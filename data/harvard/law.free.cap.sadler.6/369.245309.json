J., holding special court, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">Mrs. Hannah P. Courtright died testate, on the 12th day of February, 1885, leaving her surviving two daughters, Mrs. Catharine Elizabeth Brewer (formerly Lowry), Hannah Alice Valentine, and two grandchildren, Wm. B. Courtright and Louisa N. Courtright, the children of a deceased son, John P. Courtright. Mrs. Courtright\u2019s estate consisted of both real and personal property. Mrs. Courtright occupied the homestead at the time of her death, and Mrs. Brewer was living with her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">On the 19th day of May, 1885, Joseph McCarter and William S. Brown, executors of Hannah P. Courtright, deceased, sold and conveyed by deed of conveyance to Clara B. Taylor, the land in dispute. Mrs. Brewer remained in possession after the death of her mother, and refused to give it up, and this suit was brought to obtain the possession. The property was the homestead of Mrs. Courtright, and was sold by the executors to Mrs. Taylor for $20,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">The property was of so great a value that none of the heirs of Mrs. Courtright could afford to take it and keep it up. Mrs. Valentine, William B. Courtright, and Louisa N. Courtright were desirous that it should be sold, and urged the executors to make the sale. The executors of Mrs. Courtright, under the authority given them by the will of said decedent, made the sale. Milton Courtright, the husband of Hannah P. Courtright, died in April, 1883. Mrs. Courtright, by her will, dated October 16, 1875, directed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-9\">\u201cI give, devise and bequeath all my real and personal estate whatsoever, and wheresoever situated, unto my executors, hereinafter named, and their successors, to and for their own proper use and behoof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-10\">\u201cIn trust, nevertheless, for the following uses, intents and purposes, <em>viz., </em>in trust:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u201c1.

Brown, and the survivor of them, full power and authority to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of, any or all of my estate herein, and in last will and codicil, devised in trust to my executors, from time to time, in their discretion, and to\u2019 make, execute, and deliver and complete conveyances and assurances, in the law, to the purchaser or purchasers thereof \u2014 the proceeds of any such sales to be reinvested, as in their discretion they shall deem most advantageous for my estate, the proceeds of which sales, etc., and the income arising therefrom, to be held by them in the same manner, in the same trusts, and for the same purposes as the original estate, and to be disposed of by them in the same manner, to the same persons, and in the same proportions, as is provided in my last will and codicil.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The plaintiffs presented this point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">1.Upon the whole evidence, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">The defendants presented the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">1. That the only authority to sell the real estate in question, in the original will, is given in the eighth paragraph thereof, which power is vested in M. Court-right, and not in the executors; and such power not having been exercised by direction to the executors, the deed of conveyance of the land in question from the executors to the plaintiff was without authority and void; and, therefore, the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">2. That, by the terms of the will, as expressed in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs thereof, in connection with the terms of the last codicil, the estate of the testatrix vested in the heirs or devisees, and not in the executors, and that, by reason of such terms, the trust attempted to be expressed in said will in the executors failed, and, therefore, the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">3. That the power and authority vested in the husband of the testatrix, and her children, to dispose of the property mentioned in said will and codicils by writing, in the nature of a last will and testament, and, in case of the death of any of them, without having disposed of such property by will, to be disposed of according to the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, vested the land in dispute in such persons absolutely; and, therefore, no authority existed in the executors to dispose of the land in question, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">4. That the authority given to the executors, Joseph McCarter and William S. Brown, in the last codicil, refers only to the personalty, and not to the real estate. But, even in case the court should be of the opinion that the authority expressed there covers the real estate as well as personalty, the concluding portion of the said codicil, in terms, keeps up the same terms and purposes as expressed in the original will, which will vested the title in the heirs and devisees, and not in the executors; and, therefore, the plaintiffs cannot recover, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">5. That the terms of the last codicil do not in any manner change the terms expressed in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs of the original will; but, on the contrary, the concluding portions of said codicil carefully preserve all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>conditions and terms therein expressed, which terms and conditions vested the title to the property in question in the pr-rsons named as beneficiaries in said will; and, therefore, the sale by the executors to the plaintiff was null and void, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">The court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">We have concluded to dispose of this case by directing a verdict upon the undisputed evidence, in favor of the plaintiffs, which we will only do in order to raise a question of law involved in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">The point presented by the plaintiffs is affirmed. The several points presented by the defendants are answered in the negative. The result of this is that we take a verdict from you in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">Upon the undisputed evidence, the court directs a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the court upon the question reserved \u2014 whether, under the will of Mrs. Hannah P. Courtright and the several codicils thereto, the executors named in the last mentioned codicil had legal authority to convey the land in controversy to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">Afterward, upon entering judgment for the plaintiffs, the court filed the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">Taking the will and its codicils into consideration, the only question we have to answer is: What were the intentions of Mrs. Courtright, as evinced by the words used? Prom the whole instrument, I think it very clear that she intended that the executors should have full power and authority to sell any or all of her real estate. So clearly does this intention appear that there seems no room for construction, the office of which is to deal with ambiguities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-11\">By the eighth clause of the will, the executors were authorized to sell the real estate as her husband should direct. The husband having died, the power ceased, or at least she might well believe that it did. After the death of her husband, by the second codicil, Mrs. Courtright gives to the executors named, and the successors of them, full power and authority to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of, any or all of her estate, and to make, execute, and deliver conveyances and assurances to the purchasers. The language is unequivocal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-12\">We have not been able to find anything in the will that, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the death of Mrs. Courtright, vested a title to the real estate in suit in Mrs. Brewer, or that can be construed into a right in the defendants to retain the possession as ag\u2019ainst the plaintiffs, claiming under the deed of the executors; and it is accordingly ordered that, upon payment of jury fee, judgment be entered upon the verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, and against the defendants, for the land described in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-4\">The assignments of error specified the answers to the points presented.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-5\"><em>S.

The power vested in Catharine E. Brewer, to dispose of the property in question by will, constitutes her the owner of her share in fee. The fourth paragraph of the will, which provides that \u201cIn case of the death of the devisees, without disposing of such property by will, the same shall be conveyed unto such person or persons as by the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania would have been entitled to the same, if the deceased child or grandchild had been lawfully seised of, in the lawful possession of, or the unrestricted owner of, the same,\u201d gives her the fee under the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case [1 Coke, 88].
