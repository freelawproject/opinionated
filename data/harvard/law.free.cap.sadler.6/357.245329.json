The real estate, consisting of about one-fourth acre with two-story house thereon, was sold by said James E. Miller, administrator c. <em>t. a., </em>on an order of said court, as appears by the order of and his return to said court, made January 18, 1886, to one Ellen Kearns for the price or sum of $200, which sum is inadequate and far below the value of the property, which was appraised at $315, as she is informed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">2. The exceptant, the widow of the decedent, claims that she was never cited to elect to take or refuse to take under the will of the decedent; that she is ignorant of her duties and of her rights, and she claims the exemption allowed her as the widow' under the acts of assembly in such case made and provided; that she is very aged and poor, and she demands an appraisement under the exemption law of 1851 and its several supplements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">In the depositions taken upon the exceptions the exceptant testified, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">\u201cI can\u2019t say how old I am; I might be sixty or so; my husband, Murtey Lawley, is dead; I claim the benefit of the exemption or $300 law out of his estate; he left nothing but a little house and a little lot of land; I did not claim it before you (Mr. Corson) filed my petition, or rather exceptions to the sale, in court, because I did not know any better, and I thought the law would give it to me without my making any claim for it; I can neither read nor write; I was never told before the sale of the lot that I had to make a claim to get my rights; my brother told me I had to claim the $300 law to get my claim, and then I was advised to employ you (Mr. Corson) as my lawyer.\u201d . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\"><em>Q. </em>Mrs. Lawley, before Mr. Miller administered, did not I (Mr. Tracy) tell you you could claim the exemption, and you could get tiie property so that the children would have nothing to do with it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\"><em>A. </em>I said I would not have anything to do with it, the property should be sold; nothing was said about the $300 law, before God; nothing till my brother told me to do it after the sale, or I would have attended to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Mr. Tracy testified, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-4\">\u201cBefore letters of administration were granted, I saw Mrs. Lawley and told her the estate would have to be settled up; I told her she could claim the exemption, and that the property could be fixed so the children would have no claim on it; she says, T will have nothing to do with it; it will have to be sold.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\">Upon dismissing the exceptions and confirming the sale, Boyer, P. J., delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">These exceptions are on the part of the widow of decedent, who claims that the property ought not to have been sold, but appraised to her at least to the extent of $300 under the act o\u00ed assembly entitling a widow to have appraised and set apart to her $300 worth of the estate of her deceased husband. But unfortunately she never made such claim until after the administrator had obtained an order from the orphans\u2019 court to sell the property for the payment of debts, and actually advertised and sold the same at public sale. Under all the authorities upon the subject she is now too late. It would even do her no good to have the present sale set aside, for the expenses of the proceedings have been already incurred; and she is no longer in a situation to claim her exemption. I cannot help thinking, however, that the administrator ought to have been at greater pains to explain to her her rights as widow, although there is no express provision of law commanding him so to do. The decisions excluding her from her right to have the property appraised for her benefit at this time are, however, too unqualified and uniform to be disregarded. And now, April 2, 1886, the exceptions are dismissed and the sale confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-7\">The assignment of error specified the action of the court in dismissing the exceptions filed by the appellant and in refusing to allow her claim to the exemption provided by law for her as widow of decedent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-8\"><em>George N.
