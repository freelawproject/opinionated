The title of the act declares that it is \u201cAn Act Relative to the Establishment of a Law Library in the County of Carbon.\u201d It is not an act to incorporate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-6\">The first section provides that the fines, etc., are to be paid to a certain committee \u201cfor the establishment and maintenance of a law library, to be kept in the court house of said county, for the use of the court and bar thereof.\u201d Could a corporation be kept in the court house ? Clearly, the library spoken of in the first- section is a mere collection of books for the use of the court and members of the bar. But it is argued that by the terms of the act perpetual succession is given to the committee. But what provision is made for this succession ? The court shall appoint, and shall fill vacancies in, said committee. In corporations of every style and. class the succession is regulated by the members or corporators themselves, and not by an outside party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">The affairs of the alleged corporation are not to be controlled by the committee, as assumed by the plaintiffs in error. The third section of the act provides for the adoption of rules and regulations by the court. The power of governing its own affairs is one of the fundamental rights of a corporation. It is to act as one person, although composed of many. The many are to speak and act as one. In the regulation of the affairs of the alleged corporation the committee are powerless, except to expend the funds paid to them, and then only for one specified object, viz., the purchase of books. And even in this they are acting under the court, and as its agents or officers. The committee act in all matters relating to the law library, so far as they have power to act, simply as tire agents or officers of the court, and must account to the court. All this is repugnant to the idea of a corporation. It cannot be pretended that the court is the corporation; and yet a careful perusal of the act shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>that the court is the governing power to look after the affairs of the law library. It has exclusive control over the same as well as over the committee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-4\">The full control given to the court excludes any presumption that any incorporation was intended, and shows that the intent of the legislative mind was to provide for a collection of law books for the use of the court and bar of Carbon county, and for the preservation and care of these books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-5\">It is not necessary that there should be a corporation or body politic in order to accomplish the purposes and objects of the act; and therefore none can be said to have been created by implication or inference. All the objects of the act can. be attained without the creation of a corporation. The object was the collection and preservation of a lot of law books; and provision is made for the accomplishment of this end. All necessary restrictions and safeguards are thrown around the property when collected; and it does not follow, as in many of the cases cited, that a corporation is to be implied from the necessity of the case. Therefore the cases cited by the counsel for plaintiffs in error have no application to this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-6\">The Carbon County Law Library has no such legal existence under the act as to enable it to take under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-7\">In Magill v.

Methodist Church v. Bemington, 1 Watts, 219, 26 Am. Dec. 61; and Witman v. Lex, 17 Serg. &amp; B. 90, 17 Am. Dec. 644, are to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-8\">This bequest can only be sustained, if at all, upon the ground that it is a charitable bequest, and then it is at once met by \u00a7 11 of the act of April 26, 1856\u2019 (P. L. 332), which declares a bequest to a charity void if the testator died within one calendar month after making his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-9\">No particular form of benevolence is necessary to constitute a charity. General Albright certainly gave his library to the Carbon County Law Library from motives of charity, intending thereby to.benefit the members of the bar of Carbon county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-10\">In Pickering v.

Funds supplied by the gift of the Crown, or from the legislature, or from private gift, for legal, general, or public purposes, arc charitable funds, to be administered by a court of equity. Therefore, where money is given by will, gift, or voluntary contribution of individuals, to a voluntary, unincorporated hose company or fire association formed for general and public usefulness, without individual emolument or advantage, it is a charity over which a court of equity will exercise control.

The Carbon County Law Library has no corporate existence; it is not even an unincorporated society; it has no membership, no constitution or contract of association, in fact, no organization. The library of books is, of course, a thing inanimate, belonging perhaps to the county, and, as the learned judge of the court below suggests, h\u00e1s no more capacity to receive a legacy or a bequest than the court house itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">It is unnecessary, .however, for us to decide whether or not the objects and purposes of the law library, as contemplated in the act of April 9, 1868, constitute a charity, for if the testator\u2019s provision be a bequest to a charitable use, it is defeated by the act of April 26, 1855 (P. L. 332), and if not, it is void for want of a proper person to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
