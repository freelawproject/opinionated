J., it appeared that the railroad ran about north and south, and that the highway crossed the same at a right angle; the train in question was bound south, and Huff, the deceased, and Walker were approaching the crossing from the west; the view of the railroad from the highway towards the north in the direction of the approaching train was greatly obstructed on the west side by an orchard and a coal shed, the latter standing in the angle formed by the highway and the railroad. The coal house is 17% feet from the west rail of the south bound track, on which the train in question was running. It appeared that the view of the track, after passing the coal house on the road, was unobstructed for a distance of a mile or so; but the view before reaching that spot was somewhat limited, and at the time of the accident a strong south wind was blowing. It appeared from the testimony of Walker, who was plaintiffs\u2019 principal witness, that they stopped before reaching the crossing and looked both ways, but did not see the approaching train or hear any noise ef the same until the moment they were struck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">Other evidence was given that the parties stopped and looked before approaching the crossing, but the evidence was quite conflicting as to the spot where they stopped; the principal part of this evidence was fairly reviewed by the judge in his charge to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The defendant, <em>inter </em>alia, presented the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">1. That under all the evidence in the case the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\"><em>Ans. </em>We refuse to charge as requested in this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">2. That unless the jury find from the evidence that Huff or Walker stopped their team after passing the coal house, and looked in the direction in which the train was coming, it was negligence <em>per </em>se, and the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>Ans. </em>This point is affirmed, if you find that Mr. Iiuff did not stop, look, and listen west of the coal house. Even if he did, I submit to you to say whether it was a proper place for him to stop, look, and listen, with the wind blowing from the south, and the view to the north obstructed by the orchard; if it was not, it was negligence to drive on the track without stopping and looking east of the coal house; and the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-4\">4. That, unless the jury find from the evidence that Walker looked up the track after passing the coal house and before the accident, the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\"><em>Ans. </em>The point is refused. The undisputed evidence is he did not look up the track at this point. If they had not stopped, looked, and listened west of the coal house, it was negligence to drive on the track, as sworn to by Walker, and the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs for $5,750.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">After hearing of motion for a new trial the court ordered plaintiffs \u201cto remit from the verdict all in excess of $2,500 and file no bill of costs; rule for a new trial to be discharged; otherwise, to be made absolute and a new trial granted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">The plaintiffs remitted all in excess of $2,500, and judgment was entered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">The assignments of error specified the action of the court in refusing the motion for a compulsory nonsuit and the answers to defendant\u2019s points given above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-10\"><em>Davies &amp; Hall </em>and <em>Henry Streeter, </em>for plaintiff in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJv\">It is uncontradicted that there is a practically level piece of ground, 17% feet wide, between the coal house and the west rail, on the approach to the track from the crossroad upon which Mr. Huff and Walker were traveling. It was their plain duty to have stopped at that place; and the learned court should have said so in plain, unmistakable language. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Beale, 73 Pa. 509, 13 Am.

Bank, 114-Pa. 1, 6 Atl. 366.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-3\">The judge at the trial charged that \u201cthe rule is imperative that his duty was to stop, look, and listen before driving on the track. If he approached the track without having stopped and looked and listened, he cannot recover, because it was negligence <em>fer se.\u201d </em>Again: \u201cThe evidence of the other witnesses bearing upon this question you will call into consideration in determining this question whether they did stop; because if they did not stop west of the coal house, then it was their duty to have stopped down by the track; and if their view was obstructed there and they could not see, it was their duty to get out and see if there was a train coming. It has been said in one case that when the view is obstructed so they cannot see, it is the duty of the person or traveler to get out and take his horse by its head and look.\u201d' Lehigh Valley R.

Henry Huff was killed while attempting to ride over the railroad at a public crossing. The unquestioned evidence is that when he approached the railroad he stopped, looked, and listened. The contention was whether the place where he stopped was a suitable one to see and hear, and whether dne effort was made to ascertain if a train was approaching. The evidence as to this was well submitted by the court and justified the finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">We see no error in the charge nor in the answers to the points.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
