Harnee, deceased, before Pi-tone, P. J., are stated in the opinion in Sinclair\u2019s Appeal, 116'Pa. 316, 9 Atl. 637.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-13\">The appellant, the residuary legatee, assigned as error the .action of the court below in allowing any interest' whatever on the legacies or gifts to the creditors whose claims had been compromised.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-14\"><em>Edmund G. Butler, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVX\">\u2014 What these creditors get under this will is a gift, a bequest, a legacy, and the court below has so found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-15\">Primarily interest was in the nature of damages imposed for the nonfulfilment of a contract; now interest is either reserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>by contract or is the penalty for nonperformance of a contract, or for the nonpayment of a debt at the day it becomes dne.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-4\">A plaintiff may remit a part or the whole of the interest due on his claim, so as to bring the case within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace; but he may not so remit a part of the principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">Interest is but an incident of the debt</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">Interest is not ordinarily allowed on legacies until after the lapse of one year. The executors did not delay filing their account; on the contrary, they presented their inventory and account at the earliest possible moment, and the audit was held and the final decree entered within a year from the death of decedent and the granting of letters testamentary. They advanced the final distribution as rapidly as possible under the rules of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">There being no contract between the testator and these claimants, interest is in no way recoverable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-8\">At the time the settlements were made between the testator and his creditors, interest was not calculated; but the settlements' were all made without interest and upon the sole basis of the principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-9\">It is dear that a trust to pay or charge off debts does not make simple contracts carry interest or revive a debt which has been barred by the statute of limitations; though the contrary to both of these propositions has been heretofore maintained. \u2022 In Tait v. Northwick, 4 Ves. Jr. 816, Lord Loughborough held that a direction to pay such debts as the testator, at the time of his death, by mortgage, bond, or other specialty, or by simple contract or otherwise, owed, and all interest thereof, was confined, in respect to the interest, to debts which carried interest. 3 Jar-man, Wills, 445, 446, ed. 1881.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-10\"><em>F.
