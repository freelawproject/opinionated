L. 125) ; and the only writ by which a review can be had is a writ of certiorari. Though all writs are called appeals by virtue of the act of 1889, yet the distinguishing characteristics of the different writs that prevailed before the passage of that act still remain. <em>Re </em>Bastin, 10 Pa.

Caldwell for the adoption of Hattie M., a minor child of Emma T. Gallagher, was filed March 11, 1878. The same day the prayer of the petition was granted, and the court ordered and directed said child to take the name of and he called Hattie M. Caldwell, and have all the rights of a child and heir of the petitioner, Eliza M. Caldwell, and he subject to the duties of a child to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-12\">December 12, 1884, Mrs. Caldwell died, leaving to survive her, her adopted daughter and a brother, William H. Lewis, and several nieces, daughters of a deceased brother. January 10, 1885, the petition of William H. Lewis and others next of kin of Mrs. Caldwell was filed for citation to show cause why the decree of adoption of Ha.ttie M. Gallagher by Eliza M. Caldwell should not he revoked and set aside. After citation and an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>swers filed the case was referred to William Iienry Sutton, Esq., \u2022as examiner, to take testimony as to whether or not the signature to petition for adoption was the signature of Eliza M. Caldwell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-3\">June 11, 1885, an issue upon the question of validity of signature (only) was refused. June 20, 1885, the case was again referred to William Henry Sutton, Esq., as examiner, to take testimony as to the mental capacity of Eliza M. Caldwell at the time of adoption of Hattie M. Caldwell, in 1878, and to report to the court. The examiner reported and the court decreed, December 18, 1885, that the prayer of the petition and application for issue be refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">It further appeared that Mrs. Caldwell made a will March '22, 1878, wherein she made Hattie M. Caldwell, her adopted \u2022daughter, her residuary legatee, ignoring her brother and nieces. The latter filed a caveat, but learning of the adoption proceedings whereby Hattie M. Caldwell would take the estate, under \u25a0the intestate laws, if the will were set aside, they instituted these proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The assignments of error specified the action of the court: (1) In entering the decree; (2) in making the decree, which is \u25a0equivalent to dismissing the petition of the said petitioners; (3) in making the decree, because the same is against the evidence \u2022and testimony produced; (4) because against the weight of the evidence and testimony produced; (5) because contrary to law, equity, and justice; (6) in not granting the prayer of the petition; (7) in not making a decree setting aside the said decree of adoption of Hattie M. Caldwell by Eliza M. Caldwell because the uncontradicted testimony shows that the same was procured through the misrepresentation and undue influence of Emma T. Gallagher, the confidential nurse, servant, and housekeeper of the said Eliza M. Caldwell, and the mother of the alleged adopted child, at a time when the said Eliza M. Caldwell had not sufficient mental capacity to fully understand the import and effect \u25a0of the said adoption; (8) in not making a decree setting aside the said adoption because the violent presumption, as gathered from the evidence of constructive fraud on the part of Emma T. \u2018Gallagher, the mother of the alleged adopted child, and others, is that the intent of the alleged adoption was to prevent your petitioners, as the next of kin, from contesting the will of said Eliza M. Caldwell.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Jerome Carty, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABm\">\u2014 \u201cAdoption,\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word, is the act by which a person taires a child of another into his family and treats him as his own. Legal adoption is the judicial act creating between two persons certain relations, purely civil, of paternity and filiation. 6 Demolombe, \u00a7 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-3\">The right of any adopted child to inherit depends entirely upon the validity of the decree or proceedings by which he may be adopted. Giving an adopted son a right to inherit does not make him a son in fact; and he is so regarded in law only to give the right to inherit, and not to change the collateral inheritance tax law. As against that law he has no higher merit than collateral blood relations of the deceased, and is not at all to be regarded as a son in fact. Com. v. Nancrede, 32 Pa. 390.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-4\">In the case of Booth v. Yan Allen, I Phila. 401, it is decided that the decree of adoption under the act of May 4, 1855, will be revoked when it appears to the court that it was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-5\"><em>William J.

That act empowers courts, on petition, to make a decree, but it does not in any wise authorize any person to institute any appellate proceedings of any kind from that decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-6\">There is no right at common law to adopt a child. Ballard v. War'd, 89 Pa. 358.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">In proceedings in the course of the common law, a writ of error lies; but in statutory proceedings, where no appeal is given to the supreme court, the most that can be done is by certiorari to bring up the record for review so far as to ascertain that the \u2022court had jurisdiction, and that the proceedings were regular. Barnes\u2019s Appeal, 2 Pennyp. 506, 511.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\">The question of opening a judgment rests in the discretion \u2022of the court by Avhich it was rendered. No appeal from its action lies to the supreme court, nor could it be reviewed on writ \u2022of error, unless the opening in the particular case was in excess of the power of the court. Gatlin v. Bobinson, 2 Watts, 313.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-9\">A refusal to open is merely a refusal to disturb the judgment, and is not the exercise of an illegal power. Henry v. Brothers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>48 Pa. 70; McClelland v. Pomeroy, 75 Pa. 410; Lamb\u2019s Appeal,, 89 Pa. 407.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-4\">The court itself could not have made a decree in any other form than the one prayed for in the words of the statute. <em>lie </em>Irwin, 7 W. N.

As the act- of assembly does not authorize an appeal, we cannot review the evidence. We can review the record only. In this case that is altogether regular; and no error appears therein. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
