Webster </em>Dougherty, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE\">\u2014 The ground of the decision was that commission out of corpus is only allowed, if at all, upon the exhibition of some extraordinary service or upon the final settlement of the estate. But where the income is either insufficient or where the services are to those in remainder as well as those interested for life, commissions will be payable out of the corpus. McElhenny\u2019s Appeal, 46 Pa. 34V; Twaddell\u2019s Appeal, 1 W. N. C. 22V; Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 340, 24 Am. Pep. 183.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">By the act of June 16, 1836, this court is required in appeals-from the orphans\u2019 court to determine not the error but the merits of the case. Einney\u2019s Appeal, 3V Pa. 323.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">It has been found by the auditing judge that the appellant, as trustee, rendered certain services to the estate; and it has been determined that the value of its service for which it has not been compensated is $600. The court may believe the court below right in the distinction asserted between commissions payable out of income and those out of the corpus, but that does not touch or determine the merit of the appellant\u2019s claim. The decisions of the court have uniformly recognized the right of a trustee to compensation for services rendered to the trust estate. Montgomery\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 234; Myers\u2019s Appeal, 62 Pa. 104; Duval\u2019s Appeal, 38 Pa. 119; Heckert\u2019s Appeal, 24 Pa. 486; Perkins\u2019s Appeal, 108 Pa. 31V, 56 Am.

Pep. 183.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">The appellant was a faithful, efficient, and capable trustee, and was removed merely because of a technical irregularity in its appointment, at the instance of a <em>cestui que trust. </em>Such being the case it should receive foil compensation for its services..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-8\"><em>John A. Bcanlan, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9f\">\u2014 A commission on income is the suitable and proper mode of compensating trustees, and a commission or compensation upon the principal of an estate is never allowed except upon distribution of th\u00e9 corpus among the remainder-men at the determination of the trust itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-9\">An allowance of a reasonable commission on net income from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>real and personal property, income received and accounted for, appears to be a suitable and proper mode of compensating trustees for the execution of their trusts. Whether any allowance shall be made in addition to a reasonable commission for extra services at the determination of the trust and settlement of the account must depend on the circumstances of each case as they may exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-3\">Commissions are not allowed on reinvestment of capital. Dixon v. Homer, 2 Met. 4.22.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-4\">Compensation must come out of income. Butterbaugh\u2019s Appeal, 39 Phila. Leg. Int. 180; Hemphill\u2019s Appeal, 18 Pa. 303; Spangler\u2019s Estate, 21 Pa. 335.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">The exceptions are where such commission on income is wholly inadequate to compensate for the care, trouble, and management of the trust. Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 340, 24 Am. Rep. 183.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">In Pedrick\u2019s Estate, 5 Phila. 478, but $90 additional was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">In Barclay\u2019s Appeal, 42 Phila. Leg. Int. 48, a trustee was allowed $800 for four years\u2019 advice and diligent services and attending, <em>inter </em>alia, to sales of land, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">In Twaddell\u2019s Appeal, 81* Pa. 221, the testator died in 1844. In 1872 the remainder-men petitioned for an order directing executor to convey to them. He had charge of the land for twenty-eight years. He had a power of sale and could have sold it for $100,000, but did not and its value increased to $300,-000. He was allowed $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-9\">If so much was requisite to be done by the trustees in the cases cited, and so great a responsibility taken to insure those comparatively small allowances, the late trustee in this case has no right to a departure from the uniform rule that allows commissions on the income alone. Montgomery\u2019s Appeal, 35 Phila. Leg. Int. 242; Beck\u2019s Estate, 35 Phila. Leg. Int. 154.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-10\">The law is the same whether the estate be personal or real estate. Nieklin\u2019s Estate, 33 Phila. Leg. Int. 1876, p. 140.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-11\">In Wright v. Wright, 2 McCord Eq. 192, it is held that the time when a trastee is to be accredited with commissions or compensation on the capital of the estate is when he pays it over to the party entitled to it in remainder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-12\">Commissions are only allowed to fiduciaries upon the final settlement of their accounts (Sprott v. Baldwin, 34 Miss. 329; Eifinger v. Richards, 35 Miss. 541); and a decree for distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tion is such final settlement of the accounts as entitles an executor to receive his compensation. Crowder v. Shackelford, 35 Miss. 322.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\">A removed executor is not allowed compensation on the corpus. Montgomery\u2019s Appeal, 35 Phila. Leg. Int. 242.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">And even where an executor in trust, who had no legacy, in a case in which the execution of the office was likely to be attended with trouble, at first declined, but afterwards agreed with the residuary legatee, in consideration of 100 guineas, to act in the executorship, and on his dying before the execution of the trust was completed, his executors filed a bill to be allowed that sum out of the trust money in their hands, the court refused the claim, observing that, independently of the executor having died before the trust was executed, such bargain ought to be discouraged, as tending to dissipate the property. 3 Wms. Exrs. 6th Am. ed. 1965.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">So in order to save an estate from double commissions by reason of frequent changes of trustees, it was held in <em>Re </em>Jones, <em>4 </em>Sandf. Ch. 616, upon English authority, that a trustee\u2019s petition for his discharge upon no other cause assigned than his wish to. be relieved from his duties would only be granted by his paying the costs of the petition and appointment of his successor and by being allowed no commission upon the capital of the estate; and see Foley v. Egan, 13 Abb. Pr. N. S. 361, <em>notej </em>and 2 Lead. Cas. in Eq. (White &amp; T.) 544.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-7\">Per Curiam: :</author>\n<p id=\"A9c4\">The reasons stated and authorities cited in the opinion of the court, in disposing of the exceptions to the finding of the auditing judge, fully sustain this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
