Rush Jackson and James Thomson as surviving executors of Josiah Jackson, is admitted, \u2014 the rest denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">The answer to paragraph 13 is an averment of ownership in the land, when the plaintiffs\u2019 bill was filed, and a denial that the plaintiffs had any interest therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">James H. Godding, Esq., was appointed master, who reported, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">Our starting point is found in the conveyance produced in evidence, executed November 8, 1859, by Michael Meylert and wife, to George I). Jackson, for an undivided % interest in 523 acres and 110 perches of land, being parts of six warrants in Sullivan county. It is the west end of this land which is now in question. July 4, 1861, is the date of the next paper, to which so much importance is attached. It is a declaration by George D. Jackson, that \u201cwhereas, the said George D. Jackson and Josiah Jackson and B. Rush Jackson ... at their joint and equal expense have purchased\u201d the interest in the land, to wit, the 523 acres, etc., \u201cand at the special instance and request of them, the said Josiah Jackson and B. Rush Jackson, he, George I). Jackson, obtained a conveyance from Michael Meylert, in his own name solely, for the whole of the land so purchased\u201d \u2014 now he the declarant \u201cdoth testify, declare, and acknowledge, that he stands seised, and doth covenant that he and his heirs shall and will at all times hereafter stand seised, of one full, equal, and undivided third part of the undivided half part of the land,\u201d to the use of Josiah Jackson, his heirs, and assigns, and one like third to the use of B. Rush Jackson, his heirs, and assigns; and that upon any sale or division of the property, he will grant, convey, or assure to the purchaser or to his <em>cestui que </em>trust, their proper share of the land or interest in the proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">This declaration is here claimed as the comer stone of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 case. Was it ever repealed, canceled, or annulled by the parties, either by their concurrence or any implication from their actions? This is important, for there is no written evidence showing any change of title to the half of the land in controversy here, since the delivery of the above deed, affecting it in 1859, and the execution of this declaration July 4, 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-4\">We may here, from all the evidence, generally review the status of the parties allied in this purchase, as disclosed by the declaration. Josiah Jackson was a well-known and respected citizen, \u2014 a physieian, long resident in Sullivan county. The others were his sons, associated with him in mercantile pursuits, at Dushore, under the style of Jackson &amp; Sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">[This firm was from time to time interested in acquiring land, and the method used in the transaction just mentioned was no novelty to them; for in two instances, at least, in the evidence in this case, a similar course was held- \u2014 in one, the title being taken by the father, in the other by B. Bush Jaekson, and both were followed by declarations showing the common interest of all.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">Other deeds in evidence prove the peculiar changes of title which occurred in the fall of 1866, and are set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill. The key to these movements is found in the fact that a railroad and coal company was being organized for operation near or upon these very lands, and that the Jacksons were associating with others in taking a leading part</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">[One thing, however, for a time, complicated the arrangement, and it is clearly in the evidence. George, with a sagacity which was prophetic, declined to embark all their coal interests in the new corporation, for coal was known to be upon this land, and insisting upon his views, so arranged with other corporators, who at first objected, that he was able to reach the end sought.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-8\">By Meylert\u2019s deed, he then had legal title to % the 523 acres, 110 perches \u2014 by deed from Jordan, Woolf, Bibighaus, he acquired three undivided seventeenths parts of the same land. The balance of the title was in Mercur and Welles, and from them he obtained 5% sevente\u00e9nths of the 102 acres, 70 perches, which he sought to obtain; he then conveyed to the new corporation, 11% seventeenths of 421 acres, 40 perches (all his title therein), and so stood as the holder of the legal title to the now divided and separated 102 acres, 70 perches, which it was his object to procure. Was this transaction for himself or for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>firm? Did any other eotemporary transactions with the coal company have any influence upon this ? Who, then, owned the land ? The answer is the solution to this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-3\">If Dr. Josiah Jackson thought the matter needed any explanation, it was not long, for he died April 9, 1867; and the substance of his will, as creating parties to this suit, is admitted by the pleadings. The firm name of Jackson &amp; Sons became Jackson Brothers, and business went on as before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\">[The plaintiffs have produced in support of their claim, outside the deeds and declaration, three independent lines of evidence, which are intended, of course, to be mutually corroborative, pointing toward a common central fact: First, the admissions and assertions of George D. Jackson himself as to the real ownership of the 102-acre tract, commonly known as near the \u201cMillheim\u201d oj)ening; second, the books of Jackson &amp; Sons and Jackson Brothers showing entries largely in the handwriting of George D. Jackson, and all under his supervision, respecting the mining and sale of coal from this tract, and treating these transactions as at the expense and for the benefit of the firm; third, a sort of mathematical demonstration, which influences the ease, by showing an equality of the parties named, in their connection with the Sullivan &amp; Erie Coal &amp; Bailroad Company, its organizers, and in the stock issued for their lands; in other words, that George D. J ackson gave no more for his interest in the disputed land than did his partners, or that the partners received nothing for an asserted concession of interest, which George retained.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">[In the first instance, sixteen witnesses have testified to statements, in conversation and otherwise, with George D. Jackson, indicating, not an individual ownership in this land, but a common one in the members of the firm of J ackson &amp; Sons. In each case this land has been identified as the subject of the association; and all, with one exception, were made subsequent to the several transfers of 1866. These statements came mostly in shape of information from the speaker to his hearers, and differed among themselves greatly, in manner and form, \u2014 from mere reference to the land as \u201cours,\u201d to an unqualified assertion that it belonged to J ackson &amp; Sons.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">The names of the witnesses are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">Theo. Ackley, Jasper Clark, Levi Hunsinger, J. K. Farrell, J. M. Ileacock, J. B. Cox, P. Armstrong, J. W. Martin, H. Wib <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>liams, Charles Kissner, Christian Millheim, H. P. Moore, Horace Arnont, B. M. Sylvara, William Stevenson, J. S. Andrews.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\">[The admissions and statements recited by these parties are not altogether casual, but come in such circumstances that it was reasonable to expect the truth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The testimony of the following persons, considered in this last connection, may be important: of J. K. Farrell, who was assessor in Cherry township as late as 1869; of Dr. J. M. Heacoek, who was county treasurer in 1872. The conversations related by them are almost official. Also of H. P. Moore and William Stevenson who enjoyed unusual and friendly acquaintance with George D. Jackson in his lifetime. If their evidence amounts to anything, it is that he made unequivocal statements that the coal lands, the land in question, belonged to Jackson &amp; Sons.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">No less definite, in respect to individual ownership, is the \u25a0deposition of J. S. Andrews, but to him Jackson Brothers were named as the owners. It was after the doctor\u2019s death. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">Upon the subject opened by the second branch of the evidence, several witnesses are called to prove that the possession of the land was in Jackson &amp; Sons up to the doctor\u2019s death and subsequently in Jackson Brothers: Millheim, who worked eleven years at the coal opening bearing his name, Jasper Clark, who gave orders for the coal, Charles Kissner, who was a carpenter doing work at the mine. These testified of the father and two brothers as possessing and operating the land and mine, and directing the work done there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-9\">Copious extracts are given from the books of Jackson &amp; Sons and Jackson Brothers, cash books, coal books, day books, chiefly in the handwriting of George D. Jackson, and showing that he \u25a0charged himself with coal from the mine; that all matters connected with the coal business were conducted by the two firms .successively, and that they paid its expenses, taxes, etc., and put the receipts from it in the common till.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-10\">The defendants do not deny this, but say that this possession and use were by permission of George D. Jackson and under him. Of this, hereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-11\">[Upon the third branch of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, that which \u2022endeavored to show the even relations of the parties in the conveyances to the Sullivan &amp; Erie Coal &amp; Railroad Company, and its issue of stock in return, no infallible conclusion can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>reached. The figures admit of several combinations, and none of them are just right.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\">It would seem that death has precluded full explanation. It is clear, however, that the three Jacksons conveyed to the company a large amount of land (more than 2,000 acres), and of this perhaps all was subject to trusts, among themselves or for others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">[George conveyed 645 acres, 46 perches, in Cherry and Colley townships, which he had by some arrangement for or with Michael Meylert. Also eleven and one half seventeenths of 421 acres, etc., in warrant names of Norris and others. With the latter tract we are familiar. It is land conveyed by Meylert, November 8, 1859, and for which, with the 102 acres, etc., now in controversy, the declaration of the trust of July 4, 1861, was executed. These eleven and one half seventeenths are the original one half (8% I7ths) conveyed by Meylert, and three seventeenths (3 I7ths) conveyed to him by Francis Woolf, Thomas J. Woolf, Samuel H. Bibighaus. And here we find that George I). Jackson paid no consideration to these parties for the three seventeenths. He was but their agent, the bridge over which their title passed to their company as to 421 acres, etc., to himself as to the 102 acres and 70 perches.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">B. Bush Jackson conveyed to the company 1,038 acres, which appear to have been affected by a trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">From Mr. Mercur\u2019s evidence as to the value given to land in forming the railroad and coal company, to wit, $200 per acre\u2014 4,274 shares of stock should have been issued to the Jacksons in return. The evidence discloses but 3,439 shares issued to them directly, and these were diminished by transfers: to M. C. Mercur, 425 shares; to Francis Jordan, 123 shares; to S. H. Bibighaus, 61 shares; and to Michael Meylert, 891 shares, until finally there remains: to George D. Jackson, 646 shares; to B. Bush Jackson, 646 shares; and to the estate of Josiah Jackson, 647 shares, practically an equality in result, too nearly so to be accidental.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">The defendants\u2019 offer, by T. J. Yanderslice, J. G. Wright, and F. F. Lyon, to procure declarations made by George D. Jackson, to the effect that the land in question was his, and his only. This is claimed to be rebuttal, but must probably weigh as other declarations made in the interest of the declarant, and not in the presence of those affected by the claim. Mr. Mercur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>gives an interesting account of what was said to him by the brothers, a short time before George\u2019s death. It is certain from this that cordiality, if not friendship, had ceased between them; that George at that time claimed the land, while Rush, consistently with his present position, asserted that it \u201cbelonged to George, Rush, and father\u2019s estate.\u201d These statements were not made, however, by the brothers in each other\u2019s presence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">The foregoing may show this much: that George\u2019s declarations were not invariably to the effect of a firm or common ownership; but if he considered the land his own, and his title beyond doubt, it is not easy to understand the anxiety he expressed to Vanderslice, and his wish to see Judge Elwell or Mr. Buckalew on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">[Six receipts from the county treasurer, for taxes, were produced in evidence, the intent being to show that George D. Jackson supported a burden of ownership, not likely to be usurped by a disinterested party, and himself paid the taxes upon this property, as his own. Granting these their weight, they are silently disputed. The first one, dated June 6, 1868, for $12.75, for taxes upon the George Eox and Joseph P. Norris warrants, is undoubtedly the same item as the entry in coal book, page 54, \u201cexpenses,\u201d Jackson Brothers, for date, amount, and purpose coincide. The second and third receipts are for same tracts, <em>inter alia; </em>and here again entries are found, on the coal expense book of the firm, pages 93, 94, showing payments for taxes on the same dates, the amounts being about one fourth less, as taxes upon other warrants were paid for at the same time.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">The fifth receipt is indorsed on its back \u201cPaid by G. D. J.\u201d in George D. Jackson\u2019s handwriting. Why this, if paid by him upon his own land ? . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">[It is admitted, we believe, that all presumptions adverse to the declaration of trust must arise from the transactions of 1866, and in the failure of these it is entitled to its original vitality, so far as it affects the land in question. Upon the evidence, and from the views herein expressed, the master finds that there are no such adverse presumptions; in fact, that there is no evidence of its cancelation or rescission. It is therefore still in force as to one half the land.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">As to the other moiety, we recapitulate: George D. Jackson did not complete his legal title by any arrangement with the Sullivan \u00abfe Erie Company. This tract never was included in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>proposed or established boundaries of that corporation. Three seventeenths came from Jordan, Woolf, Bibighaus, who conveyed that interest in the entire 523 acres, etc., considered their share equal to 92 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\">[These were evidently considered as part of the 421 acres which went to the company, for the company-paid them for just that amount. This course would depress the share of the Jack-sons in the 421 acres just the 3/17 of the 102 acres and no more. The real bargain which closed the gap in the title was with Mercur and Welles.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">Mr. Mercur tells of the accepted proposition, emanating from himself and Welles: \u201cWe will give you enough of our land outside the (S. &amp; E.) line to make the 100 acres, receiving payment by stock from the company of an equal quantity of land you deed to them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">[Now, who paid the consideration ? We quote Mr. Mercur again: \u201cThe stock was issued to Welles and myself for that quantity of land in excess of our deed to the company, and the stock to the Jacksons was that much less. ... I mention .the Jacksons, meaning the doctor, George, and Bush.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">[In deference to tire defendants\u2019 position on this subject the master has studied this part of the case with special care, and the foregoing foreshadows his conclusion. He is unable to find that George D. Jackson conveyed to the Sullivan &amp; Erie Company, in individual right, any such excess of land, above that of his partners, as to extinguish their rights in the original trust, or acquire for himself the remainder of the title; nor is there a spark of evidence showing that any such arrangement was contemplated among them, and we think he was precluded from so doing without such understanding, by the fiduciary relation he then sustained. We believe further that the three Jacksons stood on terms of substantial and real equality as to this land from their first title in 1859 to and through all the transactions of 1866.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">[It is, therefore, found that the consideration which was paid at the time when George D. Jackson took the legal title to the second half of the 102 acres proceeded equally from Josiah Jackson, George D. Jackson, and B. Bush Jackson, and was paid from lands held by them, which were conveyed to the Sullivan &amp; Erie Company, Mercur, Welles, and others taking the stock therefor, pursuant to their arrangement. Upon this the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>conveyances of 1866 established a resulting trust] \u2014 Barnet v.

The trustee and <em>cestui que </em>trust, equal in interest, were not only mere possessors, but exercised and incurred notorious acts of ownership and obligation prior to Dr. Jackson\u2019s death; and since that time there has been no other possession than that of George and Bush, who were in unchanged relation to each other and were, both, executors of their deceased father\u2019s will, privies in blood and estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">Said Black, Ch.

Jackson, and on the 6th day of July, 1861, George D. Jackson executed a writing in which he declared that he held the undivided half as follows: one third for his father, one third for his brother, and the remaining third for himself. This declaration \u25a0of trust was found in the safe of Jackson Brothers after George\u2019s death, among his private papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">Three and one half seventeenths of the same tract were conveyed to George D.
