K. Powell, Esq.,\u2014 appointed under the act of April 6, 1869, and its supplements, relating to Luzerne county \u2014 are stated in his report, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-12\">The action is one of ejectment and involves a lot of land situate in the fourteenth ward of the city of Wilkesbarre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-13\">The plaintiffs made out a prima faeie case without contest, establishing the following facts, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-14\">1. John Batterton was the owner of the tract in dispute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>1872, and in that year contracted in writing to sell the same to Elizabeth Carey, the defendant, who thereupon took possession and has retained the same ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-4\">2. On June 1, 1876, Elizabeth Carey assigned the said contract to Dr. J. P. Nought, acknowledging under seal the receipt from said Nought of the full consideration money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">3. The same da.y John Batterton, the holder of the legal title,, conveyed the same by deed to said Nought, who simultaneously executed and delivered a mortgage of the premises to John Pair-child to secure $800 loaned by Fairchild to Nought, for the express purpose of paying Batterton the purchase money due him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">4. The loan thus secured not being paid, the administrators of Fairchild, who had meantime died, caused a writ of scire facias to be issued in 1881 upon said mortgage, prosecuted it to judgment, sued out a writ of levari facias thereon, by virtue of which a sheriff\u2019s sale of the land in question was made, at which they, said administrators, became the purchasers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">5. The title having thus become vested in them by a sheriff\u2019s deed duly acknowledged, the plaintiffs instituted this action to. recover possession against both Elizabeth Carey and J. P. Nought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">All those facts were practically admitted; but, Dr. Nought having formally entered a disclaimer before trial, Mrs. Carey alleged, in defense of her right to possession, that simultaneously with her assignment to Nought, and as the sole inducement to aiid sole consideration for it, John Fairchild agreed that if she would so assign her contract, thereby enabling Nought to mortgage to Fairchild, he, Fairchild, would pay her the amount of money she had paid upon and put into the property, <em>viz., </em>about. $440, and further agreed that she should retain possession of the property till he paid her the said sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-9\">To establish said defense Mrs. Carey offered Dr. J. P. Nought as a witness, and, though plaintiffs\u2019 counsel vigorously objected-the referee took, the testimony of said witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-10\">After a very careful consideration of the many authorities. cited by counsel, \u2014 especially of Arthurs v. King, 84 Pa. 525; Murray v. New York, L. &amp; W. K. Co. 103 Pa. 37; Tinstman v. Croushore, 104 Pa. 192, and Karns v.'Tanner, 66 Pa. 297,\u2014 the referee is of the opinion that he erred in admitting the testimony of said Nought; and hence does not consider it in arriving at his decision of the case. Dr. Nought is incompetent, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>because of interest and because called to impeach his own title and that of his mortgagee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\">In the language of the court in Arthurs v. King, 84 Pa. 525: \u201cBefore the passage of the act of April 15, 1869, he would have been incompetent on the ground of interest; and we cannot see that he is in any better position since.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">William McDermott, William Nandermark, and Peter Miller were also produced by the defendant and examined. Their testimony 'would be strongly corroborative of Dr. Nought\u2019s, but relates only to declarations of John Fairchild, subsequent to the alleged agreement- and hence is not, of itself, sufficient to establish a contract. See Plumer v. Guthrie, 76 Pa. 441; Nicolls v. McDonald, 101 Pa. 514.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">The referee therefore finds the following conclusions of fact:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\">1. The defendant, Elizabeth Carey, went into possession of the land described in the writ in 1872 by contract of purchase from John Batterton, the owner, and has remained there ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">2. On June 1, 1876, she, said defendant, assigned her interest in said land and contract, by a conveyance in writing duly executed, to J. P. Nought, acknowledging in said conveyance to have received from said Nought full consideration therefor, and on the same day John Batterton, the holder of the legal title, conveyed the same to said Nought, who at the same time executed and delivered a mortgage of the said land to John Fairchild to secure $800 loaned by said Fairchild to said Nought, the same being the balance then and there paid to Batterton in full of his contract with Elizabeth Carey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">3. John Fairchild died in 1879, intestate; and, said mortgage being overdue and wholly unpaid, the plaintiffs, his administrators, caused a writ of scire facias thereon to issue against J. P. Nought, regularly obtained judgment and became the purchasers of the land in question at a sheriff\u2019s sale on a writ of levari facias issued upon said judgment, \u2014 the sheriff\u2019s deed being duly acknowledged prior to the issuing of the writ in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\">4. Nought, the other defendant named in the writ, has occupied the premises since 1872, with the exception of about two weeks, but filed a disclaimer just prior to this reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-11\">5. Elizabeth Carey defends this action solely on the ground of her contract from Batterton, and an alleged unconditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>verbal promise from John Fairchild, at the time of her conveyance to Vought, to pay her some $400, the amount she had paid Batterton on her contract, including taxes and insurance, and to allow her to remain in possession until she got her money, with the further allegation that this was the consideration of her conveyance to Vought, and that neither the latter nor Fairchild ever paid her anything for her assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\">6. No improvements have been put upon the property since the date of the Batterton contract. The purchase money thereof was $1,025, and an execution on a confession of judgment in the contract at the suit of Batterton v. Carey, for purchase money in arrear and due, was in the sheriff\u2019s hands on June 1, 1876, .aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">7. It is not proven that the alleged verbal promise was ever made by John Fairchild.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-6\">The foregoing cover all the requests to find matters of fact \u2022submitted by the plaintiffs except the one numbered \u201c7\u201d in \u2019\u201cplaintiffs\u2019 points\u201d hereto attached, which is not found,'because the referee does not think it pertinent to the issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-7\">As conclusions of law the referee finds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-8\">1. That the plaintiffs\u2019 proofs malee out a prima facie case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-9\">2. That no defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is established by competent evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-10\">3. That the plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment for the land described in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-11\">The plaintiffs, by their attorney, submitted requests to find eight matters of law, which, with the referee\u2019s answers, are as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-12\">That under the defense set up by Elizabeth Carey the plaintiffs were not required to show title in them, further back than from those whose title is shown by the evidence to have been conveyed to Batterton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-13\"><em>Am. </em>The referee so finds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-14\">J. P. Vought was an incompetent witness for the defense, of the alleged verbal promise of Fairchild, both by reason of interest and on account of the policy of the law; and his evidence should be excluded in considering the truth or falsity of such allegation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-15\"><em>Am. </em>The referee so finds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-16\">Without testimony of any witness present when the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>verbal promise was made, it cannot be sufficiently proven by evidence of subsequent declarations of Fairchild.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\"><em>Ans. </em>The referee so finds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">Even though the alleged verbal contract of Fairchild is satisfactorily and sufficiently established by the evidence, it is void under the statute of frauds and perjuries, and is no defense to this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\"><em>Ans. </em>The referee does not so understand the law of the case, and declines to so find.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-7\">Even though the alleged verbal contract of Fairchild be sufficiently proven by competent oral testimony, and be valid notwithstanding the statute of frauds and perjuries, it created no interest in, or lien or charge upon, the land, available as a defense to this action which was not discharged by the sheriffs sale on the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-8\"><em>Ans. </em>The referee declines to so find, both because he does not think it material as the case now stands, and because he considers that if the alleged contract were proven it would avail and defeat a recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-9\">The defendant is barred from setting up said alleged verbal contract, irrespective of the statute of frauds and perjuries, or the sheriffs sale under the act of limitations of March 27, 1718, P. D. 930, old ed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-10\"><em>Ans. </em>The referee declines to so find, and is of the opinion . that it was not necessary for Mrs. Carey to become the aggressor, but that she had the option to set up and prove the alleged contract by way of defense as to an action of ejectment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-11\">Even though said alleged verbal promise be valid and effectual at this time and in this action, the defendant must account to the plaintiffs at the same time for the rents, issues, and profits of the property since June 1, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-12\"><em>Ans. </em>The referee declines to so find because he does not consider it necessary to consider that question in coming to a decision of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-13\">The plaintiffs are entitled to an unconditional recovery in this case, and judgment should be entered for them for the land described in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-14\"><em>Ans. </em>The referee so finds, for the reasons fully set forth above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-15\">Judgment should therefore be entered in favor of plaintiffs and against the defendant, for the land described in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The defendant\u2019s exceptions to the referee\u2019s report specified, <em>inter alia, </em>the rejection of Dr. Vought as an incompetent witness ; and the action of the court below in overruling the exceptions on this point was assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-4\"><em>T. H. B. </em>Lewis, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIa\">\u2014 Dr. Vought has no real, legal interest whatever in the result of this suit. He has no interest in the title to the land; for whatever interest he may have had passed by the judicial sale, and is disavowed by his disclaimer. He has no interest in the possession; for, having disclaimed, any attempted possession would be trespass. He has entered into no covenants with either party to the suit, and cannot therefore be charged with, or relieved from, the performance of any. He cannot be charged with costs, by reason of his disclaimer. He cannot be charged with mesne profits for any alleged possession prior to his disclaimer; for by rule 13 of our common pleas \u201cif the plaintiff in ejectment intends to claim mesne profits he shall file a statement of the amount claimed, and length of time during which time he demands said profits, and give notice of the same to the defendant or his attorney, by copy of such statement, at least thirty days before the trial. On failure so to do, he shall not be permitted to claim mesne profits in that suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-5\">No such statement was filed or notice given. Besides, any liability for mesne profits would necessarily arise after the sheriff\u2019s sale to the defendants in error; for up to that time Dr. Vought was the owner of the property. The sheriff\u2019s sale, however, occurred after the death of John Fairchild. Dr. Vought is therefore a competent witness on the question of mesne profits, whenever it properly arises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-6\">The witness cannot be said to be interested because of any possible liability to Mrs. Carey; for, having persistently asserted that the agreement was with Mr. Fairchild, she is estopped from asserting it to have been with anyone else; and even if she were not estopped, the result of this suit would determine nothing as to the liability or nonliability of any person aside from the parties to the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-7\">Interest, to'exclude a witness, must be a real, legal interest, dependent upon the result of the suit, and not a speculative or possible interest.

McClelland v. West, 70 Pa. 183.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-4\">The award of arbitrators, in the trial of an appeal from it, is not evidence; and it is error to permit it to be read. Shaeffer v. Kreitzer, 6 Binn. 432, 433.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\">The title of Dr. Yought is identical with that of the defendants in error, the transfer having been by judicial sale. That title, so far as this suit is concerned, depends upon the validity of Mrs. Carey\u2019s assignment of the Batterton contract. If that assignment is valid, then the title is valid; and any impeachment of the title by her must be an impeachment of her assignment. She makes no attack upon the title, either intentional or incidental. The validity of her defense depends upon the validity of her assignment, because her defense is an effort to maintain a claim for the consideration upon which the assignment was made; and any assertion of a claim for consideration necessarily asserts the validity of the instrument or transaction for which the consideration is claimed. So, also, any testimony going to the establishing of such a claim would also necessarily tend to the validating of the transaction on which the claim was made. Nor does the fact that the claim for consideration in this case includes the possession of the property for an indefinite time alter the case; for a consideration may be any lawful thing upon which the contracting parties agree. Nor does the claim to the right of possession impeach the title of the owner; else every claim to possession by a tenant would be an impeachment of his landlord\u2019s title.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-6\"><em>L.

This would leave him still liable to her for such consideration money according to the written papers; and her defense prevailing, that liability would be wiped out. But he was called to show, further, that his own liability under the papers was'no' liability at all, and that the decedent was the man who, by parol, promised to pay the consideration of the Carey deed to him. A witness prima facie liable on a contract cannot, by his own testimony, controvert such liability, and thereby remove his prima facie incompetency as a witness on the score of interest. Meason v.

P. Yought, vesting in him a complete title. On the same day John Fairchild loaned Vought $800, which was secured by a mortgage of the land. The administrators of Fairchild, having obtained judgment upon the mortgage and issued execution thereon, purchased the property at sheriff\u2019s sale. They brought this action in ejectment against the persons in possession, Mrs. Carey and Dr. Vought, upon whom the writ was served, and both appealed from the award of arbitrators. More than three years after the suit was begun Yought filed a disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">To defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery the defendant sought to establish by the testimony of Yought, \u201cthat simultaneously with her assignment, to Yought and as the sole inducement to and sole consideration for it, John Fairchild agreed that if she would so assign her contract, thereby enabling Vought to mortgage to Fairchild, he, Fairchild, would pay her the amount of money she had paid upon and put into the property, <em>viz., </em>about $440, and further agreed that she should retain possession of the property \u2019til he paid her that sum.\u201d Without stopping to consider whether, were it admitted that Fairchild made such oral promise, it would be a good defense, we will pass to the only question which is presented for review, namely, Was Yought a competent witness to impeach the mortgage ?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The vesting of the title in Yought, the giving of the mortgage and the making of the alleged oral agreement were at the same time. Fairchild is dead, and the plaintiffs who purchased at the sheriff\u2019s sale hold under the mortgage executed by Yought. They represented the deceased party. When a party to a thing or contract in action is dead, and his rights have passed, either by his own act or by that of the law, to another who represents his interest in the subject of controversy, the surviving party to that subject shall not testify to matters occurring in the lifetime of the adverse party.

Tanner, 66 Pa. 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Where the grantee in a deed is dead, the grantor is not a competent witness to impeach the title of the grantee\u2019s devisee by showing that the deed was intended to be in trust for the grantor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>and Ms heirs. Murray v. New York, L. &amp; W. R. Co. 103 Pa. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Yought was holder of the title to the land and the mortgagor. Aside from his testimony there is nothing against the plaintiffs\u2019 title, for on the face of the deeds and record they have as good title as was vested in Yought. Upon the defendant\u2019s showing, she was interested in the transaction. Both are excepted out of the operation of the act of 1869, by the proviso which compels the surviving party to a deed or contract to be silent, unless he who succeeds to the right of the dead consents that the survivor may speak. The defense was an attempt to show by oral testimony that the mortgage to John Fairchild was something else than its written terms, and the mortgagor was incompetent for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Had Yought not been made a party in the ejectment the case would be no different. Being incompetent, whether a party or not in the action, the act of March 28, 1867, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
