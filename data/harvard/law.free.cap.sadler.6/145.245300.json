After dark on the night of February 20,, 1886, Patrick Kelley was walking north on Cedar street and started to cross Lehigh avenue. In crossing the railroad track he was struck by the north part of ah engine backing eastward along Lehigh avenue, was thrown to the side of . the track and killed. This suit was brought by his widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">The engine was going faster than a horse trots, and was not checked at the crossing. There was no gate or stationary flagman at this crossing. Upon the engine were two flagmen for fl\u00e1gging crossings, one up and the other down the track, but they did not get off to signal the crossing as they had done before on special occasions. The engine bell was rung for two. squares before reaching Cedar street, and a head light in front and lights on the rear of the engine were burning. The whistle was not blown until Kelley started to cross.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">A witness called by the plaintiff testified that he was going along the west side of Cedar street in the same direction as Kelley, saw the light on the engine, heard the bell and waited for the engine to pass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">The engine was 14 or 15 yards away when Kelley attempted to cross the street. There was nothing to prevent him from see ing the locomotive, which was plainly visible from the sidewalk for the distance of a square. Another witness, who was on Le-high avenue one square west of Cedar street, heard the bell and saw the light as the locomotive approached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit and afterwards dismissed a motion to take it off, which was assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-10\"><em>Crawford &amp; Dallas, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akx\">\u2014 What signals, whether a whistle or flagman, are necessary is a question of fact for the jury.

Co. v. Ogier, 35 Pa. 72, 78 Am. Dec. 322. In that case Ogier was placed, by the failure to blow the whistle, in a position of peril where he was suddenly called upon to decide what course should be pursued. The court b\u00e9low said: \u201cProm the position in which he was placed, when he first could have seen the approach of the train, it is a reasonable conclusion to draw that he was in peril and must have acted upon impulse rather than from judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-8\">It is vain for the plaintiff to rely upon the presumption of law that the decedent did his duty, when the evidence of the plaintiff shows that the decedent, in spite of what his eyes and ears told him, walked directly in front of a moving locomotive.
