Defendants pleaded nonassumpsit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-11\">On the trial before' Mitchell, J., the testimony tended to establish the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-12\">The defendants rented the premises No. 11 South Water street, Philadelphia, by verbal agreement, on October 1, 1883, and paid their rent monthly until they quit, May 1, 1885, claiming to be monthly tenants. The plaintiffs refused to accept the premises at that time, as they claimed that the defendants were yearly tenants and liable for rent to October 1, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-13\">The plaintiffs testified that they had purchased the premises in March, I860, from the executors under the last will and testament of Catharine Miller, deceased. At that time W. IT. Dunlap &amp; Company were in possession of the premises as tenants for one year, under a verbal renewal of a lease between them and Catharine Miller. This lease was turned over by the executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>at the time of the settlement for the purchase of the property, to M., &amp; E. Coon. At that time it was also agreed by Dunlap &amp; Company and M. &amp; E. Coon that the lease should remain in force and eff\u00e9et as to the time, <em>viz., </em>one year, and as to the amount, <em>viz., </em>$1,200 a year. And Dunlap &amp; Company continued as tenants under said lease until released on October 1, 1883, when Pancoast &amp; Griffith were accepted as tenants. The plaintiffs testified that the defendants were accepted on the same terms as Dunlap &amp; Company held under the lease. The defendants had previously taken possession of the premises as subtenants of Dunlap <em>&amp; </em>Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">The lease was produced and identified and then offered in evidence. It was between Catharine Miller and Dunlap &amp; Company, dated February 22, 1872, with renewals between the same parties March 1, 1876, and March 1, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">The counsel of the defendants objected, on the ground that it was between other parties, irrelevant and incompetent; to which it was replied that it was between predecessors in the title of present parties, and was relevant to show the terms upon which Dunlap held; and the evidence is that defendants were to hold on the same terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">The counsel for the defendants further objected on the ground that it had not been proven, to which it was replied that it was not necessary to do so as it was one of the title papers by which plaintiffs acquired the property and defendants\u2019 predecessor in title obtained his possession. Objections overruled, lease admitted in evidence, and exception noted for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">Verdict for plaintiffs for $533.75 .and judgment thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">The assignment of error specified the admission of this paper in evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AZO\"><em>William A.

Ev. 13th ed. \u00a7 573b, p. 625.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-5\">In Kitchen v. Smith, 101 Pa. 456, there was a lease which was not in issue, but merely came incidentally, in the case in the course of the trial, and it was admitted in evidence upon the testimony of a party to the lease; and it was held that it was not necessary to call the subscribing witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-6\">To the same effect are Wright v. Wood, 23 Pa. 130, and Mix v.

It is true that lease was between other parties; but evidence had been given that the defendants below agreed to rent the property on the same terms that Dunlap, the former tenant, held it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">As these defendants had gone into possession as subtenant's under Dunlap at first, if they agreed to take the property on the same terms, it is fair to presume they knew what those terms were. On producing the lease on the trial one of the plaintiffs below swore it was the lease under which Dunlap held. Under all the other evidence, we think the lease was sufficiently proved to justify the court in admitting it in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
