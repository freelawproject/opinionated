This dam was one of the largest and most important works of the state, appurtenant to the canal, and its erection consumed a vast amount of timber, earth, and stone, all of which were necessarily obtained from the land in suit, and in fact could not- be obtained elsewhere, except at an increased and unwarranted expense. The same materials were in constant demand for the maintenance and repair of the dam, and the amount of land required to furnish the necessary material, not only for the construction of the dam, the lock, and the canal, but also constantly needed for their maintenance, could alone be determined by the commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-3\">February 25, 1826, P.

The land is on the west of the Chemung river, \u2014 the dam that was built across the river when the North Branch coal was constructed abutted against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>this land.

They have given no evidence. Their possession is sufficient to protect them, and there can be no recovery here until the plaintiff has shown a better title. This depends upon the construction of the acts of assembly under which the canals were sold. They provide that the sale shall convey all the property appurtenant to the canal or in any wise appertaining thereto, and all the estate, right, title, and interest of the commonwealth in and to the same, \u2014 and all claim and demand whatsoever, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">[The defendants ask us to submit to you whether this land was necessary for the use of the canal, \u2014 that is, the 33 acres and 69 perches.

When it was purchased by the state the canal board put upon record their reasons for .purchasing it. They deemed it to the advantage of the commonwealth to buy a farm, the. portion of which lying on the flats had been injured, and which might be utilized for a water power, rather than pay damages to the owner. The part now in controversy could by no possibility be used in connection with the canal.

L. 57, as follows: \u201cThat it shall and may be lawful for the said board, or a majority of them, to agree with the owner or owners of any land through which the \u2022said canal is intended to pass, for the purchase, use, and occupation thereof, on behalf of the state.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-12\">The land was not purchased under the act of April 9, 18.27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>P.

It is true the canal commissioners had the right to sell such portions of the land so purchased as they might think unnecessary for the canal. But they, and they only, had this right and this discretion. They never did sell \u00e1nv of these lands, and the right to so sell or part with them under the act of 1827 ended with the expiration of their powers. And from their not having sold any of this land, under the authority of that act, it should be presumed that they considered it all necessary for the convenient use and occupation of the canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">The action of the canal commissioners was conclusive of the question as to the amount of land necessary for the convenient use of the canal.

This was to be determined by the board of canal commissioners. It was what was required by the board for the use of the state that they were to value and describe; and it was of that thus required and described, not of that which the viewers might think necessary, that the law defined the seisin of the state.

Cox v. Freedley, 33 Pa. 124, 75 Am. Dee. 584.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">In order to interpret this act of assembly and this proclamation and give each clause in them its full meaning, we must look at things as they then existed, and the canal as it then was. To give a particular description was impossible. The canal property wTas over 100 miles long. Its boundaries were irregular. In some places its title extended only so far \u25a0 as its permanent monuments had been built on the ground. In others the title extended as far as the descriptions contained in deeds and releases, which had been placed on record. The property varied in width from about sixty feet, when it passed through flat and level land, to that of many rods when it passed through deep cuts or along steep hillsides. Besides this, there were many pieces of land used in connection -with toll houses, lock houses, weigh locks, basins, docks, besides lands overflowed by the back water from the dams, necessary for the convenient use of the canal, of different sizes, irregular shapes, in some cases with undefined or perhaps undefinable boundaries. As these pieces of land could not be particularly described, it was necessary to convey them by general words, and we claim that those used in the act are the most general and sweeping that could have been selected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\">The property is to be conveyed with the appurtenances.

One general test is how far the incidents claimed are necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of what is expressly granted. Wright v. Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Co. 45 Pa. 482; Buckholder v.

It is admitted that the defendants have no title whatever to the land described in the writ. If it belongs not to the plaintiff, then it does belong to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and although it may belong to the latter, yet it is not now and never was open to settlement, warrant, or patent; nor is it property over which the land office has ever had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The defendants rest their defense solely on the ground of possession, a ground sufficiently substantial if it be found that the plaintiff has not a superior right. It is conceded that the Pennsylvania &amp; New York Canal &amp; Bailroad Company, through the Sunbury &amp; Erie Railroad Company, and the North Branch Canal Company, was and is the vendee of the commonwealth as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to all the property belonging or appurtenant to the North Branch canal; but it is alleged that the land in suit was not so appurtenant, and this because it was not necessary for the use of that improvement; hence, although the grant to the company above named was, \u201cof the upper North Branch canal, with all the property therfeto belonging, or in any wise appertaining,\u201d it did not convey the land in controversy. That is, as the defendants contend, although this whole tract of <em>72 </em>acres was bought by the canal commissioners for the use of the canal, and on part of which the canal was actually located, they have nevertheless the right to define what was necessary for that purpose; to run off what they may think was really appurtenant to the state works, and settle upon and occupy the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">.The mere statement of this claim, involving, as it does, an assumption so unwarranted, ought of itself to settle this controversy ; for the question naturally presents itself, Who gave these men the authority to say what should or should not be canal property, or to limit the power of the state officers ? If the commonwealth treated this as canal property and as such conveyed it to her grantees, we cannot understand by what warrant private citizens undertake to sit in, judgment on and annul her acts and the resolutions of her officers. But, passing this feature of the case, let us see how, in fact and in law, this matter stands. By the act of the 25th of February, 1826, P. L. 55, the canal commissioners were authorized \u201cto agree with the owner or owners \u2022of any land through which the said canal is intended to pass for the purchase and occupation thereof, on behalf of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Here was the grant of a power certainly of sufficient breadth and generality; their purchases were to be confined to lands through which the canal was intended to pass, but there was no limitation either as to amount or quality; that was left to their sole discretion. They might be extravagant to the last degree; they might buy 100 acres where but ten were necessary, but there was no power which could call them to account, or reverse their judgment, except that by which they -were created, \u2014 the general .assembly of the commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Again, if they did so purchase, under the provisions of the said act, whether economically or extravagantly, the land so purchased was canal land \u2014 appurtenant to the canal, for they had no power to purchase for any other purpose. The land office had nothing to do with it, nor was any department of the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ernment authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of it.

L. 201), lands so purchased must have remained canal property as long as the state retained its improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">In such case, however, that is, had neither that act nor one similar to it been passed, it is very clear that all the property purchased by the commissioners under the acts of 1826 and 1827 would have to be regarded as belonging to the public works; and in case of the sale of those works and their appurtenances, all such property must pass and be held by the commonwealth\u2019s vendee. But the latter act put no compulsion on the commissioners ; authority was thereby given to them \u201cto sell the remainder not occupied by the canal, and to convey to the purchasers respectively the estate and title thus acquiredbut whether they should make such sale or not was left entirely to their own discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We have, then, in this department of the commonwealth (called the \u201cBoard of Canal Commissioners,\u201d which said board represented the public works and nothing else), the power to purchase lands for the use of the state canals and for no other purpose; the power also to sell them, should it seem to that board necessary; so, from this, it would seem to follow as a corollary that the judgment of this board must be final, since there was no tribunal in the state having power to revise that judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">If, then, it purchased the land in controversy for the use of the canal, and never declared any part thereof unnecessary for such use by putting the surplus on the market for sale, by what authority may either a lower court or this court revise and correct the act and judgment, or discretion, of this governmental department, in which was vested all right, title and power in and over the canal lands ?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It may be that the canal commissioners acted improvidently in buying the whole of John Spalding\u2019s farm for canal purposes when but part of it was necessary for such purposes, or in not running off and selling the surplus, but when we have made this admission, what then? Who can revise and annul their deliberate act ? They certainly did need part of it for the use mentioned ; and in their resolution of September 25, 1838, they declared that the erection of dam No. 1 so impaired the land of Spalding as to render it unfit for farming purposes; and as the erection of the said dam would create a good water power on said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>land, therefore they directed the superintendent of the T'ioga line to pay to Spalding the sum of $4,000 for the fee of the whole tract. Thus was the land in controversy bought expressly for the use of the canal by the properly constituted authorities of the state, and it is not within our province to say that they did not act providently.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">Did the state still own the canals, the idea that the defendants could squat upon the lands connected with them, and set at defiance the power of the commissioners, on the plea that they were not necessary for the purposes for which they were bought, would be too absurd to talk about But the plaintiff is the vendee of the state, and by its deed it took that over which the canal commissioners had control for the state; and it now represents both the state and the canal board, so that if the defendants could not claim as against the canal board, prior to the time of the sale, neither can they now claim as against the Pennsylvania &amp; New York Canal &amp; Railroad Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Merour and Mr. Justice Stereett dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
