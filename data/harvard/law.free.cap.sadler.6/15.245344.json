Glanz, a liquor dealer, died intestate, June 3, 1884, leaving to survive him a widow, Mary A. Glanz, one minor child, his mother, Elizabeth Glanz, and a sister, Mrs. Sarah Gernet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-11\">Letters of administration were granted to his widow, whose account, showing receipts of $8,528.16, was duly filed and confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-12\">D. W. Nevin, Esq., was appointed auditor, to examine the account and make distribution of the balance in the hands of the administratrix. Such balance was not sufficient to pay all the claims presented against the estate, nor the amount of those found due and owing by the auditor; and he distributed the balance <em>pro rata </em>among the creditors, whose claims were allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-13\">To the auditor\u2019s report John McCann, a creditor of the deceased, filed exceptions, <em>inter </em>alia, to the allowance of the claims of Mrs. Elizabeth Glanz and Robert Gerver; to the action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>auditor in refusing to surcharge the administratrix and in allowing the balance of the widow\u2019s exemption to Mary A. Glanz out \u25a0of the balance for distribution, and also to the auditor\u2019s fee of \u25a0$275, as exorbitant and excessive and not within the limits of the act of assembly regulating the compensation of auditors appointed by the orphans\u2019 court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\">The facts in relation to these claims are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">The claim of Elizabeth Glanz was made up of a note given by \"Edwin S. Glanz for $500, $90 for money loaned, and a $1,000 4 per cent bond, of the value of $1,217.50. No objection was made to the claim on the note for $500. The auditor rejected the claim for $90, money loaned, not considering it sufficiently proven. In allowing -the claim for the bond the auditor based his decision upon the following evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">Mrs. Sarah Gernet testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-7\">\u201cI live with my mother on Eerry street. Ed. came to my \u25a0mother\u2019s house, and asked where mother was, and I said she was up-stairs. He went up-stairs, and I had occasion to go upstairs, and saw the bond on the bed. He came down shortly after, and I saw him have the bond in his hand. I saw him have the $1,000 bond. I just came up as she had gotten it out of the \u2019box and laid it on the bed. It was a $1,000 bond. He had it in \"his hand when he came down-stairs, and came out in the kitchen where I was, and he said, \u2018this is a heavy load off my mind.\u2019 I said, \u2018Did mother give you the bond <em>V </em>and he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I \u25a0asked him if that would see him through and he said it would, \u25a0and he went out of the door.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-8\">The same witness on being recalled a few days later, testified \u25a0\u25a0as follows: \u201cWhen he got the bond he said: \u2018Mother, I will pay you in small amounts every week;\u2019 and then he asked her if that would do, and she said yes; when he came he asked for the money as a loan.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">On cross-examination she testified: \u201cThis took place the \u25a0same day that he got the bond; it was when I was up-stairs, before she gave him the bond; it was when I saw the bond lying \u25a0on the bed, I saw her give the bond to him, that is, I saw the \u2019bond in his hand when he came down-stairs, and he said he would pay her so much every week; and he asked her if that would do, and he said be would pay it back as soon as possible.\u201d Charles B. Hetrick, to prove the value of the bond, testified as .follows: \u201cOn May 14, 1884, Edwin Glanz came to our office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>with a $1,000 4 per cent government coupon bond, and we bought it from him for 1.21% and gave him a check for $1,217.50.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-4\">A part of the claim of Robert Gerver consisted of a balance due on a book account, for liquor sold. Objection was made to the allowance of this claim, on the ground that Robert Gervei was a retail liquor dealer, and the charges being made of wholesale quantities it could not be recovered. The auditor refused to sustain this objection for the reason that if Gerver violated the law, he was subject to its penalties; but in no case did he forfeit his claim until a conviction should be had under the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">Counsel for exceptant offered to prove before the auditor that, subsequent to the confirmation of the account, evidence was discovered that the entire assets of the decedent\u2019s estate were not accounted for by the accountant, and asked to surcharge her with such property and moneys remaining in her hands unaccounted for. To this offer the administratrix objected:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">The auditor sustained the objection for the reason that the account was confirmed absolutely; and the auditor, having been appointed to distribute the balance in the account, could only inquire as to such matters as relate to distribution, and not to such matters as affect an account already confirmed, to which no exceptions were filed before the appointment of the auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">After hearing the exceptions to the report of the auditor, the \u2022following opinion of the court was delivered by Schuyler, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">To this report eleven exceptions vrere filed, but they were not all pressed at the argument. Those that were pressed may be disposed of with but brief comment without injustice to the exceptants. If the testimony of Mrs. Gernet is to be believed, there was no error in allowing the claim of Mrs. Elizabeth Glanz. It is true that Mrs. Gernet is the daughter of Mrs. Glanz. It is also true that she had to be called to the stand a second time, after an interval of several weeks, to supply defects in her first testimony. But these were circumstances that go exclusively to her credibility, which was for the auditor. Clearly, upon such grounds alone, we would have no right to say that this witness is unworthy of belief, when the auditor, with far better opportunities of judging, says to the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-9\">The claim of Robert Gerver is made up of a number of items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>which are objected to in a lump. The argument for exceptants, however, was chiefly directed against the allowance of the balance of $31.86 on book account for liquors sold. It seems that, these liquors were sold in wholesale quantities, and that Mr.. Gerver had no wholesale liquor license, he being at the time of the sale a hotel keeper. The allowance of this part of Mr. Gerver\u2019s claim is resisted, solely upon the ground that the liquor was sold in violation of a statute of the United States (Rev, Stat. \u00a7 3242, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2094), which provides that every person who carries on the business of wholesale liquor dealer without having paid a license shall be fined' not less than $1,000, and imprisoned not less than six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-4\">It will be noticed that the penalty is annexed, not to the act of selling, but to the carrying on of the business of wholesale liquor selling. It is a sufficient answer to the position of the learned counsel for the appellants to say that there is no evidence that Mr. Gerver \u201ccarried on the business of wholesale liquor dealer.\u201d From all that appears these sales to Glanz were the only sales of this character ever made by Gerver; and if so, we think the act of Congress has no application. See Eahter v. First Nat. Bank, 92 Pa. 393.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">Whether or not the payments made to Gerver were sufficient to cancel the balance claimed by him is a question of fact. The fact has been found against the exceptant; and we have not been convinced that the auditor committed error in so doing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">The account having been confirmed absolutely, the auditor was appointed for the sole purpose of distribution. He therefore very properly refused to inquire into the question of surcharge. That was a matter over which he had no jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-7\">The last exception is to the auditor\u2019s compensation. This is. an indirect way of \u201cswearing at the judge,\u201d \u2014 a not unusual, practice when parties lose their cases. The excellent character of the learned auditor for integrity is of weight in the balance' when weighing this question of the compensation charged by him. But, outside of this, we think this charge not unreasonable. In addition to the evidence furnished by the notes of audit and the report, it was stated at the argument, in the presence of the counsel for excejatants, and not denied, that in passing upon the numerous questions of fact it became necessary to make long and tedious examinations of books of account, which greatly added to the labors of the auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>And now, September 28, 1885, the exceptions are dismissed and the report confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">The assignments of error specified the action of the court in dismissing the exceptions to the report of the auditor and confirming the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-5\"><em>William Gorman, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMf\">\u2014 It is a rule of reason and therefore of law that where a witness varies in his statement of the same transaction in material particulars at different periods the testimony is to be greatly doubted. Com. v. Sallager, 3 Clark (Pa.) 127.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">Prom the testimony given by the daughter on the first day this claim of the mother would be considered under the lawr either a gift out and out or an advancement; for the law recognizes the natural affection which prompts the parent to make voluntary provision for children by anticipating in their favor the distribution of the patrimonial estate before death.

Pay, 6 W. N. C. 60, says: \u201cClaims of this character against the estates of decedents resting on mere oral testimony of declarations or admissions are very dangerous, and ought certainly not to be favored by the courts.\u201d See also Graham v. Graham, 34 Pa. 480.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-9\">The claim of Pobert Gerver raises the question whether the court will help a retail liquor dealer to recover for goods sold by wholesale, such retailer having no license as a wholesaler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-10\">The proof before the auditor was that Pobert Gerver was a retail liquor dealer and that he sold liquor to decedent in barrels and quantities not authorized by his license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-11\">The Pevised Statutes, p. 624, \u00a7 3232, IT.
