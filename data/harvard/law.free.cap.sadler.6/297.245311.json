It is not an interlocutory order, but a definite decree, from which an appeal lies to this court.

Act of March 29, 1832, \u00a7 59, Purdon\u2019s Digest, ed. 1883, p. 1286, pi. 62.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">The power of the orphans\u2019 court to appoint a guardian is purely statutory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">\u201cThe orphans\u2019 court of each county shall have the care of persons of minors resident within such county, and of their estates, and shall have power to admit such minors when, and as often as, there shall be occasion to make choice of guardians, and to appoint guardians for such as they shall judge too young,\u201d etc. Act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 191.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-10\">The court has no power to appoint a guardian for minors, simply because someone (perhaps an entire stranger or an interloper) asks it, or because some relative or pretended friend, out of whim or caprice, or perhaps from improper motives, demands it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-11\">There must be \u201coccasion\u201d for it, a legal cause or ground for the action or interference of the court.

A legal discretion is vested in the orphans\u2019 court to appoint guardians of the persons and estates of minors; and such discretion is not the subject of review in a court of error. Gray\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 243; Mc-Cann\u2019s Appeal, 49 Pa. 304.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-5\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">As a matter of correct practice evidence should have been taken before making the decree; but modified as it has been, and being now restricted to a guardianship of the estate only, of the minor children, we cannot discover that the appellant is injured thereby. If they have no estate as he avers, the guardian will take nothing from him. If they have some which the appellant conceals, the necessity for a guardian is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
