Co. Ct. 483.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-5\">On the trial, before McPherson, J., a special verdict was agreed upon. The court charged the jury as follows: [\u201cYour verdict in this case will be a verdict of guilty.\u201d]1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-6\">A verdict of guilty was accordingly rendered, subject to the special verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-7\">The opinion of the court on the special verdict was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-8\">The special verdict finds the facts to be as follows: Dr. Ege is a physician residing in Reading, Berks county, and was duly registered there in ugust, 1883. After that date and before May 18, 1885, when he also registered here, he practised medicine in this county, coming at regular intervals for the double purpose of seeing those persons who had already consulted him in Reading, and of attending to such patients as might come to him here for the first time. Eor meeting such persons he had a place of business, of which he gave public notice. Whenever he was thus in this county, he attended all persons who called upon him or desired his professional visits, and made charges for his services. His residence has not been changed. This indictment charges him with a violation of the act of 1881, P. L. 72, in practising medicine in Lebanon county without having first been registered here, and the question for decision is whether, upon these facts, his registration in Berks county of itself permitted him to thus practise in this county also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-10\">This is not the case of a physician duly registered in the county of his residence and called only upon special occasions to see patients elsewhere. It is no doubt true that much the larger part of Dr. Ege\u2019s business is done in the county of Berks; but it is also true that the business done here was not upon speci\u00e1l calls? for his services, but was of the same kind as that done in Read-'' ing. He had a room in this city to which, by advertisement, the public was invited; he came at regular intervals, and while he was here he attended professionally to all persons who asked for his services, making charges and receiving payment therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-11\">[He was therefore \u201cpractising\u201d medicine in this county, and in our opinion, was required to register before he could lawfully thus pursue his profession here. We think he was a \u201csojourner\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>in this county, and therefore within the express language of the second section of the act of 1881. ]2</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-4\">Other provisions of the act support this view. Section 3 repeats the phrase, \u201cresides or sojourns,\u201d and [\u00a7 8 defines a sojourner to be \u201cany person opening an office or appointing any place where he or she may meet patients or receive calls.\u201d It was argued that this general language, which fits the case before us, must be restricted to physicians residing out of the state; but it- seems to us to include all physicians, wherever they may reside.]3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">Section 8 does not seem to be doubtful, in the language quoted,, and we must give effect to its plain direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-6\">The purpose of the act, also, is in accord with the apparent meaning of this definition. In \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, and 5 registration is said to be required \u201cfor inspection by the public;\u201d that is, in order that the community, to which the practitioner\u2019s services-are offered, may be given some facts as to his training and experience on which to base a judgment of his capacity. And, as. we think, each community in which, from time to time, he \u201cresides or sojourns\u201d is to have a similar opportunity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-7\">[Presumably, he will only practise where he resides; and,, in that event, registration there fulfils the purpose of the act; but if he also \u201csojourns\u201d elsewhere, that purpose requires him to give the new public, to which he appeals, the same information about his medical study and practice.]4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-8\">The earlier legislation on this subject also confirms the belief just expressed. The act of 1869, P. L. 1067, required of physicians, practising in several counties therein named, certain qualifications, and by \u00a7 3 extended these requirements to \u201cany person who shall attempt to practise medicine or surgery by opening a transient office in any of the aforesaid counties, or who shall, by handbill or other form of written or printed advertisement, assign such transient office or other place to meet persons seeking medical or surgical advice or prescription; . . .\u201d \u2014 thus putting residents and sojourners on the same-footing. Similar local acts are to be found in the laws of 1870 at pages 353, 659, 705, and 1156, and in the laws of 1873 at pages 147 and 550. These acts affected the following counties, viz\u201e: Adams, Armstrong, Beaver, Berks, Blair, Bradford, Cambria, Carbon, Chester, Columbia, Crawford, Cumberland, Dauphin, Elk, Erie, Huntingdon, Indiana, Juniata Lancaster,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Lawrence, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Monroe, Northampton, Perry, Philadelphia, Schuylkill, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Union, Venango, Warren, Washington, Wyoming and York; or considerably more than half the state. Like provisions occur in the general acts of 1875, \u00a7 5, P. L. 51, and of 1877, \u00a7 4, P. L. 42. The title of the latter act, <em>viz., </em>\u201cAn Act to Protect the People of the Commonwealth against Incompetent Practitioners of Medicine, Surgery, and Obstetrics,\u201d shows a purpose in the same general direction pursued by the act of 1881, and the whole course of the legislation referred to properly throws light upon the latter act, which is <em>in pari materia </em>and is best understood, not as standing alone, but as the last of .a series. Re Keeling\u2019s Road, 59 Pa. 358; Pittsburgh, A. &amp; M. Pass. R. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 1 Pennyp. 449.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\">It seems evident from this review that the act of 1881 uses a single word \u201csojourner\u201d in place of the longer phrases of the earlier acts, but refers thereby to the same class of persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">[We therefore hold that Dr. Ege was sojourning in Lebanon county for the purpose of practising medicine, and that he violated the act of 1881 by thus sojourning without registration.]5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">Judgment must be entered for the commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-7\">The defendant was sentenced to pay a fine of $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-8\">The assignments of error specified the portions of the charge inclosed in brackets and designated respectively by exponents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-9\"><em>Grant Weidman, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX6\">\u2014 The act of 1881 is a penal statute and should, therefore, be strictly construed. Bucher v. Com. 103 Pa. 534.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-10\">The evident purpose of the act was to secure for the citizens of the commonwealth, as nearly as possible, competent practitioners of medicine and surgery. With this purpose in view it provides for two classes of practitioners: (1) Such as have a diploma from a medical college or university; and (2) such as have practised medicine or surgery continuously in this commonwealth since 1871,.without having the degree of Doctor of Medicine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-12\">The act further provides for and regulates the mode by which such physicians or surgeons residing out of the state as may, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>by tbe laws of tbe state in wbicb they reside, be legally qualified to practise medicine or surgery, may practise in the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-4\">By \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, and 4 of the act, all persons having a diploma, whether intending to take up a residence permanently or temporarily, shall present the same to the prothonotary of the county where he resides or sojourns, and be registered as set forth in the act. The act does not say that his right to practise is confined to the county where the physician or surgeon resides or sojourns. Being penal the act cannot be so construed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-5\">By \u00a7 5, 'physicians or surgeons of the second class are required to register in the county in which they reside. The word \u201csojourn\u201d or \u201csojourner\u201d does not appear in this section. It is absurd to say that the legislature intended to discriminate in favor of this class.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-6\">The construction which makes all the provisions of the act consistent, and carries out its purpose, is that \u201csojourner\u201d applies to \u201cphysicians or surgeons who are legally qualifi\u00e9d to practise medicine or surgery in the state in which they reside.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-7\"><em>A.
