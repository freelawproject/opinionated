J., Gordon, Trunkey, Green, and Clark, JJ.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ao7\">Appeal from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery County, directing a citation to issue.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Agi\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-12\">The petition of J. M. Albertson, filed in October, 1885, represented :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-13\">That Ninian Irwin died May 5, 1877, leaving a last will and testament which was duly proved before the register of wills of said county after the said testator\u2019s death, and letters testamentary thereon were by said register duly issued to his widow, Nghcy Adelaide Irwin, and that on February 5, 1881, the said execijtrix filed a first account and that since said time she has filed no account. That your petitioner is a creditor of the said estate, and that more than one whole year has elapsed since filing the first account. Your petitioner therefore prays the court to award a citation against the said Nancy Adelaide Irwin, commanding\u2019 her to file an account in said estate at the next term of court or make such other or further order as to Your Honor may seem meet or the laws may require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The answer of the said Nancy Adelaide Irwin alleged:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">That the matters alleged in the petition for said citation are not sufficient in law to entitle the petitioner to the said citation, nor to the account therein prayed for. She therefore prays to be hence dismissed, and that her reasonable costs may be decreed to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">Upon granting the citation as prayed, Boyer, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">When this petition was presented the court granted a rule upon the executrix to show cause why a citation as prayed for should not issue commanding her to file an account; which was made returnable to the February .adjourned court The clerk by a clerical error indorsed upon the petition that a citation had been awarded as prayed for. The same day the acceptance of service at bar was indorsed upon the petition by the counsel of the executrix, G. B. Fox &amp; Son, Esquires. No citation or rule appears to have been actually issued or served. I shall consider it therefore as intended \u2014 a rule to show cause; and so the counsel for the executrix seem to have treated it when they filed their demurrer to the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">We think, however, that when an executrix has filed, as in this case, a first account, which implies further assets to be administered, a creditor of the estate, after waiting about five years after the partial account, is entitled, without showing more, either to another account or to some explanation of the delay. If there be any good reason why the executrix should not further account at present, it would have been but just to disclose it; and upon sufficient cause shown the court woiild have extended the time. But the respondent has chosen instead to rely upon a demurrer, which we do not consider sufficient as an answer to the rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">And now, March 1, 1886, the rule is made absolute; and a citation is directed to issue commanding the respondent as executrix of the last will and testament of Ninian Irwin, deceased, to file a further account on or before the first day of May, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-9\">This action of the court was assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-10\"><em>G.

C. 369.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-5\">Where an executor or administrator has failed to file an account within a year from the grant of his letters, any creditor may compel him to do so. But this right of the creditor results from the executor\u2019s duty to file an account within the specified time; and it by no means follows, when this has been performed, that further accounts will be ordered whenever the convenience or caprice of the creditor may demand. Caldwell\u2019s Estate, 6 W. N. C. 370.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-6\">After an account of an executor has been filed, the right of creditors to a further account is not of course, but is to be determined by the circumstances of the case.
