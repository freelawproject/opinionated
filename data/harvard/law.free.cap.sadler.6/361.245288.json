Pursuant to the term and stipulation of the aforesaid \u2022agreement, the said Walters paid the sum of $60 in cash on the 18th day of July, 1883, and on the same day executed and delivered to the said the II. W. Collender Company thirteen promissory notes payable respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, I, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 months after that to the order of the said company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>each for the sum of $30, and afterwards paid the first four of said notes at or about the time of their maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">Fourth. The defendants in this case stated, on the second day of June, 188-1, obtained a judgment by suit in the court of common pleas aforesaid against the said Walters for the sum of $366.12, and on the 7th day of June, 1881, issued out of said court a writ of fieri facias to October term, 1881, No. 1, by virtue of which writ the sheriff of the county on the same day levied upon the said billiard tables, balls, cues, cue racks, etc., with other goods, as the property of the said Walters; describing them in his levy as three pool tables.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">Fifth. The said the H. W. Oollender Company upon learning-of this levy served a written notice upon the said sheriff on the-11th day of June, 1881, through their attorney, Wm. F. Solly,, warning him that the said tables, billiard cues, cue racks, and all fixtures belonging to said tables were not the property of the said Walters, the defendant in the execution, but were the property of the said company. And this court, on the 7th day of July, 1881, granted a rule, upon the said company, as claimant of the property, to maintain or relinquish the claim pursuant to-the act of assembly passed the 10th day of April, 1818, which rule was made absolute on the same day and issue directed to-be raised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">If the court be of the opinion that tire billiard tables, balls, cues, cue racks, etc., being the goods above mentioned and levied upon as the property of the said A. P. Walters, were not owned by nor did not belong to him when levied upon, the judgment shall be entered in favor of the plaintiff, here the claimant, for the goods mentioned in the notice to the sheriff and included in the sheriff\u2019s levy; if the court be of the contrary opinion, then 'judgment shall be entered in favor of the defendants. The costs to follow the judgment, and either party reserves the right to. sue out a writ of error therein to the supreme court of Pennsylvania,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">Upon entering judgment for the plaintiff, Boyer, P. J., filed1 an opinion, in which, after stating the facts, he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-8\">If this were a case of the first impression, there might be some-doubt upon the question raised by the facts; but a series of decisions have settled the law upon the subject in Pennsylvania, and we have to apply them to reach a sure conclusion. It has. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>long ago been established that in this state goods may be delivered upon a loan or contract of hire without rendering them, while in the possession of the bailee, liable to levy and sale by his creditors; and it has been equally well settled that where goods are leased and delivered to the lessee under the lease, it may be coupled with an agreement that if at a future time the lessee should pay for them a stipulated price, they should become his; and this latter agreement will not destroy the relation of bailment in the meantime, or subject the property to levy by the creditors of the lessee. Such a bailment is distinguished from a conditional sale, which, although valid between the parties, does not protect the property in the hands of the vendee from tire execution of creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">In Myers v. Harvey, 2 Penr. &amp; W. 478, 23 Am. Dec. 60, a leading case, Chief Justice Gibson, speaking for the supreme court, says: \u201cSuch a transaction includes two distinct but consistent contracts, the one talcing effect, if at all, when the other is spent. The contract of bailment preserves the ownership of the bailor during the particular relation created by it; and the contract of sale which supersedes it transfers the title as soon as it is called into action by payment of the price.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">Clark v. Jack, 7 Watts, 375, followed, in which there was a loan of a library, subject to be turned into a sale by compliance with certain conditions; and it was held that this did not vest in the bailee such ownership as to subject the property to levy and sale upon an execution for his debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">In Chamberlain v. Smith, 44 Pa. 431, there was a hiring of a yoke of oxen for a year, to be returned with the privilege to pay a price named and keep them; held, a bailment and not a sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">In Rowe v. Sharp, 51 Pa. 26, Sharp, by writing, let to Goff two billiard tables for nine months, and Goff was to use them at his place of business, pay a certain sum for their use, and at the end of the term to redeliver them; and if then Goff had complied with the covenants of the agreement Sharp was to make him a bill of sale of the tables, the consideration for which was to be the sum paid for their use; this was held to be a bailment for the use of the tables during the term and protected the title to the property in the bailor. This was a case exactly parallel to the case at bar, except that in Rowe v. Sharp there had been a bill of sale drawn in the first instance, but the lease substituted afterwards and before delivery. Agnew, Justice, in delivering the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>of the supreme court, remarks: \u201cThat a sale of the billiard tables was contemplated in the lease between Sharp and Goff of the 16th of November, 1865, is manifest in the writing itself as well as from the other evidence in the cause; but it is the character of the sale which must determine when the title vested; the bill of sale of the 13th of November, 1865, was not signed, and before Sharp, the manufacturer, parted with his possession, he had a right to dictate the terms of its transfer.\u201d This principle has been since repeatedly recognized and the decision in Rowe v. Sharp affirmed. See Edwards\u2019s Appeal, 15 W. N. O. 22; Eorrest v. Nelson, 16 W. N. O. 275.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">The cases cited <em>contra </em>do not disturb Rowe v. Sharp. Price v. McCallister, 3 Grant Cas. 248, was a case in which the property was seized by the landlord under a distress for rent, and turned upon a different principle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">Brunswick &amp; B. Co. v. Hoover, 95 Pa. 508, 40 Am. Rep. 674, was a clear case of a conditional sale. And the case avowedly made for surety only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">In Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, 92 Pa. 55, 37 Am. Rep. 661, it was the same and the sale changed as such on vendor\u2019s books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">I am referred to a newspaper report of a case similar to this, decided in Vermont, in which these very plaintiffs were a party and decided against under a statute of that state in favor of an assignee in insolvency. But this of course cannot be of authority against the decisions of our supreme court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">It is insisted, however, that the payment of part cash and the giving of the thirteen negotiable promissory notes, covering all of the balance of the stipulated amount except $15, takes this case out of the ruling in Rowe v. Sharp and kindred cases. But in Myers v. Harvey, 2 Penr. &amp; W. 478, 23 Am. Dec. 60, there was a judgment note for the price, and Chief Justice Gibson answered the argument by saying: \u201cUndoubtedly, a vendor may take a bill or note on his own terms and consequently without binding himself to treat it as payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-10\">So in Chamberlain v. Smith, 44 Pa. 431, the whole hire was paid m advance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-11\">So also in Clark v. Jack, 7 \"Watts, 375, the bailor held a judgment note for the amount. Here there was a balance of $15 not covered by payments or note. Being therefore of opinion that the tables, balls, cues, cue racks, etc., mentioned in the case stated and levied upon as the property of said A. W. Walters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>were not owned by him when levied upon as his property, but were the property of the plaintiff in this suit,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-4\">Judgment is directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the goods mentioned in the notice to the sheriff and included in the sheriff\u2019s levy, with costs of suit, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">The assignment of error specified the action of the court in entering judgment upon the case stated in favor of plaintiff, and in not entering judgment in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-6\"><em>Henry A. Stevens, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5R\">\u2014 An agreement such as the one now in question, disguised under the mask of the word lease, is simply a contract of conditional sale. It is convincing proof that this transaction was understood between the parties to have been a sale; that the $60 paid in cash, on the 18th day of July, 1883, was in payment of the last two notes of the series, Nos. 14 and 15, making a total in cash paid $180. Brunswick &amp; B. Co. v. Hoover, 95 Pa. 508, 40 Am. Bep. 674; Forrest v. Nelson, 16 W. N. C. 275.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-7\">There is not a single element of bailment in this transaction; it is immaterial what the parties call it; the law pays little heed to the label; it looks beneath and examines the nature and character of the contract between the parties. Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, 92 Pa. 55, 37 Am. Bep. 661; Krause v. Com. 93 Pa. 418, 39 Am. Bep. 762.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-8\">The property on the 18th day of July, 1883, became vested in Walters, and the Collender company after that day had neither property nor interest in said tables, balls, cues, etc., against the execution creditors of said Walters, the said Collender company having delivered to Walters full possession, and Walters having at all times thereafter exercised over them, at his hotel, unlimited public control and ownership, and upon this showing-must have obtained credit. Martin v. Mathiot, 14 Serg. &amp; B. 214, 16 Am. Dec. 491; Brawn v. Keller, 43 Pa. 104, 82 Am. Dec. 554; Price v. McCallister, 3 Grant Cas. 248.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-9\">The acts and omissions of the Collender company subsequent to the 18th day of July, 1883, are further corroborative of the intention of sale; there has been no attempt at forfeiture (if such right ever existed); nor has there been any demand or motion of any kind to that effect. Axtell v. Caldwell, 24 Pa. 88 ; Munroe v. Armstrong, 96 Pa. 307.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The notice of the Collender company given to the sheriff under the interpleader act, claiming as it does the whole interest in said tables, balls, cues, etc., without notice of said payment of $180 made by said Walters, renders its pretended claim under said notice false, illegal, and an attempted fraud upon the innocent creditors of Walters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-4\">A claimant cannot set tip a limited interest after giving notice to the sheriff of an entire ownership; he should have given the sheriff notice of his true interest. Meyers v. Prentzell, 33 Pa. 482; Stewart, v. Wilson, 42 Pa. 450.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-5\"><em>Ii. K. Weand </em>and <em>William F. </em>Solly, for defendant in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqDi\">'The lease in this case is the exact lease in the formal parts as in the case of Powe v. Sharp, 51 Pa. 26, and decided by this \u25a0court to be a bailment for use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-6\">The contract is a valid one and can be enforced, even against creditors. Myers v. Harvey, 2 Penr. &amp; W. 479, 23 Am. Dec. \u202260; Clark v. Jack, 7 Watts, 375; Pose v. Story, 1 Pa. St. 191, 44 Am. Dec. 121; Vandyke v. Christ, 7 Watts &amp; S. 373; Henderson v.

Huntsman, 92 Pa. 53, 37 Am. Pep. 661 (that being a conditional sale), relied upon by the plaintiffs in error, points out with great force and clearness the distinction between a conditional sale and a bailment, and the line of cases beginning with Clow v. Woods, 5 Serg. &amp; P. 275, 9 Am. Dec. 346, and ending with Enlov? v. Klein, 79 Pa. 488, are consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>erect and commented upon; Rose v.

Hoover, 95 Pa. 508, 40 Am. Rep. 674, also relied upon by the plaintiffs in error, and Rowe v.
