Attorney General et al., Appts., <em>v. </em>John B. Reed et al.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b418-4\">Mt. Carmel, a borough incorporated, under the act of April 3, 1851, was laid out in accordance with a draft duly filed upon a tract of land through which a turnpike company, chartered under the act of March 25, 1805, was maintaining its line. .By ilie act of March 27, 1830, the' company was authorized to change the line in any borough to accommodate the citizens, and accordingly gave Mt. Carmel the privilege of making such a change. The streets of Mt. Carmel, as laid out in the draft, were dedicated, and as fast as they were completed the turnpike was abandoned and its site reoeeupied by the owners of the fee, until only a small part remained. By an agreement in 1806, the borough covenanted, in consideration of the privilege of changing the route, to keep the turnpike within its limits in repair. In 1882 citizens of Mt. Carmel petitioned the borough authorities to open a street which would cross the remaining portion of the turnpike at right angles; and it was authorized by them in 1884. Work was begun and resulted in obstructing the turnpike by the street, which was at a grade six feet higher than the turnpike. Whereupon the Commonwealth e* <em>rel. </em>the Attorney General and certain citizens of Mt. Carmel, filed a bill for an injunction to restrain the borough authorities from so obstructing the turnpike, alleging that proceedings under the act of April 22, 1856, in the quarter sessions were prerequisite and that the defendants had no right in opening a street to obstruct another public highway. <em>Held, </em>that an injunction would not bo granted, although perhaps the remaining portion of the turnpike should have been first vacated by ordinance of the council, as provided in the act under which the borough was incorporated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AEY\">Note. \u2014 Streets may be vacated when laid out by the borough (Com. v.

Carmel, from obstructing a road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\">The facts as they appeared before E. W. Greenough, Esq., the master appointed by the court below, were stated in his report, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">The Centre Turnpike Road running from the city of Reading, Pennsylvania, to Sunbury, in the same state, was laid out and opened by the Centre Turnpike Road Company under and by virtue of a charter granted by the commonwealth, by act of assembly of March 25, 1S05, and supplements of April 4, 1807, and March 27, 1830. In its route it passed over the site of the present borough of Mt. Carmel which was incorporated by the court of quarter sessions of Northumberland county, Pennsylvania, November 3, 1862, under the act of April 3, 1851, entitled \u201cAn Act Regulating Boroughs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">The general course and direction of the said turnpike across the said borough of Mt. Carmel was from southeast to northwest ; crossing the streets and lots as marked and laid out on the general map or plan of said borough, diagonally. The act of March 27, 1830, above mentioned, by the terms of the first, section thereof empowered the said turnpike company \u201cto alter the course of its road at or near any borough, town, or village which has been or may be laid out adjoining said road, so as in the best manner to accommodate the inhabitants of said borough, town, or village, and the citizens generally;\u201d and by the second section of the said act of March 27, 1830, it was provided that \u201cso much of the present road as may be vacated and rendered useless, by any alteration in the course thereof, which may be made in pursuance of this act, shall revert to the original owners of the land,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\">In pursuance, therefore, of the provisions of this act the officers of the said turnpike company gave to the borough of Mt. Carmel \u201cprivilege\u201d to alter the course of said turnpike road, and on the 27th day of September, 1866, the corporate officers of the said borough signed the following agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-8\">\u201cIn consideration of the privilege granted by the Centre Turnpike Road Company to the borough of Mt. Carmel to alter the route of the turnpike road through the said borough of Mt. Carmel, we, the burgess and town council, in behalf of the said borough of Mt. Carmel, having completed the new road, do hereby agree to hereafter and forever keep the said road and bridges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>through tbe said borough in good order and repair at the proper expense of the said borough of Mt. Carmel; signed by five members of the town council, the chief burgess, and the secretary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-4\">By the evidence it appears that the said turnpike road was disused and abandoned by the public, as the streets of the said borough were opened and put in condition for use, and as the road became abandoned its site was occupied by the owners of the fee, and buildings were erected upon some of the several portions of the turnpike where it fell within lot lines; hence, it is found that from the time of entering into this said agreement, down to about the time of beginning the action, all of the said turnpike road lying within the limits of the said borough was abandoned, and tbe streets of tbe said borough used by the public in place thereof, except a small portion extending from the junction of Maple street and Mt. Carmel avenue in a northwesterly direction to tbe northern line of the said borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">Mt. Carmel avenue runs east and west; Vine street, another of the public highways of said borough, runs north and south. Along the northern edge of Mt. Carmel avenue is a steep declivity, descending to the bed of Shamokin creek. In consequence of this declivity none of the streets of said borough running north and south were opened and graded for use, north of the line of Mt. Carmel avenue and south of Shamokin creek. The reason was that the expense necessary to be incurred would be very great.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">\u25a0 In 1882, certain citizens of the said borough presented a petition to the town council, asking that Vine street, one. of the streets of said borough, should be opened to the northern line of the borough; and on August 11, 1882, by resolution of council it was decided to open and complete said street. No action, however, was taken at the time towards completing said Vine street; and it was not until 1884 that the matter was again taken up by council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">On May 5, 1884, tbe borough council, by resolution, instructed the street committee to have a. survey made for tbe purpose of ascertaining the grade. lip to this time a portion of Vine street lying south of the line of Mt. Carmel avenue was opened and used by tbe public. The balance of said Vine street extending from the north side of Mt. Carmel avenue, north, to the northern line of the borough, existed only on paper, being so laid out on the original map or plan of said borough. In completing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Vine street, according to the grade fixed by the borough surveyor, it was necessary to cut down below the existing grade of the street from a point south of the line of Mt. Carmel avenue across said avenue and some distance beyond, altogether about 200 feet. At this point the line of the turnpike road was reached, running nearly at right angles to Vine street. The grade of the turnpike was, however, below the grade of said Vine street, at their point of intersection; and an earth and stone filling -was made across tire said turnpike road, about 50 feet wide and of ah average height of 5% to 6 feet. Beyond the turnpike the earth filling continued the same width to the south bank of the Shamokin creek, which was crossed by a bridge 16 or 1Y feet wide inside the railings. Beyond the bridge the said street was filled to a width of about 50 feet to Bailroad avenue, the northern limits of said borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">This action grows out of the fact that the grading of said Vine street, across the said Centre Turnpike Boad, naturally and necessarily so obstructed the latter as to render it impassable. The embankment across the turnpike is 6 or Y feet high on the lower or west side of Vine street and 5 or 6 feet on the upper or east side. The prayer of the complainants is that the respondents be restrained \u201cfrom obstructing the public road or highway commonly called the Centre turnpike, from its intersection with Mt. Carmel avenue and Maple street to the northern limits of the borough of Mt. Carmel,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">The said turnpike afforded to the inhabitants of the said borough and of the township north thereof the only means of intercommunication until the completion of Vine street aforesaid. By means of said Vine street (as completed) and Bailroad avenue, connection with the turnpike north of the borough is now established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">On August 1, 1884, certain of the citizens of said borough filed a bill praying for a special injunction, and on August 6 the court made a decree granting said preliminary injunction; and on the same day the coiirt granted a further rule on complainants to show cause wby the special injunction should not be dissolved, because the attorney general had not been made a party to the complaint. Said rule was argued and held under advisement by the court. Complainants, after notice to respondents, laid the matter before the attorney general, asking him to intervene. Said attorney general, concluding that the case was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>proper one for his intervention, applied to the court January 28, 1885, for leave to intervene and asked for a rule on respondents to show cause why prayer should not be granted and the record amended accordingly. February 2, after hearing, rule was made absolute, and the record amended by the addition of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania <em>ex relatione </em>Lewis C. Cassidy, Attorney General.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-4\">December 30, 1884, however, the court had made absolute the rule of August 6, 1884, dissolving the special injunction \u201cwithout prejudice to either party,\u201d for the reason that the attorney general was not a party. Immediately upon the dissolution of the special injunction the respondents proceeded in their work of completing said Vine street, and in doing so rendered the said turnpike impassable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">The questions arising here are: Had the respondents a right to open said Vine street? And did they proceed in the manner prescribed by law ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">If they had the right and proceeded in the prescribed manner, then the court has not power to enjoin them. Among the powei*s vested in the corporate officers of a borough is the power to \u201csurvey, lay out, enact, and ordain such roads, streets, lanes, alleys, courts, and common sewers as they may deem necessary, and to provide for, enact, and ordain the widening and straightening of Lie same.\u201d Purdon\u2019s Digest, p. 203, \u00a7 49, being part of act of April 3, 1851, under which said borough was incorporated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">The borough of Mt. Carmel aforesaid was incorporated by the court of quarter sessions of Northumberland county, November 3, 1862, under the above-mentioned act of assembly, and a map or plan of the said borough was recorded in the office for the recording of deeds of the said county in Deed Book S. S. p. 582. Among the streets of said borough as they appear by the said map or plan is Vine street aforesaid. By decree of the court incorporating said borough, Vine street was therefore declared to be a public highway, not only for a portion of its length, but in entirety. It happens, however, that for certain reasons it was not necessary or expedient to open the said Vine street its entire length at the same time, and therefore a portion of it remained disused for a period of some years after another portion thereof was opened and used by the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\">In the case of Ake v. Mason, 101 Pa. II, the court says-; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201c\"Where a plan for laying out a street is confirmed by tbe proper court, tbe public record of sucb proceeding is notice of tbe location of tbe street to purchasers of land which will be crossed by it when opened.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\">It is in evidence that said Yine street is named as the boundary in conveyances of land lying along tbe line of that part of said street opened about tbe time of and after tbe institution of these proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">Tbe complainants maintain that tbe action of tbe respondents in opening said Yine street without having made application to tbe court of quarter sessions, for tbe appointment of viewers, as provided for in tbe act of April 22, 1856 (a supplement to tbe act of April 3, 1851), (Purdon\u2019s Digest, \u00a7\u00a7 141, 142, p. 212), was without warrant of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">The first section of said act of 1856 is as follows: \u201cWhenever tbe burgesses and town council of any borough shall open, or be about to open, any streets or alleys therein, or to widen or extend tbe same, it shall be lawful for said burgesses and council, or a majority of them, to apply by petition to tbe court of quarter sessions of tbe peace of the proper county, setting forth the facts and describing the locality of sucb streets or alleys, and praying said court to appoint seven disinterested freeholders of sucb borough, who, after being first duly sworn or affirmed to perform their duties under this act with impartiality and fidelity, shall proceed to view the premises described in said petition, having regard to advantages and disadvantages caused to tbe several properties along tbe line of and adjoining said streets .and alleys, and shall assess and allow to all persons injured thereby sucb damages as they shall have sustained respectively over and above all advantages, and shall also make assessment for contribution upon all sucb properties as shall be benefited by tbe opening, widening, or extension of said streets and alleys, sucb sums respectively as they may have been benefited over and .above all disadvantages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">Second section of said act of 1856: \u201cTbe said viewers shall make report of their proceedings in writing to the next session of said court, describing tbe properties upon which assessments have been made, specifically stating whether for contribution or for damages, with tbe amounts respectively, and the said court may at the next session thereafter, or at any subsequent session, on the hearing of such parties as choose to contest the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>modify, approve, and confirm the said report, which confirmation shall be final and conclusive upon all parties; and the said burgesses and council may proceed to collect all such damages and assessments for contribution in the same manner as other debts dire such boroughs are by law collectible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">The said Vine street, however, had already been declared a public highway by decree of the court of quarter sessions at the time of the incorporation of the borough. By the recording of the map or plan of said borough, notice was given of the location of its several public highways, among which was Vine street aforesaid. Moreover, a portion of said Vine street was in use as a public highway for a long period of time prior to the commencement of these proceedings. But the public did not see fit to use said Vine street all of its entire length, immediately upon its dedication as a public highway. From this fact, however, it cannot be presumed that an abandonment by the public of its right ever to use said Vine street as a public highway was intended. In opening said Vine street, therefore, the said respondents, the corporate officers of the said borough, were opening a street already laid out on the map or plan of the borough, a street already, by decree of court, a public highway, not used by the public as a highway because the natural conditions of the soil over which the route of the said street passed, rendered such use impossible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">The act of 1856 provides a way for opening streets and alleys where damages \u201cto properties along the line of and adjoining said streets and alleys\u201d occur. Prior to the passage of this act, parties injured petitioned the court for a jury of six to view and assess damages arising from the opening of the public highway; but the owners of the several properties along the line of and adjoining said Vine street, do not appear, complaining of damages to their said properties, and there is no evidence to show that tire said owners object to the opening of the said street. But the attorney general and certain citizens of the said borough of Mt. Carmel come and ask the court to restrain the said respondents, because in opening said Vine street they have obstructed \u201canother public highway,\u201d to wit, the said Centre turnpike. \u201cWhen a highway, which has once been the bed of an artificial road belonging to a turnpike company, comes by law within the control of the corporate authorities of a city, they are not bound to keep it in repair as an artificial highway, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>merely so that it may </em>be safe and convenient for ordinary travel.\u201d Com. <em>ex rel. </em>Atty. Gen. v. Philadelphia, 11 W. N. O. 485.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-3\">If the Centre Turnpike Road bo not vacated in a proper and legal manner, the corporate officers of the borough of Mt. Carmel may be under obligation to keep it in repair \u201cso that it may be safe and convenient for ordinary travel.\u201d But in the master\u2019s opinion it would be improper to enjoin the respondents from obstructing the said turnpike by the opening of said Vine street, for the natural and necessary effect of that would be to render impassable said Vine street, which is also a public highway, and more properly one of the highways of said borough than the said turnpike is, because it is laid out upon the map or plan of the borough as such, but the turnpike does not so appear. The decree of the court, incorporating said borough gives the corporate officers official authority to open the highways thereof. Wilkes-Barre\u2019s Appeal, 100 Pa. 313.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">As before stated, the filling and grading said Vine street across the turnpike is about 6 feet high and the turnpike at the point of intersection is II to 19 feet wide. It is clear, therefore, that the removal of this filling would effectually prevent the use of Vine street, and it would seem hardly consistent in the. court to prevent the corporate officers of a borough from opening the public highways of the same, because the proper completion and grading of a certain street or alley would obstruct another highway in the said borough, and one, too, not laid down upon the general map or plan of the same. But at the same time it might be both consistent and proper for the court to compel the corporate officers to so restore and put in repair the highway thus obstructed that it might again become safe and convenient for travel. And just here arises the question whether the said turnpike, to wit, the portion thereof lying within the limits of the said borough, and now in dispute, was a public highway at the time of its obstruction in the manner aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">Referring again to the act of 1830, which was a supplement to the act of 1805, incorporating the said Centre Turnpike Company, it appears that powers were conferred upon the said turnpike company by the legislature to alter the route of tire turn\u2019 pike road at or near any city, borough, or village so as best to accommodate the inhabitants thereof, and the citizens generally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In the case of the said borough of Mt. Carmel just such a contingency arises as this act was intended to make provision for. By the arrangement of the streets, lots, etc., of the said borough, it was deemed to the best interests of the citizens thereof and the citizens generally that the route of the turnpike through the said borough should be abandoned and the public highways thereof, as laid out on the map or plan of the same, substituted therefor; hence, as before stated, the turnpike was so abandoned, as the streets of the borough were put in such repair that they could be used in place thereof, the corporate officers bearing the expense of maintaining the turnpike until the other highways were ready for use; and it appears also by the evidence that as fast as the turnpike became disused the portion thereof falling within the lot lines were fenced up, built upon, and in one way and another taken possession of by the owners of the fee in just such manner as the act of 1830 aforesaid, by its second section, provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\">The said turnpike, therefore, was vacated and abandoned from the southeastern part of said borough northwest to the intersection of Mt. Carmel avenue and Maple street aforesaid, by the operation of this act of IS30 and by the agreement of the corporate officers of said borough (with the officers of said turnpike company) to substitute other public highways in place of the said turnpike road, and by the actual carrying into effect of the terms of said agreement, no other proceedings to vacate said turnpike within the limits of said borough having ever been established, nor were any necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">The act of 1830 aforesaid provided for the vacation of the \u25a0said turnpike within the limits of boroughs, etc., and general acts providing for the vacating of roads subsequently passed need not necessarily conflict with or repeal said act of 1830. For \u201cif there be two affirmative statutes on the same subject, there must be a clear inconsistency or repugnancy that the later one may repeal the former.\u201d <em>Be </em>Somerset &amp; S. Hoad, <em>74 </em>Pa. 61.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">This substitution of one highway for another was not completed at once, however, but gradually, and piece by piece. For a long time, moreover, the corporate officers of the borough had ceased to substitute streets in place and lieu of said turnpike, for the reason that there remains thereof but the small portion from the intersection of Mt. Carmel avenue and Maple street to the northern limits of the borough; and as before stated, the expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>and difficulty of completing Vine street or any of the streets running north across Mt. Carmel avenue and across Shamokin creek to the north bank thereof, naturally deprived the corporate officers from entering upon any such undertaking as long as it could be avoided, and as the said turnpike, <em>viz., </em>the portion above referred to, afforded and approached to the northern limits of the borough and the turnpike beyond, the completion of the streets of the borough designed to take its place was naturally deferred as long as possible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-4\">At last, however, in 1882, as before stated, certain citizens of said borough petitioned for the opening and completion of the balance of Vine street, and the borough council resolved to do so. The work, however, was still delayed; and it was not until 1884 that measures were taken to bring the undertaking to a conclusion, and then the borough council, proceeding in just the same manner as their predecessors had done in similar contingencies, open, grade, and fully complete said Vine street in such manner that it can be substituted for and take the place of the only portion of said turnpike not yet abandoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">By reference to the agreement between the officers of the turnpike company and the officers of the said borough, it does not appear that it was proposed or intended to substitute the streets and alleys of said borough in place of only a part of the turnpike within the borough limits; but on the contrary it is clear that the turnpike company proposed to turn over to the borough all of the turnpike lying within the boundaries thereof; and on the part of the borough officers it is equally manifest that they on their part intended and proposed to maintain and keep in repair all of the turnpike in the borough until they had completed the streets and alleys of the borough and substituted them for the turnpike. Nor is there any ground for presumption that either party to this ageement contemplated the maintenance of the turnpike beyond the time when, by the completion of the streets, etc., of the said borough, it ceased to be a necessity to the public. In compliance with the said agreement the corporate officers continued to maintain and keep in repair the small portion of the turnpike now in dispute, down to about the time they were ready to replace it with Vine street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">In the opinion of the master the completion of Vine street, in manner aforesaid, in accordance with the agreement above mentioned, under the terms and provisions of the act of 1830 de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>tailed above, simply completes the act of vacating and abandoning the said turnpike within the borough limits, in the manner provided for and pointed out by the law governing this case; and he is of the further opinion that the said turnpike, to wit, the portion here in question, ceased to be a public highway, as soon as the corporate officers of the borough performed their part of the agreement in substituting the new road in place thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-4\">In view of the facts of the case and the law governing the same, as interpreted by tire master, he would respectfully recommend that a decree be entered as follows, to wit, that the bill be dismissed and the complainants pay all the costs and fees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">Several exceptions to the master\u2019s report were filed by the plaintiffs; upon dismissing the exceptions and confirming the report Rockefeller, P. J., March 22, 1886, delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">I refer to what I have already said in this case in two former opinions, filed August 6, 1884, and December 30, 1884, respectively, especially t\u00f3 those parts of said opinions relating to the merits of the case. The authority of the town council of the borough of Mt. Carmel to open Vine street cannot be denied. In the case of Sower v. Philadelphia, 35 Pa. 231, cited' by Chief Justice Mercur, in the case of Ake v. Mason, 101 Pa. 21, it was held that a resolution of councils directing the opening of a street laid down in the general plan of the town has the same force as an ordinance for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">No lot or land owner is questioning the right of the borough in the present case to open the street without first paying or securing to be paid the damages that they have or may sustain. Indeed, the conveyances of lots bounding thereon describe the street as a boundary. The complainants do not question or dispute this right, as appears by thoir ninth exception to the master\u2019s report. As was shown and admitted on the former hearings of this case, and as I will presently show by the facts in evidence before the master, that portion or part of the turnpike road extending from the junction of Maple street and Mt. Carmel avenue to the northern line of the borough was never vacated, and remains a public highway today; so that the only or at least the principal question to be determined in the case is whether the town council of a borough have the right to open a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>street laid down in the general plan of the town if, in doing so, it will necessarily and unavoidably close up and obstruct another highway not laid down in the town plan, but which has become a highway by having been the bed of an artificial road belonging to a turnpike company and on being abandoned by the company became a public road under the general laws of the state. That the corporate officers of the borough are under obligations to keep that part of the turnpike road within the borough limits and not vacated in repair, so that it may be safe and convenient for ordinary travel, is clearly shown in the case of Oom. <em>ex rel. </em>Atty. Gen. v. Philadelphia, 11 W. N. O. 485.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-4\">In the master\u2019s opinion it would be improper to enjoin the respondents from obstructing the turnpike by the opening of Vine street, for the reason that the natural and necessary effect of that \u25a0would be to render impassable said Vine street, which is also .a public highway and more properly one of the highways of the borough than the turnpike, because it is laid out upon the map \u25a0or plan of the borough as such and the turnpike does not so appear. \"Whether this is a correct opinion or not is the vital question in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">[I agree with him that it might be both consistent and proper for the courts to compel the corporate officers to restore and put in repair the highway thus obstructed that it might .again become safe and convenient for travel, if that were reasonably practicable. But, as I understand the evidence, it is not reasonably practicable so to do. This, however, may be a matter for future investigation.] If it can be done, the case \u25a0of Oom. <em>ex rel. </em>Atty. Gen. v. Philadelphia, 11 W. N. O. 485, is authority on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">As to whether that part of the turnpike in dispute has ever been vacated, I think the case is clear. The act of March 27, 1830, authorized the turnpike company to alter the course of its road at on near any borough, town, or village which has been \u25a0or may be laid out adjoining said road so as in the best manner to accommodate the inhabitants of said borough, town, or village, \u25a0and the citizens generally. It is manifest from the evidence that prior to the 27th of September, 1886, the turnpike company had given the borough of Mt. Carmel the privilege to alter the route of the turnpike through the borough, and that on or previous to that day the borough had completed a new road by tire opening of Oak street and perhaps other streets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>which the company used instead of the bed or route of the old road; and the corporate officers of the borough on that day agreed in writing with the turnpike company to thereafter \u201cand forever keep the said road and bridges through the said borough in good order and repair at the proper expense of the said borough of Mt. Carmel.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-4\">The master finds \u201cthat from the time of entering into this said agreement down to about the time of the beginning of this action (August 1, 1884) all of the said turnpike road lying within the limits of the said borough was abandoned and the streets of said borough used by the public in place thereof, except a small portion extending from the junction of Maple street and Mt. Carmel avenue in the northerly direction to the northern line of said borough.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">It is this latter part of the turnpike that this dispute is about, and it is this that Richard Carnow, the' chief burgess of the borough in 1866, testifies that the \u201cagreement was entered into to keep the road from the railroad up to this street (Maple street) in repair.\u201d There was a bridge on that part of the road, and we think this explains the agreement. The master says: \u201cNo other proceedings to vacate said turnpike within the limits of said borough having ever been instituted, nor were any necessary.\u201d Certainly, there were none prior to the filing of the bill in this case, and no legal proceedings since that I know of. The master says \u201cthat in compliance with said agreement the corporate officers continued to maintain and keep in repair the small portion of the turnpike now in dispute, down to about the time they were ready to replace it with Vine street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">That was from the date of the agreement in writing, September 27, 1866, to the summer of 1884. He refers to the act of 1830 and the said agreement, and what was done under it, and concludes that all that \u201csimply completed the act of vacating and abandoning the turnpike within the borough limits, in the manner provided for and pointed out by the law governing this case; and he is of the further opinion that the said turnpike, to wit, the portion here in question, ceased to be a public highway as soon as the corporate officers of the borough performed their part of the agreement in substituting the new road in place thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">This part of the finding of the master, in my opinion, is erroneous. The agreement of September 27, 1866, completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the act. It is clear from the agreement itself that the alteration in the route of the turnpike, through the borough, had been made prior to the execution thereof, and that the said agreement neither contemplated nor permitted any subsequent alteration of the route. This was the understanding of all parties. The corporate authorities so understood it and acted upon it accordingly. In my opinion there can be no doubt whatever that the turnpike was only abandoned by the turnpike company and the new roads or streets of the borough accepted as a substitute therefor from the eastern limits of the borough as far as the junction of Maple street and. Mt. Carmel avenue, and no farther; and that part thereof from that point to the northern line of the borough (the part in dispute) remains a public highway, the same never having been vacated according to law. I am informed that it is the desire of the parties to take this case to the supreme court at once, that the question may be settled, and in order that they may do so at the present term I have proceeded without delay to decide it. I have determined it in accordance with the law and the facts as I believe them to be, and I think the question is fairly raised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">[The only important question in the case is whether the corporate authorities of a borough, in opening a street laid down on the plan of the town, can do so if the opening of such street will naturally and unavoidably close up and obstruct another public highway not existing on the said plan but running across it through lots aud lawns, and which had become a highway in the manner stated in this opinion and the auditor\u2019s report, without in some legal way first causing the same to be vacated. Considering that the general borough laws, under which this borough was incorporated, give to the corporate officers such ample and general powers \u201cto survey, lay out, enact, and ordain such roads, streets, etc., as they may deem necessary, and to provide for, enact, and ordain the widening and straightening of tire same,\u201d and that the supreme court has decided that this pov'er extends to vacation of streets, alleys, etc., I have come to the conclusion not to interfere, although I am bv no means certain that this is a correct determination. It is very questionable in my mind whether the existing highway ought not to be first vacated by resolution or ordinance, and councils not permitted to exercise the right to open other streets until this is done.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>[That the municipal authorities alone have power to vacate a street in an incorporated borough was decided in the case of <em>Be </em>Osage Street, 90 Pa. 114.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\">This was done in the present case, by an ordinance passed after the institution of proceedings, but.not until the court had dissolved the special injunction. Was the act of opening Vine street and thus necessarily closing the turnpike a legal vacation of the turnpike? The opening of that street was for the purpose, as we understand it, of making a street or highway to take the place of the turnpike and to be used instead thereof, as the evidence shows that it will be impossible to make the old turnpike fit for ordinary and convenient use as a highway if Vine street is to be kept open. I presume the question is more a matter of costs than anything else.] The turnpike will doubtless have to be abandoned. However, with that question we have nothing to do at present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">The question of costs must be disposed of. Many of the citizens of the borough, finding the old turnpike a safe, easy, and convenient approach to that part of the town, both from the adjacent township and the railroad station, saw that the borough authorities were about to destroy it by the opening of Vine street, and with the Attorney General instituted these proceedings to prevent it. The grade was easier and there was safety at the railroad. As Vine street is opened it is now necessary to pass along a narrow roadway on either side of the railroad track to get to either the old turnpike or railroad station, which is a serious matter; and there is perhaps not much wonder that the complainants remonstrated. There was no resolution or action by the town council at the time the bill was filed, vacating the turnpike; but the closing up of the same was threatened as the work of opening Vine street showed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">These proceedings have been carried on with much feeling on both sides, and an indictment is pending in the court of quarter sessions.

The power thus conferred upon the council is to be construed strictly; and until they clothe someone with the authority to open, widen, straighten, grade, or close a road or street, by legal resolution or ordinance, no authority to act in the execution of such plans exists, and anything done under pretense of such authority is an unwarranted assumption of public duties that will not be tolerated by the court.
