It was shown that both the old and the new boards had rubbish on them. These men were working on a temporary platform composed of loose boards laid on the joists, and could not see anyone beloiv them. It Avas further sIioaaui that at about 9.30 a. m. Somer Avas ordered by General Superintendent Carstens to report to the foreman of the machinists, Avho- sent him to the fourth floor to drill holes in iron plates, to do which he Avas obliged to sit astride an iron girder, and could not, without danger of falling off, look up. While they were thus working, Alfred Harrison, one of the defendants, and General Superintendent Carstens came up the ladder, which was about 8 feet from where Somer was working, and stopped and saw him there. Harrison went on up to the eighth floor, and saw the gang of men at their work there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">It Avas also shoAvn that Harrison went through the building each day, and that he directed and ordered the men. -While the parties were thus situated a brick fell from the eighth floor, where the men were working, and struck Somer on the head and seriously injured him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendants moved for a compulsory nonsuit, which the trial judge granted, delivering at the same time the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">I think we start Avith the proposition that it is received law that an injury caused by a fellow Avorkman, and not done by direction of the master, even if done negligently by the fellow workman, does not make the master responsible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">In order in certain cases to fix the responsibility upon the master it is said, where the character of the fellow workman is that of a general superintendent, so that in some sense he assumes the position of the master and has the control which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>master has, that there the master is liable by reason of this general control having been imparted to the superintendent, and in some sense making him thus responsible, as though it were the act of the master or employer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-3\">But I think a little confusion has been introduced into the cases by the use of some language, as, for instance, where it is said that the general superintendent or master workman, whoever he is, has the right of employment of the workmen, as illustrating that he is armed with the same power as the employer. I think that class of cases, so far as I understand them, is properly limited to something done directly by the superintendent or master workman which leads consequentially and naturally to the injury indicted. The mere fact of the employment of workmen is no higher act than would be that of the master himself. If they were employed by the master, it would not make the master responsible for an injury consequent to a fellow workman; and the illustration of employment is only put in connection with some other act as showing the authority of the superintendent, or master workman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-4\">In this case I do not think the evidence shows that it was brought to the attention of either the superintendent or of Mr. Harrison that this man was in a dangerous position. The work that was done up above was of a general character. I suppose, in removing this planking, whatever it was, it was done first at one point and then at another point; and if anything fell, it was heard at various positions over the building; and there is nothing to indicate that anything had fallen previously immediately over this man and his fellow workman who was with him. He appears to have been placed there by this fellow workman, who wanted somebody to assist him, and who had no power at all other than being permitted to take the man with him and to occupy the position which he did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">It appears also that the space was open at the top, so that they could see from the position where they were to the top of the building, and nothing to indicate that there was likely to be anything to happen at that position in the way of danger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">Nor is it satisfactorily and clearly shown how the accident happened. If there was nothing above, there was nothing to fall perpendicularly upon the head of this man. It is possible, by placing a board, if it were in a certain position, that it might get an impetus and a graded fall that would possibly reach to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>this man; but even that is not shown. It is not shown from what direction this brick came. Whether there were bricklayers immediately above tire plaintiff is not shown by the evidence, although it is stated that bricklayers were employed there. It does not follow that this brick might not have been thrown from some position and fallen upon this man. If, for instance, there was a brick in the way in handling a plank, or anything of the kind, a workman might negligently pick it up and give it a \u2022cast from him. This could scarcely be anticipated by an employer or by a superintendent. Therefore, in addition to what I consider the general law on the subject, that this accident appears to have been the result of negligence of the fellow workman, there is the uncertainty as to how it happened at all, which I think ought to have been more clearly pointed out before the jury can be asked to say that there was a responsibility for it. It would be in some sense guessing into a verdict to make the \u2022employer responsible under these circumstances. I therefore .grant the motion for a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-4\">Subsequently the court on motion refused to take off the non-suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">The assignments of error specified the entry of the nonsuit \u25a0and the refusal to take it off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-6\"><em>John T.
