The times are so hard that it is impossible to raise money; and hoping and believing that the coming season will brighten matters up, I would like to renew the note for a year, paying interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent. I have had to pay a great deal for George, but I want to give him another chance to redeem himself, and put him on a solid basis.

Liszman, dated Carlisle, Pa., February 25, 1884, for the payment of $450, twelve months after date, to the order of Kossuth Marx &amp; Co. at the Carlisle Deposit Bank, and signed at the bottom by George H. Liszman, and on the back by Philip Liszman, to be followed by evidence that the signing by Philip Liszman on the back of the note was with the intention and with the understanding that he was the surety of George H. Liszman for the payment of this note to the payee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-10\">Objected to, because on the production of the note it appears that it is not the note of George Liszman and Philip Liszman. It is the note of George Liszman to the order of Kossuth Marx &amp; Co. The name of Philip Liszman is written on the back of it above that of Kossuth Marx &amp; Co. It is therefore not his note, nor is he in any way liable for it. The understanding of the parties cannot be shown outside of that paper; the contract of suretyship must rise on the paper on which they bring suit, and which is now offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: We add to our offer, in further explanation or qualification of it, that the evidence, which we propose to show, that Philip Liszman signed the note as surety for George H. Liszman, is in writing, which said writing is offered in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-13\">Defendant\u2019s counsel: The paper offered in evidence with the note does not better the offer. It does not alter the character of the note nor create any liability which does not appear upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the face of the papei* on'which they base their suit. It is irrelevant and immaterial. There is nothing in the offer to charge the defendant or make him liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: We also propose to show that the note was given for a debt owing by George H. Liszman. That the settlement was made through the father, Philip Liszman, ana the compromise made through him, and that it was the understanding and agreement before the note was signed that' he was to sign it as surety for George H. Liszman, his son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">Objected to, that it is not sufficient to take it out of the statute of frauds, nor to make this note a legal obligation on the part of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\">By the Court: It will be for the jury to say whether the letter of Liszman of the Ith of February, 1885, refers to the note signed by George Liszman and indorsed by himself, dated February 25, 1884. The offer of the plaintiffs is admitted. (Note and letter read to the jury.) (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-9\">The court charged the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-10\">On the note, as it appears, there would be no legal liability on the part of the defendant; but we have admitted a letter written by Philip Liszman to the former, and written in February, 1885, which (if you find it was written in reference to the note in suit) would give such acknowledgment of the circumstances under which he signed the note as would justify you in finding him liable on the note.

Nor does the letter of February <em>1 </em>identify the note as to date or amount, nor does it contain a promise to pay, as in Eilbert v. Finkbeiner, 68 Pa. 243, 8 Am.
