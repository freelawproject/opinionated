There are no writings in evidence, so far as the printed testimony shows, except the deed and bond; and certainly these are not changed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-7\">The whole contention from the beginning has been that the church debt wTas not embraced in any writing or agreement between the plaintiff and defendant. Our allegation is that it is just as good as if it had been, but it required the verdict of a jury to find out that it was the arrangement and agreement between the parties on the 20th of December, 1878, that Day should pay the church debt, and with that understanding and inducement Osborn executed the papers between them upon his part, whatever they were.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-8\">It is not trae that any paper then and there executed was in any way enlarged, varied, or altered. Osborn sues upon his mortgage. Day says, \u201cYou owe me the amount of this church judgment.\u201d Osborn replies, \u201cYou agreed with me if I would execute a deed to you for my farm, and convey to you certain personal property, on the 20th day of December, 1878, you would pay the church debt for me \u2014 my debt \u2014 upon which that church judgment is based.\u201d There was no paper given in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>deuce either contradicted or varied. The only rule of law which the testimony any way acted upon was the rule that when parties make agreements in writing, the presumption is that they put everything pertaining to the subject-matter in the written agreements, but this is only a presumption. In Phillips v. IVIeily, 106 Pa. 537, the defendant by his own testimony undertook to defeat a recovery upon a promissory note for $3,000 made by himself, simply by his \u201cunsupported oath which was contradicted by the plaintiff\u2019s oath, and the persuasive evidence furnished by the note itself.\u201d That was a different case from this. Here no writing is violated; there one was wiped out \u201cto contradict or vary written instruments unless there has been fraud, accident, or mistake in the creation of the instrument itself,\u201d or \u201cunless there has been an attempt to make a fraudulent use of the instrument in violation of a promise or agreement made at the time the instrument was signed, and without which it would not have been executed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-4\">In both the cases cited from 103 Pa. 177, and 507, it is said: \u201cParol evidence is admissible to show a verbal contemporaneous agreement which induced the execution of a written obligation though it may change the terms of the written contract,\u201d and in Greenawalt v. ICobne, 85 Pa. 369, it was held that \u201cit would be an affectation of learning to cite all the cases which establish this principle.\u201d Again, we assert that the testimony complained of by the plaintiff in error varied or altered no writing between the parties. The writings, whatever they were, remain as when they were written. See Woods v. Russell, 1 Sad. Rep. \u00e9l.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-5\">In every case cited by the plaintiff in error the attempt was made to overthrow, enlarge, vary, or alter the instrument in suit by parol. This is not our case at all. But treating it as the counsel for the plaintiff in error treats the matter, we say then there was testimony to submit to the jury, and it was properly submitted by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-6\">To overthrow a written contract it is necessary that the parol evidence be clear, precise, and satisfactory. Juries must not hesitate or doubt; they must have clear convictions; they must believe the witnesses, and find the fact in issue definitely and distinctly established. Absolute certainty is out of the question, where facts are to be found from oral testimony and circumstances. Spencer v. Colt, 89 Pa. 31\u00e9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\">The law does not require proof so convincing as to leave no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>doubt resting on tbe minds of the jurors; it is enough if there be evidence to satisfy an unprejudiced mind, beyond a reasonable doubt. Young v. Edwards, 72 Pa. 257.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-4\">The degree of weight to be given to the testimony of each witness is for the jury, and not for the court. Ott v. Oyer, 106 Pa. 6.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AOl\">Me. Justice Trunkey:</author>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">At the time the deed, bond, and mortgage were executed, the parties made a written statement showing what debts Day should pay, as part of the consideration of the deed. The chief contention now is whether it was orally agreed that Day should pay another debt, called the church debt, amounting to over $1,-000, which induced the plaintiff to sign the deed and statement. Both parties agree that no such oral contract was made in the hearing of anybody else, and that the defendant refused to pay that debt so far as their attorneys and other persons had knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Mr. Hutchinson, who was Osborn\u2019s attorney, testifies that Day positively refused to pay the church debt; that it was not included in the writings; that he was very much shocked when Osborn gave way, and he then said to Osborn: \u201cI wipe my hands of this matter,\u201d and told him he \u201cwould have nothing more to do with him; that he ought to make provision for the church debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Osborn testifies that in a private conversation, shortly before the signing of the papers, the defendant promised to pay that debt. Hutchinson says he saw Osborn and Day talking, but did not hear a word. Day denies any such conversation or promise, and the numerous disinterested witnesses all say that the church debt was omitted from the writing, because Day would not agree to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">The parties were assisted by their respective counsel, who were painstaking that everything agreed upon should be expressed in the writings. The plaintiff sets up a secret oral promise as the inducement to his signing the papers. His testimony and the testimony of the defendant are in flat contradiction, as respects the alleged promise, and the plaintiff\u2019s is without corroboration. Under the circumstances, if the claim can stand, what is more worthless than a written agreement ?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">It is proved by all the witnesses, except the plaintiff, that Day refused to pay the church debt, and the writing shows what debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>he agreed to pay. None was omitted by mistake. How can it be said that the addition of the church debt does not vary or change the written contract ? If added, it increases the defendant\u2019s liability $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">If the alleged promise is not part of the transaction evidenced by the writings, it is unenforceable. If a part, it should be in the instrument stating what debts were to be paid by the defendant. Parol evidence is admissible to prove the promise, as alleged ; but the promise, being denied by the positive testimony of the defendant, cannot be established by the uncorroborated testimony of the plaintiff. The principle applicable to the law of the evidence in such a case as this, has been reiterated in recent cases in this state. It was error to affirm the plaintiff\u2019s second point, for the evidence was insufficient to submit to the jury to find the facts therein stated. The second specification is sustained, and we need not specially note the other specifications (which are well taken) for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">It is hardly necessary to remark the first specification. Strictly, the point set out therein should have been refused, but with the other instructions the affirmance could hardly have been misleading. If there was nothing due the plaintiff, no cause for bringing the suit, the verdict should have been for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The sixth specification is not sustained. The defendant\u2019s third point was well answered by the learned judge of the common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
