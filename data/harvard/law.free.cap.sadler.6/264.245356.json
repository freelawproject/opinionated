White, his attorney, complains, for that whereas the said plaintiff, heretofore, to wit: on the first day of April, 1884, at the county aforesaid, was member of a certain beneficial society named, to wit, the Rev. Hugh McLaughlin Beneficial Association, and as such member, under the laws and rules thereof, was entitled to receive certain benefit and payments in case of his sickness, and the said defendants did then and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>conspire, combine, confederate, and agree together, unlawfully and unjustly, to expel the said plaintiff from the said society and to deprive him of his rights and membership thereof, and of the payments due and which were to fall due to him from the said society by reason of his sickness. And the said defendants in the pursuance of the said unlawful and wicked conspiracy, combination, confederacy and agreement, and for carrying the same into effect, did afterwards, to wit, on the day and year last aforesaid, took, pushed, and shoved the said plaintiff, and caused and procured the said plaintiff to be taken, pushed, and shoved from a certain room in which the said plaintiff was present at a meeting of the said society; hindered, prevented, and totally excluded the said plaintiff from that time to again enter the said room and from attending or being present at the said meeting and the subsequent meetings of the said society, and hindered and prevented the said plaintiff from claiming, having, or obtaining any benefits and payments from the said society by reason of his said membership and sickness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">By means of which several premises the said plaintiff has lost and been deprived of his rights and privileges of attending and. being present at the meetings of said society, and of having and receiving sick benefits and payments from the said society. And other -wrongs to the said plaintiff then and there did, to the daim age of the said plaintiff $5,000; therefore he brings suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">The defendants pleaded not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">At the trial before Pierce, J\"., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">Plaintiff joined the aKev. Hugh McLaughlin Beneficial Society\u201d in 1869, and prior to 1880 had been drawing frequent benefits from the society. In 1880 he claimed to be sick again, and the stewards, whose business it was, visited him, and after paying him one week\u2019s benefits ($5) declined to pay him any more, because, as they alleged, they could see nothing the matter with him, and he declined to show- them a certificate which he claimed Dr. Thomas Gr. Morton had given him. The stewards reported to the society adversely to plaintiff\u2019s claim for benefits. He then went to counsel, who in September, 1880, sent a claim to the society for $35, being seven weeks\u2019 benefits at $5 per week. Thereafter on September I, 1880, the society voted to request plaintiff to arbitrate, and notified him of it the next day; but he declined to arbitrate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>' His claim not having been paid, suit was brought by him against the society before a magistrate, and judgment obtained October 4, 1880, from which an appeal was taken to the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\">April 5, 1881, John H. Kirk a member, made a charge against Sweeney that he had violated the by-laws of the society by not having an arbitration to settle his dispute with the society before going to law; and May 10, 1881, a special meeting of the society was called to consider the charge, at which meeting Sweeney was present and took part \u2014 the vote on expulsion being 116 in favor to 29 against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">January 6, 1882, the appeal was tried in the court of common pleas, before Biddle, J., and a nonsuit was entered, on the ground that plaintiff should have complied with the by-laws as to arbitration before bringing suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">After the nonsuit in 1882 he alleges that he was ready to arbitrate ; but as in the meantime he had been expelled, the society did not consider him a member.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">In September, 1882, he filed a petition for a mandamus in common pleas No. 3 against the society, which it answered, to which answer a demurrer was filed. On March 24, 1884, judgment was entered for the relator on the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\">On April 1, 1884, a regular meeting of the society was being held, when plaintiff and a stranger were discovered to be present. The secretary announced that he had business of importance to lay before the meeting, but could not do so as long as persons were present who were not members; whereupon, the stranger left. Plaintiff said he was as good a member as anyone present, and refused to leave. He now asserts that he said in a loud voice that the court had so decided. In this statement he is contradicted by almost every other witness. However, he did not show any authority of any kind from the court. No one present in the room knew of any decision of the court, except the secretary, and he has not been made a defendant. Plaintiff persisted in remaining. A member then offered a resolution' as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">Whereas Hugh Sweeney appeared in this hall and claimed to be a member of this society, without any authority being shown by him for such claim, and having been requested by the president to .leave the hall and Mr. Sweeney\u2019s refusal to do so,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Resolved, that the president requests the assistance of police officers to put Sweeney out of the hall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">This resolution was agreed to, and in pursuance of it the president, McLafferty, requested the doorkeeper to call in an officer, who laid his hand on Sweeney\u2019s shoulder and told him to go out, which he did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">After plaintiff was put out the secretary read a communication from the counsel of the society which stated that No. 3 court had decided to reinstate plaintiff, and which further advised an appeal to the supreme court. By a resolution the society decided to follow the advice of counsel and an appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">In May, 1885, the supreme court affirmed the decree of the common pleas, and plaintiff then took a certificate of the decree to the society. Counsel advised the society that plaintiff was compelled to pay back dues before reinstatement; and when the president and secretary told plaintiff what counsel had advised, and that he must pay the back dues or they could not reinstate him, he procured an attachment to be issued against them for contempt in not obeying the decree, and they were fined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">Immediately thereafter plaintiff was reinstated by putting his name on the roll as usual, and he has continued a member since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-8\">Of the defendants, Aikins never was a member of the society, and never was present; Thomas Cat\u00f3n was not present on April 1, 1884; Dennis McDevitt did not come in until just before plaintiff was put out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-9\">The court, after reviewing the testimony and calling attention to the action of the defendants for which the action was brought, charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-10\">Now, you have heard the evidence and it is for you to say whether this was done in pursuance of an unlawful conspiracy on the part of the defendants in this action to deprive him, the plaintiff, of his rights of membership in this society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-11\">[These societies are very beneficial to the poor, to the laboring classes, who most usually take advantage of them, and they ought to be encouraged in the line of their duty; but if they go beyond that and do what they ought not to do, then they are liable for their acts or omissions like other individuals or associations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-12\">In this case it is alleged that he, the plaintiff, refused to ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>bitrate; and in refusing to do that refused to do his duty; and if these defendants, members of the society, did that which they ought not to have done, the law will visit upon them the damages for their misdoing, for any offense against the rights of a private member.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">It is for you to say, however, whether what they did was in the line of their duties as members of the society or whether they went outside of their duties as members of the society to oppress this man. If (hey did that, then they would be liable for anything not in the line of their duty as members of the society.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">It is charged that the defendants, or this society or some of them, were not only depriving him of his rights as a member but also undertook to find fault with what the court had done. In that instance, however, the court vindicated itself and. imposed a fine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">[There is one feature in the case that strikes me with considerable force; and that is, at the meeting in 1881, I think it was, they then knew or ought to have known that there had been a decision in favor of Mr. Sweeney and which they disregarded. Sweeney says that he told them of this; and it is admitted that the secretary of the society had with him a letter from the counsel for the society, notifying them of the decision of the court of common pleas No. 3; notwithstanding which they undertook to expel him, and did put him out by main force. Even if the secretary had no such notice from the counsel, Sweeney, if you believe him, said enough to put them on inquiry, at least, as to whether he had been sustained in court; but they went right ahead and put him out \u2014 expelled him.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">The defendants submitted, <em>inter </em>alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">2. \u201cThere is no evidence in this case of any illegal combination between the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-9\">3. \u201cUnder all the evidence the verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">After refusing these points the court added: \u201c[Mr. White calls my attention to the fact that I have said nothing about punitive damages; that I intended to embrace that subject. If you are satisfied that the plaintiff was expelled improperly, you can visit upon the defendants what in the law are known as punitive damages; not simply compensatory damages, but done to punish the defendants; that is, if the act done wilfully and maliciously.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Verdict and judgment were for tlie plaintiff for $449.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\">The assignments of error specified the portions of the charge inclosed in brackets, the refusal of the points quoted, and the action of the court in admitting in evidence for plaintiff the record of the mandamus case, and in admitting in evidence for plaintiff facts before and after April 1, 1884, the date laid in the <em>narr.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-5\"><em>Mann &amp; Miles, ' Thomas P.

There is not the slightest evidence of a conspiracy to deprive him of the rights and benefits of the association to which he belonged. He was expelled in a regular manner, and by the decisive majority of 90 in a vote of 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The action was that of the corporation, and was final and conclusive, until reversed by the judgment of the court of common pleas. When that court gave its judgment in his favor on the mandamus, it was his business to serve the decree, in a regular manner, on the officers of the society; and if in that case they did not restore him, he had his remedy by attachment, which, it seems, he finally resorted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">But when he appeared at the April meeting, he appeared, so far as the association knew, as an intruder without right, and on being requested, as he was, by a vote of the members then present, to retire, he should have quietly obeyed; and not having done so, he made himself liable to forcible expulsion. His declaration that he had been restored by the judgment of the court, even if heard by a majority of those present, was not the kind of information that they were bound to regard; they had a right to require the production of the order of the court; and even after that, they were entitled to a reasonable time for its consideration, and for that purpose might well have ordered him to retire from the lodge room.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Instead of pursuing this regular and quiet course, he chose to intrude himself on the society and attempt his own restoration in a manner which accorded rather with his own will than with propriety and law. The result of his experiment is on himself; fortunately, it was not at all serious; and as he was finally restored to his membership he has nothing of which to complain. But had the result been more serious than it was, it could not have been visited on the defendants, since they did nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the transaction bnt what they were warranted to do in the exercise of their corporate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The judgment of the court below is now reversed and set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
