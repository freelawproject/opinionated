ITis parents were both foreigners, the father, Edward Barry, being a native of Wales, and his mother a native of England. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>lived together as husband and wife in Northumberland at the time of the birth of their son. The mother died on the 24th day of January, 1885, and was buried by the overseers of the poor of Northumberland on the 26th. On the 21th the father left, and has not since been heard of. The mother of the pauper\u2019s mother1 also resided in Northumberland, and upon her death took charge of the pauper, who was then about four months old. This mother of the pauper\u2019s mother Avas married to one Peter Warters.. They were Arery poor and Avere obliged to ask for assistance. Finding work at Northumberland to be scarce they moved to Milton and took the pauper along with them. An order of relief Avas taken out and the pauper placed on Milton for support. The overseers of the poor of Milton took out an order of removal, and removed the pauper to the borough of Northumberland, from Avhich order the overseers of the poor of that borough appealed. Neither the pauper, his mother, father, nor grandmother ever had a settlement in Milton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-3\">[That borough contends that the pauper had at least a quasi settlement in Northumberland, if, in fact, he was not legally settled there by reason of his birth at that place; and that the burden of finding his legal settlement is on Northumberland and not on Milton.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-4\">The rule of course is that a pauper can only be removed to the-place where he was last legally settled; but it is contended that there is an exception to this rule, as Avhere a stranger wounded or sick must be supported by the district where he is at the time he falls helpless, etc., on the principle decided in the cases of Overseers v.

Milton, having shown that the pauper was bom in Northumberland, to which place he has been removed, and that that place is, by reason of his birth, prima facie his place of settlement, Northumberland contends that it has shown that' his last place of settlement is in Turbut township, Northumberland county. If Northumberland is in a position to show this, as against Milton, under the circumstances, then the question arises: Is a mother\u2019s settlement, acquired by her second marriage, communicated to her children by a former husband ?

It was holden that the children did not gain a settlement in Wang-ford, nor were removable thither, to charge that parish. As to the nurse children, they might indeed be sent thither for nurture only, yet still the parish of Brandon must relieve them there, and not the parish of Wangford. But the children above the age of seven years ought not to be removed at all; being settled inhabitants in the parish of Brandon; and the removal of the mothers shall have no influence in the settlement of the children.

James, 2 Watts &amp; S. 568, 31 .Am. Dec. 525, Chief Justice Gibson premises certain principles \u00a1about which he says there is no dispute. He says: \u201cThe dom- ' icil of an infant is the domicil of his father, during the father\u2019s \u2019.lifetime, or of his mother during her widowhood but not after 'her subsequent marriage, the domicil of her widowhood continuing in that event to be the domicil of her child. A husband can-mot properly be said to stand in the relation of a parent to his wife\u2019s children by a previous marriage, where they have means \u00bbof support which are independent of the mother, in whose place \u2019he stands for the performance of her personal duties, because ra mother is not bound to support her impotent children so long ?as they are of ability to support themselves. Neither can they derive the domicil of a subsequent husband from her, because filer new domicil is itself a derivative one, and a consequence of the merger of her civil existence. Her domicil is his, because \u00a1she has become a part of him; but the same thing cannot be said of her children. Having no personal existence for civil pur\u2022poses, she can impart no right or capacity which depends on a \u00a1state of civil existence; and the domicil of her children continues \u00a1after a second marriage to be what it was before it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\">This question, I understand, has been decided by Judge El-'Weu. in Columbia county, and by Judge Cummin in Lycoming \u00a1county.

Eep. 441, is not to the point That case only determines that .a widow may acquire a settlement different from that of her hus- ' band, by complying with the terms of the aot of assembly, which is communicable to her children. The widow had gained a .settlement of her own after the death of her husband by leasing \u25a0a house and living in the same a year and paying the rent. It was held that she, as the head of the family, was capable of acquiring such a settlement and of communicating the same to her unemancipated children. There are certain expressions in the opinion of Chief Justice Thompson that doubtless tend to \u2022mislead. For instance, he says: \u201cStill we have no reported decisions which carry a derivative settlement to her children as \u25a0a consequence of her settlement. Nor is there any statutory -provision or decided case against it, in this commonwealth. Why, therefore, shall it not be so on principle ?\u201d Again : \u201cThere is no difference between an acquired and derivative set tlement.\u201d For the last assertion he cites the case of Eex % \u2022 St. Matthew Bethnal Green, Burr.

Some time in the year <em>1819 </em>a man by the name of Joseph J. Fawcett emigrated from England to this state and found employment as a miner at Peckville, in the county of Lackawanna. After working there about nine months, about the first of April, 1880, Fawcett was joined by his wife and their daughter, Mary Ada Fawcett, aged about thirteen years and seven months. Fawcett boarded with his father, and his family remained with him there until he was killed, about the beginning of August, 1880. Mrs. Fawcett removed about two months afterwards with her daughter to the town of Plymouth, and about four months after that again removed with her daughter to the town of Danville, where they remained twelve months. Soon after they arrived at Danville, Mrs. Fawcett married a man by the name of Peter Warters, an iron worker, employed at one of the iron mills at Danville, and she resided with him there until February, 1882, when they removed to the borough of Milton, and in a few weeks rented a house from Solomon Fairchild in the township of Chillisquaque, in Northumberland county, where they resided a full year and paid the rent, <em>viz., </em>$8.33 per month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\">Mrs. Fawcett, now become Mrs. Warters, paid the rent personally, as she attended to the payment of the family expenses. The next spring they removed to the house of Paul Masteller in Turbut township, taking a lease of the house at a rent of $10 per month. During the year for which they had rented this house. Warters was imprisoned in the Northumberland county jail at Sunbury, but his family continued in the occupancy of the Masteller house until the end of the year, Mrs. Warters paying the rent in full. Mary Ada Fawcett continued a member of her mother\u2019s family and was at no time separated from her mother. At the same time Mrs. Warters had a boarder by the name of Edward Barry. Both Barry and Warters were iron workers, and worked at the Milton nail works. During the occupancy of the Masteller house, Mary Fawcett became pregnant by the boarder, Edward Barry. This man Barry w^as a foreigner and had no settlement in the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\"><em>Ans. </em>I find the facts to be as stated in this point, except that I cannot say that \u201cMary Ada Fawcett continued a member of her mother\u2019s family and was at no time separated from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>mother.\u201d It seems that after Mary Ada\u2019s marriage with Edward Barry, the pauper\u2019s father, they lived together as husband and wife and that she was supported by him out of his earnings. Mrs. Warters says they kept house about two months, when she took sick and came home to her. They lived in the house with her until they started housekeeping themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-3\">\u201cSecond. When the lease of the Masteller house expired, April 1, 1884, Mrs. Warters with her daughter removed to the borough of Northumberland, the boarder, Edward Barry, accompanying them. On the first of the following September Edward Barry and Mary Eawcett were married in the presence of the mother, Mrs. Warters, by the Catholic priest at Sunbury, and their child was born fifteen days afterwards on the 16th day of September, 1884. The child was a boy and was named Edward <em>James </em>Barry. Edward Barry rented a house in Northumberland from Mr. Van Alen for whom he worked for a time and held it two months, from October 1 to December, 1884, when he gave it up. The mother of the child had failed in health and returned to the house of her mother, Mrs. Warters, where she died on the 24th day of January, 1885, less than five months from the time of her marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">\u201cOn the day after Mrs. Barry\u2019s burial, her husband absconded and has not since been heard of.

Does she lose control of her children, and is she relieved of the burden of caring for them, by contracting a new marriage ? The English courts virtually held to that position, and the courts of Massachusetts followed their decisions. But it is to be noted that the courts in Massachusetts declared .the law otherwise upon the passage of an act of their legislature (Rev. Stat. chap. 45, \u00a7 1), which directed that \u201clegitimate children shall follow and have the settlement of their father, if he shall have any within this commonwealth, until they gain a settlement of their own; but if he shall have none, they shall, in like manner, follow and have the settlement of their mother, if she shall have any.\u201d Plymouth v.
