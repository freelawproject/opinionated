Small, his wife, in right of the said Susan; Clarence Hawthorn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and Hose Hawthorn, his wife, in right of said Hose; Louisa H. Youngman and P. C. Oberdorf against Wm. I. Greenough, and Jacob Kramer, high sheriff of Northumberland county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-4\">The allegations of the bill, supported by injunction affidavits, were substantially as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">I. John'G. Youngman died on the 13th of September, 1881, seised of most of the land proposed by respondents to be sold on the execution against John Youngman, a son of tire decedent, testate. By his will the testator devised two certain parcels of his real estate (designated in the partition proceedings hereafter adverted to as purparts one and two), to his daughter Louisa, with the power of sale of purpart one, upon the condition that the heirs all agree to the sale; but of the other absolutely, especially directed to said Louisa. The testator also directs that the balance of his land may be sold, upon the agreement of the heirs; in which event the proceeds shall be equally divided among the heirs, after certain debts, legacies, devises, .and bequests shall first have been provided for from the fund. No land, strictly as such, except perhaps a contingent life estate in all but purparts one and two, passed under the mil to the execution defendant, and this, subject to the provisions of the will in nature of a trust for the specific uses named therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">II. Proceedings in partition under the will were commenced in the orphans\u2019 court on August 21, 1872, for the partition, valuation, and distribution of the testator\u2019s real estate, or the fund, as provided by that instrument. They were conducted to the issuing of the writ directed to the sheriff, when their progress was arrested by the contract and agreement by the heirs and devisees for a settlement, partition, and distribution, \u25a0on the basis of an amicable family adjustment. This included the allowance of the claims of Susan E. Small, shown by the will in full, with, interest, from the land or fund, of the whole estate, except purpart two, which, it was settled by the heirs .and devisees, passed by the will absolutely to Louisa, and purpart one for life, contingent upon the exercise by her of the power of sale, just as specifically and absolutely devised to her, subject to \u201cthe agreement of the heirs\u201d only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">III. As represented to the principal complainants, and which they were induced to believe, and encouraged to rely upon, as the true state of things at the time, by the positive acts and silence of Mr. Greenough, the principal respondent, the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>impediment to a conclusion of such amicable family settlement, partition, and distribution under the will, was the certain judgment bond or bill single, dated the 10th of July, 1867, for $1,800, with interest, held by Mr. Greenough, of the respondents, to which the testator was a party obligor, as surety for the said execution defendant, who was principal debtor therein. Subject only to that on an outstanding claim, the basis of settlement was fixed and agreed upon by the heirs and devisees themselves, which contemplate a partition or conversion of the land to raise a fund'to answer the premises of a will, as well as the payment of such outstanding debt especially. George B. Youngman was also a party obligor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-4\">IV. Thus matters stood, until February 3, 1877, when the said William I. Greenough took another bond or bill single, signed by the same John Youngman, the said execution defendant, as principal debtor, and by A. A. Youngman and the said George B. Youngman, as sureties, for the same principal debt. Mr. Greenough held those bonds as collateral securities until the 22d day of March, 1879, when, without entry of judgment or action or proceeding to enforce the collection, either against the principal debtor or the surviving sureties, or yet against the estate of the testator, as the deceased' party, by sale and assignment of that date, under the inducement aforesaid, he passed both bonds to the said Susan E. Small in consideration that she paid the whole debt and interest thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">V. Without notice of the fact, just the day before, to wit, on March '21, 1879, the said William I. Greenough, however, to the prejudice of such securities, entered a judgment upon record against George B. Youngman, the principal surviving surety, to No. 109, June Term, 1879, in the common pleas of Northumberland county, wherein the said George B. Youngman owned valuable real estate besides his interest in the testator\u2019s estate. The debt of this judgment was in the penal sum of $3,800; the real debt at the date of entry was $1,554.51, with interest from entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">YI. As additional inducement to the payment of the debt and interest on the bonds of July 10, 1867, to Mr. Greenough, the holder tliereof, the principal debtor, John Youngman, the said execution defendant, made and delivered to the said Susan E. Small, by a separate paper, an assignment of his interest in his deceased father\u2019s estate, dated March 21, 1879, all of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>was followed by conveyances dated September 28, and October 7, 1880, of all tbe testator\u2019s real-estate, except purparts 2, 5, and 6, the valuation of which latter had not yet been agreed upon, when Mr. Greenough\u2019s judgment of No. 279, September term, 1880, upon which the sale proposed by the respondents is to be effected, was discovered, in the summer of 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-4\">But not informed of this last mentioned judgment, and discovering the judgment to No. 109, June term, 1879, entered as aforesaid against the said George B. Youngman, the said Susan E. Small, encouraged in the premises, by the acts and silence of Mr. Greenough, to believe she now at least by its payment could remove the sole remaining impairment to her titles and securities acquired on the basis aforesaid, on October 26, 1880, paid the debt, interest, and costs of that judgment on the faith-of a contract that it should be transferred to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">VII. The conveyances to Mrs. Small were duly recorded under date of January 25, 1881, made in pursuance of the basis and contract of settlement, which arrested the partition proceeding commenced in 1872, as already adverted to. She had been encouraged, by the positive acts and silence of .Mr. Greenough, to rely on a state of things essentially different from that he now, by his execution proceedings, insists upon, to her irreparable injury, if he be permitted to consummate his wrongful purposes in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">To remove the impediment by the bonds against the testator, as well as against the said George B. Youngman, who died on April 9, 1880, before consummating the settlement on the basis agreed upon as aforesaid, and on faith that her rights as creditor, legatee, devisee, and vendee could thereby be secured, she paid the debt of these bonds, as well as 'the debt of the judgment entered to their impairment by Mr. Greenough, before his assignment, but on the very eve thereof. And under the same delusion, if delusion it be, afterwards, to wit, on the 23d day of February, 1881, relying in good faith, on the same premises, and especially on the acquisition of the interest of John Young-man, the said execution defendant in the bond in controversy, she unwittingly entered satisfaction on her judgment of the 29th of March, 1879. And thereupon on the 26th day of February, 1881, discovering her mistaken entry of such satisfaction, the said William I. Greenough, wrongfully and without authority, entered satisfaction also upon the judgment of the 21st of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>'March, 1879, against George B. Youngman, the debt, interest, \u25a0and costs of which were paid by the said Susan E. Small, on \u25a0the faith of a transfer as aforesaid, under date of the 26th of October, 1880, upon discovery as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-4\">VIII. By means whereof the said William I. Greenough wrongfully opened the door for entry of his judgment of July 10, 1880, against John Youngman, the execution defendant, in this controversy involved, and for the assertion of a pretended right as of the first lien creditor upon the interest of said execution defendant in the lands of the testator, as well as of those \u25a0of the said George B. Youngman, deceased, so by his execution proceedings pretended to be remaining in such defendant; although the character and extent of such interest in land or fund remain in the orphans\u2019 court on partition proceedings, as to the \u25a0estate of John G. Youngman, deceased, and on order of sale for payment of debts, as to the estate of George B. Youngman, deceased, to both of which proceedings the said Greenough appeared and was heard as a party, unsettled and unadjusted by final decree of distribution only; and this, notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of that court of all the premises, and notwithstanding he has made and is still making his contest there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">IX. By means whereof also, as well as by his execution proceedings upon his said judgment of July 10, 1880, the said Greenough wrongfully intends the defeat of the said Susan E. Small\u2019s claims, by Avill and by judgment, or in right of first lien creditor in the premises, although he stands as her vendor of the securities, on one of which her judgment of March 29, 1879, was entered and improperly satisfied as aforesaid. The better to consummate this end, his wrongful endeavor is to prosecute his execution proceeding against her lien debtor, the said John Youngman, so as to become sheriff\u2019s vendee while her rights as devisee of the said John G. Youngman, deceased, as Avell as creditor, and as vendee both of the orphans\u2019 court and of some of the heirs and devisees, upon a contest waged by him in the same orphans\u2019 court, remain unsettled and without final .adjudication, so that she may not know how tp do or perform fairly to protect her just and lawful rights and estate in the same premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">By such sale by the sheriff the said Greenough unlawfully intends to effect the discharge of the lien of the judgments.and bonds, the debts of which were paid to him on the faith of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>transfer, by Mrs. Small, from the land of the said decedents as well as from the whole undivided interest of his execution debtor therein, while she shall be held in doubt and confusion in the orphans\u2019 court, under his contest there, as a party to the proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-4\">X. Instead of ordering satisfaction of her judgment of March 29, 1819, the said Susan E. Small had intended to order .a release of a small piece of land of the estate of her deceased brother, George B. Youngman. The said improper satisfaction was entered February 23, 1881, long after Mrs. Small had acquired her titles by conveyance and assignment, and long after these had been put upon record. And on June 21, 1881, her application by petition 'to tire court to strike off such improper and mistaken entry of satisfaction upon record was made. After a hearing, upon a rule, at which Mr. Greenough appeared, and was heard, the said satisfaction wras decreed to be stricken off and the lien of the judgment restored, upon the adjudication that the satisfaction was improperly and by mistake entered upon'the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">During the interval in which the record stood satisfied no property or estate which might have been the subject of a lien by judgment was acquired or lost by the principal debtor in that judgment, who is also the execution defendant in the proceedings now in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">XI. The judgment entered July 10, 1880, in favor of Mr. Greenough and against the said John Youngman was upon a mortgage bond with power of entry, for a debt contracted in and about the erection and construction of a large dwelling house upon the land and separate estate of the wife of the defendant, and was secured by her mortgage of the same premises, entered and recorded the \u2014 day of-, 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-8\">It was \u201cnot dreamed of\u201d by the parties in interest in the said decedents\u2019 estates as a possible encumbrance or impediment in the way of an amicable family settlement thereof. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">And the money which constituted the debt of this mortgage and bond was advanced by the mortgagee, not directly to either of the parties mortgagor, but only as the improvement of such separate estate of the wife progressed, and was directly paid out by the mortgagee to the contractor, material man, and builder. And no effort to enforce the collection of this debt, in whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>or in part, against the said mortgaged premises, has to this day-been made by the mortgagee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-4\">XII. On the 24th of October, 1883, A. A. Youngman, one of the heirs and devisees of the said testator, as well as one of' the administrators of the said George B. Youngman, deceased,, by petition to <em>the </em>orphans\u2019 court, revived proceedings in partition therein, under the will, which were now conducted to a conclusion, so far that the report of inquest was confirmed absolutely by the orphans\u2019 court, and that the real estate of the said testator has been awarded and decreed by the said court to be taken and held at the appraisement, as shown by the return of the inquest; to the said Susan E. Small, the certain land described in report of inquest as purparts 1 and 3, as party, heir, and vendee of heirs; also purparts 5 and 6, as party and heir to Louisa II. Youngman, purpart 2, as party, heir, and devisee;. and to Samuel Byerly, purpart 4, as party and vendee of heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">XIII. As judgment creditor of John Youngman, who was&lt; an heir and party to the said partition proceedings, by judgment of July 10, 1880, entered upon the mortgage bond as aforesaid, at the return of inquest, made December 3, 1883, Mr.. Greenough appeared, and on his petition to the said orphans\" court, a rule was granted and issued against the parties and heirs-to show cause why he should not be admitted to file exceptions and be heard as a party. This rule was returnable January <em>7, </em>1884. By reason thereof the decree of confirmation was refused by the orphans\u2019 court, until afterwards, on January <em>7,. </em>1884, the said rule was discharged by consent. And thereupon, as well upon the petition of the said Greenough as upon that of' the heirs and devisees, after first- making decree of confirmation of the return of inquest, the said court appointed George-Hill, Esq., auditor to ascertain liens, encumbrances, and owelty. And Mr. Greenough appeared before the auditor and contested there, as well as afterwards upon exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report in court, and was fully heard, although the contest was there limited chiefly to the question of priority of lien, not upon the land in question, but upon the fund raised upon the proceedings in partition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">XIV. And the land levied by Mr. Greenough\u2019s execution\u00bb upon his judgment of July 10, 1880, as of a pretended interest remaining in the said execution defendant, which was of the estate of George B. Youngman, deceased, was sold on January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>19, 1884, pursuant to an order of the orphans\u2019 court, issued December 19, 1883, without the pretense of irregularity, for the payment of debts. Mr. Greenough was himself a contestant bidder at the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\">XV. After the decree of confirmation of the report of inquest, and the-allotment at her bid on partition by the orphans\u2019 court, as to the purparts aforesaid, and having become the orphans\u2019 court vendee of the land and premises which had been of the estate of George B. Youngman, deceased, sold on the order of the orphans\u2019 court for the payment of the debts of the said decedent, the said Susan E. Small went into the exclusive possession thereof, granted and conveyed parts of the lands and premises so allotted and assured unto her, to her cocomplainants, as shown fully by the bill, who, under such grant and assurances, went into the possession of the parts so conveyed to them, when she and they, in good faith, relying upon the titles so assured unto them, made the large and valuable improvements, shown alike by the bill and the advertisements by the sheriff for the sale thereof. These were made long before Mr. Greenough issued his venditioni exponas for such sale, but after he had put on record his admission that the lien of his judgment had been discharged from the land in question, or from his said judgment debtor\u2019s interest therein, <em>\u201chj </em>virtue of the said partition proceedings by reason of the conversion of the share of the .said judgment debtor into the valuation money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">XVI. Thus, all the land, a pretended remaining interest in which, as of the execution defendant, is unlawfully and wrongfully undertaken and proposed to be sold by the defendants, on a venditioni exponas issued upon the judgment of July 10, 1880, at the instance of the plaintiff therein, whose claim is in course of adjudication in the orphans\u2019 court, on proceedings to which he has always been an active party on his own petition, and where he has been fully heard, which proceedings are there still pending and undetermined. And this to the great prejudice and irreparable injury of the rights of the said Susan E. Small and her vendees in all the premises, who have paid the purchase money, gone into possession, and made the valuable improvements of the land in question, upon the faith of their titles acquired as aforesaid, by contract and conveyance of the heirs and devisees of both the said decedents, and also as the orphans\u2019 court vendee on an order and sale for the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>debts and in partition as aforesaid, to which proceedings Mr. Greenough, on his own petition, being made a party, ought in equity and good conscience to be held, not only as having encouraged such reliance on their titles by the complainants, but also as a party vendor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-4\">XVII. It is charged, therefore, that by the said sales of the heirs, as well as by the said assurances by the said orphans\u2019 court proceedings, and under the will of the decedent testate, the fund is substituted for the land, and that it is an unlawful and inequitable abuse of right and power in all the premises to permit the respondents to consummate their proposed sale by the sheriff, as by them contrived in the same premises, whereby the pretense of an outstanding title, as in the sheriff\u2019s vendee, shall obtain to the irreparable injury and interminable prejudice of and interference with the just and lawful rights of the complainants therein, as of an undivided interest or estate in the .said land, to the conveyance of which to the complainants, Mr. Greenough, the said execution plaintiff, ought in equity and good conscience to be held as a party vendor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">XVIII. On the faith of their titles, so acquired as aforesaid, and going into possession after payment of the purchase money, \u25a0especially of the execution defendant\u2019s interest as aforesaid, and by satisfaction of the judgments and bonds aforesaid, if this be held efficacious, the valuable buildings and improvements described in the levy, seizure, and notice of the proposed \u25a0sale by the said respondents were made and erected in good faith, and while encouraged by the positive acts and silence of the said Greenough to rely on a different state of things fronv that on which he now insists as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">XIX.. The consummation of the said proposed sale by the sheriff would defeat the rights of the complainants under the will of the said John G. Youngman, deceased, as well as their rights as heirs and creditors of the said George B. Youngman, \u2022deceased,, by a proceeding by execution upon a judgment which never Avas a lien upon either of said decedents\u2019 titles, and only upon the said defendant\u2019s interest, in the event he takes as land, and then subject to the payment of debts and the provisions by -will; all of which ought first to be ascertained by proceedings directed to the purpose in the orphans\u2019 court, where such laudable endeavor is still pending, as well as the same subject-matter of this controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The bill concluded with a prayer that the defendants be enjoined from the further prosecution of the execution proceedings and restrained from the sale of the lands and tenements, so proposed by them to be sold, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\">The defendant Greenough filed the following affidavit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">\u201cWilliam I. Greenough, defendant, being duly sworn, saithr</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">\u201cThat he recorded judgment against John Youngman to No., 219, September term, 1880, by entry on warrant of attorney, in the said county, on July 10, 1880; that he issued thereon a fieri facias, returnable to December term, 1883, of the court, and a. levy was made November 26, 1883, upon the lands mentioned in said bill, which were upon inquest duly condemned, and to No. 63, May term, 1885, issued a writ of venditioni exponas for the sale of the same lands, and, as mentioned in said bill, they have,, been advertised for sale by the sheriff upon the said writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">\u201cThat the lands so levied on consist of part of the lands of which John G. Youngman, deceased, died seised, of the land of George B. Youngman, deceased, in part. That the right of John Youngman therein consists of such interest as he acquired as devisee of John G. Youngman, deceased, and as heir of\u2019 George B. Youngman. That by an order of the orphans\u2019 court,, the real estate of George B. Youngman was sold in manner-stated in the bill; but as to the piece now offered at sheriff\u2019s, sale, the sale at orphans\u2019 court sale has not been finally confirmed, nor the title of John Youngman finally ended, and proceedings in partition in the orphans\u2019 court now commenced upon the petition of A. A. Youngman for the partition or valuation, of the lands of John G. Youngman, deceased, which proceedings have been continued so far that offers to take have been made by some of the devisees, of all the parts at the valuation fixed by the inquest, but the several pieces have not yet been allotted by final decree of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">\u201cIt is claimed, whether the claim is just or not, that one of the pieces of land brought into the partition was devised by the will of John G. Youngman to one of the children, Louisa. H. Youngman, in severalty; and after the death of John G. Youngman and before the institution of the said proceeding in partition, all the other heirs and devisees joined in conveying, by deeds for the valuable considerations therein contained, all the lands of John G. Youngman, deceased, except two pieces of comparatively small value; and also the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of George B. Youngman\u2019s land was offered at sheriff\u2019s sale. All the lands so conveyed were sold and conveyed, as deponent is informed, after the entry of deponent\u2019s judgment against1 John Youngman, and were subject to the lien of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\">\u201cDeponent had hoped that through the said proceedings in partition and the orphans\u2019 court sale his right, through his said judgment, could have been adjusted; but his right to appear in \u25a0either case has been in some respects denied to him, because he is not a judgment creditor of George B. Youngman, and because he is only a lien creditor of one of the heirs of John G. Youngman. And he states, as an instance, that while he is convinced that the proceeding in partition is void because partition was prayed, under the will of John G. Youngman, of a piece \u25a0of land devised in severalty to Louisa H. Youngman, and because partition was prayed of all the land, conveyed in severity to Susan E. Small, by the heirs, and that, at least as to all these lands, the said partition was void and of no effect to discharge the lien of said judgment of deponent against John G. Youngman; yet it has been held in said partition proceeding that deponent has no standing in court to plead such want of jurisdiction in the orphans\u2019 court in this case. To be put in \u00a1a position to determine the question whether his lien is discharged by the said partition proceeding, and whether the said court has jurisdiction in partition, and for other purposes, the said deponent has proceeded upon his execution to sell the interest of John G.

J., delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">I am of opinion that all the important and material matters contained in this bill were fully considered and disposed of at the present term in the matter of the proceedings in partition of the real estate of John G. Youngman, deceased, and the special return to the order of sale of the real estate of George B\u201e Youngman, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">Wm. I. Greenough, Esq., is the plaintiff in a judgment, duly entered in this court against John Youngman, and has caused all the right; title, and interest of the defendant in his father\u2019s lands to be levied, condemned, and advertised to be sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-7\">The defendant has no defense and is not objecting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-8\">The plaintiffs in the bill claim to own the whole of the lands by virtue of certain deeds from the other heirs, and also by virtue of certain proceedings in partition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-9\">Mr. Greenough claims that he is a lien creditor of John Youngman, one of the heirs, his lien having been entered before the conveyances, and also that the partition proceedings were void for want of jurisdiction. In order to test these matters he has levied upon and proposes to sell any interest that John Youngman has in the lands and then try the title in ejectment. This I think he has a right to do, and cannot be interfered with by third parties, although it may becloud their title. If John Youngman has no title, Mr. Greenough will take nothing by the sheriff\u2019s sale. In the said opinion of this court, filed at this term, the said partition proceedings have been sustained, and, that being so, Mr. Greenough\u2019s lien is discharged. He must come upon the fund. The titles of the parties electing to take the several purparts will be good and valid when they are finally awarded, unless the partition proceedings are void. We think that as the parties and the liens against the respective heirs would have followed each one\u2019s share in the land the same result would follow by their consenting to a partition as made by the inquest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-10\">Mr. Greenough complains that the valuation was too low, but he was not in a position as a lien creditor of one of the heirs to object. His right to object was denied. He now alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tbe proceedings in partition were void for want of jurisdiction. The decrees of tire orphans\u2019 court in matters in which it has jurisdiction are conclusive and cannot be impeached in collateral proceedings. Mr. Greenough desires to try the question as to whether the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction, alleging that if it had not the proceedings were void, and that the parties electing to take the lands at the appraised value got no title. This we think he had a right to do; and this court has no right to stay his execution, although the title of the parties to whom the lands may eventually be awarded may be beclouded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-4\">For this reason the application for a special injunction to restrain the defendants is refused..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">The plaintiffs appealed and assigned the refusal of the preliminary injunction as error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">Subsequently the court dismissed the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">The plaintiffs thereupon appealed from the decree and assigned as error the dismissal of their bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-8\"><em>Wm.
