It will not .be contended, and is admitted, that the school board had no legal authority or power in make a contract such as was contemplated by this paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-9\">\u2022 [It has been contended that the liability arising under this .paper could not be enforced against the executors of James T. Leonard, because of the addition to his name of the words: \u201cPresident Sch. Bd.\u201d We do not agree with this contention, and instruct you that even if he was acting for the school board, or pretending to act for the school board, in making this contract, that contract being one which they had no power to make, he thereby became individually liable, and the other party to the contract had a right to bring this action against him in order to recover from him individually the amount of this contract stipulation.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-10\">The defendants have asked us to instruct you- upon the following propositions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-11\">First That under all the testimony and pleadings in this case the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-12\"><em>Ans. </em>[We must decline so to instruct you.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-13\">Second.

Leonard as President of the School Board of Clearfield, and upon the credit of said board, then the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-14\"><em>Am. </em>[We must decline so to instruct you, for the reason already given: that the school board had no authority or power to make any such contract. Judge Leonard having put his name to this paper, the plaintiff had a right to treat him as being individually responsible to him (plaintiff) for the amount of this contract.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Third. That if the jury believe-that James T.

We do not think this point applicable to-the case now trying, under the evidence and facts in this case.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">Now, under the view we have taken of this case, that would only leave you to ascertain the sum due the plaintiff on this-note; and it would not be necessary to have you retire for that, purpose, as there is no fact in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">[We instruct you that under this paper and the evidence in the case, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the principal sum of $160, and interest thereon from the 25th of October, 1880, which is $56.80; and we instruct the clerk to take your verdict in that amount.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-7\">The verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff for $216.80.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-8\">The assignments of error specified, 1-3, the answers to the defendants\u2019 points; 4 and 5, the admission of evidence; and 6- and <em>1, </em>the portions of the charge inclosed in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-9\"><em>8.

The presumption in such case- is that, the contracts were made upon the credit and responsibility of the government itself. This rule applies to simple contracts both parol and written; and where there is an attempt to-imply a responsibility the proof ought to be exceedingly cogent and clear, to create personal responsibility. Story, Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 302-304, 306.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-10\">This rule as to proof ought to be still more stringent where the evidence discloses the principal to the person who contracted with the agent of the corporation. Kathbon v. Eudlong, 15-Johns. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-11\">An officer of a corporation who by its direction executes an instrument not competent to bind the corporation; <em>e. g., </em>a sealed instrument, but without the corporate seal, is not therefore personally bound; he is not an agent acting without authority with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in the rule that enforces a contract so made against the agent. Episcopal Church of St. Peter v. Yarian, 28 Barb. 644.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-4\">Where a contract on behalf of a corporation is signed by its agents with their own names and seals, although presumptively they may be personally liable, yet it appearing that the contract was for the benefit of the corporation and was so understood, and that the agents were duly authorized by the corporation to make it, and the contract is such that the corporate seal is not essential, the remedy is against the corporations, and not against the agents. Haight v. Sahler, 30 Barb. 218.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-5\">In general it is true that there is a distinction between contracts on the part of the government by its agents, and those which are entered into on the part of individuals or corporations by those who represent them. In respect to the first it may safely be asserted that whether the contract be by parol or by deed, the public faith is exclusively relied on whenever the agent does not specially render himself liable. Hopkins v. Mehaffy, 11 Serg. &amp; R. 128.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-6\">But if from the nature and terms of the instrument it appeal\u2019s that the party is an agent and that he means to bind his principals to act for him, and not on his own account, tbs law will give the paper that intendment to carry out the actual meaning of the parties, however inartificial the language may be. 11 Mass. 27; 5 Maul\u00e9 &amp; S. 345; Palev, Agency, 378.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-7\">On this point there is no difference whether the instrument be a deed or an unsealed contract Burrell v.

The instrument itself in no way purported to bind anyone but him; he does not even pretend that he was acting as agent for anyone. The addition in no way affects the character of the note. It is the individual note of Leonard, and he is liable thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-5\">An agent who signs his own name instead of that of his principal becomes himself liable, and the word \u201cagent\u201d appended to his name is merely <em>descriptio personen. </em>Whiting v. Dewey, 15 Pick. 428; Hastings v. Lovering, 2 Pick. 214, 13 Am. Dee. 420; Stackpole v. Arnold, 11 Mass. 27, 6 Am. Dec. 150; May-hew v. Prince, 11 Mass. 54; Arfridson v. Ladd, 12 Mass. 173; Seaver v.

Sahler, 30 Barb. 218, ruled that \u201cwhere, in the body of a sealed instrument, the covenants are stated as if they were made by a corporation directly with the plaintiff, without' the agency of anyone, and the defendant is not named, but signs, the instrument and seals it with his own seal, as president of the corporation and on their behalf, an action cannot be sustained upon it against him individually.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-5\">In the present case the body of the instrument plainly and clearly binds but one person, James T.

Austin, 5 Whart. 313, cited by plaintiffs in'error, the defendant who had indorsed a draft as \u201cagent\u201d was exonerated from liability, upon proving that it was given for merchandise furnished to his principal and without any consideration moving to himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-9\">In Sharpe v. Beilis, 61 Pa; 69, 100 Am. Dec. 618, cited by the plaintiffs in error, the claim for which the note was given was for coal sold to the company by the plaintiffs. Beilis was asked to give his note to the plaintiffs; and said he would not, but indorsed the note as president. He so indorsed it, and the \u201cPres\u2019t\u201d was erased without his knowledge. This court decided that it was not the defendant\u2019s individual note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-10\">In Markley v. Quay, 8 W. N. C. 145, relied upon by the plaintiffs in error, no consideration moved to the defendant individually, and the instrument was intended by both the contracting parties as an order upon a fund belonging to the principals, was given in payment of a debt due by them, and was not intended to bind the defendant in his individual capacity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In Hollenback v.
