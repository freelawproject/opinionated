McAboy, 74 Pa. 249, is founded upon the convenience and policy of the state, and the limited remedy for payment of debts; but that was an action upon a municipal bond to raise money for public uses; and none of the reasons set forth in that case apply to this.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-11\"><em>8.

A suit in favor of a corporation must be brought against the person, wherever he resides or may be found. It does not follow that because the corporation may bring suit in another county, the same rule may be applied to it when defendant. The reason is not the same, and therefore the law has always been understood to be otherwise. Lehigh Co. v.

L. p. 79, 1 Purdon\u2019s Digest, 58, does not authorize the sheriff to go beyond his bailiwick to serve process in local actions instituted against municipal corporations. The ease of Potts v. Pittsburgh, 14 W. N. O. 38, is decisive of the point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-8\">The entry of an appearance and the filing of a plea did not cure the defects, in the service of the process in this case. The defendant at no stage waived the defect in the service of the writ.
