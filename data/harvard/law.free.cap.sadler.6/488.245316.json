J., in the opinion of the court below, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqM\">It appears from the evidence taken in this case that Clark Olds, Esq., an attorney of this court, was employed by the petitioner to attend to his interest in connection with the settlement of the estate of Daniel Yeager, deceased; that he did give the business his personal care and attention, rendering considerable and valuable service, and that after the whole matter had been brought to a successful conclusion and the money had been paid into court, the petitioner sought to avoid and evade the payment of the proper compensation earned by and justly due to his counsel, attempting to draw the money himself, and for the evident purpose of defrauding him of his fees, he, the petitioner, living in a distant state and having no property here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>blow it is true, as claimed on part of the petitioner, that the attorney has no lien upon the money in court; but as the amount has, it appears, been paid by the clerk to the attorney of record, who is amply responsible, and as the petitioner has his legal remedy, we are not disposed to become a party to his apparently intended wrong by using the power of the court in the way we are asked to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">The order is refused and the rule discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">The assignment of error specified the action of the court- in discharging the rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-6\"><em>8.

Dubois\u2019s Appeal, 38 Pa. 231, 80 Am. Dec. 478; Irwin v. Workman, 3 Watts, 357.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-7\"><em>Davenport &amp; Griffith </em>and <em>William </em>Benson, for appellee.\u2014</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-8\">The orphans\u2019 court is a court of equity. Having taken jurisdiction of the subject-matter in controversy, it has a right to determine and adjudicate every matter and thing connected therewith. It is not claimed that the appellee has a lien upon the money in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-9\">When a fund is brought into a court of equity by the services of an attorney, who looks to that alone for compensation, though his interest is not- in the nature of a lien, he is the equitable owner thereof to the extent of the value of his services;' and the court administering the fund will intervene for his protection and award him a reasonable compensation therefrom. McKelvy\u2019s Appeal, 15 W. N. C. 564.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b505-10\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The learned judge found as a fact that the money was paid to one who, as an attorney of the court, was employed by the petitioner to attend to the business which produced the money in contention, and that he did render considerable and valuable services, and brought the matter to a successful conclusion. He was, therefore, undoubtedly entitled to pay for his services. It is not shown that he demanded an unreasonable fee or that he was unwilling to pay over the residue of the money to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Under all the facts of the case, we see no sufficient cause for reversing the action of the court</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
