J., were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">Jacob Stank, the prosecutor, on the 15th of September, 1885, was the keeper of a boarding house in the fourth ward of the \"borough of Shamokin; at that time he had sixteen boarders, among whom was a brother of Mrs. Stank, who was married on the evening of the above date. There were present at the wedding, which was held at the prosecutor\u2019s house, from twenty-seven to thirty-five persons, as variously estimated by the witnesses. Among the guests were two men, acquaintances of Stank, who at one time had boarded with them, one of whom had some money, said to be $27, which he gave to Mrs. Stank to take care of for him, which she took and placed in a trunk for safe keeping. This trunk was .in a bedroom occupied by the '.Stanks on the first floor of the house, and it was shown that in addition to this $2J the Stanks had the sum of $530, which was -deposited in this same trunk. Among the guests at the party -were August Broskie and John Becker, the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">It was shown on the part of the commonwealth that in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>course of the evening tbe party ran short of refreshments, and that Mrs. S tank\u2019s brother came into the bedroom where the trunk was and asked Mrs. Stank, in the presence of both the defendants, and who, probably with some other guests, were present with her in the bedroom, for money to buy more beer; whereupon. Mrs. Stank went to the trunk and took out a stocking containing $530 and opened it in the presence of the defendants and her brother, and she, not knowing the denominations of the money, requested Broskie, one of the defendants, to select therefrom the required amount. Broskie picked out a five dollar bill, which was handed to the brother, and the balance of the money was replaced in the presence of the defendants in the trunk. Afterwards, in the course of the evening, Becker, one of the defendants, spoke to the prosecutor and his wife about a house that he owned, and offered to sell it to them for $1,000, and was informed that the amount of money belonging to them was $450. The festivities were continued until nearly 12 o\u2019clock at night, when the guests, including the defendants, left the house, and the inmates, including the boarders, the two visitors, and the prosecutor and his wife, retired to rest, the visitors and Stank and his wife occupying the same bedroom on the first floor, in which the trunk was located. After being absent from the house about an hour, Becker and Bi\u2019oskie, the defendants, returned together and entered the house and proceeded to the prosecutor\u2019s bedroom, and finding Mrs. Stank there in bed, they went to her and induced her to drink two glasses of porter, although it was conclusively shown that she was already intoxicated, as was, in fact, the prosecutor, and possibly everyone else in the house. Afterwards the defendants were induced to leave the house. That same night, after the party had dispersed, the house of Stank was entered through the window to the bedroom occupied by Stank and his wife, and the trunk containing the money was carried out, and the next morning was found about one square from Stank\u2019s house, and the stocking containing the $530 was taken therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-3\">Further evidence was given connecting defendants with the crime charged, all of which was particularized and commented on by the judge in his charge; whereas, the evidence given in behalf of defendants was referred to in general terms only. There were no requests for specific instructions on the part of defend* ants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The court, <em>inter </em>alia, charged the ury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-4\">[The defendants also gave in evidence some testimony as to their previous good character as honest men. In all criminal cases defendants are allowed to give this kind of evidence. It is evidence that is allowed in order to disprove guilt, and is said to be positive evidence. It may of itself produce what is called reasonable doubt, and may result in producing an acquittal. The evidence of character is a matter of course to be taken into-consideration by the jury in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Of course, if a man is proved guilty \u2014 if the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt \u2014 he must be convicted and punished, no difference what his previous good character may have been.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">Now, you will take into consideration all the evidence, and give these defendants a fair and impartial trial, and endeavor to render a true verdict between the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the defendants. You, of course, realize the importance of the case to the community and to society, as well as the defendants. I need scarcely refer you to the fact of this being an important case on all sides. If you believe the defendants are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, then you will not hesitate to find them guilty. If, however, as I stated, you have a reasonable doubt, fairly arising from the evidence, you will acquit them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">Verdict, guilty as charged in the first count of the indictment; and sentence accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">The second assignment of error specified the portion of the charge inclosed in brackets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">The third assignment of error specified the action of the court in the general charge to the jury particularizing the evidence of the commonwealth, and referring to the evidence of the defendants in general terms only, with one or two exceptions, which had a tendency to cause, and actually did cause, an unfavorable impression in the mind of the jury, inconsistent with the well-known rule, that all men are presumed to be innocent, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-9\"><em>8.

If the court had said: If you believe that the testimony on the part of the commonwealth has made out the offense charged in the indictment, beyond a reasonable doubt, it will become your duty, after that, to consider the evidence of the defendants\u2019 previous good character, and .after a careful l'easoning of that evidence, with all the other evidence in the case; and if, in vour opinion, this evidence of previous good character will create a reasonable doubt in your minds of their guilt, then your verdict must be not guilty \u2014 -an instruction of this kind would have been strictly within Heine v.

C. 559, 590.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">This form has been ratified by the courts of this state, as well as every state in the Union, where there is any reported case upon the subject. Nor does there appear to be a single case in the books where a contrary view has been even hinted at. In 1822 Justice Duncan said: \u201cThe charge is for a burglarious entry, with the intent to steal, and then and there stealing. It is all one offense, and one burglary; the only crime laid is burglary.\u201d Stoops v. Com. 7 Serg. &amp; P. 499, 10 Am.

Com. 60 Pa. 103, where the indictment was identical in form with this, Chief Justice Thompson said that \u201cit was argued that there is embraced in this charge of burglary a charge of larceny. This is true; and it is not to be denied that a conviction by the jury of the minor offense would be sustained.\u201d Hollister v. Com. 60 Pa. 103. See also Com. v. Solby, 15 W. N. C. 392.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-8\">We admit that the general rule undoubtedly is that two distinct crimes or offenses cannot properly be joined in the same count of the indictment, and that such joinder will be fatal on demurrer or motion to quash, but this rule is by no means of universal application; and one of the exceptions, as well established as the rule itself, is that burglary and larceny committed at the same time may be thus united. In such case the burglarious entry, with the intent to steal, and the consummation of that intent by actual theft, are so connected that the two crimes. may be charged in the same count, in order, it is said, to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>vict of one on a failure to establish the other.'

There is no way in which the description of the goods could be made to appear without the same was a matter of record; and the record would be the indictment charging the offense.
