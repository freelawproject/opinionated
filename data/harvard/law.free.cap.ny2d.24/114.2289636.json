Moneys received by petitioner from the sale of capital assets no longer employed or employable in its business or as reimbursement for the accidental destruction or condemnation of its property are not gross earnings, that is, receipts from the employment of capital, under section 186. <em>(People ex rel. Brooklyn Union Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>114 App. Div. 266; <em>People ex rel. Brooklyn Union Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Gaus, </em>195 N. Y. 616; <em>People ex rel. Westchester Light. Co. </em>v. <em>Gaus, </em>199 N. Y. 147.) II. The Tax Commission\u2019s adherence for half a century to the view that receipts such as are here involved were not taxable under section 186 represents a contemporaneous and long-standing administrative construction that such receipts are not taxable <em>(People ex rel.

This represented the balance allegedly due on the franchise tax imposed upon Con Ed\u2019s gross earnings for the quarter ending July 31, 1960, pursuant to section 186 of article 9 of the Tax Law. Con Ed paid the full amount assessed against it, under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On July 31, 1961 Con Ed applied, for a $20,753.36 refund of the amount so paid. The assessment to the extent of $20,753.36 was based on the following receipts :</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Cash received by the Company for property damage and insurance claims......</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Cash received by the Company from the sale of capital assets <em>no longer employed in its business </em>(emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">A) .

These reimbursements were in no way produced by the petitioner\u2019s capital. Such receipts are not derived from the <em>\u2018 </em>employment of capital \u2019 but from the accidental <em>destruction </em>of capital. The stipulated facts do not indicate whether or not the reimbursements for the damaged property exceeded its cost less depreciation value, that is, whether petitioner has made any profit on paid reimbursements. We will assume, as apparently the parties do, that no profit's were made \u201d, (23 A D 2d 477, 478-479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The majority, however, agreed, citing <em>People ex rel. Westchester Light. Co. </em>v. <em>Gaus </em>(199 N. Y. 147), that the receipts from the sale of real property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, scrap and obsolete machinery were properly subject to taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The dissenter below was of the opinion that all the receipts were subject to taxation. He stated: \u201c The wording of the statute is sufficiently inclusive to sustain a finding that cash reimbursements from property damage claims and insurance claims are part of \u2018 gross earnings \u2019 which <em>\u2018 </em>means all receipts from the employment of capital without any deduction \u2019.\u201d (23 A D 2d, p. 480.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">After reviewing the history of section 186 and the cases decided before and after the 1907 amendment, we are of the opinion that none of the receipts from the transactions in question is subject to the franchise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The sole question presented for our consideration is one of statutory construction, to wit, what was the legislative intent in adding \u25a0 the sentence <em>\u201c </em>The term \u2018 gross earnings \u2019 as used in this section means all receipts from the employment of capital without any deduction \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As originally enacted, section 186 provided for a franchise tax upon various types of' utility companies measured by their <em>\u201c </em>gross earnings from all sources within this state \u201d. In interpreting the statute in its original form, the Appellate Division held in 1906 that, in order to arrive at taxable \u201c gross earnings \u201d, the cost of raw materials used in producing the utility service had to be deducted from the company\u2019s gross receipts <em>(People ex rel. Brooklyn Union Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>114 App. Div. 266). We subsequently affirmed without opinion <em>(People ex rel. Brooklyn Union Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Gaus, </em>195 N. Y. 616 [affg. an unreported Appellate Division decision entered in 1909 upon an oral statement by the Appellate Division that it was bound by its previous 1906 decision (114 App. Div. 266) on the same issue between the same parties]).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Apparently reacting to the decision by the Appellate Division, the Legislature in 1907 amended section 186 by providing a statutory definition for the term \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>gross earnings \u2019 \u2019. It is important to note that the amendment did not delete the term \u2018 \u2018 gross earnings \u201d and substitute a more all-encompassing phrase, but rather sought to define \u201c gross earnings \u201d in such a way so as to abrogate the interpretation placed upon the phrase by the Appellate Division in the <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Go. </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Shortly after the Legislature had amended the statute, a trilogy of cases came to our court to test the effectiveness of the</p>\n<p id=\"b151-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>amendment <em>(People ex rel. Westchester Light. Co. </em>v. <em>Gaus, supra; People ex rel. Consolidated Gas Co. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Gaus, </em>199 N. Y. 527; <em>People ex rel. Astoria Light, H. &amp; P. Co. </em>v. <em>Gaus, </em>199 N. Y. 528). All three cases involved the very same receipts that were in question in the <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. </em>case; i.e., none involved the kind of receipts presently before us. In those cases the appellants argued that the amendment did not succeed in changing the statute as formerly construed and that it was still entitled to deduct the cost of raw materials used in manufacturing the utility services. This court rejected the argument finding that, although the amendment was \u201cinartistically expressed \u2019 \u2019, the \u2018 \u2018 statutory amendment followed upon the construction given by the Appellate Division \u201d in the <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. </em>case and, therefore, we could not <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 refuse a construction of a statute in accordance with the presumed legislative intent, because clumsily worded \u201d (199 N. Y., pp. 149-150).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">The case at bar is the first to seek further judicial interpretation of the relevant statute since the above trilogy of cases came to our court in 1910. This, however, is easily explained by Con Ed\u2019s unrefuted assertion that the Tax Commission has never before sought to tax receipts arising from the transactions presently before us. While we agree with the majority below that the Tax Commission cannot be estopped from changing an interpretation of a statute <em>(Matter of Marx </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>286 App. Div. 913), we are of the opinion that the failure to tax the type of transactions here involved for 53 years should not he viewed as meaningless, hut rather such inaction should create a presumption in favor of the taxpayer which can only be rebutted by a clear manifestation of legislative intent to the contrary. It is our opinion, and apparently the opinion of the Tax Commission for 53 years, that the Legislature did not intend to tax the transactions here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">It is evident that the 1907 amendment did not contemplate a substitution of \u201c capital\u201d or \u201c gross receipts\u201d for \u201c gross earnings \u201d as the basis for taxation. It merely sought to include that portion 'of capital which the <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. </em>case required to be deducted from \u201c gross earnings \u201d to arrive at the proper basis. This is only that portion of \u201c gross earnings \u201d which represents the \u201c employment of capital \u201d to manufacture, distribute and sell various public utility services. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>proceeds from the transactions here involved do not represent an \u201c employment of capital \u201d at all. Con Ed does not employ its capital for the purpose of having it accidentally damaged or destroyed. It does not employ its capital to construct or purchase facilities so that they can be condemned by governmental authority and appropriated for another use, or so that they can be sold when they are obsolete or sold as scrap when they become inoperative. The proceeds from these transactions represent the amounts realized from the destruction or confiscation of capital, not the employment of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should he modified by reversing so much of that order which confirmed the Tax Commission\u2019s determination allowing the taxation of the transactions involving sales of capital assets and affirming so much of the order which annulled the Tax Commission\u2019s determination as to the receipts for property damage and insurance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Bergan, Keating. Breitel and Jasen concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Order modified, with costs to appellant-respondent, in accordance with the opinion herein, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. The last sentence of the statute was added by amendment in 1907 (L. 1907, eh. 734, \u00a7 3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. Included in the sum representing proceeds from the sale of real property was the sum of $451,000 which represented a partial payment for certain property owned by Con Ed that was taken by the United States Government in condemnation. Although .the majority below has drawn a distinction as to the receipts which represent the involuntary destruction of property, they apparently have not drawn a similar distinction as to the involuntary sale of property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
