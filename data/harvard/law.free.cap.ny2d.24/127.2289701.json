The papers are, therefore, insufficient and no hearing is required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Oddo, </em>275 App. Div. 816, 300 N.

No notice of appeal was ever filed. However, three years later, in July, 1967, the defendant made the present application for <em>coram nobis </em>relief on the ground that he had been misled into permitting the time to appeal <em>to </em>lapse by virtue of his assigned counsel\u2019s representation and assurance. In particular, he claims that he had asked counsel whether \u2018 \u2018 there was anything else which could be done, anyone else [to whom] he may appeal \u201d and that the latter told him \u201c not to worry, that everything would be taken care of in due time \u2019\u2019.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We recently held that a defendant who fails to file a timely notice of appeal because of his reasonable reliance on his assigned counsel to do so is entitled to relief by way of <em>coram nobis. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>23 N Y 2d 656, revg. 28 A D 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>1101; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>24 NY 2d 130, also decided today.) This, it should be noted, but followed other decisions of our court which granted such relief where assigned counsel misled an indigent defendant by telling him that an appeal would be costly (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>16 N Y 2d 1062) or where counsel decided, on his own initiative, to abandon an appeal that had already been instituted. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lamplcins, </em>21 N Y 2d 138; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Renzzio, </em>14 N Y 2d 732; see\u201e also, <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 738; <em>Entsminger </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>386 U. S. 748.) In the face of these decisions, the earlier cases which denied relief for assigned counsel\u2019s failure to carry out a promise to take an appeal have been effectively overruled and may no longer be considered authoritative. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kling, </em>14 N Y 2d 571; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>14 N Y 2d 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The defendant herein is entitled to a hearing as to the truth of his allegations that his lawyer had led him to believe that an appeal would be taken and that he reasonably relied on that assurance. If it be found upon the hearing that he was induced, by reason of that representation, to allow his time to take an appeal to expire or that he was misled as to his right to appeal, he should \u2014 in accordance with the procedure we have adopted \u2014.'be resentenced <em>nunc pro tunc </em>upon the previous finding of guilt so as to afford him \u201c an opportunity of prosecuting and perfecting an appeal, since the time for taking such appeal \u00a1would date from the rendition of the new judgment. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hairston, </em>10 N Y 2d 92, 94; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>12 N Y 2d 417, 420-421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the case remitted to the County Court, Suffolk County, in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Judges Burke, Bergan and Keating concur; Judges Scileppi, Breitel and Jasen concur in result on the grounds that defendant\u2019s court-assigned lawyer allegedly promised to take an appeal, had failed to do so and had subsequently been disbarred for similar omissions to take appeals in criminal cases although he had promised to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Order reversed and case remitted to the County Court, Suffolk County, for a hearing in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. This attorney was subsequently disbarred on .the ground, among others, that he had taken fees- from defendants in criminal eases for the purpose .of prosecuting appeals and had failed to do so.
