The Authority in disapproving petitioner\u2019s application for a brand label registration for its eight-year-old Ancient Age, 86 proof bourbon, was exercising its discretion as provided by law. Its determination was a reasonable exercise of that discretion. It was lawful and not in violation of any right of petitioner, and was properly confirmed by the court below. <em>(Matter of Gambino </em>v. <em>State Liq.

It withheld its approval\u2014and thereby prevented the petitioner from introducing its eight-year-old bourbon in the New York market\u2014\u25a0 solely on the ground that, shortly before the date of the application, the petitioner had withdrawn from sale in New York a sios-year-old bourbon, also 86 proof and also bearing the brand name <em>\u201c </em>Ancient Age Kentucky Straight Bourbon \u201d, which continued to be sold in great quantity, and at lower prices than the eight-year liquor, in other parts of the country. The withdrawal of the lower-priced sw-year-old bourbon and the nearly simultaneous proposal to introduce a more costly eh/M-year-old bourbon, similarly labeled except as to age, were characterized by the Authority as being <em>\u201c </em>designed to circumvent \u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>so-called \u201c affirmation section \u201d of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law (\u00a7 101-b, subd. 3, pars. [d]-[i]). Those paragraphs \u2014 (d) through (i) \u2014 <em>(infra, </em>pp. 37-38), in effect, require a distiller of whiskey to offer its products in New York at prices not higher than the lowest prices at which it sells them in any other State.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The petitioner brought this article 78 proceeding to compel the Authority to approve the label for its eight-year-old Ancient Age Whiskey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In opposition, the Authority contended that its action did not fall within any of the categories listed in section 121 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law <em>(infra, </em>p. 40) and was, therefore, not judicially reviewable. It went on, nevertheless, to defend, on the merits, its conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s application was an attempt to evade the requirements of section 101-b. In the course of doing so\u2014 and this is most significant \u2014 the Authority conceded that there was a <em>difference </em>between the two kinds of whiskey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It further indicated \u2014 and through counsel has explicitly stated on the argument in this court \u2014 that it would approve the eight-year label if the petitioner also continued to offer the six-year product in the New York market. The court at Special Term held that the denial of the registration was \u2018 \u2018 without basis in fact \u2019 \u2019 and \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>arbitrary and capricious \u201d and remanded the matter to the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On appeal, a divided Appellate Division reversed. It concluded that section 107-a gave the Authority discretion with regard to approving brand label registrations, so as to give effect to the objectives of the other sections of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, section 101-b among them, and the court found adequate basis in the record for the Authority\u2019s determination. That action of the Authority, the court also held, was not subject to judicial review. The dissenting justice expressed the view that the statute only permitted the Authority to prevent discrimination in <em>price </em>between sales of <em>like </em>products in New York and in other states but did not empower it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>prevent a distributor from <em>withdrawing </em>from the New York market one of two admittedly <em>different </em>products. The action taken by the Authority being beyond its lawful powers, it was subject to judicial review, the dissenter went on ,to urge, notwithstanding section 121. With both of these conclusions we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We turn, first, to section 107-a itself. Subdivision 4 of that section\u2014the part with which we are mainly concerned \u2014 states, quite simply, that \u201c [n]o liquor * * * shall be labeled,</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">offered or advertised for sale \u201d unless it is done <em>\u201c </em>in accordance with \u201d regulations of the Authority and unless \u201c the brand or trade name label\u201d affixed to the container of the beverage <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 shall have been registered with and approved by the authority and the appropriate fee paid \u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Under paragraph (a), the functions of the Authority are not \u2014 as the petitioner contends \u2022\u2014\u2022 purely ministerial. The Authority may, undoubtedly, exercise discretion to refuse to approve a label which would help an applicant to violate any part of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. However, and this is decisive, there is nothing in the statute prohibiting the conduct which the Authority freely acknowledges it was trying to prevent\u2014 namely, the withdrawal by the petitioner of its six-year-old bourbon from the New York market and the offering, at a higher price, of a similarly named but clearly labeled and concededly different eight-year-old whiskey instead. No matter how worthy the Authority\u2019s objective may seem from the point of view of the consumer, it appears to lack any legal foundation whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Certainly, nothing in the remaining subdivisions of section 107-a itself helps to sustain the administrative action. Subdivision 2, the only other provision having possible relevance, runs counter to the claims of the Authority. Referring to regulations which the Authority is empowered to promulgate, subdivision 2 recites that they \u201c shall be calculated to prohibit deception of the consumer \u201d, to provide him with \u201c adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>information as to quality and identity \u201d and to \u201c achieve national uniformity in this field in so far as possible.\u201d However, as we have pointed out, the Authority makes no claim that the proposed label is deceptive, false or incomplete in any respect. The Authority rests its case entirely on its professed purpose of giving effect to subdivision 3 of section 101-b \u2014 and to that portion of the statute we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\">The \u201caffirmation\u201d provisions, paragraphs (d) through (i) of subdivision 3 of section 101-b (L. 1964, ch. 531, \u00a7 9), reversed the State\u2019s long-standing policy of discouraging the reduction of liquor prices<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of enforcing the maintenance of retail prices at levels fixed by the distiller (former \u00a7 101-c; L. 1950, ch. 689, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">In 1964, acting on the recommendations of a Moreland Act Commission and of the Governor, the Legislature repealed the resale price maintenance section of the statute (L. 1964, ch. 531, \u00a7 11).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its declaration of policy, the Legislature stated that \u201c consumers of alcoholic beverages in this state should not be discriminated against or disadvantaged by paying unjustifiably higher prices for brands of liquor than are paid by consumers in other states \u201d (L. 1964, ch. 531, \u00a7 8). Going beyond the recommendations just mentioned, the Legislature also amended section 101-b by adding to its subdivision 3 the provisions which \u2014\u25a0 as since amended and re-lettered (L. 1967, ch. 798, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4) \u2014 are now paragraphs (d) through (i). They are unusual, if not unique, in the field of consumer protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Paragraph (d), the key to the amendments, requires the \u201c owner \u201d of a \u201c brand of liquor \u201d to include in the monthly schedule of prices it files with the Authority \u2014 the filing of the schedules themselves has been mandated since 1942 (\u00a7 101-b, subd. 3, par. [a] [L. 1942* ch. 899, \u00a7 1])\u2014a verified \u2018 \u2018 affirmation * * * that the * * \u201d <em>price </em>of liquor to wholesalers set forth in such schedule is <em>no higher than the lowest price </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>which <em>such item </em>of. liquor will be sold \u201d anywhere else in the country during the month for which such schedule is in effect. (Emphasis .supplied.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to each1 \u2018 item, \u2019 \u2019 the underlying schedule must state, pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision 3, the \u201c exact brand or trade name * * * nature of contents, age and proof where stated on the label \u201d. Paragraph (f) of that same subdivision, in effect, prohibits the purchase or sale of <em>\u201c </em>any item \u201d not covered by an affirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Upon the most cursory reading, it is evident that amended section 101-b is a regulation of <em>prices </em>only and not a regulation of the <em>kinds </em>of liquor products which may or may not be sold in New York. The discrimination at which it is aimed is, manifestly, solely that involved in offering the <em>same </em>product at higher prices in this State than elsewhere. There is not a word in the statute which confers upon the Authority the power to forbid a distiller to withdraw one of its products from sale in New York or to make the offering of one of a distiller\u2019s products a condition to .the approval of a label for a different product. It is true that, if a distiller sells only its more expensive whiskeys in New York, while making a wider selection of its products, including cheaper items, available in other states, it practices a kind of discrimination against the New York consumer. But, quite plainly, the Legislature did not undertake to control this kind of discrimination, nor \u2014\u2022 and this is most important:\u2014\u25a0 to establish any standards or criteria for doing so. Had such regulation been intended, the draftsman of the statute could readily have found clear and direct language to express the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Nothing that we have said, of course, implies that a <em>concerted </em>withdrawal of cheaper products by distillers who should be in competition might not violate antitrust laws. (See U. S. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; General Business Law, \u00a7\u00a7 340-347.) Nor does the Authority lack power, under section 107-a, to exercise discretion with respect to new labels describing liquors which are <em>not significantly different </em>from one or more others, whether such others are still being offered by the distiller on the New York market or have been withdrawn from that market. In such cases, the Authority might well have basis for concluding that the manipulation of labels for what are, essentially, the <em>same </em>products undermines the price regulations established by amended section 101-b and violates reasonable standards of labeling under section 107-a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\">In the present case, however, it is the Authority itself, as already noted, which has determined that the two products are, in fact, <em>different (supra, </em>p. 35). Under these circumstances, it must be concluded that the Authority is not seeking to enforce the policies against <em>price </em>discrimination embodied in section 101-b but is attempting, instead, to enforce an unauthorized policy of its own directed against <em>product </em>discrimination. The Authority may not depart from the directives and standards laid down in the statute and legislate for itself to this extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">We have left for the last the question\u2014really the threshold question\u2014of ,the reviewability of the Authority\u2019s action under section 107-a because what has been said thus far helps to dispose of it. Since the Authority\u2019s attempted regulation lies, in our opinion, completely beyond the scope of its statutory powers, the court may not be barred from hearing a challenge to the administrative action. As we noted in <em>Matter of Guardian Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bohlinger </em>(308 N. Y. 174, 183),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Even where judicial review is proscribed by statute, the courts have the power and the duty to make certain that the administrative official has not acted in excess of the grant of authority given 'him by statute or in disregard of the standard prescribed by the legislature. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">However, even if the Authority\u2019s action were well within the compass of section 107-a, it would not be immune to judicial review. Section 121 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law lists, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>among the actions of the Authority which may be reviewed by the Supreme Court, \u201c [r] efusal * * * to issue * * * a permit. \u2019 \u2019 The term \u2018 \u2018 permit \u2019 \u2019 is not defined in the statute (of. Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, \u00a7 3, \u201c Definitions \u201d), although the word appears in many places (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 90 through 99-b). Since approval of a brand label registration enables the applicant to use the label, and denial of the registration prevents such use in the sale of liquor, the approval of such a registration is equivalent, in substance, to the issuance of a \u2018 \u2018 permit. \u2019 \u2019 Indeed, a \u201c brand label use permitas such, was issuable\u2014pursuant to former section 99-a (L. 1963, ch. 204, \u00a7 32) \u2014at the time the brand label registration requirements were added to section 107-a and at the time .the present case was before the Authority. The Authority\u2019s form of application, used by the petitioner in the present case, requested \u2014 to quote from the text of the document \u2014\u25a0 \u2018 \u2018 approval of the registration of the Brand Label specified [by the applicant] and issuance of a Brand Label Use <em>Permit </em>\u201d. This was enough, it appears to us, to constitute the Authority\u2019s adverse determination a <em>\u201c </em>refusal to issue * * * a permit \u201d within the meaning of section 121. The repeal of section 99-a in 1968 (L. 1968, oh. 597, \u00a7 1) should not be construed as expressing a legislative intention to remove brand label registration from the scope of judicial review. The sole purpose of the repeal was, evidently, to substitute for the permit fee theretofore payable to the Authority a tax of equivalent amount payable under the Tax Law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For the reasons stated, a refusal to approve a brand label is subject to the same standards of review as apply to the other actions of the Authority listed in section 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In sum, then-\u2014\u25a0 since the proposed label for the petitioner\u2019s eight-year-old bourbon was not deceptive or incomplete and since the Authority concedes that six-year-old and eight-year-old bourbons are different products, there was no lawful basis, under section 107-a or section 101-b of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law \u2014\u25a0 or any other provision of statute \u2014 for the Authority\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s application for a brand label registration and it should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs to the petitioner in this court and in the Appellate Division, and the matter remanded to 'Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein. v</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\">. The petitioner also sought a more general direction to the Authority to <em>\u201c </em>accept registrations of brands of different ages or proofs or formulas with the same brand name.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. In an affidavit submitted to the court at Special Term, Donald S. Hostetter, Chairman of the State Liquor Authority, stated that <em>\u201c </em>in no wise is the Authority saying, nor has it ever been urged, that 6 year old liquor is the same as 8 year old liquor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\">. In full text, paragraph (a) of subdivision 4 of section 107-a reads- as follows: \u201cNo liquor, wine or beer shall be labeled, offered or advertised for sale unless in accordance with such regulations and unless the brand or 'trade name label affixed to or imprinted upon the container of such alcoholic beverage shall have been registered with and approved by the' authority and the appropriate fee paid as provided for in this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">. Thus, since 1942 it had been illegal to sell liquor to wholesalers or retailers at prices other than those specified in monthly schedules required to be filed by distillers and certain other distributors (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, \u00a7 101-b, subds. 3, 4 [L. 1942, ch. 899, as amd. by L. 1948, ch. 551]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. The commission reported that New York\u2019s price-fixing policies had no significant .effect on temperance and appeared to benefit only the distillers. The existing law, it was found, resulted in the payment by the New York consumer of sharply higher prices for liquor than were charged elsewhere in the country.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">. Paragraph (d) .of subdivision 3 of section 101-b reads, in somewhat greater detail, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\"><em>\u201c </em>There shall be filed ,in connection with and when filed shall be deemed part of the schedule filed for a brand of liquor pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision an affirmation duly verified by the owner of such brand of liquor * * * that the bottle .and case <em>price </em>of liquor to wholesalers set forth in such schedule is <em>no higher than the lowest price </em>at which <em>such item </em>of liquor will be sold by such brand owner * * * [anywhere in the United iStates] * * * at any time during the calendar month for which such a schedule shall be in effect\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. The Authority has, \u00a1the record indicates, dealt informally with several such eases, in which, for example, the distiller merely changed the proof by a fraction of one percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\">.

And whether there was such manipulative use of the difference between the two kinds of bourbon is a question exclusively for the Authority to determine if there is any rational basis to support its view.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Appellate Division majority concluded that there was a rational basis for the Authority\u2019s determination and I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">While there is a difference between six and eight-year-old. bourbon it is a difference of limited degree both as to quality and cost of production. A crucial circumstance which makes understandable and rational the action of the Authority is that the distiller\u2019s application for the new eight-year-old label was coupled with its request to withdraw its six-year-old bourbon from the New York market. A further crucial circumstance is that the distiller does not propose to withdraw its six-year-old bourbon in markets outside the State where it also sells eight-year-old bourbon. As stated by the Appellate Division: \u2018 \u2018 By this mechanism the petitioner could maintain the price of a medium bourbon in New York (eight-year-old) and market a medium age bourbon throughout the country (six-year-old) at any price it saw fit.\u201d (29 A D 2d, p. 360.) In rejecting the distiller\u2019s application the Authority was not seeking to control what was sold but to enforce the price regulation features of the statute (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, \u00a7 101-b, subd. 3, pars. [d]-[i]), at least as they affected medium age bourbon, in which class both the six-year-old and eight-year-old bourbon fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The net effect, therefore, of the .distiller\u2019s action, as now approved by this court, is to remove from the New York market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the lower-priced six-year bourbon. In this way the legislative and statutory policy of the State to give New York consumers most favored price treatment afforded consumers in other States is denied in this instance. I also conclude that the Authority\u2019s power to approve or disapprove labels implies a power to reject a label if it serves the purpose of evading other provisions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Accordingly, I dissent and vote to affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Judges Burke, Scjleppi, Bergan, Keating- and Jasen concur with Chief Judge Fuld; Judge Bkeitel dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Order reversed, with costs to petitioner in this court and in the Appellate Division, and matter remitted to Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
