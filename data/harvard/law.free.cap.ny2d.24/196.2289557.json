This court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(260 N. Y. 171) expressed, in 1932, the hope and the purpose of the framers of the early New York juvenile delinquency statutes, beginning with the Children\u2019s Court Act in 1922, that the proceedings were not designed to be punitive but were for the protection and training of a child found in difficulty; and would be administered by humane and parentally minded Judges whose end was not to punish, but to save the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The successful juvenile court is concerned primarily with the totality of factors which cause a child to meet difficulty in his life, and only incidentally with the event which brings the child to the court, which may itself play only a small role in that problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The Judge, acting as a mature and well-balanced parent, tries to find the answer to the child\u2019s trouble; and only if all else fails and there is no other recourse, does he commit the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>to any institution, and even then he tries to find the one best suited to the child\u2019s needs and having the fewest punitive policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Nothing could be farther removed in temper and purpose than this from the criminal court for adults. And although it has failed, as all human institutions have a tendency j;o do, always to reach its highest purpose; and has sometimes in method and result seemed to act like a criminal court, it is not reasonably arguable that in the half-century or so of its existence in the United States the juvenile court has profoundly changed for the better the way children in difficulty are treated by the public legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In such a court, the accoutrements of due process evolved from the 18th Century experience with the rigors of common-law prosecutions \u2014 public trial, shields against self incrimination, adversary inquiry into the single event which brought the child to court \u2014 seem irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">As Judge Crouch wrote for the majority in <em>Lewis </em>(p. 177): <em>\u201c </em>For the purposes of this case, the fundamental point is that the proceeding was not a criminal one. The State was not seeking to punish a malefactor. It was seeking to salvage a boy who was in danger of becoming one. In words which have been often quoted, \u00a3 the problem for determination by the judge is not, Has this boy or girl committed a specific wrong, but What is he, how has he become what he is, and what had best be done in his interest and in the interest' of the state to save him from a downward career. \u2019 (23 Harvard Law Review, 104, 119,\u00a3 The Juvenile Court,\u2019 by Julian W. Mack.) * * * Since the proceeding was not a criminal one, there was neither right to nor necessity for the procedural safeguards prescribed by constitution and statute in criminal cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In that case an important constitutional question was squarely met. The Trial Judge examined the 15-year-old boy as to the facts of alleged delinquency in a private hearing, but in the presence of his family and clergyman, without warning against self incrimination (pp. 173-174). The boy admitted the facts and on his admission the adjudication of juvenile delinquency Avas made. It was not, Judge Crouch noted, in examining the constitutional problem, <em>\u201c </em>a criminal trial and there was no defect\u201d (p. 174).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Apart from how the Constitution may he read in its effect on highly informal proceedings looking into the circumstances in which a child is failing in normal growth and in adaptation, there is a genuine and responsibly held difference of opinion about what is best to do. Many sociologists believe that the criteria of the criminal law and its methodology, including protection against self incrimination and the right to counsel in the case of the young child, impair rather than help a process designed not as punishment but as salvation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">A lawyer\u2019s traditional professional duty in an adversary proceeding is to do what he can and fight as hard as he can, to see his client wins. In the criminal case this is to see his client acquitted, the charge reduced, or the punishment minimized. But a child\u2019s best interest is not necessarily, or even probably, promoted if he wins in the particular inquiry which may bring him to the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">And since the lawyer as advocate ought not be stultified in his professional obligation to sustain his cause, he should likewise not be cast in the role of impartial adviser to the court on the social problem involved; and, thus, the original view of the founders of the juvenile court that it would be better not to have formal adversary proceedings remains essentially valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Self incrimination in the historic Star Chamber sense in which the Bill of Bights was concerned is thought by proponents of the juvenile court to have no relevancy to a process in which the particular act which brought the child to the inquiry may play no significant part in an attempt to see him in his total environment and to help him. In theory, at least, there is nothing to incriminate and there is no criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">There is, naturally enough, another side of the coin. A different view is shared by a number of lawyers concerned. They see some danger of erosion of constitutional rights in the informality and lack of <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>legality \u2019 \u2019 in the way juvenile court Judges in practice deal with the children\u2019s cases. And they are concerned, also, that \u2018 \u2018 fairness \u2019 \u2019 by the customary standards of the adult criminal case is being withheld from children in juvenile courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">It is pointed out that the event that brings the child before the Judge is, by definition, the equivalent of a crime, i.e., an \u201cact which, if done by an adult, would constitute a crime \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(Family Ct. Act, \u00a7 712, subd. [a]). It is noted, additionally, that the disposition of the case, although not penal in nature, may sometimes be not much different from that of youthful offenders convicted under the criminal laws. Under very limited circumstances, for example, the juvenile may be committed to Elmira Deception Center or other similar institutions (Family Ct. Act, \u00a7 758, subd. [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Careful and fully explicit safeguards, however, are provided in the statute to insure that an adjudication of this kind is not a <em>\u201c </em>conviction \u201d (\u00a7 781); that it affects no right or privilege, including the right to hold public office or to obtain a license ('\u00a7 782); and a cloak of protective confidentiality is thrown around all the proceedings (\u00a7\u00a7 783-784). These protections have had full judicial implementation <em>(Matter of Giroffi, </em>283 App. Div. 890; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>273 App. Div. 492; <em>Matter of Hambel </em>[Levine], 243 App. Div. 530; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Erie R. R. Co., </em>225 App. Div. 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Although this plenary protection to good name and status is very different from the residual disabilities flowing from criminal conviction, the argument in favor of criminal court protective rights for delinquent children continues to stress the possible loss of freedom as one consequence of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The juvenile court system, on the basis of that argument, has had the singular misfortune of being impaled on the sharp points of a few hard constitutional cases (e.g., <em>Matter of Gault, </em>387 U. S. 1; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U. S. 541; <em>Matter of Gregory W., </em>19 N Y 2d 55). This possibility and, in the particular instances, the actuality, were the bases of reasoning by which the court in cases such as <em>Gault </em>and <em>Gregory W. </em>applied criminal law protective techniques to the juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">They were not only hard cases; each had facts easily dramatized. They were not typical of the vast mass of juvenile proceedings in the United States. In <em>Gault </em>there was an absence of elemental fairness. The complainant was not sworn and did not appear in court; there was no adequate notice of the proceedings 'given to the parents; there was no counsel or offer of counsel; no record was made of proceedings; there was no right of appeal or review; and the juvenile court Judge, explain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ing his action, seemed to have a somewhat vague notion of the alternatives open to him (387 IT. S. 1, <em>28-29). </em>The court, accordingly, was able to reach the encompassing conclusion (p. 29): \u201c The essential difference between Gerald\u2019s case and a normal criminal case is that safeguards available to adults were discarded in Gerald\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The facts in <em>Matter of Gregory W. (supra) </em>were almost equally dramatic. One 12-year-old child, mentally disturbed, was detained by police and questioned for 24 hours; the other 12-year-old child for 10 hours. This period was regarded as unreasonable and their admissions held to have been coerced. And <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(383 IT. S. 541, <em>supra), </em>the precursor of <em>Gault, </em>was also a hard case. There, the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia waived jurisdiction of that court and transferred petitioner to the District Court for criminal proceedings against him with a resulting heavy penal sentence without giving him an adversary right to oppose the waiver. This decision was held arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It can scarcely be doubted that <em>Gault </em>and <em>Kent </em>have had an adverse effect on the concept of a juvenile court free from the technicalities of the criminal law. (See, e.g., the comment of the Supreme Court of Dlinois on <em>Gault </em>that the <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>opinion exhibits a spirit that transcends the specific issues there involved \u201d <em>[In re Urbasek, </em>38 Ill. 2d 535, 541].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Historically, as it has been seen, a majority of this court gave ungrudging support to the concept of a system of dealing with children\u2019s cases free from criminal law technicalities in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(260 N. Y. 171, <em>supra). </em>It is interesting to note that the present constitutional issue was joined in that case almost 40 years ago in the strong dissent of Judge Crane, with whom Judge Kellogg concurred, in which substantially all of the objections that have since developed were examined, especially the protection against self incrimination. (See 260 N. Y., pp, 179-185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">But, of course, the decisions of the majority in <em>Lewis </em>could no longer survive the constitutional views which now are dominant ; and, indeed, the Legislature has given extensive statutory implementation to procedures which in many respects run the juvenile procedure in close parallel to the adult criminal courts. (See, e.g., Family Ct. Act, art. 7: Part 2, Custody and Detention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u00a7'\u00a7 721, 724, 726, 729; Part 3, Preliminary Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 731, 736, 738; Part 4, Hearings, \u00a7\u00a7 741, 744, 745, 746, 748; Part 5, Orders, \u00a7\u00a7 752, 758; Part 6, New Hearing and Reconsideration of Orders, \u00a7 761.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Whether these techniques really help the child, whose interest it is the declared purpose of the State to protect, remains a debated question, unresolved between the advocates of two quite different methods and two different philosophies. It seems probable we cannot have the best of two worlds. If the emphasis is on constitutional rights something of the essential freedom of method and choice which the sound juvenile court Judge ought to have is lost; if range be given to that freedom, rights which the law gives to criminal offenders will not be respected. But the danger is that we may lose the child and his potential for good while giving him his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Some such discussion as that which has been undertaken seems useful to put the present case in perspective. It involves the constitutionality of section 744 (subd. [b]) of the Family Court Act, which is one of the provisions governing the procedure in juvenile delinquency. The section provides that any determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory hearing that the child did an act <em>\u201c </em>must be based on a preponderance of the evidence \u201d. In a criminal case the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt; that is, if there be a \u201c reasonable doubt\u201d he is \u201c entitled to an acquittal\u201d (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7389).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The Family Court in the present case made a specific finding by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the fact alleged against the 12-year-old appellant, to the effect he had removed $112 from petitioner\u2019s pocketbook and stolen it, was true. The law guardian contemporaneously raised the question of the constitutional sufficiency of the finding. The sufficiency of the finding is the only question on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">It is not easy to define for the purposes of practical application the tenuous difference between <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>beyond a reasonable doubt \u201d as a quantitative or qualitative test of proof, and \u201c by a fair preponderance of the evidence \u201d, It is enough to say that for a very long time one has been used in the criminal law and the other in civil law, and that the profession accepts the view that beyond a reasonable doubt is a \u201c higher \u2019 \u2019 standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>But the standard is in the present ease expressly stated by statute; and, indeed, by a statute which goes very far in providing due process safeguards for children in delinquency proceedings in Family Court. The delinquency status is not made a crime; and the proceedings are not criminal. There is, hence, no deprivation of due process in the statutory provision; and, since the proceeding is quite different from a criminal prosecution, it seems reasonable to think there is no substantial equal protection question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The decision in <em>Gault, </em>in which there was almost a total absence of due process, is not necessarily to be read as an inters diction of this standard of proof required by the New York statute. It is not an absence of procedural due process that a noncriminal status determination have a different measure of proof than that required for conviction of crime. This was the holding of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals after a reading of <em>Gault </em>in <em>Matter of Wylie </em>(231 A. 2d 81). A contrary conclusion was reached in Illinois in <em>In re Urbasek (38 </em>Ill. 2d 535, <em>supra). </em>The question was not decisive in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gostanso </em>(395 F. 2d 441),' where the judgment of adjudication was affirmed, and the Trial Judge had applied what the court regarded as a proper standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b235-7\">Chief Judge Fuld (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AVW\">There is much in the court\u2019s opinion with which I agree but on the narrow question presented\u2014 the standard of proof to be applied in proceedings against juvenile delinquents\u2014-it seems to me that the answer has been virtually foreclosed by the Supreme Court. In my view, the decision in <em>Matter of Gault </em>(387 U. S. 1) requires the conclusion that due process of law is violated if a child may be found to have committed a crime and incarcerated for an appreciable length of time on evidence less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">I do not believe that a lesser standard may be justified on the theory that the proceedings\u2014which may result in confinement of a 12-year-old boy in a State Training School for as long as six years \u2014 are designed, in the words of the court (opn., p. 197), \u201cnot to punish, but to save the child.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>rationale, it seems to me, was decisively rejected by the court\u2019s approach to the problem in <em>Gault. </em>\u201c Ultimately,\u201d the court there wrote (387 U. S., at p. 27), \u201cwe confront the reality of that portion of the Juvenile Court process with which we deal in this case. A boy is charged with misconduct. The boy is committed to an institution where he may be restrained of liberty for years. It is of no constitutional consequence \u2014 and of limited practical meaning\u2014that the institution to which he is committed is called an Industrial School. The fact of the matter is that, however euphemistic the title, a <em>\u2018 </em>receiving home \u2019 or an * industrial school \u2019 for juveniles is an institution of confinement in which the child is incarcerated for a greater or lesser time. His world becomes <em>1 </em>a' building with whitewashed walls, regimented routine and institutional hours. . . .\u2019 <em>[Holmes\u2019 Appeal, </em>379 Pa. 599, 616, Musmanno, J.,. dissenting.] Instead of mother and father and sisters and brothers and friends and classmates, his world is peopled by guards, custodians, state employees, and <em>\u2018 </em>delinquents \u2019 confined with him for anything from waywardness to rape and homicide. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Once the Supreme Court decided that the child was entitled, as a matter of due process, to notice of charges, to counsel, to the rights of confrontation and examination and the privilege against self incrimination\u2014because the proceeding is \u201c comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution\u201d (387 U. S., at p. 36) and because the \u201csafeguards available to adults\u201d in \u201c a normal criminal case * * * [may not be] discarded in [a child\u2019s] case\u201d (p. 29)\u2014it necessarily follows that a finding of guilt, which entitles a court to confine a boy until his eighteenth year, may not be predicated upon less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">There may not be any decision expressly stating that the reasonable doubt standard is an essential aspect of due process in criminal prosecutions. But who could question that it is? That-standard has been so deeply imbedded in our law, .is so fundamental and universal, that no one would venture in an ordinary criminal case to apply a standard less stringent. It is essential to due process not only because of the deprivation of liberty which could result but also because of the vital part it plays in the entire criminal procedural scheme. For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the burden of .proof is closely related to the privilege against self incrimination\u2014as a device to offset the adverse effect of a defendant\u2019s failure to defend himself. It also compensates for lack of discovery proceedings and disclosure devices traditionally available to ordinary civil litigants. Manifestly, a person accused of a crime, whether he be an adult defendant in a criminal case, or a child charged as a delinquent, would be at a severe disadvantage, a disadvantage amounting to a lack of fundamental fairness, if he could be adjudged guilty and imprisoned for years on the strength of the same evidence as would suffice in a civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">My conclusion is not without support in judicial decision. At least two courts have also concluded that, in the light of <em>Gault </em>(387 U. S. 1, <em>supra), </em>due process demands that the proof in a delinquency proceeding be beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>In re Urbasek, </em>38 Ill. 2d 535; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Costanzo, </em>395 F. 2d 441; see, also, Dorsen and Rezneck, Gault and Juvenile Law, 1 ABA Family Law Quart., No. 4 [Dec., 1967] pp. 1, 25-27. But see, contra, <em>In re Wylie, </em>231 A. 2d 81; <em>De Backer </em>v. <em>Brainard, </em>183 Neb. 461, probable jurisdiction noted Feb. 24, <em>1969, </em>393 U. S. 1076.) Thus, in. the <em>Costaneo </em>ease (395 F. 2d 441, <em>supra), </em>the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared (pp. 444-445):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201c Our precise question then is whether for purposes of the required quantum of evidence, no less than for notice, \u2022 counsel, cross-examination, and the privilege against self-incrimination, a federal juvenile proceeding which may lead to institutional commitment must be regarded as \u2018 criminal. \u2019 We hold that it must be so regarded. No verbal manipulation or use of a benign label can convert a four-year commitment following conviction into a civil proceeding. [Case cited.] The Government\u2019s burden in a juvenile case, therefore, is to prove all elements of the offense \u2018 beyond a reasonable doubt, \u2019 just as in a prosecution against an adult. * * * In practical importance to a person charged with crime the insistence upon a high degree of proof ranks as high as any other protection. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201c It would appear a patent violation of due process and equal protection of the law if a juvenile were found to have committed a crime on less evidence than would be required in the case of an adult, especially since the consequences of the adjudications are essentially the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">And in the <em>Urbasek </em>case (38 Ill. 2d 535, <em>supra), </em>the high court of Illinois, noting that the language of the opinion in <em>Gault \u201c </em>exhibits a spirit that transcends the specific issues there involved \u201d (p. 541), wrote that (pp. 540-541)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201c * * * it would seem that the reasons which caused the Supreme Court to import the constitutional requirements of an adversary criminal trial into delinquency hearings logically require that <em>a finding of delinquency for </em>misconduct, <em>which would be criminal if charged against an </em>adult, <em>is valid only when the acts of delinquency are proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have been committed by the juvenile charged, </em>[p. 540] <em>\u201c * * * </em>When we eschew legal fictions and adopt a realistic view of the consequences that attach to a determination of delinquency and a commitment to a juvenile detention home, \u2018 juvenile quarters \u2019 in a jail or a State institution * * * we can neither truthfully nor fairly say that such an institution is devoid of penal characteristics. <em>* * </em>* the incarcerated juveniles\u2019 liberty of action is restrained just as effectively as that of the adult inmates serving terms in State and Federal prisons, [p. 541] \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">It may well be, as the court observes (opn., p. 202), that there is but a <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>tenuous difference\u201d betwe\u00e9n <em>\u201c </em>a fair preponderance of the evidence \u2019 \u2019 and <em>\u20181 </em>proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d But the simple fact is that the Family Court Judge in the ease before us saw a difference between those standards. In reaching his decision that the appellant was guilty, he explicitly acknowledged that he was basing his findings of fact on the <em>11 </em>preponderance of evidence \u2019 \u2019 and frankly admitted that the proof fell short of establishing guilt or delinquency beyond a reasonable doubt. Along with Dorsen and Rezneek (Grault and Juvenile Law, 1 ABA Family Law Quart., No. 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>[Dec., 1967], 1, p. 27, <em>supra), </em>I too find it difficult to understand \u201c how the distinctive objectives of the juvenile court give rise to a legitimate institutional interest in finding a juvenile to have committed a violation of criminal law on less evidence than if he were an adult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">It has been aptly said that the prosecution\u2019s duty to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt <em>\u201c </em>is a requirement and a safeguard of due process of law in the historic, procedural content of \u2018 due process. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>343 U.

With the <em>Gault </em>case on the books, it follows, I suggest, that, where a 12-year-old child is charged with an act of stealing which renders him liable to confinement for as long as six years, then, as a matter of due process, as well as of equal protection, the case against him must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Judges Scileppi, Breeder and Jasen concur with Judge Bergan ; Chief Judge Fixed dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judges Burke and Keating concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
