The <em>Despatch, </em>belonging to the plaintiffs, with a cargo also owned by them, sailed from <em>Nerv-York </em>on the 29th <em>August, </em>1806, for <em>St. Tago de Cuba, </em>commanded by <em>L. Rogers, </em>who was also <em>supercargo </em>and <em>consignee </em>for the voyage. The vessel arrived at <em>St. Jago de Cuba, </em>where the outward cargo was sold by <em>Rogers, </em>and part of the proceeds invested in a return cargo, consisting of indigo, tortoise shell, and specie, equal in value to the amount insured; and on the 26th <em>April, </em>1809, the vessel sailed under the command of <em>Rogers, </em>on the voyage insured, and arrived at <em>New Orleans </em>on the 8th <em>Tune, </em>1809, where <em>Rogers, </em>the master, fraudulently converted the specie to his own use, and never further prosecuted the voyage, but afterwards absconded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-10\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the court on the above case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Adl\"><em>D. B. Ogden, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARx\">contended that this was a clear case of barratry, and the only possible objection he could anticipate to the plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery was, that when the master was also supercargo and consignee, there could be no barratry in regard to the <em>cargo, </em>or there could be no barratry, in that respect, where the owner of the cargo was at the same time owner of the vessel. As to this objection, he relied on the case of <em>Earle </em>v. <em>Rowcroft,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>considered it as hardly deserving a serious answer; but that it need only <em>to </em>be stated to show that it had no weight. <em>Barratry </em>is there laid down to be any fraudulent or criminal conduct against the owners of ship or goods, by the master or mariners, in breach of the trust reposed in them, and to the injury of the owners, though not done with intent to injure the owners,- or to benefit, at their expense, the master or mariners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Wells, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ1\">The doctrine of barratry is not founded on principles of natural justice. Its operation against insurers, who do not appoint, and seldom have any knowledge of, the master or mariners, is hard and unjust. The court, therefore, will not feel disposed to extend it, but will rather confine it where it ought to be confined, to the <em>owners of the vessel, </em>who have the appointment of the master. Lord Mansfield<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> thought it extraordinary that the doctrine should ever have crept into the law of insurance, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-4\">1. The first proposition for which I shall contend is, that there cannot be barratry, in relation to the cargo, when it is owned by the owner of the vessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\"><em>Marshall</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>defines barratry \u201c any act committed by the master or mariners, for an unlawful or fraudulent purpose, contrary to their duty to their owners, and whereby the owners sustain an injury.\u201d The definition of Park is more accurate; that any act of the master or mariners, which is of a criminal or fraudulent nature, or which is grossly negligent, tending to their own benefit, to the prejudice of the <em>owners of the ship, </em>without their consent or privity, is barratry.\u201d This definition is adopted by <em>Brackenridgc, </em>J. in the case of <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Insurance Company of Pennsylvania,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>omitting the words \u201c tending to their own benefit.\u201d All these definitions agree in one essential circumstance, that the act done must be to the prejudice of the <em>owners of the vessel. </em>This prejudice may be either <em>direct </em>and <em>immediate, </em>or <em>consequential. </em>For when the cargo is fraudulently disposed of by the master, it is <em>consequentially </em>injurious to the owners of the vessel, because they are responsible for the embezzlement of the cargo. But if no injury, direct or consequential, arises to the owners of the vessel, there can be no <em>barratry. </em>Here the plaintiffs are owners of both vessel and cargo, and as they cannot, in the character of owners of the vessel, be answerable to themselves, as owners of the cargo, no such injury can arise, and so there is no barratry. This is an insurance on the cargo only. If the vessel only had been insured, or if the cargo had belonged to third persons, then there might have been barratry\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoM\">On examination, every case of barratry, reported in the <em>English </em>books, will be found to militate against the distinction which has been stated by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. They will be found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>cases in which the policy of insurance was on the <em>vessel </em>only, or where the <em>cargo </em>insured belonged to <em>third </em>persons, and not to the owner of the vessel. In <em>Stamma </em>v. <em>Brown,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the goods insured were shipped by a third person. In <em>Elton </em>v. <em>Brogden</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the policy was on the ship. In <em>Vallejo </em>v. Wheeler<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> goods were insured; the ship belonged to <em>Willis, </em>who chartered her to <em>Darwin, </em>who set her up as a general ship, and <em>Vallejo </em>was one of the shippers of goods. In <em>Nutt </em>v. <em>Bourdieu,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the policy was on goods shipped by a third person. <em>Lockyer </em>v. <em>Offley</em><footnotemark><em>||</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was on the ship, and the act of <em>barratry </em>was smuggling. In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Hunter</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the insurance was on goods shipped by a third person. In <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Byron</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the policy was also on goods shipped by a third person; and the act of barratry consisted in deviating for the purpose of taking prizes, and which made the owners of the vessel, under the charter-party, liable for damages. In <em>Phynn </em>v. <em>Royal Exchange Insurance </em>Company,<footnotemark>\u2021\u2021</footnotemark> there was a policy on goods, but it does not appear who owned the goods. In the case of <em>Lewin </em>v. <em>Suasso, </em>cited by <em>Park, </em>(128.) it is not distinctly stated whether the insurance was on the ship or cargo, but as the barratrous act was alleged to be a fraudulent sale of the vessel, the inference is irresistible that the policy was on the ship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-19\">In the decisions of our own courts will be found two cases which seem to militate against the proposition which I have endeavoured to support. In all the other cases, the insurance was either on the <em>ship </em>alone, or on goods owned by a third -person.<footnotemark>\u00a7\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-20\">The case of <em>Crousillat </em>v. Ball,<footnotemark>||||</footnotemark> in the supreme court of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>arose on a policy on ship and cargo, both of which were owned by the plaintiff; and <em>Yeatcs, J. </em>before whom the cause was tried, directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff, on the ground of the barratry of the master. In that cause, however, the distinction now raised was not made by the counsel, nor considered by the court. In the case of <em>Wilcocks and others </em>v. <em>Union Insurance Company,</em><footnotemark><em>***</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is stated in a <em>note to Condy\u2019s </em>edition of <em>Marshall on Insurance, </em>that the plaintiffs were owners both of the vessel and cargo; but the fact is not stated in the report of the case by Binney,<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> and there is reason to conclude that Mr. <em>Condy </em>must have been mistaken as to that fact. There is not, then, a single decision, in our own courts, except that of <em>Crousillat </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>where the plaintiff being owner both of the vessel and cargo, recovered against the insurer on the ground of barratry. The <em>American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u2022decisions, in this respect, are in unison with those of the <em>English </em>courts- This court, therefore, in adopting what I conceive to be a solid distinction, will not violate any authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-3\">2. Where the master is also <em>supercargo, </em>or <em>consignee, </em>and the barratrous act may be referred to his character as <em>consignee, </em>the insured cannot recover on the ground of the barratry of the master. Here the master was <em>consignee </em>of the cargo, and so it is distinguishable from the case of <em>Earle </em>v. <em>Rowcroft,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the captain was a supercargo.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-4\">\n<em>Emerigon,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apv\">notwithstanding the marine ordinance of France, is of opinion that the owner of the ship cannot be insured against the barratry of the master, because, being himself answerable, according to the <em>Roman </em>law,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> for the master he employs, he cannot, as <em>insured, </em>throw <em>the burden on the </em>insurer, who would have immediate recourse against him as <em>owner, to </em>recover back the same loss, and thereby produce a circuity of action, which is not allowed by law. And he states and discusses the precise question, whether, if the master has a commission to dispose of an adventure of goods on board, the insurer of such adventure is answerable for the loss of it, occasioned by the fault of the master; and he is of opinion that he is not, for this would make the insurer answerable to the insured for the faults of his own agent or factor. He says the clause in the policy as to <em>barratry </em>of <em>master </em>and mariner, relates only to the acts of the captain committed in quality of <em>master, </em>and not <em>to </em>such acts as render him culpable in his function of mercantile agent. And, he adds, the matter is attended with much less difficulty, if the captain, having arrived at his port of destination, squanders away the goods or adventure consigned to him; for it is then a <em>land risk, </em>for which the insurer cannot, in any manner, be responsible, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Now, in the present case, the vessel had actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>a!r\u00cdVCd at <em>New 0rleans\u2019 </em>her port of destination. Marshall, who ches the doctrine of <em>Emerigon, </em>does it with approbation, and seems not to consider it, in this respect, as different from the <em>English </em>law. And in <em>Crousillat </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>the proposition is admitted to be clear law. The court there said the plaintiff must recover, \u201cunless, the evidence shall satisfy the jury that the captain was the general agent and consignee of the plaintiff, ^ and acted as such; in <em>that case, </em>the law is equally clear, that the gets of a general agent cannot, any more than the acts of the principal himself, be denominated barratry.\u201d The doctrine of <em>Eme'figon </em>was re-co\u00a7nised by this court in the case of <em>Kendrick </em>v. Delafield,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and impliedly adopted as law. <em>Kent, </em>J. having in view the distinction, says, \u201c The fraudof the master was not committed in the character of consignee of the plaintiff\u2019s cargo, but in his character of master of the vessel. This is the true distinction on the subject, and which reconciles the doctrine in <em>Emerigon </em>with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the present case. The captain did not, and could not, lay aside his character and responsibility as master, until the vessel had performed her voyage, and arrived at the port of destination.\u201d So here, on the arrival of the <em>Dispatch </em>at <em>New Orleans, </em>the character of the captain as <em>master, </em>in relation to the goods, ceased, and his character as <em>consignee </em>commenced, and it was in the latter character that the fraudulent act was committed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1W\">\n<em>D. B. Ogden,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6B\">in reply, said, the distinction raised by the 'counsel for the defendant in discussing the first point, though ingenious, was not to be found in the books, and it is very surprising that <em>Marshall, </em>a writer so learned and correct, in his treatise on this subject, had not taken notice of such a distinction, which, if known in the law of insurance, must be allowed to be very important. The fact that it has never been stated in the argument of the numerous cases which have arisen on the subject, nor been laid down by any elementary writer or judge, so far from being in favour of the proposition, is conclusive evidence against it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-5\">It is, an erroneous argument to say that the insurers are liable, where the owners of the vessel are <em>consequentially </em>in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>jured by barratrous acts in relation to the cargo, because they are <em>consequentially </em>answerable to the owners of the cargo for the injury; but that when the injury is direct and immediate to them, it should not be <em>barratry. </em>There are numerous cases where the owners of the cargo have recovered against the insurer for the barratry, of the master. Barratry is any fraudulent act of the master to the injury of the owner of the ship or cargo. And it is because it was perfectly immaterial whether the fraudulent act ivas to the injury of the owner of the vessel or the OAvner of the cargo, that the distinction noiv attempted to be made was never thought of before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-4\">As to the second point, the opinion of Lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>in <em>Earle </em>v. <em>Rowcroft, </em>is a conclusive ansAver. The distinction between the tivo characters united in the captain, of <em>master </em>and <em>supercargo, </em>is treated as perfectly futile and groundless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-5\">Again, the act of barratry ivas not in taking the goods on shore, but because he carried them on shore fraudulently, Avith an <em>intent </em>to convert them to his oivn use. It can make no difference Avhen -or where the act is done, if the vessel'has not been so long in port as to put an end to the insurance. Here the voyage insured was from <em>New Orleans to New-York, </em>so that the risk still continued in that port.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\"> 8 <em>East, </em>126.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b51-10\"> <em>Nutt </em>v. <em>Bourdieu</em>, <em>Term Rep. </em>323\u2014330.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b51-11\"> <em>Marsh, on Ins. </em>375.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b51-12\"> 1 <em>Binney's Rep. </em>293. 322.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b51-13\"> See <em>Millar on Insurance, </em>138\u2014455. 1 <em>Emerigon, </em>366.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ad3\"><em> 2 Stra. </em>1174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A1q\"> 2 Stra. 264.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"AIy\"> <em>Comp. </em>143. and see 1 <em>Johns Rep. </em>23. n.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"ApyI\"> l <em>Term Rep. </em>31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-10\" label=\"||\">\n<p id=\"A8I\"> <em>Term Rep. </em>2. see also Term Rep. 277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-11\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AQ1M\"> 4 <em>Term Rep. 5.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-12\" label=\"\u2020\u2020\">\n<p id=\"ALg\"><em> </em>6 <em>Term Rep. </em>379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-13\" label=\"\u2021\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b52-11\"> 7 Term Rep. 503.

The law permits the oivner of the ship to be insured against the misconduct of the captain and crew, though they are his own agents, and persons of his own choice. It is too late to question the law, ivhatever we may think of its policy. And as the owner of the vessel can be insured against the <em>barratry </em>of the master, committed against the vessel, there is no reason ivhy he should not be equally insured as to the cargo. The principle is the same, and all the cases in the <em>English </em>law, which define <em>barratry, </em>render it sufficiently comprehensive to embrace the oivner of the cargo, notivithstanding he may happen to be also oivner of the ship. <em>Barratry </em>includes every spe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>cies of fraud, concerning either the ship or cargo, committed by the master in respect to his trust as master, to the injury of the owners or shippers. It was for the defendants to show the ex-ceP^on&gt; and the books afford no pretence for any; on the contrary, the case of <em>Crousillat </em>v. <em>Ball </em>(4 <em>Dall.

That was a policy on ship and cargo, and both ship and cargo were owned by the plaintiff, who recovered on the charge of barratry committed particularly in respect to the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Nor can the barratrous act be referred to the master in hie character of consignee. The cargo consisted partly of specie, and when the captain arrived at <em>New Orleans, </em>he converted the specie to his own use, abandoned the voyage, and absconded. This was clearly a criminal breach of duty in his character of master of the vessel, and though he had a superadded character of consignee, the act is properly imputable to him as master.
