This wss held, after verdict, to be a sufficient averment of the afe firmanceofthe judgment, and the loss <em>o? </em>damage consequent theieon. A verdict aids a title defectively set forth.

The plaintiff in error brought an action against the defendant, in the court below, for a <em>false return, </em>to a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>directed to him, as a justice of the peace, requiring him to certify the proceedings, &amp;c. in a certain cause before him, as a justice, in Which <em>Israel Nix </em>was plaintiff, and the plaintiff in error defendant. The declaration stated the issuing of the <em>certiorari </em>out of this court and its delivery to the defendant, who, contriving and intending, &amp;c. falsely, maliciously, and deceitfully, and in deceit of the supreme court, &amp;c. to prevent the plaintiff in error from obtaining a reversal of the said judgment, &amp;c, made a certain return, &amp;c. (setting it forth,) that \u201c the plaintiff demanded, &amp;c. and the defendant pleaded the general issueand \u201c that the defendant being called on for his testimony, alleged that his witness was gone, and he producing no testimony, I gave judgment for the plaintiff,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c and that after the plaintiff had exhibited his proof as aforesaid, and until the said cause was finally ended, the defendant did not, as is alleged in his affidavit, offer any proof to show payment of the said demand, or any other defence.\u201d Whereas in truth and fact the plaintiff did not plead the general issue, as is alleged in the said return, but pleaded payment, &amp;c. and after the plaintiff\u2019s proof before the said justice was ended, the defendant offered to prove payment of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, &amp;c. which proof the defendant <em>{Ramsay) </em>refused to receive or hear; and whereas, also, in truth and fact, the matter of the answer and return aforesaid is false, and altogether contrary to the truth, by pretext whereof he, the plaintiff in error, was not only prevented from obtaining any redress or reversal of the judgment and proceeding aforesaid, &amp;c. but he, the plaintiff in error, was also compelled to suffer imprisonment, and endure great pains both in body and mind, and to pay and expend divers large sums of money, &amp;c. to his damage, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">The defendant below pleaded the general issue, and the cause being tried, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages to 164 dollars and <em>75 </em>cents. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>below, being of opinion that a new trial ought not to be granted, unless the plaintiff would remit 60 dollars, part of the damages assessed by the jury, the plaintiff, therefore, entered a <em>remittitur </em>for that sum; and a motion was afterwards made in arrest of judgment, and the court being of opinion that the declaration' was bad and insufficient, adjudged that the plaintiff should take nothing by his bill, &amp;c. and further, that the defendant recover against the plaintiff 40 dollars and 44 cents for his costs and| charges, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-4\"><em>I. Hamilton, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJC\">contended that if there were any defects in the declaration, they were cured by the verdict. The general rule is well settled, that a verdict will aid a title defectively set out, though not a defective title.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But the declaration is substantially good. The <em>falsity </em>of the return anc* the consequent injury, are the <em>gravamen </em>of which the plaintiff complains, and they are stated with all requisite certainty.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARX\">Again, the court below ought not to have adjudged costs to be recovered by the defendant. On an arrest of judgment no costs can be given; for it is not a case within any of the statutes allowing costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae1\">As judgment was given against the plaintiff in the court below, this court, if they are of opinion that the judgment was erroneous, will give such judgment as the court below ought to have given.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AW_\">J. <em>V. </em>N.

That the declaration contained no averment that the suit on the <em>certiorari </em>was at an end, or that any judgment was given on the return. In this action as well as for a malicious prosecution, it ought to appear that the original suit was at an end.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-12\">2. The allegation of <em>falsity </em>in the return is too vague and general; it is not set forth with that precision and certainty which is requisite to enable the court below to give judgment with safety.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACFY\">3. But whether, the court below were right or wrong in arresting the judgment, this court will see from the whole record ; and may award a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><em> 1 Johns.

The principal question is, whether the plaintiff\u2019s declaration contains a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>sufficient averment, that the judgment on which the writ of <em>certiorari </em>was brought, was reversed; for the allegation of fal\u201e sity in the return is sufficiently clear and explicit. The dec\u00edaration states, that \u201c by pretext whereof (the false return) he, the said <em>Joseph, </em>was not only prevented from obtaining any redress or reversal of the judgment and proceedings aforesaid, of the said Frederick, in the said suit between him, the said <em>Frederick </em>and the said <em>Joseph; </em>but the said <em>Joseph </em>was also compelled to suffer imprisonment, and to endure great pains in body and mind, and to pay and expend divers large sums of money.\u201d After a verdict, there can be no doubt that this averment substantially sets forth the affirmance of the judgment, and the loss or damage consequent thereon. The doctrine on this subject is well settled by Sergeant <em>Williams, </em>in a note to 1 <em>Saund. </em>128. Where there is a defect, imperfection, or omission, which would have been a fatal objection on demurrer; yet if the issue joined be such as necessarily required, on the trial, proof of the facts defectively or imperfectly stated, or omitted, and without which it is not to be presumed that either the judge would direct, or the jury would have given the verdict, such defect, imperfection, or omission, is cured by the verdict at common law. This principle was admitted and enforced, in the case of <em>Bayard </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>in error. (2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>550.) Considering this, then, an imperfect setting forth of the affirmance of the judgment it is entirely cured by the verdict; for it is a settled prim ciple that a verdict aids a title defectively set out. <em>(Doug. 697. </em>2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Prac. </em>886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-17\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to consider whether costs can be given on an arrest of judgment. But I think it proper to say they are not recoverable. An arrest of judgment is a refusal to give judgment; and the statute concerning costs does not extend to such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-18\">The damages in this case having been found' by a jury, and this court being bound to give such judgment as the court below ought to have given, the judgment for the costs must be reversed, and a judgment entered that the plaintiff recover the damages found by the jury, and not remitted by the plaintiff; together with the costs of this court, and his costs in the court below; and that he be restored to all things, which he has lost by the judgment below. (2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Prac. </em>1130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">Judgment for the plaintiff,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
