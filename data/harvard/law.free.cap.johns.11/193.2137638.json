The plea, after stating the proceedings , , . under the act-, to entitle the defendant to his discharge, set it forth <em>verbatim, </em>dated 6th <em>August, </em>1811, by which the defendant, \u25a0 <em>Gomparts, </em>was discharged <em>ic </em>from all debts due from him at the time of his said assignment, or contracted for before that time, though payable afterwards,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALW\">Nathan, also, in like manner, pleaded his discharge under the same act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-12\"><em>Jacobs, </em>the other defendant, pleaded <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment, with notice of set-off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-13\">The plaintiff <em>replied </em>to the plea of <em>Gomparts </em>that the plaintiff ought not to be barred, &amp;c. because he the said <em>Gomparts, </em>together with the said <em>Nathan </em>and <em>Jacobs, </em>did assume, <em>Sec,</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-14\">\u25a0The same <em>replication </em>was also made to the plea of <em>Nathan.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-15\">To each of these replications there was a <em>general demurrer </em>and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-16\">S. <em>Jones,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADS\">jun. in support of the demurrer, contended, that the defendant was discharged from his <em>joint, </em>as well as separate, <em>debts. </em>He cited 3 <em>R.

In <em>White v. Combes and\u2018 others, </em>in which the pleadings are stated in 1 <em>Lil. Ent. </em>106. (S. C. 1 <em>Rich. K. B. Prac. </em>219\u2014227.) one of three defendants pleaded his separate discharge under the bankrupt law, and the plaintiff) admitting his bankruptcy, replied the <em>joint </em>contract, and there was judgment for the plaintiff) which, in a note, is said to have been affirmed, on a writ of error, in the exchequer chamber.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Again, a plea that the promise was made jointly with others, an(] no(; by the defendant separately, is 'a plea in abatement, not in bar.

That case could not apply here, where the defendant demurs to the replication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-7\">The discharge of the insolvent defendant is from <em>all his debts. </em>Now the debts he owes jointly with others are equally his-debts, as those he owes separately.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b204-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AhW\">This is a clear case. The insolvent is discharged from his joint as well as separate debts, for, as each partner is severally as well as jointly responsible for the partnership debts,they are equally his debts as those contracted by him individually.
