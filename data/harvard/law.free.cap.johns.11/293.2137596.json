The cargo was discharged at <em>St. Pierre, </em>which is an open roadsted in the island of <em>Martinique, </em>as soon as circumstances would permit, and the vessel was taking in a return cargo, and had on board 35 hogsheads \u00b0 \u00b0 \u2019 <em>\u00b0 </em>of molasses when, on the 7th of <em>July, </em>a violent gale of wind _ _ . _ _ _ &gt; . \u201e , , arose, by which the vessel was driven against the rocks oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>site <em>the </em>town; and after beating against them, was driven so high on shore, that when the gale subsided, and the sea became calm, there was only two or three feet water on the outside of her. The <em>supercargo, master, </em>and <em>mate, </em>whose depositions were read in evidence at the trial, said it would have cost more than' the vessel was worth to get her off. The supercargo stated that the. harbour master informed the surveyors, that it would cost about twelve hundred dollars to get the vessel off, exclusive of cables and other materials necessary for that purpose ; but all the witnesses expressed their opinion, that it would cost more than the .vessel was worth to get her off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">On the 8th of <em>July </em>the master presented a petition to the governor, for a survey of the vessel and cargo, and an order of survey was accordingly granted on the next day; and on the llth of <em>July </em>a survey was made by the harbour master, two carpenters, and two sea captains. The harbour master and carpenters were of opinion that the vessel ought to be condemned ; the ship-masters, at first, doubted, but they all, afterwards, signed the report for her condemnation. The carpenters said they would not undertake to get her off and repair her bottom for less than 2,500 or 2,600 dollars; and they all were of opinion, that it would cost more to get the vessel off and repair her, than she would be worth in the <em>United States. </em>The ship-masters were of opinion that it would cost 5,500 dollars completely to refit the vessel, and that she would not be worth, in the <em>U. States, </em>more than 4,000 dollars. The surveyors examined the vessel on the side next to the shore, from stem to stern, without wetting their feet. The vessel was sold at auction for 285 dollars, besides her sails and rigging, which were sold separately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">Three other vessels which were driven ashore at the same time, were surveyed, condemned, and sold as wrecks. Attempts were made to get the <em>Ph (mix </em>off by floating her with casks and spars, which did not succeed. The person who purchased her at auction, after several fruitless attempts to get her off, sold her to two <em>American </em>captains for 500 dollars. They testified that they tried, for several days, various means, with the assistance of 40 or 50 persons, to get her off, without success. They, afterwards, bargained with a person to give him 100 dollars, if he would get her off; and after trying two days,. he succeeded by means of a large lighter. Her bottom was repaired by-a carpenter for 40 dollars, but not so as to enable her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>&lt;o carry a cargo. The sails and rigging were purchased for her, and she arrived at <em>Salem, </em>in ballast, but leaked very badly during the passage. The whole expense of repairs, and bringing the vessel to <em>Salem, </em>was about 2,200 dollars, including 122 dollars for seamen\u2019s wages. The whole expense of getting off the vessel was about 500 dollars. After her arrival in <em>Salem </em>she was sold for 2,150 dollars. The purchasers at <em>St. Pierre </em>were of opinion, that she might, with the repairs they put on her, have gone to <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>in ballast; and that after she was got off, she might have been repaired for 100 dollars, so as to have carried a cargo to <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>and thence to <em>New-York. </em>They purchased her with a view to bring her home and sell her, as it was not in their power to bring home a cargo, on account of the non-intercourse law. Sails and rigging cost three times as much in <em>St. Pierre </em>as in the <em>United States.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-19\">The chief justice charged the jury, that if the captain of the <em>Phoenix </em>took in a cargo at <em>Martinique </em>for the <em>United States, </em>the vessel was forfeited by the non-intercourse law, and the plaintiff had no interest in her at the time of the loss. She was engaged in an illicit trade; but she might, however, lawfully take in a cargo at <em>Martinique </em>for <em>St. Bartholomew ; </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that they were surprised by this objection, and that possibly they might have shown that the cargo was intended for <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>and if the jury were of that opinion, the remaining question would be, whether there had been a partial or total loss. That the vessel was driven ashore by a tempest, and the surveyor certified that she ought to be sold; that such certificate was not conclusive, but if made <em>bona fide </em>it was strong evidence. Presuming it to be an honest survey, it stated that the vessel could not be got off and repaired for half her value; and if that was so the loss was total, and the insurers liable. That the value to he taken, in estimating whether she could be got off and repaired for one half, was not the value specified in the policy, but the value at <em>Martinique, </em>where the injury happened. It was immaterial whether she was, in fact, got off for 100 dollars, or for nothing. The case, at the time of the survey, appeared desperate, and the good fortune of the subsequent purchasers could not destroy the right of the plaintiff That there -appeared to be good cause for the certificate of the surveyors, \u2022 and if the transaction was honest, and a sound discretion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>exercised in selling the vessel, the defendants were liable for a total loss, and he was inclined to that opinion; but if the jury thought the vessel was not injured to half her value, they must find a verdict for a partial loss, or the amount of actual damage sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-3\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for a total loss. A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AuiL\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aym\">1. At the time of the loss the plaintiff had not an insurable interest in the vessel, she having become forfeited to the <em>United States </em>for a violation of the non-intercourse law. There was no illegality in the voyage insured; but as actually carried on, it was illegal, anda breach of the law of the <em>United States. </em>By the act<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it is declared to be unlawful to import into the <em>United States </em>any goods, wares, or merchandise whatever, from any port or place situated in <em>Great Britain </em>or <em>France, </em>or in any of their colonies or dependencies; and the goods as well as the ships or vessels on board of which they are laden are declared to be forfeited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au6z\">Where, by statute, a forfeiture of goods is <em>created, the </em>property, by the forfeiture, is devested out of the owner, without any proceeding on the part of the state, and becomes vested in the government.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASV\">This principle was recognised by the supreme court of the <em>United States </em>ip the case of the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grundy and another.</em><footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The lading on board, therefore, of the 35 hogsheads of h \u00b0 e1. molasses at Martinique, before the accident, with intent to bring <em>them to the United States, </em>was an act of forfeiture. All the witnesses agreed that after discharging her outward cargo, she proceeded to take in her <em>return cargo, </em>that is, a cargo home to the. <em>United States. </em>It can make no difference, in relation to the operation and effect of the law of the <em>United States, </em>whether the cargo was to be imported into the <em>United States </em>direct from <em>Martinique, </em>or circuitously, by the way of <em>St. Bartholomew.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-10\">It is stated in the case, that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel were surprised by this objection at the trial, and the judge in his charge so states it, and that the plaintiff might <em>possibly </em>have proved that the goods taken on board were intended to be delivered at <em>St. Bartholomew; </em>and on this bare hypothesis, without any proof whatever, his honour left it to the jury to find that fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>if they believed it. But the act of congress says, putting the goods on board, with intent to bring them into the <em>United States, </em>forfeits both vessel and cargo. There should have been some evidence of an intention to deliver the cargo at <em>St. Bartholomew. </em>But if it was intended to go to <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>merely as a more secure mode of conveying the property, circuitously, to the <em>United States, </em>it would not vary the case. It must be shown that it was intended to land the goods at <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>and to sell them there, and not to reship them to the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-4\"><em>2. </em>There was not such a technical total loss in this case as would justify an abandonment. The circumstances excite a strong suspicion that advantage was taken of the accident, to make the insurers pay for the vessel, rather than expose her to seizure by bringing her back to the <em>United States. </em>The hull only of the vessel was injured by striking on the beach, which was caused by the violent swelling of the sea. Not a spar, nor any part of her rigging, was damaged. The expense of getting the vessel off was estimated by the harbour-master at about 1,200 dollars; the actual expense of all the unsuccessful efforts for that purpose was 500 dollars, and an offer was finally made to get her off for 100 dollars, which succeeded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-5\">The right to abandon must be grounded on the <em>fact </em>that it would cost more than half the value <em>of </em>the vessel to repair <em>her, </em>not on the <em>opinion </em>of men. Opinion, at most, is but evidence of the fact; yet the judge charged the jury that it appeared to be a desperate case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-6\">The survey is very loose and unsatisfactory. It contains no estimate of the cost of repairs; the nature and extent of the damage are not stated. There are no facts on w'hich we can reason, or form a correct opinion. The surveyors merely gave their own broad opinion, without stating facts, by which we might test the accuracy of their judgment. If the estimates of the witnesses, and the actual expenses, as mentioned by them, are examined, the whole amount of the cost of getting the vessel off and repairing her, cannot be made to amount to more than 1,200 dollars. Then, taking the valuation of the vessel in the policy, which I contend is the true mode, it is not possible, by any process of calculation, to make out a case for abandonment. The valuation in the policy is 6,000 dollars; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>But it may be said, we must take the value of the vessel at thepiace where the accident happened. In an <em>open </em>policy, the valuation is to be taken at the <em>home </em>port. In a valued policy, the valuation agreed on must be taken. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bell and </em>others,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Lansing,Ch. J. says, \u201cThe difficulty is much increased by the estimate necessarily required of the value of the old (materials) at the <em>home </em>port, and of the new at the port of repair.\u201d He seems to take it for granted, that the rule is, except in regard to new materials, that the value at the <em>home </em>port is to be taken. The object is to bring the vessel home, and her value here is the proper measure. She may have twenty different valuations in as many foreign ports. It might be that the vessel would be worth 20,000 dollars at Martinique, and then there could be no case for abandonment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Auq_\"><em>Coldefi, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaI\">1. If the plaintiff had an interest which he could transfer, then he had an insurable interest. It was held, in the case of the <em>Anthony Mangin;</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that though, as between the party guilty of the breach of the law, and the government, the forfeiture related back so as to devest the individual, and vest the government with the property, yet that the rule did not apply to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. <em>By </em>the abandonment, in this case, the property was transferred to the insurers, who would, as <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, hold her against the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-5\">But we deny the fact of an illegal trading. The witnesses speak of the lading of a return cargo, as distinguished from the cargo carried out. They do not say it was a return cargo to <em>New-York, </em>or to the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj-X\">Stranding, followed by shipwreck, justifies an abandonment, xvithout regard to expenses of salvage or repairs.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Here the vegse\u00a1 was driven on shore, and beat over a ledge of rocks, where she remained high and dry. Various experiments were made to get her off, without success, when it was concluded to abandon any further attempt. Is not this a clear case of shipxvreck ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-7\">Again, the vessel having been regularly surveyed and condemned, as incapable of being repaired for less than half her value, there was just cause for an abandonment of the voyage. Subsequent events cannot affect the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, The rule as to half the value, is taken from the <em>French </em>law, \u25a0There, <em>the freight </em>enters into, the valuation of the vessel, ip the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>policy, and to this is added the outfits and premium; all which may far exceed the value of the vessel itself. The value in the policy may be, and often is, much too high.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-4\">In regard to the <em>cargo, </em>the value in the policy does not govern. In order to ascertain the degree of damage to the cargo, the sound and the damaged articles are sold. The policy is regarded as open for this purpose. In the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bell </em>it does not appear whether it was a valued policy or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">It is the valuation at the port of necessity that must be taken as the ground of estimate, and the charge of the judge, in that respect, was correct.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-6\"><em>Emmet, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqe\">said if the underwriters in this case were to be considered as purchasers, they were not <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, for they had notice of all the facts, and must have known the illegality of the shipment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">It is true, that stranding, followed by shipwreck, is a ground for an abandonment; but what is shipwreck ? <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It is such an injury to a ship as incapacitates her from proceeding on the voyage, unless repaired at an expense exceeding half her value.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-4\"> 10 <em>Cong. </em>sess. 2. <em>c. 91. </em>s. 4, 5. 6. vol. 9.

The first question presented in this cause is, whether the plaintiff; at the time of the loss, had an insurable interest in her.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">By the 4th section of the act to interdict the commercial intercourse between the <em>United States </em>and <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>France, </em>and their dependenoi\u00e9s, and for other purposes, passed the 1st of <em>March, </em>1809, the importation of any goods, wares, and merchandises whatever, from <em>Great Britain </em>or <em>Ireland, </em>or any of the colonies or dependencies of <em>Great Britain, </em>is prohibited; and the 6th section of the same law declares, that if any article or articles, the importation of which is prohibited by that act, shall, after the 20th of <em>May, </em>be put on board of any ship or vessel, boat, raft, or carriage, with intention to import the same into the <em>United States, </em>or the territories thereof, contrary to the true intent and meaning of the act, and with the knowledge of the owner or master of such ship or vessel, boat, raft, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>or carriage, such ship or vessel, boat, raft, or carriage, shall be forfeited, <em>Sec.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">If the master of this vessel intended the lading she had taken in at <em>St. Pierre, </em>on the 7th of <em>July, </em>1811, for the port of <em>NewYork, </em>it would, unquestionably, be a direct violation of the statute, and a forfeiture must ensue, by which the property of the vessel would immediately vest in the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In the- case of <em>Wilkins and others </em>v. <em>Despard, </em>(5 <em>Term Rep. </em>112.) it is decided that if a ship be seized as forfeited under the navigation act, the owner cannot maintain trespass against the party seizing, although the latter does not proceed to condemnation, for by the forfeiture the property is devested out of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The case of the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grundy and another, </em>(3 <em>Cranch\u2019s Rep. </em>337.) cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, rather supports this doctrine. At all events, I cannot find in the report of the case any thing opposed to it. It is there decided, that under the act of congress, of <em>December, </em>1792, which declares that if a false oath be taken, in order to procure a register for a vessel, <em>the vessel or its value </em>shall be forfeited ; that the <em>United States </em>had an election to proceed against the vessel as forfeited, or against the person who took the false oath, for its value; and that until the election was made, the property of the vessel did not vest in the <em>United States; </em>that an action could not be maintained for money had and received against the assignees of the person who took the oath, and who had become a bankrupt, the assignees having sold the vessel, and received the purchase money before seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The act of 1792 gives two remedies, the forfeiture of the-vessel, or the value, to be recovered from the person who took the false oath; consequently, the remedy is at the election of thd <em>United States. </em>The property, therefore, could hot vest until the seizure. The act, in relation to the case before us, affords but one remedy, and that is, the forfeiture of the vessel, so that the seizure is not necessary to change the property; the owner loses his right to it immediately after the commission of the act producing the forfeiture. It must be granted, that the evidence in support of such an allegation ought to be conclusive, as the effect of it goes to destroy the right of action altogether, for by the forfeiture of the vessel to the <em>United </em>States, the insurable interest of the plaintiff was at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The testimony of the supercargo in the case before us is, that the vessel had proceeded to take on board a <em>return cargo, </em>and continued so to do until the 7th of <em>July, </em>when the gale commenced. In this the captain and the mate concur; and they also state that she actually had thirty-five casks of molasses on board at the time of the disaster; no further explanation of their intentions, as to the disposition of the return cargo, is. given.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">It will not admit of a moment\u2019s doubt, that by <em>return cargo, </em>the goods for the home port were intended; and if the policy had been confined to one foreign port, no room would be left for any other explanation on the subject; but the vessel was destined for <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>with liberty to touch and trade at <em>Martinique, </em>the place where those articles were taken on board; it is, therefore, possible that an explanation might be given that the return cargo was intended for <em>St. Bartholomew. </em>No such explanation, however, appears in the ease before us. It ;was left to the jury by the judge, without any further evidence, accompanied with an observation, that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that he was surprised by the objection taken on the</p>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">part of the defendants, and that, possibly, if he had not been, he might have shown that the cargo was intended for <em>St. Bartholomew. </em>This was not shown, and without it the jury had ho ground to infer that it could be so intended, for until explained, the evidence will admit of no interpretation other than that the goods so laden were intended for the port of <em>New-York. </em>Although, on the other points, I am inclined to think the cause is with the plaintiffs, yet the objection made by the defendants\u2019 counsel, on the ground of forfeiture, being insurmountable, it cannot change the result; a new trial must, therefore, he granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
