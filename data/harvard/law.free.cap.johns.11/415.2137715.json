The sheriff then sold all the right and title of <em>James Latham </em>to this man, and the plaintiff became the purchaser. But what evidence is there that <em>Peter </em>ever was the property of <em>James Latham ? </em>If he ever was a slave, he belonged to <em>James Latham's </em>father, who died in <em>Canada, </em>subsequent to the sheriff\u2019s sale. <em>Janies Latham </em>was not the executor or administrator of his father\u2019s estate; and how does it appear that he ever acquired any property in the slave ? The circumstance that his father abandoned his property, and went to <em>Canada, </em>might, perhaps, be regarded as a virtual manumission of the mother of <em>Peter; </em>but <em>James </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>Latham </em>could have no claim to Mm, except as an executor or administrator of his father.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-14\"><em> Sable </em>v.

The question in this case is, whether the evidence is sufficient to establish the plaintiff\u2019s property in the slave.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The mother of <em>Peter </em>was the slave of the father of <em>James Latham. </em>By the statute, (sess. 11. c. 40. s. 2.) he followed, from his birth, the state and condition of his mother; and, consequently, he was the slave of <em>Latham, </em>the father of <em>James $ </em>unless, after going to <em>Canada </em>during the revolution, the master has been attainted of adhering to the enemies of the country, which would operate as a lawful manumission of the slave. <em>(Laws of New-Yorlc, </em>sess. 9. c. 58. s. 29.) But such attainder and conviction, if any, has not been shown. In 1798, the time when <em>Peter </em>was sold by the deputy sheriff it appears <em>Latham, </em>the father of <em>James, </em>was living, and resided in <em>Canada ; </em>and he then continued to be the owner. The abandonment of his family and property could not devest him of his right to the slave; and the mere possession could not create sueh an interest in <em>James Latham, his son, as to </em>subject the slave to be seized and sold for the payment of his debts. The plaintiff <em>ticlston, </em>having only purchased the right and title of <em>James Latham </em>from the deputy sheriff, he cannot, now, under that sale, <em>establish his </em>claim to him, as his slave, who, if not a freeman altogether, must be considered as part of the estate of <em>Latham, </em>the owner of the slave\u2019s mother, and subject to the disposition and control of his executors and administrators, in the same manner as the other personal property of the deceased, unless otherwise directed by will. The plaintiff having no claim to the services of <em>Peter, </em>the nonsuit was properly granted by the judge; and the motion to set it aside must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
