This objection was overruled by the judge; and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case containing the facts above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-7\"><em>Henry, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjU\">There can be no doubt as to the identity of the original patentee; the person under whom the lessors derive title, was shown to be. the deceased soldier, to whom the land was granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-8\">As to the other objection; the printed journals of the assembly are not evidence, without proof of their having been compared with the originals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-9\">The principal question is as to the <em>alienage </em>of the lessors. We admit the general principle that alien enemies, resident in the country of the enemy, cannot maintain an action in our courts. This objection is not, however, favoured, and ought to be pleaded strictly. Where the disability arises after suit brought, it must be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>and cannot be given in evidence under the general issue. But this objection does not apply to the present case. By the act of the legislature, passed the 2d of <em>April, </em>1798,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> (sess. 21. c. 72.) all .conveyances to aliens, not being the subjects of any power, at the time of the conveyance, at war with the <em>United States, </em>are declared to be valid, to vest the estate in such aliens, apd they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>are te hold the same, notwithstanding any plea of alienism. The only exception is, that the party must not be an alien enemy at the time of the purchase; and the only restriction on the right thus granted is, that the grantee cannot lease or grant the estate, reserving rent or creating a tenancy. In every other respect, as perfect right was vested by this statute in grantees of land, who were aliens, as if they had been natural born citizens of this state. The public faith of the state was pledged by the grant. If, then, a perfect right was granted, it carries with it a perfect remedy. The subsequent intervening war cannot take away or impair the right or the remedy. So far as it regards the lands, so allowed to be held by aliens, they are regarded as citizens.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-13\">The act of 1798 is analogous to special letters of denization, by which an alien is enabled to sue.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-14\">Again, by the 9th article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, made with <em>Great Britain, </em>the 19th of <em>November, </em>1794, it is agreed that <em>British </em>subjects, holding lands in the <em>United States, </em>shall continue to hold them, and may grant and dispose of them as if they were native citizens; and that neither they nor their heirs or assigns should, as regards such lands, and the legal remedies incident thereto, be regarded as aliens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-15\">If the lessors are within the scope of this treaty, the objection of alienage cannot be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-16\">Supposing, even, a right in the government to confiscate or sequester the property of an alien enemy, no individual could claim the benefit of such a right. It belongs to the general government, having the power to declare war and peace. But this is a subject which need not be discussed here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-17\"><em>Kellogg, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASL\">1. The journals of the assembly ought to have been received in evidence. The votes of assembly, and the minutes of council, have been admitted in evidence in <em>Pennsylvania.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>So the resolutions of congress were allowed to be received in evidence in the case of <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Cabot,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in the supreme court of the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-18\">A parish register, register of the navy-office, books in the herald\u2019s office, doomsday-book, prison-books, the log-book of a man of war, &amp;c. have been received in evidence.<footnotemark>||</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-19\">2. Alienage may be pleaded in bar or abatement.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> If it may be pleaded in bar, it may be given in evidence under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>general issue. And in ejectment, by the <em>consent rule, </em>the tiefendant is bound to plead the general issue, and can put in no other plea. Under a plea of <em>non assumpsit, </em>the defendant may give in evidence that the plaintiff is an <em>alien enemy.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>All matters which go <em>in bar </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s action may be given in evidence under the general issue. In ejectment no special pleas can be pleaded, unless in abatement, of a matter which has arisen subsequent to the issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">By the act of the 2d of <em>April, </em>1798, no greater right in lands was granted to aliens than they possessed, or might possess, by the municipal law, or law of nations. Now, it is well settled that the rights of an <em>alien </em>enemy to personal property, though not taken away, are suspended during the war.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> He cannot sue or bring any action to recover his property, until peace is restored. In <em>England, </em>it is held that an underwriter on <em>French </em>property, in time of peace, is not liable for a loss occasioned by capture by <em>British </em>ships, during hostilities commenced between <em>France </em>and <em>Great Britain, </em>subsequent to the policy being effected, and terminated before bringing the suit. <footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-6\">An alien enemy, even in regard to personal property, can acquire no right during the war.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-10\"><em>Van Vechten, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-Wi\">said that without the act of <em>April, </em>1798, aliens could not hold lands, and it was competent to the legislature to grant the right to them. The lands held by aliens are subject to taxation, and to contribute to the expenses of maintaining the war. The lessors, in the present case, hold under an express legislative grant. The rights of aliens, in regard to personal property, rest on principles of general law. The lessors, having a perfect legal title, must, on the faith of the state, have a right to protect that title from the invasion of third persons.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b429-11\"><em> </em>This act vas limited, in its duration, to three year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> <em>Vattel\u2019s Law of Nations, </em>b. 2. c. 8. s. 114. b. 3. c. 5. s. 76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AouT\"> <em>Co.

If appears, by the case, that the title to recover exists in those of the lessors who were alien enemies at the commencement of this suit, resident within the kingdom of <em>Great Britain ; </em>and the questions submitted to us are, whether, under the circumstances of this case, such alienage is a bar to the suit; and whether the objection can be taken under the general issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have urged that the act of the legislar ture, (sess. 21. c. 72.) and the 9th article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, concluded the 19th of November, 1794, between <em>Great Britain </em>and the <em>United States, </em>preclude the defendant from setting up the alienage of the lessors, as a bar to their recovery. The act of <em>April, </em>1798, declares valid conveyances thereafter to be made to any alien not being the subject of some power which, at the time of the conveyance, is at war with the <em>United States of America, </em>for the purpose of vesting the estate, thereby granted, in such alien; and it provides that it shall be lawful to and for such alien or aliens to have and to hold the same to his, her, or their heirs or assigns for ever, any plea of alienism to the contrary notwithstanding. The treaty provides that <em>British </em>subjects, who then held lands in the territories of the <em>United States, </em>should continue to hold them according to the nature and tenure of their respective estates and titles therein, and might grant, sell, or devise the same to whom they pleased, in like manner as if they were natives; and that neither they, nor their heirs or assigns, should, so far as might respect the said lands, and the legal remedies incident thereto, be regarded as aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The treaty, manifestly, has no application. Sir <em>William </em>Pulte<em>nog </em>and the lessors of the plaintiff, though <em>British </em>subjects, neither held nor owned the lot in question, until long after the treaty; and it relates only to lands <em>then held </em>by <em>British </em>subjects, and not to any after acquired lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The statute has reference merely to the title; it neither professes to regulate, nor does it at all relate to any remedy for the recovery of land purchased and held under its provisions. The plea of alienage, interposed to suspend a recovery during a war between the two governments, is very different from the plea of alienage which the statute meant to guard against and obviate. Without the protection of the statute, the lands purchased by Sir <em>William Pvlteney </em>would have been liable to <em>escheat. </em>To do away any plea of alienage, working a forfeiture and devesting the estate, was the sole object of the statute. It neither contemplated nor provided for the present case, which is a mere' temporary suspension of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\"><em>Vattel, </em>in speaking of lands or immovable goods, possessed by the subjects of an enemy, (book 3. c. 5. s. 76.) observes, \u201c la-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>permitting them to purchase and possess these goods, he has, in this respect admitted them into the number of his subjects, but the income may be sequestered, for hindering the remittance of it to the enemy\u2019s country evidently alluding to an alien enemy eommorant in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The laws of all commercial nations allow debts to be contracted in time of peace, between aliens and its subjects or citizens ; and yet, when war intervenes, it forbids an alien enemy, eommorant in the enemy\u2019s country, from maintaining a suit for the recovery of such debts, pending the war. As well might the alien enemy, residing in the territory of his sovereign, complain that as he was suffered to acquire a debt in time of peace, he ought not to be hindered in time of war from collecting it. Such complaint would be in strict analogy with that of the plaintiffs\u2019 in the present case. The answer in both would be the same: \u00a3t Your debt, contracted with the permission of the government's saved to you, and your lands, purchased under the sanctity of our laws, is saved to you; but neither of you can sue whilst you remain eommorant in the enemy\u2019s country. The safety of the state requires that you should not get possession of your funds, during the war, lest they afford you the means of making remittances to the enemy\u2019s country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The general issue of not guilty in ejectment, puts in issue the right of the lessors to make a demise for the purpose of maintaining an ejectment. If alien enemies, resident in the country of the enemy, cannot maintain the action during hostilities, as it is clear they cannot, they are incapable of making a valid demise for that purpose. The case of <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(10 <em>Johns. </em>183.) shows, that the alienage of the plaintiff may be pleaded in bar, or abatement; and whatever may be pleaded in bar, may, in ejectment, be given in evidence under the general issue, provided the matter existed at the commencement of the suit. <em>Sellon, </em>(vol. 2. p. 110. c. 2.) speaking of the defence in ejectment, says, that pleas in bar, or abatement, are now seldom pleaded; for the defendant is bound, by the consent rule, to plead not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">It is rendered unnecessary to notice the other points in the ease. With respect to them, I will only say, that they do not stand at all in the way of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. The title-of the lessors was already made out, and the evidence offered was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
