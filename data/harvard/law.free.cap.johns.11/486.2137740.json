As to the assault-<em>*n8&gt; </em>&amp;c- and imprisoning the plaintiff, and detaining him in pri80X1 \u00ae}r space of ten hours, part of the time in the first count of the declaration mentioned, that the plaintiff and three other persons being in a house occupied by one <em>Elisha Fitch, </em>in <em>Manlius, </em>made a great noise, affray, disturbance, and riot in the said house, in breach of the peace, and because the defendant, being a labourer and lodger in the said house, at the request of the said <em>Fitch, </em>in attempting to keep the peace and stop the noise, &amp;c. was assaulted by the plaintiff, he gave charge of the said plaintiff to one <em>Curtis to </em>take him into his custody, and keep him until he could be carried before a justice of the peace, to answer for the said breaches of the peace, and that, at the request and by the order of the defendant, the said <em>Curtis </em>gently laid his hands on the said plaintiff and took him into custody for the purposes aforesaid; but because it was midnight, and the plaintiff could not be immediately carried before a justice, he was necessarily detained in the custody of <em>Curtis </em>until the next day, and that he was, as soon as he conveniently could he, carried before a justice; and the defendant avers, that, by means of the premises, the plaintiff was necessarily imprisoned for the space of ten hours, part of the said time; which is the same, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-12\">To this <em>second </em>plea the plaintiff demurred specially; because, 1. It does not answer the first count of the declaration; 2. That it is no justification or bar to the action; 3. That it is double and argumentative, and in other respects uncertain, informal and insufficient.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-13\"><em>Sill, </em>in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANg\">The plea is founded on the supposition that a private person may not enly arrest another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>wlio Is breaking the peace, but may lawfully command a third person to arrest the disturber.
