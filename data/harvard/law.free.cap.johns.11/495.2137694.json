The defendant proved, that at the time of bringing the suit, and for a long time before, and during the life of the original grantee, all the lands in the patent of <em>Rensselaer </em>had been leased out by the landlord, and that there was no common of <em>estovers </em>or pasture in the manor of <em>Rensselaermick.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>A verdict was taken for the plaintiff generally, subject to tiie opinion of the, court, with liberty to either party to turn the case m\u00edo a special verdict; and, in case judgment should be given for the plaintiff, the damages were to be assessed by a jury of inquiry.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-4\"><em>E.

If a stranger enter on the commons, the lessee may bring trespass against him. If the lessor enters or destroys the whole, the whole rent is suspended ; but if on a part only, the rent is apportioned. Or if all the commons which are appurtenant are taken away, the tenant may have a remedy by abatement; but if the right of common is merely abridged, the tenant may have an action on the case, or an assize. The common of which a tenant may be deprived, may, in value, hear no proportion to the amount of the rent; and the doctrine of a suspension, or an extinguishment of the udiole rent, does not apply to this case. The distinctions on the subject are well understood in <em>England, </em>and laid down in the books.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-5\">Besides, this is merely a covenant, and not a grant of any estate or interest out of which rent can issue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-6\"><em>Van Bur\u00e9n, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4Z\">The tenant having been deprived of his commonage, he may set it up in defence as a suspension of the rent.

The principle is the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-14\">It is no answer to say that this is a covenant for the right of common.

Several points have been raised and discussed in the argument, upon which it is unnecessary to express any opinion. Whether the covenant relating to the common of estovers and pasture, rims with the land, and binds the assignee of the rent; whether if the landlord <em>approves, </em>or encloses a part or the whole of the commons, the rent thereby becomes suspended ; whether a rent, strictly speaking, can be reserved upon a demise of an incorporeal hereditament, are all questions which it is not requisite to decide, in this case. The right of common, of which the defendant complains she has been, deprived, forms no part of the premises granted to <em>Harder, </em>under whom she claims; neither is the rent reserved upon the right of common, but is, on the contrary, expressly upon the \u201c lands grantedbeing the yearly tenth part of all the produce \u201c thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AjOi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Considering the nature of the rent reserved by this conveyanee, it may well be questioned whether the covenant, in re\u00eda\u00bb tion to the right of commons, had any effect upon the amount agreed to be paid. In all the books in which it is said that an eviction by the landlord operates either a suspension or apportionment of the rent, (according to the nature and extent of the eviction,) it will be found that the eviction was of a part, or the whole of the premises demised; and I take occasion here to observe, that I must not be understood as admitting that any of the cases referred to by the defendant\u2019s counsel are applicable to this case. The estate here granted being an estate in fee, the common of <em>estovers </em>and of pasture, mentioned in this covenant, are of that species which are denominated <em>appurtenant, </em>and not appendant, between which there hre many essential differences. The former does not arise from any connexion of tenure, and may be created by grant, or claimed by prescription ; whereas the latter can only arise from prescription. The question, then, is, whether the right of common, in this case, is to ' be considered as part of the thing granted by the deed to <em>Harder, </em>by virtue of which it is claimed, or as resting merely in covenant. Although the proper technical words of a grant are, \u201c <em>dedi et </em>concessi,\u201d yet it is not to be disputed that other words manifesting that a grant was intended by the parties, will have the same, effect, and this intention is to be collected from a careful consideration of the entire deed.</p>\n<p id=\"A21V\">Whether, according to the fair construction of the covenant In question, the grantee acquired a right of common, after there ghould <em>he </em>no more waste and unappropriated land in the tract called <em>Claverack, </em>in consequence, of the settlement and improvement of the country, is a point which I do not intend to examine or decide; but I think it quite clear, looking at all the provisions in this conveyance, that the right of common constitutes no part of the premises - granted by it. The words of the grant, the <em>habendum, </em>the reservation of, and the covenant to pay the rent, all refer <em>to the </em>lands described in, and granted by, the conveyance. From this, it is evident that when the parties intended, the one to make, and the other to receive, a grant, they adopted the apt and technical words to accomplish that purpose, according to their established and legal signification and effect, After these parts of the conveyance, comes the stipulation relative to the right of common, which, in its terms-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>is not a grant, but stri'-tly a covenant. The words here made tise of, unlike those by which the lands are conveyed, are words of promise and agreement only, as distinguished from words of grant. <em>Aunties la we^bis nulla est ambiguitas, ibi nvlla exposiiio contra verba expressa fienda </em>cst. The language of the deed, where a grant is intended, is, \u201c grant, bargain, and sell,\u201d but when the grantor intends to bind himself by a covenant only, he uses words clearly evincing such intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">If this covenant has been broken, the only remedy is by an action upon it against such persons as may, in judgment of law, be considered responsible for the consequences of a mon-performance 5 but as long as the tenant continues in the unmolested enjoyment of land granted, a \\iolation of the covenant is no defence against an action for the recovery of the rent\u00bb The cases cited by the counsel for the defendant, in relation to this branch of the case, (and my researches have led me to the examination of several more,) all proceed upon the ground, that an eviction to produce suspension or apportionment of the rent, must be of \u00e1 part, <em>o\u00ed </em>of the whole of the thing demised, and upon which the rent is reservedand, as in this case the right of common is not to be considered as part of <em>the </em>grant, according to the legal import of that term, this defence cannofi <em>be </em>sustained-</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00edTudgment for the plaintiff</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
