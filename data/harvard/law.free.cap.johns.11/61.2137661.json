E. Colden </em>testified that he was present at a conversation between the plaintiff and defendant and <em>William Ross, </em>Esq. on the 1st of <em>May, </em>1810, in which it appeared that <em>Ross </em>had let a house to <em>Humphreys </em>for a year, and who was then about to enter and take possession of it, when <em>Gardner, </em>who claimed a right to let the house, forbade him; that it was then agreed between <em>Ross </em>and <em>Gardner, </em>in the presence of <em>Humphreys, to </em>submit the question, to which of them the rent should be paid, to the decision of <em>J. Fisk </em>and <em>J. Storey, </em>Esquires, as arbitrators, and that, in the mean time, <em>Humphreys </em>should enter into the house, to which agreement, he, <em>Colden, </em>was called as a witness, and v <em>7 </em>that <em>Humphreys </em>took possession of the house, Sec.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-21\"><em>Storey </em>testified that <em>Gardner </em>informed him that <em>Ross </em>and he had agreed to submit to him and <em>Fisk </em>to whom the rent should be paid; and the witness understood the same from <em>Ross, </em>who requested him to act as an arbitrator, and he thought, also, that <em>Humphreys </em>spoke to him and wished the question decided; that the witness and <em>Fisk </em>met as arbitrators, and <em>Gardner </em>and <em>Ross </em>ap<em>r </em>peared before them and stated their respective cases, and that, after hearing the parties, the arbitrators awarded that <em>Humphreys </em>should pay the rent to Gardner, and the witness soon afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>informed <em>Ross </em>of the decision, who said the arbitrators had mistaken the question, &amp;c,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-3\"><em>Fisk, </em>who was also a witness, testified substantially to the same facts, and that he informed <em>Ross </em>and <em>Gardner </em>of the decision of the arbitrators, in <em>May, </em>or the beginning of <em>June, </em>1810.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\">On this evidence, the counsel for <em>Humphreys </em>objected, 1. That it did not appear that <em>the </em>plaintiff occupied the premises under any demise; 2. That it did not appear that <em>Humphreys </em>was a party to <em>the </em>submission, and, therefore, ought not to be bound by the award; 3. That it did not appear that the arbitrators had published their award; 4. The submission being by <em>parol, </em>it was not valid so as to affect the right to real property; but these objections were overruled by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">The son of the plaintiff was then sworn as a witness, and testified that on the 1st of <em>May, </em>1810, when his father was about moving into the house, as a tenant to <em>Ross, </em>an altercation arose between <em>Gardner </em>and <em>Ross, </em>and the plaintiff wished them to decide to whom the rent was to be paid; and thereupon <em>Gardner </em>and <em>Ross </em>agreed to submit the matter to <em>Fisk </em>and <em>Storey, </em>as arbitrators; that he understood the question submitted was, whether it was competent to <em>Gardner, </em>who was a co-executor, to give a lease to <em>Ross.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">It being objected that there was no proof that <em>Humphreys </em>had <em>notice </em>of the award, the judge decided that it was necessary to show there was notice before he could be charged. The counsel for <em>Gardner </em>then attempted to prove a <em>notice, </em>and insisted that it ought to be left to the' jury, from all the circumstances, to presume a notice to <em>Humphreys; </em>but the judge said that there was nothing shown to authorize such a presumption, and he charged the jury that for want of such notice, <em>Humphreys </em>was entitled to a verdict, and the jury found a verdict accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-8\"><em>Fisk </em>and <em>Storey, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A97\">They cited 2 <em>Chit.

The two arbitrators prove the same facts substantially, and one of them says he thinks <em>Humphreys </em>spoke to him and wished the question decided, and a son of <em>Humphreys, </em>introduced by him, also stated the same controversy and submission, as stated by <em>Colden, </em>and that <em>Humphreys </em>said, at the time of the altercation, that he wished <em>Gardner and Ross </em>would <em>determine to whom he </em>should pay the rent, and the submission to arbitration was thereupon made. The arbitrators met and heard the allegations of <em>Ross </em>and <em>Gardner, </em>and decided in the same month of <em>May, </em>1810, that the rent ought to be paid to <em>Gardner. </em>Upon these facts, the question of notice to <em>Humphreys </em>of the award does not arise, lie was bound to take notice of the award at his peril, for he was present when it was submitted to the arbitrators to determine to whom he should pay the rent, and it was in proof that he was privy to the submission, and the conclusion <em>is </em>irresistible that it was so referred with his approbation. The parties claiming respectively the right to let, interpleaded, as it were, in his presence, and agreed to refer the question <em>to the </em>arbitrators, and he entered into possession with the knowledge of that interpleader and submission, and at the time it took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">A new trial ought, therefore, to be awarded, with costs to abide the event of <em>the </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
