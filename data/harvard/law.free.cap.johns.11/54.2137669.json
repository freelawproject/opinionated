The declaration contained several counts; ^ie ^rst count stated that the plaintiff was the infant son and one of the children of <em>Daniel Gidney, </em>by whom he prosecuted, &amp;c. and <em>a\u00edter </em>tiie usual averments, that in a certain discourse which the defendant had with the said <em>Daniel, </em>of and concerning the 0 children of the said <em>Darnel, </em>and of and concerning the said <em>Charles, </em>the plaintiff, &amp;c. the defendant maliciously spolce and Polished, &amp;c. the following words: \u201c your children\u201d (meaning, &amp;c.) &lt;c are thieves, and I\u201d (meaning the defendant) \u00ab can prove it.\u201d There were several other counts, one of which stated the words to be \u201c his children\u201d (meaning the children of the said <em>Daniel) </em>\u201c are thieves, and I can prove it.\u201d The other counts, in the <em>innuendoes, </em>stated the words as spoken of the plaintiff among the children of the said <em>Daniel. </em>There was a general demurrer to the declaration and joinder, on which the court below gave judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Afmo\">D. <em>Russell, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_h6\">contended that the declaration was sufficient.

In <em>Van Vechten </em>v. Hopkins,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> was decided that an <em>innuendo </em>could not be proved, though it was said, that where the person meant to be libelled could not be identified, without the aid of extrinsic facts, by a proper <em>averment </em>and a <em>colloquium, </em>such extrinsic facts might be introduced and proved. Though there is a <em>coi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>loquium, </em>there are not, in the present case, those proper averments to point the <em>slander, </em>with certainty, to the plaintiff</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A_FF\"> <em>6 Bac. </em>Ab. <em>231. </em>Slander, (I. 2.) 1 Chit Pl. 382. <em>Cro.

The words \u201c your children,\u201d \u201c his children,\u201d apply to and embrace <em>all </em>the children of <em>Daniel Gidney, </em>with whom the defendant was conversing. The case of <em>Foxcraft </em>v. <em>Lacy (Hob. </em>89.) is analogous, as to the effect and application of such expressions. In that case, it appears that a suit was pending against the plaintiff and 16 other persons, and a discourse being had concerning the suit, the defendant said <em>these defendants helped to murder H. F., </em>and it was adjudged that each of the 17 defendants was entitled to his separate action of slander. It might have been urged, as well in that case, as in this, that the words did not necessarily mean the plaintiff. In this case, the first count contains a <em>colloquium </em>concerning the plaintiff in particular, as well as the other children of <em>Daniel Gidney, </em>and the <em>colloquium </em>conclusively points the words, and designates the plaintiff as one of the children intended. A <em>colloquium </em>is sufficient to give application to words still more indefinite, such as <em>one of the servants of I. S. is a thief; (4 Co. </em>17. b.) and if one count be good, it is sufficient on general demurrer to the whole declaration.
