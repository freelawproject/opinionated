In the afternoon of the next day, the wind began to blow fresh, so as to oblige them to close reef their top-sails, and increased till four the next morning, with hard squalls, attended with snow and sleet. The gale continued to increase, and about seven A. 3VL, by the direction of the pilot, they wore the ship, and stood in for <em>Revel </em>bay. Being deceived, by the thickness of the weather, as to the distances, the ship got aground on a shoal running off <em>Surp </em>point.. Exertions were made to get off the ship ; but the gale increasing, with heavy seas, she filled with water, and the crew, with some difficulty, left her in the boat. The master deposed, that the sole reason for proceeding to <em>Revel, </em>was because the supercargo had ascertained that she could not get to <em>Cronstadt </em>that season, on account of the ice; and had\"not that been the case, it was the intention of the supercargo to proceed direct from <em>Port Baltic </em>to <em>Cronstadt. </em>That when the ship left <em>Port Baltic, </em>it was determined to go to <em>Revel, </em>and there deliver the cargo, that it might be transported from thence to <em>St. </em>Peters-<em>burgh </em>; but if there had been no obstructions to the navigation by the ice, the vessel would not have lauded the cargo at <em>Revel, </em>but have proceeded to <em>Cronstadt. </em>Thai there is no port or place of delivery for <em>Petersburgh, </em>nearer to <em>Cronstadt </em>than <em>Revel; </em>and that it is very common for vessels bound to <em>St. Petersburgh </em>to deliver their cargoes there, when the navigation of the <em>Gulf of Finland </em>is obstructed by ice. That at the time the <em>African </em>was there, six <em>American </em>vessels, bound to <em>Si. Petersburgh, </em>put into <em>Revel, </em>and discharged their cargoes. That when the <em>African </em>arrived at Revel, the <em>Gulf of Finland </em>was closed by the \u00edce, so as entirely to interrupt the navigation as far down as the eastern part of the island of <em>Narjou, </em>which forms the boundary of the bay of <em>Revel. </em>There is good anchorage at <em>Port Baltic, </em>which is used as a <em>king\u2019s port, </em>and vessels occasionally winter there, but never when they can got into <em>Revel, </em>which <em>is </em>a port of entry, and the usual place;<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of landing cargoes. The little settlement bearing the name of <em>port Baipic </em>contains no more than ten or twelve small houses ; but no stores or warehouses; nor is it a place of delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsNS\">The deposition of the supercargo was substantially the same as that of the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">The defendants\u2019 counsel read in evidence the depositions off two masters of vessels, who had been in the <em>Baltic </em>and <em>Gulf of Finland, </em>who said,that at the time the <em>African </em>entered <em>Port Baltic, </em>had they gone there on account of the ice, they should have wintered there. One of them said, a vessel proceeding from <em>Port Baltic </em>for <em>Cronstadt, </em>would not stand in for <em>Revel, </em>and that if \u25a0she did, she would be entirely out of the track for <em>Cronstadt, </em>and that the place' where the <em>African </em>went aground was out of the usual track; that <em>Revel </em>is a dangerous port to enter, but when entered, is the best port in the <em>Gulf of Finland.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">The chief justice charged the jury that if-they believed that the captain acted in good faith, in leaving <em>Port Baltic </em>for <em>Revel, </em>he was justifiable in doing so; and then the passage thither, on which the vessel was lost, would not, under the circumstances of the case, amount to a deviation ; and the jury, thereupon, found a verdict for the plaintiffs for a total loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new-trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-9\"><em>Wells, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAmo\">The only question is, whether there was a <em>deviation. Revel </em>was not a port mentioned in the policy, nor a port of necessity. In order to justify stopping at an intermediate port, there must be either a necessity for doing so, or a usage of trade. When the vessel arrived at <em>Port Baltic, </em>which we admit was a port of necessity, it was ascertained that it was impracticable to reach <em>Cronstadt, </em>the port of delivery, and the cargo might then have been landed at <em>Port Baltic, </em>and sent on to <em>St, Petersburgh, </em>or the vessel, after wintering at <em>Port Baltic, </em>might have proceeded, in the spring, when. the navigation was safe, to <em>St. Petersburgh, </em>her port of destination. The cause or necessity which forced the <em>Af rican </em>to seek safety in <em>Port Baltic, </em>continued, and she ought not to have left it merely to seek another port of necessity. If this should be allowed, a vessel might, without any justifiable cause, encounter the same perils, a second or third time, and, under the pretext of a port \u00e9f neeessity, go in search of a market. <em>R&amp;tlel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>was not a port or place in the voyage insured, and there was no reason for going there, unless for the sake of disposing of the cargo.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-6\">In <em>Parkin </em>v. <em>Tunno,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the vessel was insured at and from <em>Bristol </em>to Montevideo, and any other port or ports in the river <em>Plata, </em>in possession of the <em>English. </em>On arriving in the Plata, all the places there, except <em>Maldonado, </em>were in possession of the enemy, and the <em>English </em>commander, on account of the situation of the <em>English, </em>ordered the vessel immediately away, and being short of Avater, and wanting repairs, she bore aAvay for <em>Rio Janeiro, </em>as the nearest friendly port of safety, and in going there rvas lost; ,the court of K. B. held that the policy could not be extended, by implication, to cover the ship in her voyage to <em>Rio Janeiro, </em>though it was necessary tojgo there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">So here, the specific voyage insured is from <em>Carlsham </em>to <em>St. Petersburgh ; </em>and the ship cannot be alloAved to coast along the <em>Gulf of Finland, </em>from port ,to port. If she is allowed to go to <em>Revel, </em>because it is near to <em>\u2022St. Petersburgh, </em>she might afterwards go, for the same reason, to <em>Narva; </em>and thus, instead of a direct voyage to <em>St. Petersburgh, </em>she might go, from port to port, along the coast of the <em>Gulf of Finland, </em>and thereby greatly enhance the risks of the voyage. This loss has arisen, not on the voyage insured, but on a voyage from <em>Port Baltic to Revel.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-8\">Suppose a vessel insured from <em>Charleston </em>to <em>Philadelphia, </em>and, on arriving at the mouth of the <em>Delaware, </em>should find the river so stopped with ice, as to render it impracticable to reach her port of destination, and should put into <em>New-York, </em>Avould she be covered by the policy, in afterwards going from <em>New-York </em>to <em>New-London, </em>or <em>Baltimore ?</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-10\"><em>Colden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfN\"><em>Port Bailie </em>is a small place, and not a port of entry or delivery; there are no warehouses there to receive cargoes. <em>Revel </em>is the best port in the <em>Baltic, </em>though somewhat difficult to enter. It is the nearest port to <em>St. Petersburgh; </em>and in case a vessel cannot get to <em>St. Petersburgh, </em>she may deliver her cargo there. If driven by a storm into <em>Port Baltic, </em>and the winds and Aveather afterwards became favourable to proceed on her voyage to <em>St. Petersburgh, </em>she would be justified in leaving <em>Port Baltic, </em>for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiqS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>If the <em>African </em>had remained at <em>Port Bailie </em>until spring, and afterwards had been lost in going to <em>Pctcrsburgh, </em>the defendants would then have objected that there was a <em>deviation, </em>by reason \u00b0f the delay, and that she ought to have gone to <em>Revel, </em>and there delivered her cargo. She did, in fact, attempt to reach <em>Revel </em>first, but Avas compelled to go into <em>Port </em>Baltic. The captain acted Avith good faith ; and had he reached <em>Revel, </em>in the first instance, Avould it have been pretended that it Avas a deviation ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIt\">Again, the situation of <em>Revel, </em>and the usage of the trade, in regard to that port, as Avell as <em>Port Baltic, </em>justifies the conduct of the master.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az_\">The cage of <em>Parkin </em>v. <em>Tunno </em>is very different from the present. The vessel, in that case, did arrive at <em>Maldonado, </em>a port in the <em>Plata, </em>and she afterwards attempted to prolong her,voyage by going to a place entirely out of its route. But here <em>Revel </em>is in the usual route to <em>St. Petersburgh.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">Take the case put by the defendants\u2019 counsel, and suppose a . vessel bound to <em>Philadelphia, </em>stopped by the ice, should go to <em>Wilmington, </em>as a place of. necessity, and finding afterwards that she could go on to a place much nearer to Philadelphia, should leave <em>Wilmington </em>to go to <em>Newcastle, </em>and should be lost, Avould not the insured be entitled to recover ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-6\"><em>Wells, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8E\">said that if a map or chart of the <em>Gulf of Finland </em>Avas examined, it Avould be found that a vessel going into <em>Revel </em>is as much out of the direct and proper route to <em>St. Petersburgh, </em>as a vessel, bound from <em>Charleston </em>to <em>Boston </em>Avould be, if she put into <em>Nem-Yorh </em>or <em>New-London.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">There is a difference between a port of entry and a port of delivery, and the insured might have entered the vessel at <em>Revel, </em>Avhile at <em>Port Baltic, </em>and obtained a permit to land her cargo at the latter place. But the defendants did not insure the entry or delivery of the cargo.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AtSV\"> 11 East, 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-3\"> <em>oddy on Commerce. </em>102. 166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b366-8\">Thompson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8VL\">delivered the opinion of the court. The going to <em>Revel </em>Avas no deviation. It Avas a port of necessity; and the course of conduct pursued by the master Avas justified by the state of the Aveather and the obstruction of the navigation in the <em>Gulf of Finland </em>by the ice. It is no deviation to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u00a9ut of the way to avoid danger, or when compelled by neceE&amp;it.y. It is, therefore, laid down as a general principle, which runs through all the cases on this point, that if the captain, in departing from the usual course of the voyage, acts fairly and <em>bona </em>fide, and according to his best judgment, to avoid the threatened rlanger, and thereby promote the benefit of all parties concerned, and has no other view but to conduct the ship and cargo to the port of destination, the policy still continues. His having pvt into <em>Port Baltic </em>as a port of necessity did not oblige him to remain there during the winter. And although the supercargo received such information there \u00e1s to induce him to believe that they should not be able to reach <em>Cronstadt </em>or <em>Peteisburgh, </em>the port of destination, yet both he and the captain swear it was their intention to go on, if not prevented by the ice. And it was not until they arrived off the bay of <em>Revel </em>that they ascertained with certainty that they could not proceed to <em>Cronstadt </em>by reason of the ice. It was prudent and discreet in th\u00e9 captain to go on to <em>Revel. </em>It was only about twenty-five miles from <em>Port Baltic. </em>The weather was fine and the wind fair, and there was every reasonable prospect of a speedy and safe arrival ; and if he found it impracticable to go on, <em>Revel </em>was a much more safe and secure place to winter.in <em>than Port Baltic; </em>the latter having no storehouses for storing the cargo in case it should become necessary to unload the vessel, nor is it a port of entry or delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The jury have found that the captain acted in good faith, and that the necessity and circumstances of the case justified his going to <em>Revel; </em>and this finding is fully warranted by the evidence. Although there is good anchorage in <em>Port Baltic, </em>and vessels occasionally winter there, yet, from the testimony, it appears that they do not, when they can get into <em>Revel. </em>Besides, the case furnishes very strong evidence of a usage or custom for vessels bound to <em>Si. Peiersburgh </em>to put into <em>Revel, </em>and deliver their cargoes there, when the navigation of the <em>Gulf of Finland </em>is interrupted by ice. A number of <em>American </em>vessels had, at that time, put in there for that purpose. From the lateness of the season when 'this voyage was undertaken, it was reasonable to presume the navigation would be obstructed by ice, and underwriters must have calculated that the usual course of the voyage would, in such case, be pursued. Under these circumstances, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Would be carrying the doctrine of deviation to an extravagant length to apply it to a case like the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The motion for a new trial must accordingly be denied.</p>\n<author id=\"b368-5\">Van Ness, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABH\">If this case had been left to the jury, to say whether, by the tisage of trade, the master had not a right .to go to <em>Read, </em>and they had found for the plaintiff, I should have been better satisfied. It was not put to the jury on that ground; and I think it very doubtful, whether any such usage \u2022exists, notwithstanding the evidence stated in the case. I do not, however, mean to be considered as dissenting from the opinion of my brethren ; though, at the same time, I am not perfectly clear as to the right of the plaintiff to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
