The indictment and proceedings having been removed into this court, by <em>certiorari, Colden </em>moved that the prisoners should be discharged. He read the commitment and indictment, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tended that there was no crime charged against this state; that,the* indictment did not even state any crime cognizable by the laws of the <em>United States. </em>But if the facts stated amounted to treason against the <em>United States, </em>it would not be a crime against <em>this </em>state. It might, perhaps, be said, that this was a case in which the courts of this state have a concurrent jurisdiction with those of the <em>United States. </em>If so, it would follow, either that the <em>United States </em>would be ousted of its jurisdiction, or that the party might be twice tried for the same offence ; for either the courts of this state have a right to try the defendants, in exclusion of the <em>United States, </em>or they must be liable to be twice put in jeopardy for the same offence. It is not denied, that there may be treason against this state, as in case of insurrection or rebellion against the particular laws of this state. The indictment here states, that the subjects of <em>Great Britain </em>became enemies of this state, in consequence of the war declared by the <em>United States, </em>and being enemies, &amp;c. [He was here stopped by the court, who desired to hear the district attorney.]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7IL\"><em>Hankins, </em>(acting for the district attorney,) contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbqO\">The indictment is founded on the first section of the act relative to treason, (sess. 24. c. 29.1 <em>N. R. L. </em>145.) which declares, \u201c that if any person do levy war against the people of this state, within this state, or be adherent to the enemies of the people of this state, giving them aid and comfort in this state or elsewhere, and be thereof attainted of open deed, such offences, and no other, shall be adjudged treason against the people of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-5\">The first objection whieh may be made is, that the offence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>aught first to have been inquired into, by this court, the 6th section of the statute declaring that all offences, declared to be treason, committed upon land out of this state, or on the sea, shall be inquired of, heard, and determined in the supreme court, by good and lawful men of the same county where the said court shall sit, in like manner as if the treason had been committed within the same county. But it was not intended by this section of the act, that this court should make the <em>first </em>inquiry as to the fact, but that they should finally inquire and der termine, by a jury, and give judgment thereon. It does not prevent a grand jury of the general sessions of the peace from inquiring into the fact, and finding a bill of indictment against the party, which may, then, be removed into this court for trial and judgment. An indictment is only an accusation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-4\">It is sufficient in an indictment, that the charge of high treason be reduced to a reasonable certainty, so that the defendant may be apprized of the nature of it, and be prepared to answer it.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> In a case of so enormous a crime, the court will not quash an indictment. Courts do not quash indictments, on formal objections, in case of treason or murder.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-5\">As to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state to try this offence; there is nothing expressed in the constitution of the <em>United States </em>against it, The second section of the 4th article declares, that persons charged in any state with treason or felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall, on demand of the executive authority of the state, be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\">There is no law of congress inhibiting the interference of the state courts. On the contrary, the second section of the act of <em>April </em>30th, 1790, authorises the magistrates of the different states to receive informations of treason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-7\">The judiciary act (section 11.) declares that the circuit courts of the <em>United States </em>shall have exclusive cognizance of all crimes or offences cognizable under the authority of the <em>United States, </em>except where the laws of the <em>United States </em>shall otherwise direct. The state courts have concurrent power with those of the <em>United States </em>in numerous cases which might be ^ted.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxQ\">In the exercise of the concurrent power, the state court<em>s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>must act in subordination to the <em>United States. </em>In case the slate courts acted against the power of the <em>United States, </em>the courts of the <em>United States </em>might issue a <em>prohibition </em>to them. Until, however, the collision between the courts of the two governments exists, the state courts may act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN3Y\">The individual states are sovereign and independent, except in matters ceded to the general government of the <em>United States. </em>Under the old confederation, the powers of the states were the same.

That the facts charged in the indictment do not amount to the crime of treason against the state of <em>New-York; </em>and, 2dly, That the state courts have no jurisdiction of treason against the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">The indictment, containing several counts which are substantially alike, after setting out a state of war between the <em>United States </em>and <em>Great Britain, </em>declared and carried on under the authority of the <em>United States, </em>alleges, that the prisoners, being citizens of the state of <em>New-York, </em>and of the <em>United States of America, as traitors against the people of the state of NenYork, </em>did adhere to, and give aid and comfort to the enemy, by supplying them with provisions of various kinds, on board a public ship of war, upon the high seas. It has been attempted, on the part of the prosecution, to support this indictment under the statute of this state, (1 <em>N. R. L. </em>145.) which declares treason against the people of this state to consist in levying war. against the people of this state, within the state, or adhering to the enemies of the people of this state, giving to them aid and comfort in this state, or elsewhere. And it has been said, that this act is nugatory, unless it applies to cases like the present; but this by no means follows, for there can be no doubt but such a state of things might exist, as that treason against the pee-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>pie of this state <em>might be </em>committed. This might be, by an open and armed opposition to the laws of the state, or a combination and forcible attempt to overturn or usurp the government. And, indeed, the state, in its political capacity, may, under certain special circumstances, pointed out by the constitution of the <em>United States, </em>be engaged in war with a foreign enemy. But no such circumstances are stated in this indictment. <em>Great Britain </em>cannot be said to be at war with the state of <em>New-York, </em>in its aggregate and political capacity, as an independent government, and, therefore, not an enemy of the state, within the sense and meaning of the statute. The people of this state, as citizens of the <em>United States, </em>are at war with <em>Great Britain, </em>in consequence of the declaration of war by congress. The state, in its political capacity, is not at war. The subjects of <em>Great Britain are </em>the enemies of the <em>United States of America, </em>and the citizens thereof, as members of the union, and not of the state of <em>New-York, </em>as laid in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The alteration in our statute, since the adoption of the constitution of the <em>United States, </em>plainly shows the sense of the legislature on this subject. By the act, as it stood in the year 1787, (1 <em>G. Ed. Laws, </em>316.) it was made treason to adhere to, or give aid and comfort to the enemies of the people of the state of <em>New-York, </em>or <em>of the United States of America. </em>But, in the several revisions of the law, since the adoption of the constitution, the latter words have been omitted, as unnecessary and inapplicable to the situation of the state, as a member of the union. Under the old confederation, there was no judicial power organized,and clothed with authority for the trial and punishment of treason against the <em>United States of America. </em>It became necessary, therefore, to provide for it under the judicial powers of the several states; no such necessity, however, exists under our present system. According to this view of the subject, it would seem unnecessary to notice the question of jurisdiction; for, admitting the facts charged against the prisoners to amount to treason against the <em>United States, </em>they do not constitute the offence of treason against the people of the state of <em>New-York, </em>as charged in the indictment. The offence not being charged as treason against the <em>United States, </em>the present indictment cannot fee supported, even admitting this court to have jurisdiction. We would barely observe, however, that we think the jurisdiction of the state courts does not extend to the offence of treason against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>United States. </em>The judicial power of the <em>United States </em>extends to all cases arising under the constitution and laws of the <em>United States. </em>The declaration of war was by a-law of congvess; and, in consequence of which, it became criminal in the prisoners to afford aid and comfort to the enemy. And the act establishing the judicial courts of the <em>United States, </em>gives to the circuit courts cognizance, exclusive of the courts of the several states, of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the <em>United </em>States, except where the laws of the <em>United States </em>shall otherwise direct. (1 <em>Sess. </em>1 <em>Cong. </em>c. 20. <em>sec. </em>11.) In whatever point of view, therefore, the case is considered, we are satisfied that the present indictment cannot be supported. The prisoners must accordingly be discharged.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b564-3\"> Bat the court remanded the defendants, until information was given to the judge of the supreme court of the <em>United diales, so </em>that they might be proceeded against in the circuit court of the <em>United States, </em>if it was thought proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
