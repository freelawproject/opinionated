J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">delivered the opinion of the court. The special demurrer alleges for cause, a variance between the <em>sub. mission </em>as contained in the bond, and the <em>submission </em>as set out in the award. According to the condition of the bond, the submission was special, of one matter only in dispute between the parties. But the award contains a <em>recital </em>of a <em>general </em>submission of all matters, concluding, however, with a reference to the bond, for more particular information, as to the matter submitted. The question arising on these pleadings is, whether this is such a variance as to vitiate the replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">The rule of pleading, as to setting out the award, is, no doubt, different when the action is upon the arbitration bond, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>and when <em>it is </em>upon the award itself. In the latter 'case, the plaintiff is not bound to set forth more of the award than is necessary to support his particular claim. In the former, he .must set out, in liis replication, the whole award. This appears\" .to be the general rule laid down by elementary writers. (1 <em>Chit, Pl. 585.) </em>But, by a recurrence to. the cases decided, it will be seen that it is not required that the award, should be set out <em>in haze verba. </em>If any part is void and immaterial it may be omitted. This distinction is supported by the case of <em>Foreland </em>v. Marygold, (1 <em>Salk. </em>72. S. C. 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>715. S. C. 12 <em>Mod. </em>534.) w'hich is a leading case on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In the case before us, the only variance is an omission in the replication of the recital contained in the award. That recital 'is not only immaterial, but void, as being foreign from, the submission, and <em>not </em>warranted by it, and containing matter upon which no award was pretended to be made. In the case of <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>(2 <em>Mod. </em>169.) it is expressly laid down, that a misrecital in an award will not vitiate it. There is no objection, therefore, to the replication, in matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">On the merits, the plaintiff is clearly entitled to recover. The award does not extend to matters not contained in the submission. Though the recital is broader than the condition of the bond, and purports to extend the powers of the arbitrators to matters not contained in the submission, yet it expressly refers to the, bond for the particulars of the matter submitted; and being mere recital only, it may be rejected as immaterial. .The award purports to be upon the matter contained in the condition of the bond, and no further; for it directs the payment of a sum of money by the defendants to the plaintiff which \u201c shall be considered in full of and concerning all differences in the condition expressed in the bond.\u201d Judgment must be entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
