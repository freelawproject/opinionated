(Comp. </em>161. 169.) <em>Rafael </em>v. <em>Verelst. (W. Bl. </em>983.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-14\">As to the jurisdiction of the court martial, which appeared to be the principal point in the case, he contended that the <em>fourth </em>section of the act of congress, passed the 28th of <em>February, </em>1795, (cong. 3. sess. 1. c. 91.) declaring that the <em>militia, </em>employed in the service of the <em>United States </em>shall be subject to the same rules and articles of war as the troops of the <em>United States, </em>had reference only to the rules and articles of war then in existence, and not to such as may have beeii subsequently made, in the year 3 806. The word employed must be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>and understood to mean, whilc <em>actually </em>employed, or in actual service. A person in the militia cannot be subject to punishment after the time of his service has expired. If he were so, how long after the expiration of the term of service is he liable? Is it for an indefinite period ? Can he be tried and punished, after he has returned home, has married, perhaps, and has a family? The act of congress of the 11th of <em>January, </em>1812, to raise an additional military force, (cong. 12. sess. 1. c. <em>14. s. 16.) </em>xvhich provides that a deserter from the service of the <em>United States </em>may be tried by a court martial, and punished, although his term of enlistment had elapsed previous to his arrest, shoAvs the sense of congress, that Avithout such special regulation, a soldier could not be tried or punished after his term of service had expired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-4\">For the <em>defendant </em>it was insisted, that the court martial ivas not a court of <em>inferior </em>jurisdiction, though it ivas <em>limited </em>as to place, and as to the subject matter, or persons to be tried. The only question is, whether the plaintiff was subject to the jurisdiction of the court martial. The court proceeded under the authority of the act of congress of the 2oth of <em>February, </em>1795. The plea states, and the fact is admitted] by the demurrer, that the plaintiff was <em>employed </em>in the service of the <em>United States. </em>As soon as he ivas employed, he became liable to the rules and articles of Avar. The act is prospective; it relates to persons when employed, or for the time being. The rules and articles of Avar, in 1806, are the same as those which were in force in the year 1795. The latter (art. 1. s. 6. See <em>Gray don's Digest, Appendix, </em>146.) declare that all officers and soldiers, Avho, having received pay, or having been duly enlisted in the service of the <em>United States, </em>Avho shall be convicted of deserting, shall suffer death, or such other punishment as a court martial may inflict. So by art. <em>1. s. 17. (Graydon's Digest, Appendix, 156.) </em>militia men, <em>mustered and in pay, </em>and joined or acting \u00edvith the regular forces of the <em>United States, </em>are to be governed by the rules and articles of war, and subject to be tried by court martial, in the same manner as the regular forces, except that the .court martial is to be composed of militia officers. To the same effect is the 97th article of the rules of Avar, established by the act of congress of the 10th of <em>April, </em>1808. (Cong. 9. sess. 1.) -Lapse of time Avill not oust the court martial of its jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>if no time is fixed; but by the 88th article of the rules of war, there is a limitation fixed for such trials to two years after the offence committed. The plaintiff was amenable to the court when it was ordered to be held. A court of limited jurisdiction, acting within its jurisdiction as to place and the subject matter, cannot be made liable to an action. The court could not know who were ordered into the service of the <em>United States, </em>until the person accused was tried. That was to be ascertained at the trial. The plaintiff made no' objection to the jurisdiction of the court martial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-5\">Again, the court martial merely pronounces judgment; the sentence is to be reviewed and executed by the commander in chief, to whom all their proceedings are to be reported, and who, if he approves them, confirms the sentence, and orders it to be executed. The plaintiff, then, if he was aggrieved by the proceedings of the court martial, should have applied to General <em>Dearborn, </em>and made his objection. That was his remedy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The case of <em>Mostyn </em>v. <em>Fabrigas (Comp. 172.) </em>shows that a court if limited jurisdiction is not liable to this action, but the party iggrieved should apply to the superior court of review, having lower to correct the proceedings of which he complains. A lourt deciding a question within its jurisdiction, can never be iable for their decision. While it remains unreversed, it is inal and conclusive.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AR3\"> <em>Bonnell </em>v.

The first ,nd second objections to the pleas are wholly untenable. It is tot necessary to allege that a case had occurred which gave uthority to the President of the <em>United States </em>to call forth the lilitia,under the act ofthe 28th of <em>February, 1195. </em>That act, after numerating the cases, on the occurrence of which the militia lay be called into the public service of the <em>United States, </em>vests i the president a high discretionary power: he, and he alone, ; made the judge, as well of the happening of the events, on diich the militia may be called forth, as of the number, time, nd destination of that species of force. In every case in \u2022liich the president acts under that law, he acts upon his responbiiity under the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">If it was necessary to the validity of these pleas to state, tiier that the <em>United States </em>were invaded, or in imminent dan\u00bb cr of invasion, or that the laws of the <em>United States were </em>op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>posed, or the execution thereof obstructed, the matter thus stated would be issuable, and the plaintiff might, in his replication, take issue on them, and oblige the defendant to prove the occurrence of a case specified in the act; and thus every subordinate officer, who should be called into service, would be put to the necessity, when he was sued for any act of discipline upon the privates, to prove to a jury that the president had acted correctly in making his requisitions; and if he failed in this proof, it Avould subject him to damages for an act otherwise lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">To countenance such a construction of the act, Avould be monstrous. Every trial would either subject all the archives o: state to an examination before the court and jury, or the de fendant Avould inevitably be found guilty. No man would dare <em>to </em>obey the orders, either of the president, or of his superior officer, lest, peradventure, the president had either abused his \u00e1utho rity, or misjudged, in relation to the occurrence of the fact Avhich authorized him to call forth the militia.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">It is a general and sound principle, that whenever the laAi vests any person Avith a poAver to do an act, and constitutes him a judge of the evidence on which the act may be done, and, a! the same time, contemplates that the act is to be carried inte effect, through the instrumentality of agents, the person thu clothed with power is invested Avith discretion, and is, <em>quoai hoc, </em>a judge. His mandates to his legal agents, on his declaring the event to have happened, av\u00edII be a protection to those agents and it is not their duty or business to investigate the facts thu referred to their superior, and to rejudge his determination. Ii a military point of view, the contrary doctrine Avould be sub versive of all discipline; and as it regards the safety and securit; of the <em>United States </em>and its citizens, the consequences would b deplorable and fatal. It was not necessary, therefore, to se forth the occurrence of these events in the pleas, as a j ustifica tion of the defendant\u2019s conduct, because they were not, am could not, be matter of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The objection that the governor\u2019s order does not mentioi which president gave the order to him, nor what number o militia Avas called out, is too refined and idle to require exami nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The third objection is also untenable. Court martials for th( trial of militia officers or privates, are to be composed of mili fia officers. . (97th article of rules and articles of war.) It ii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>not a sugeradded qualification that such officers shall have been in the service of the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The objections that the pleas do not allege that General <em>Dear-born, </em>when he ordered the court martial, commanded the army of the <em>United States, </em>or that he ordered the sentence to be executed, are not well taken. The plea states that General <em>Dearborn, </em>when he issued the order, was a major general of the army of the <em>United States ; </em>and this imports that he then commanded' the army; but, under the act of 1795, it is not required that courts martial should be ordered by a general commanding an army.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The 65th article gives to the officer ordering the court the power of confirming and executing the sentence; but it does not prescribe the manner of doing either; and from analogy to all other courts of criminal jurisdiction, it necessarily follows, that the court before whom the trial is had, has the power, liter conviction, of keeping the person of thp delinquent, until the will and pleasure of the superior officer be known.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">It is also objected that the plaintiff was not subject to the rules md articles of war, because they were enacted in 1806, and posterior to the act authorizing the president to call out the nilitia.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The 4th section of the act of the 28th of <em>February, </em>1795, provides that the militia employed in the service of the <em>United' States, </em>shall be subject to the same rules and articles of war as ;he troops of the <em>United States. </em>The act of the 10th of <em>April, </em>1806, establishing the rules and articles of war, ordains, that rom and after the passing that act, the rules and articles therein \u00a1hall be the rules and articles by which the army of the <em>United States </em>shall be governed. It follows, necessarily, then, that hese rules and articles attached to the militia which were called nto the service of the <em>United States </em>thereafter, without refermce to the time when the power to call them out was confer-ed; and this independently of the 97th article, which actually ;xtends the rules to the militia. The act of 1795 is clearly irospective.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The only remaining objection is, that the pleas do not state hat the plaintiff\u2019s term of service was unexpired when he was ried and sentenced, and put under guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Without examining the question whether the plaintiff was liade to be tried, after the period for which he was called out \u00a1ad elapsed, we are clearly of opinion that the defendant is not iable to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"ApP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The court martial was constituted to try all the delinquen) militia men in three counties, and the defendant was personally and regularly before the court, and charged with the offence oi desertion. The defendant, and the other members of the court, were sitting as judges. It was competent to the plaintiff tc have raised the objection under consideration, or any other but he waived every objection by pleading guilty, and throw ing himself on the mercy of the court. <em>(Comp. </em>172.). Aftei this can he be permitted to turn round upon the court, and pre tend that he was not liable to their jurisdiction 7 Had he urgec the objection, it might have availed him; but his plea admit: their jurisdiction, and his own guilt. Besides, the court martia had not power to carry any sentence into execution. Theii proceedings were liable to the' review of General <em>Dearborn </em>and there he should have resorted with his exculpatory proof (5 <em>Term Rep. </em>182. 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The distinction taken by Justice <em>Wilson, </em>in <em>Drervy </em>v. <em>Coulton, </em>(1 <em>East, 56. </em>in the notes,) is a very sound one. <em>\u201c </em>In ver] few instances,\u201d he says, \u201c is an officer answerable for what he does to the best of his judgment, in cases where he is compel lable to act; but the action lies where the officer has an optioi whether he will act or not.\u201d If the court martial had jurisdic tion over the person of the plaintiff, and over the subject mat ter, (his offence) then, most clearly, the members of that cour are not answerable. (1 <em>Ed. Raym. </em>467.) The plaintiff admit ted both facts, by submitting to the jurisdiction of the court and pleading guilty. I will <em>only </em>add, that it would be most mis chievous and pernicious, to subject men acting in a judicia capacity, to actions, where their conduct is fair and impartial when they are uninfluenced by any corrupt or improper mo fives, for a mere mistake of judgment. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In the present case they are called in question by a person who, by acknowledging <em>the </em>jurisdiction of the court and his own guilt, never require* them even to deliberate on any of these points or objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Van Ness, J. <em>dissented.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Platt, J. not having heard the argument, gave no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> See <em>ante, </em>p. 114. <em>Jenkins and others </em>v. <em>Waldron.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
