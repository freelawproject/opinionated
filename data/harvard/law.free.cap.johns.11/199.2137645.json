W. RADCLIFF, for the plaintiff, moved for a writ of <em>procedendo </em>in this cause to the mayor\u2019s court of the city of <em>NenYork.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-4\">The suit was originally commenced in the mayor\u2019s court, and Henry, one of the defendants, only was taken. The plaintiff issued another writ against <em>Graham </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>to answer together with <em>Henry, </em>on which <em>Graham </em>only was taken. <em>Graham </em>appeared by attorney, and <em>Henry </em>in proper person. A <em>habeas corpus cum causa, See. </em>as to the defendants, <em>Graham </em>and <em>Henry, </em>was taken out, to remove the cause to this court, returnable at the last term. On the 24th <em>January </em>last, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney demanded, in writing, of the attorney of <em>Graham </em>and <em>Henry, to </em>file special bail for all the defendants, within twenty days, so that the plaintiff might proceed to declare against them in this court. It did not appear that any rule had been entered by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney for the defendants to appear, or that a <em>procedendo </em>issue; and no bail had been put in by the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-5\"><em>Slosson </em>objected,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATg\">that by the 10th rule of <em>October </em>term, <em>1796, </em>the plaintiff, before he could be entitled <em>to </em>a <em>procedendo, </em>must enter a rule that the defendants appear within twenty days, and make affidavit of the service of notice of such rule on the defendants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-9\"><em>Radcliff, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9X\">said the plaintiff could not enter such a rule, as only two of the defendants were in this court. In <em>Fry </em>v. <em>Careys</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where an action ivas brought in the sheriff\u2019s court against two partners, and one of them brought a <em>habeas corpus </em>and put in bail for himself only, the court of K.

How that appearance is to be effected, it is not necessary now to decide. As the plaintiff has not entered any rule for an appearance, the motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"ARC\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
