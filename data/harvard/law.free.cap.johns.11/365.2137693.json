A. Emmet, (J.

From the lapse of time, therefore, the presumption is, that the debt was paid. It may, perhaps, be said that the judgment was on the bond, for the security of which the mortgage was given, and which judgment has been revived; but the judgment and mortgage are for different sums; and there is a difference also in the parties, one of the bonds being given by Lord <em>Stirling, </em>jointly with <em>Philip Livingston. </em>The revival, therefore, of the judgment does not repel the presumption that the mortgage has been paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-15\">Again, the mortgaged premises did not pass by the will of <em>Anne Waddell. </em>It is settled, that by the general words, \u201c lands, tenements, and hereditaments\u201d in a devise, a mortgage in fee, though forfeited, will not pass, if the testator has other property to which those words will apply.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A mortgage, though in name and appearance it would seem real estate, is, in reality, a mere pledge, and passes as personal property. On principle, a mortgage, where the mortgagee is out of possession, ought never <em>to </em>pass as real property. If it was a mere pledge, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>possession under it. The children of Mrs. Waddell had no right to enter as decisees; nor can their conveyance of the property be operative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-4\">again, the testatrix directs that all the children shall hold as tenants in fee, until a sale by the executors.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Now William Waddell, her eldest son, never joined in the conveyance; the lessors, therefore, must recover one fifth part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\">By the statutc,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> all attor~iments by tenants to strangers are declarod void, unless made pursuant to some judgment at law or decree in equity, or with the privity or consent of the landlord or lessor, or to a mortgagee after th~ mortgage is forfeited. The attachment, then, should have been to the mortgagee, or to the legal representative of the mortgagee. Now William Waddell was the heir at law of the mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">Nor was the attorlinient made with the consent of the land~ lord. Nathan Miller was not the landlord; lie was himself the tenant of Lord Stirling. He was not the owner of the revcr~ sion or lord of the fee. The recital in the deed of attornment shows that he did not pretend to be landlord. It would be in fraud of the statute to allow a tenant to surrender a lease to a stranger, and then attorn to another and take a new lease: The statute is remedial ; and should he liberally construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">Unless the possession can he connected with the legal title under the mortgagee, there can be no adverse possession. The possession here commenced in tenancy or in fraud. Should it be said that it is enough if the party in possession claims title, though the title may be bad,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> yet, still, the possession must be adverse from the beginning; but a title commencing ,ifl tenancy cannot become adverse.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-8\">Again, here was a lease and possession under it, and Lord &amp;irling, or his heirs, had no title to the possession until aftei the lease had expired. It is true, the lease would be forfeited by the attornment, yet the lessor is not bound to take advantage of a forfeiture.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-9\">Again, Lady Stirling had a particular estate for life<footnotemark>||</footnotemark> in the premises, and1 until the determination of that estate, there can he no adverse possession.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-10\">It will, perhaps, be said, that the defendants have shown a title out of the lessor of the plaintiff; and that is enough. But if the attornrnents to Jolui Ta~Jlor were void, the title of the</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Fl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u25a0defendants is derived from the tenants, and they can take no other or better title than such tenants possessed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-4\">Though the case of <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Pegge</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>has since been overruled,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> <em>yol </em>the principle there laid down by <em>Bulle, </em>J. lias never been disturbed. lie lays it down as clear law, that a tenant cannot set up the title of a mortgagee against the mortgagor, because he holds under the mortgage, and has admitted his title. This principle was recognised by this court, in <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Harrington,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Collins </em>v. Torrty.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> In the last case, the court went even further, and would not allow a stranger to defend ids possession, by showing a subsisting mostgage by the lessor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-5\"><em>I. </em>Emoit, and <em>S. Jones, </em>jun. contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am5\">We do not think it necessary, at present, to draw into discussion the validity of the proceedings under the judgment, or of the sheriff\u2019s sale; nor to inquire as to the precise nature of the estates derived by Mrs. <em>Alexander, or </em>Eira. <em>Duer, </em>under the will of Lord <em>Stirling.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">The strong, and, as we contend, unanswerable objection to i'lie plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery is, that there is a subsisting and outstanding forfeited mortgage by Lord <em>Stirling, </em>and which is held by the defendants, which must be a complete shield and defence to them, until the lessors of the plaintiff come in and redeem the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">There were three bonds of Lord <em>Stirling, </em>one of which was already secured by a previous mortgage, and the mortgage In. question was a security for the two others, as well as the first. The judgment was, rao doubt, for the amount of those two bonds. The premises ta question are not included in the parcels of land particularly described, but passed under the general words. Such general description has been held good in <em>England., </em>if a man bargains and sells all his lands in <em>D.} </em>all his houses, woods, S:c. will pacs.<footnotemark>||</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMU\">Here is a mortgage in fee, forfeited and outstanding, which may be used by the tenant in possession, (though he cannot connect himself with the mortgagee,) to defend that possession.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> But <em>John Taylor, </em>and the defendants under him, are, in fact, connected with the mortgagee. The mortgagee died, leaving live children. <em>Henry Waddell, </em>one of the heirs, conveyed to <em>John Taylor, </em>tire Sd of <em>Fehman\u2019, </em>U38. The sheriff\u2019s deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>was dated the 1 Oth of <em>June, </em>1788. <em>Taylor entered under the </em>title derived from the mortgagee, not under the sheriff\u2019s deed. The deed re cites the mortgage, and conveys all the right, ti-tie, and interest of the grantor under it. Similar deeds were executed by two other children, so that <em>Taylor, </em>beside the right of his wife, held the rights of three of the heirs of the mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-5\">If Mrs. <em>Waddell </em>had died without a will, her eldest son, <em>William, </em>would, as her heir at law, have taken all her estate; but as trustee to <em>the </em>executors, or persons entitled to the personal estate, who are all the children. If there had been no will nor debts, and the personal representatives had taken .possession of the mortgaged premises, could the mortgagor turn them out of possession, merely because the heir at law had the <em>legal </em>estate ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0q\">But there is, in fact, a will, which establishes a connexion between the defendants and the mortgagee. The word <em>estate </em>is, used by the devisor in its most extensive sense. She devises <em>all her estate </em>to her five children. This included the debt and mortgage of Lord Stirling, It was the manifest intention of Mrs. <em>W. </em>that her property should go to all her children equally, and not to the heir at law. A mortgage is an interest, or estate, capable of being devised; and if sufficient words of description are used, the land or subject pledged, as well as the money se~ cured by it, vrill pass.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqHq\">Though the legal estate may have been in the heir at law, yet the children, being in possession, and having a <em>beneficial </em>interest, they may protect themselves by the mortgage. It makes no difference whether the interest is that of a devisee, or <em>cestui qui trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-8\">It is said, the court will presume that the mortgage has been satisfied by the payment of the debt; but there is no such presumption, and no proof of payment has been shown or pretended. In regard to judgment debts, there can be no presumption of payment from lapse of time. The judgments are legal debts to this day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsM\">Again, the leases of <em>Miller </em>were subsequent to the mortgage, and are, therefore, in regard to the mortgage, void.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It is unnecessary, therefore, to discuss the doctrine of attornment, for the persons in possession became tenants to the snort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>gagee, and to the defendants claiming under her. But, in truth, the attornments were legal and valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-3\">Again, twenty-three years elapsed from the time <em>Taylor </em>took possession to the commencement of this suit. It is enough that he entered under colour of, or claiming title; for though it were a bad title, still <em>the </em>possession is adverse. He <em>entered, not </em>under Lord <em>Stirling, </em>but as owner; and on the faith of his having a good title, he' took the attornment of the tenants. It is said that the limitation will not run, because Mrs. <em>Alexander, </em>under the will of Lord <em>Stirling, </em>had a particular estate for life in the premises. But we contend, that under that will the wife of Lord <em>Stirling </em>took an estate in fee.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-9\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_D\">said the presumption against its being an unsatisfied mortgage, arising from the lapse of time, was strong; and the evidence to repel that presumption ought to be clear and satisfactory. The defendants cannot cover themselves with this mortgage. The heir at law is not a trustee to the children, but to the executors and administrators of the testatrix, who directs the whole of her estate to be sold and converted into money. This shows, most clearly, that <em>she did not intend </em>that her children should have any concern with the real estate, but merely to recover their shares of the proceeds in money. The general words of the will, will not pass an estate out of the possession of the devisor. The mortgage was intended to go as personal property to the executors, and to be collected by them among the debts.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-16\"> Verna,621. 1 <em>Vernon, </em>4. 1 <em>Atk </em>605. 2 <em>Ch.

I do not think it necessary to examine into the correctness or legality of the proceedings to revive the judgment against-the heirs and tertenants of Lord <em>Stirling; </em>nor whether the premises passed by the sheriff\u2019s deed under that judgment, because the counsel for the defendants, on the argument, disavowed to claim under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The question, then, is as to the validity of the title under the mortgage given by Lord <em>Stirling </em>to <em>Anne Waddell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">The general description in this mortgage is liable to no objection ; a party conusant of his rights may sell or mortgage, by general description, though an officer must define what he sells,</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>It was stated, on the argument, that the proof of the will of <em>Anne Waddell </em>was insufficient, and ought not to have been received as evidence of title; it was read on the trial as a link in the defendants\u2019 title, without objection, which might otherwise have been obviated. It is now too late to make it. The will, therefore, for the purposes of this argument, must be considered as duly proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">By this will, <em>Anne Waddell </em>directs her executors to collect, with all convenient speed, the one third part of the estate left her by her husband, and the interest money since accrued and due to her or to grow due, and all outstanding debts of every kind, and this, with all the rest of her estate in the <em>Hardenbergk </em>patent, and <em>elsewhere, whatsoever and wheresoever, </em>to be turned into money by them, and be equally distributed among her five children, share and share alike, who are to be tenants in common in fee of the severalty until such sale and distribution be made. The testatrix then gives <em>751. </em>to each executor for his trouble, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The words, as used, are not particularly appropriated to the conveyance of real estate, but are applicable to both personal \u00e1nd real; it is all her estate whatsoever. (6 <em>Cruise, </em>231. s. 113. 1 <em>Atk. 605. in note. 2 P. Wms. </em>198. 8 <em>Term Rep, </em>118. 8 Ves.jun. 417. <em>5 Ves. </em>jun. 339.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The term estate evidently applies to all kinds of an estate; the debt and mortgage, consequently, passed by this devise; and as to her real estate, the fee was intended to be vested in all her children, as tenants in common, until distribution made betxveera them; so that it clearly appears never to have been the intention of the testatrix, that <em>William Waddell </em>should hold as trustee. If this is the true interpretation of the xvill, to xvliom ought the tenants to have attorned, but to the children of <em>Anne Waddell, </em>whose legal representative, <em>John Taylor, </em>xvas, as appears by the respective conveyances in evidence, at least sufficiently so, to give force and validity to the transaction. But admitting that the legal estate, created by the forfeiture of the mortgage, did not pass by the xvill, and that it descended to her eldest son, <em>William, </em>as heir at law, who in such case could hold it only as trustee for the executors, and, if no debts exist, (which, for aught that appears, is the fact in this instance,) for the other children. It then might well be questioned xvhether the possession has not been long enough to presume a deed from <em>William, </em>who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>slept on his rights since 1791; and the case of <em>England, ex dem. Syburn, </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>(4 <em>Term Rep. </em>682.) will support this doctrine; but without enforcing this principle, there can be no doubt that <em>John Taylor </em>entered as well under the mortgage, as under the judgments upon all or some of the debts due by Lord <em>Stirling </em>to Mrs. <em>Waddell, </em>also secured by the mortgage. If, then, an attornment, after the mortgage became forfeited, is authorized by statute to a mortgagee, it is equally valid in this case, as the possession by <em>John Taylor </em>must be deemed to have been taken for all the heirs, who cannot be treated by the mortgagor as strangers, and be turned out of a possession, obtained under a mortgage thus held for their benefit, forfeited before such possession was taken, and evidently unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">That possession was taken several years subsequent to the forfeiture cannot be denied. It was, in fact, forfeited previous to the revolutionary war, long before the date of <em>Ann Wad-dell\u2019s </em>will; and the possession was taken subsequent to her death. To show that this is an outstanding mortgage, it is only necessary to advert to the documents and evidence before us; - and although the proceedings to revive- the judgments may be deemed insufficient in law, to support the sale under them, by the sheriff of <em>Ulster </em>county, yet they are evidence to show . the conduct and understanding of the party, in relation to the debt, in order to rebut the presumption of payment, by lapse of time and acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u2022 That such presumption cannot exist, in this case, is evident. The judgment obtained in <em>March, </em>1771, must prevent it. But it is said that this judgment is not for the same debt, and, therefore, disconnected with the mortgage. This cannot be the case; the contrary inference is irresistible. The circumstances in evidence will not admit of a doubt that the judgment is on two of the bonds recited in the mortgage, and that the debt is in fact the same. This alone ought, perhaps, to be deemed sufficient to repel the presumption of payment; but it also appears that proceedings were had in 1775 and in 1788, to revive this judgment, and that, in 1790, <em>John Taylor </em>took possession of the premises, and the tenants attorned to him ; so that instead of acquiescence until this period, the greatest attention and vigilance are evinced. But without noticing the proceedings to revive the judgments, the lapse of time from the 2d of <em>December, </em>1771, the period when the mortgage became due, to the 7th <em>o\u00ed April, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>1790, the time <em>John Taylor </em>took possession, is not long enough ^ presume payment, and deducting the period of the war, from the 14th of <em>October, 1775, </em>to the 21st of <em>March, </em>1785, which ought to be done as being conformable to the rule adopted in the statute of limitations, it is wholly insufficient. Subsequent to 1790, Mr. <em>Taylor, </em>as the claimant under the representatives of <em>Anne Waddell, </em>supposed himself secure in the possession of the property, if not on the ground of title under the sheriff\u2019s deeds, at all events under the mortgage, until it should be paid off, and he ought not now to be disturbed in it.'</p>\n<p id=\"Abn\">It might, perhaps, be insisted that the entry on the premises by Mr. <em>Taylor, </em>while in possession of the sheriff\u2019s deed, in 1790, was under colour of title; and that such entry was made by him as ownel- of the land, under a belief that the deed extinguished the equity of redemption ; and that the premises having been thus adversely held by him and his heirs for upwards of twenty years, the remedy in this action is lost. To determine the character of this possession, involves a question as to the extent of the devise to Lady <em>Stirling, </em>contained in the will of Lord <em>Stirling, </em>whether it gave an estate for life or fee simple. Although, in my view, there can bo little doubt as to the true construction of that devise, and, consequently, of the nature of the defendants\u2019 possession, the inquiry, in this instance, is rendered unnecessary by the conclusive evidence that the mortgage, under which they held the premises in question, is outstanding, and, of course, sufficient to protect them in this action. Without, therefore, giving an opinion as to the right of the lessors to redeem, which cannot be made a question here, we are of opinion, that the defendants are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
