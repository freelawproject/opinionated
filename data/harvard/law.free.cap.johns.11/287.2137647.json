The place of capture was not a port or river, though a place within the jurisdiction or under the control of <em>Napoleon.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATr\"><em>Capture </em>and <em>seizure </em>are not always convertible terms, but one has a different meaning \"from the .other. Capture is a word of known <em>technical </em>signification, and is understood to be a taking of property <em>jure belli, </em>by an enemy in open war, or by way rePisa^ with intent to deprive the owner of it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It is an act done with a hostile intention. A seizure, arrest, or detention, is not a hostile act; it is not done with any view to d<em>e </em>prive the owner of his property. It is not an <em>act of war.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Matilde </em>and <em>Potts,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this distinction is adopted and made the ground of decision by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqO\">It may, perhaps, be said that by the word seizure, the insurers meant <em>capture.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFy\">It is true that the intent and meaning of the parties to the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u2022bument Is to be looked to; and the written clause is to control the printed words. But there is nothing in the written clause here which can control or vary the printed words. The language shows that the insurers understood the distinction for which we contend. The insurance is against <em>capture only: </em>warranted not to abandon in case of <em>capture </em>or <em>detention, </em>until after six months, nor in consequence of <em>blockade. </em>Then what is the meaning of the latter part of the clause, \u201c free <em>from seizure </em>in any river, port or place,\u201d &amp;c. ? It is, no doubt, meant 'o exempt the insurers from land-risks; it was intended to guard against a seizure by land, or by the governing power of the country to xvhich the vessel was bound. The seizure intended is an act by a poxver set in motion from the land, or by the ruling power of the country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">In <em>Jarman </em>v. <em>Coape,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the insurance was \u201c free of capture or seizure in the port or ports of dischargeand the court held the clear intention to be, to exempt the insurers from <em>land-risks.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-8\">In <em>Baring </em>v. Vaux,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> a ship was warranted free from capture in port, and it ivas held that it did not protect the underwriters from any loss happening by capture in a place not within the limits of a <em>port. </em>So in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Tierney,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the ship was warranted free of capture in port, a capture while lying in an open road, outside of a harbour, xvas held not to b'e within the warranty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-9\">Should it be said that the capture was not legal, because within the jurisdiction of a neutral power, it may be ansxvered, that the insurance is against illegal as well as legal captures. Besides, the capture, as it respects the party taken within the neutral jurisdiction, is legal, unless the neutral government complains. The objection as to the legality of the capture, is to be made by the neutral only whose jurisdiction has been violated.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-15\"><em>Golden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOc\">The capture in this case was clearly within the maritime jurisdiction of <em>Holland.</em><footnotemark><em>||</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is' found, by the verdict of the jury, that the capture was within the'jurisdiction of <em>Holland, </em>and that <em>Holland </em>was under the control of <em>Bonaparte. </em>We admit the distinction laid down between capture and seizure or arrest; and we insist that this was not a capture <em>jure belli, </em>or because it xvas enemy\u2019s property, or because it be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>longed to a neutral violating the law of nations. The cause of seizure, as stated in the <em>proceedings </em>of the <em>French </em>court, is that the vessel was sailing to a <em>French </em>port, without having a <em>certificate \u00b0f </em>ort5'lw) in violation of the <em>Berlin </em>and <em>Milan </em>decrees. Those decrees were municipal regulations. They form no part of the law of nations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-5\">The seizure was within the jurisdiction of the country, and by virtue of municipal regulations enforced in the country. That it was made by a vessel of war can make no difference; for vessels of war are authorized to seize for a violation of the revenue laws;</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">In <em>Jerman </em>v. <em>Coape </em>and <em>Baring </em>v. <em>Vaux, </em>the insurers were held not to be liable for seizures in a <em>port </em>or <em>ports. </em>Here the words are far more extensive. The intention ivas to exempt from capture in certain places or situations. It is an exception of a part of the risk before assumed, or from the general words, \u201c capture only.\u201d It has reference to place; that is, the insurance is against capture only, except in any river, port, or place, <em>Sec.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">There is no occasion to resort to any distinction as to the rules of construction between printed and written clauses; for here the general clause and the exception are both written, and the rule of construction must be precisely the same as that of any written contract.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ae_v\"><em>T. A. Emmett, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aec\">said the two clauses were distinct. The exception is put in for the benefit of the insurers, and if. there is any inconsistency, they must take the consequences of it. In construing such occasional clauses, it is usual to inquire by whom they were introduced; and if the party introducing them might have explained himself clearly and explicitly, his not doing so ought not to afford him an occasion to'impose restrictions upon the other party, which he has not distinctly expressed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">* <em>Marsh, on </em>Ins. 305. B. 1. c. 8. s. 3.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKH\">We insist that this is a capture <em>jure belli, </em>as <em>prize of war. </em>The proceedings were in the <em>imperial council of prizes at, Paris. </em>The condemnation in that court was as prize of war. The <em>captors </em>were <em>French privateers; </em>the <em>court </em>was a <em>prize </em>court; the cause of condemnation was a violation of the <em>Berlin </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>Milan </em>decrees, which declare a vessel, in such a situation, <em>denationalized, </em>as having lost her original national character, and as being <em>British </em>or enemy\u2019s property. It was not a condemnation for a violation of a mere municipal regulation, otherwise the proceedings and condemnation would have been in <em>Holland. </em>If any municipal law or ordinance was violated, it was that of <em>Holland, </em>and there would be the place of condemnation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-5\">It was, emphatically, against <em>illegal </em>captures that this insurance was made. At that time, in 1809, no power on earth could <em>legally </em>capture <em>American </em>property; and it was to protect themselves against illegal captures and seizures, not warranted by the law of nations, that the plaintiffs caused this policy to be effected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-6\">The clause being introduced for the benefit of the insurers, they cannot take advantage of any inconsistency or contradiction between it and the other parts of the policy, so as to vary the meaning of the words used.

This <em>is </em>an insurance on the brig <em>Resort, </em>on a voyage from <em>Ncw-York </em>to <em>Bremen, </em>or a port of discharge in the <em>North Sea </em>or <em>Baltic, </em>against <em>capture </em>only. The policy, among other warranties, contained the following: \u201c Also <em>free from seizure </em>in any port . or place under the jurisdiction of <em>Napoleon, </em>or under the jurisdiction of any power under his control or in alliance with him.\u201d The brig was taken on the coast of <em>Holland, </em>by two <em>French </em>privateers, and carried into the port of <em>Amsterdam, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Was afterwards condemned by the imperial council of prizes g's <em>Paris, </em>as prize of war. The jury found that the\" capture was Within the jurisdiction of <em>Holland, </em>and that <em>Holland </em>was, at the t\u21226) i*1 alliance with, or under the control or jurisdiction of? <em>Napoleon, </em>and the question for the court is, as to the meaning of the exception <em>\u201cfree from </em>seizure,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"AoP\">The exception was intended for the benefit of the underwriters, and in order to give it any effect, must be so construed as to restrict the risk assumed by the general words of th\u00e9 policy.. The insurance being against capture only\", any exception out of that risk must have been intended to extend to some peril which, would have fallen under the denomination of capture; otherwise, the exception is senseless. The underwriters did not assume the risk of <em>seizure </em>for breach of any municipal regulations. It would, therefore, be giving\" no effect to the exception to limit it to such risk. It is, \u00f1o doubt, a sound rule of construction, that terms made use of in contracts are to be understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense,\" unless the context evidently requires, in order to effectuate the intention of the parties, that they should be understood in some other special and peculiar sense. Seizure may, in general, be applicable <em>to </em>a taking or detention, for the violation of some municipal regulation; but where such meaning cannot be given to it, consistent with the obvious sense and understanding of the parties, it is no violation of any settled rule or principle of law, to give it some other interpretation, better comporting with the fair intention of the parties. The underwriters did not mean to assume any risk except that of capture, and not even that, if made in any river, port, or place under the jurisdiction of Napoleon, or under the jurisdiction of any power under his control, or in alliance with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">It is no strained interpretation of- the term <em>seizure </em>to consider it as synonymous with capture; and then the underwriters, although they assume the risk of capture generally, exempt themselves even from that risk, if the capture is made under any of the circumstances mentioned in the warranty. In no other way can any rational interpretation be given to the clause; and the jury having found that the seizure or capture was, in fact, within the exception as to place, the underwriters cannot be made re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>sponsible for the loss, defendants. Judgment must, accordingly, be for the</p>\n<p id=\"Aht\">Judgment for the defendants.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\"> In <em>Dagleish and others v. Brooke, </em>(15 <em>East's Rep. </em>294.) the goods were warranted <em>61 </em>free from capture or seisure in the ship\u2019s port or ports of discharge.\u201d The ship arrived in the outer road of <em>Pillm, </em>which is a bar harbour, where large ships, like the one mentioned in the policy, are obliged to discharge part of tbeir cargoes into lighters, in order to go over the bar into the inner harbour, where the remainder is discharged ; and the captain having anchored two miles and a quarter further out than ships usually lie for that purpose, which difference was decided by the jury to be immaterial, he went on shore to obtain permission to discharge his cargo, and returned in five or six days, in company with some <em>Prussian </em>soldiers and a pilot, who took possession of the ship and cargo, which was afterward confiscated; this was held to he an arrival at the elected <em>port </em>of discharge, and a <em>seisure </em>there within the meaning of the warranty, so as to discharge the insurers from the loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
