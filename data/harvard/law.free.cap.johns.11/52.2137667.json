Lovell Sr Co. </em>and applied towards paying the said debt. It was agreed, at the time of the transfer o\u00ed the notes, that the defendant should not be called upon for Payment, until all legal means had been used to recover the amount of such notes from the makers. The note in question not being paid, a suit was brought against the maker and a judgment recovered against him, on which a <em>fi.fa. </em>was issued, and afterwards a <em>ca. sa. </em>on which being .taken in custody, the maker afterwards obtained Ms discharge under the insolvent act, so that * nothing had been collected from him; and a suit was afterwards brought in the name of the plaintiff against the defendant,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aak\">It was contended by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, at the trial, that the interest in the note was in <em>Thomas Lovell if Co. </em>at and from the . <em>\u201e </em>commencement of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AL6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that as the note was'endorsed and delivered for the benefit of <em>Thomas Lovell Sc Co. </em>and ivas so endorsed after it was due, it was not competent to the plaintiff alone to sustain the action; and that no action could be maintained for the benefit of <em>T.

Lovell </em>and his partner or partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-22\">The court below, therefore, nonsuited the plaintiff.

That the plaintiff below having voluntarily submitted to a nonsuit, and there being no judgment for costs, no error would lie on the judgment. The defendant did not ask for a nonsuit, but the plaintiff suffered himself to be nonsuited, and he cannot now get rid of the judgment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\"> 1 <em>H.

But the defendant could have no concern with that question. He was responsible to the person whose name was so inserted in the blank endorsement. This is a plain and settled rule, and a decision to this effect was made in the court of errors in 1800, in the case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Kerr. It </em>is also settled, that error will lie on a judgment of nonsuit; <em>(Willson </em>v. <em>Foree, </em>6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>110.) and though there be no <em>costs </em>awarded upon the record in <em>this </em>case against the plaintiff) who was nonsuited, yet he was aggrieved by being defeated of his right of action in that suit, and of his costs for prosecuting the same. If illegally nonsuited, the judgment of ponsuit ought to be reversed, and the plaintiff reinstated in the cause in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
