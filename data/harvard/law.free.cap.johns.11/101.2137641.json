W. Tremper, </em>deceased, in his lifetime, to <em>Margaret Livingston, </em>the testatrix, in her lifetime. The declaration contained but one count, eharging the defendants as <em>heirs and devisees </em>generally, without showing how they were heirs and devisees. The defendants pleaded <em>riens per descent, 8?e, </em>on which the plaintiffs joined issue. The cause was tried at the <em>Ulster </em>circuit, m September, 1813, when a verdict was taken for the plaintiffs, by consent, subject to the opinion of the court on the following case:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-14\"><em>J. W. Tremper, </em>the obligor,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADR\">in <em>October, </em>1794, died seised of a large real estate, leaving, as his heirs and representatives, <em>WilHam Tremper, Catharine, </em>the wife of <em>Conrad E. Elmendorf, John Tremper, Elizabeth, </em>the wife of <em>S. H. Phillips, </em>and <em>Jacob I. Tremper, </em>all of whom were defendants; and <em>Ann, </em>who married <em>John Story, </em>the other defendant, by whom she had a son named <em>John. Ann </em>afterwards died; and after her death her , \u201e , . son also died, before the commencement of this suit. <em>Ann, </em>before her intermarriage with <em>John Story, </em>had married <em>John McGregor, </em>by whom she had a son named <em>John, </em>now living; the father having died soon after he was born, and after the death of <em>J. W. Tremper. John Story, </em>the husband of <em>Ann, </em>and one of the defendants, before and after the death of <em>Ann </em>and her son, and before and since the commencement of this suit, possessed and occupied a part of the real estate of which the said <em>John W. Tremper </em>died seised, and received the rents, &amp;c. for the same, by virtue of a conveyance thereof, made by the said <em>Ann, </em>in her lifetime, during her intermarriage with the defendant <em>John Story, </em>to <em>Alexander Story, </em>his brother, who, afterwards, before the commencement of this suit, conveyed the same to the said <em>John Story ; </em>but the plaintiffs were ignorant of such conveyance until the trial of the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The defendants insisted that the plaintiffs ought to be non-suited, because they had not proved their allegation that the defendant, <em>John </em>Story, was an heir or devisee of <em>J. W. Tremper.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-4\">The cause was submitted to the court without argument.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AI-\">The declaration is against the defendants as <em>heirs and devisees </em>of <em>Tremper </em>generally, and the defendants have pleaded <em>riens per descent. </em>With respect to all the defendants, except <em>John Story, </em>it was proved that they were heirs or devisees ; but he neither inherited, nor took any thing by devise, from <em>Tremper. </em>His wife was a daughter of <em>Tremper, </em>but had, together with her husband, conveyed her proportion of his real estate to a third person, who afterwards conveyed it back to <em>Story. </em>It cannot be pretended that <em>Story </em>is either an heir or devisee of <em>Tremper, </em>and he cannot be charged as such. (2 <em>Saund. </em>7. note 4.) The declaration is in the <em>dehet and detinst. </em>This action is, therefore, to be classed among those arising <em>ex contractu; </em>and, by the settled principles-of law, the plaintiffs were bound to prove a joint liability on the part of all the defendants ; and not having done so, they ought to have been non-suited.
