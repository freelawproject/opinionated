The wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ness further stated that <em>Otis </em>was dead; that on a former trial of the cause, in the court of common pleas of <em>Jefferson </em>county, from which it was removed to this court, <em>Otis </em>was a witness, and testified that the note was first deposited with him in the autumn of the year 1808, in the manner mentioned by the witness; that in February, 1809, <em>Kibling </em>informed him, <em>Otis, </em>of the payment of the note; that the endorsement of it was afterwards obtained, and it was delivered to the plaintiff towards payment of his demand against <em>Daggett </em>and <em>Otis, </em>on their note above mentioned; that, at the time he so delivered the note to the plaintiff he informed him of the payment of it, and of the manner in which the endorsement from <em>Daggett </em>had been obtained, and told the plaintiff he might take the note and make what he could from it. This evidence, as to what <em>Otis </em>testified at a former trial, was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel; but the judge admitted it on the ground that <em>Otis </em>was dead. The defendant then produced and proved a receipt given by <em>Daggett </em>to the plaintiff, which was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, but admitted by the judge. The receipt was as follows: <em>\u201cChester, January </em>3, 1809, received of <em>John Kibling, </em>jun. the .full demand which I hold against him, dated the <em>1 Tth </em>of <em>May last, </em>which was given for a certain lot of land in <em>Ellisburgh, </em>bping for value received.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-4\">The. jury, under the direction of the judge, found a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">\u25a0 A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-6\"><em>N. </em>Williams, for the plaintiff contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A14\">1. That the note in question having been endorsed and transferred before it became due, and before the alleged payment by the maker, evidence of such payment was inadmissible. AVhere a note is negotiated before it is due, the holder cannot be affected by any dealings or transactions between the maker and payee.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Where a note is transferred before it is due, the maker is not allowed to show payment, or to impeach the consideration,, unless to prove a fraud in its original creation;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and it is only where it is neg\u00f3tiated after it is due, that any such defence is allowed. . Again, this note was. actually <em>delivered </em>to <em>Otis </em>in 180.8, and before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>time of the alleged payment, though not then endorsed. This was a valid transfer of the note, at that time, and <em>Daggett </em>ivas hound, when called upon at any time afterwards, to endorse the note. It is not essential, to the transfer of a note, that it should be endorsed at the time of its delivery to the endorsee,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> provided the endorsement is afterwards made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX1\">Again, it is a general principle of law, that where one of two innocent persons must suffer, by the act of a third, he who enabled such third person to occasion the loss ought to sustain it.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The plaintiff is an innocent endorsee; and the defendant, who pag suffered the note to remain in his hands after it was paid, ought to sustain the loss, or to seek his remedy against Daggett, the payee, if he has fraudulently endorsed it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX8\">Again, the evidence of the payment was improper and illegal. The receipt and declarations of <em>Daggett, </em>the endorser, who was no party to the suit, ought not to be allowed to defeat the right of a <em>bona fide </em>holder. The terms of the receipt are peculiar and remarkable, and may well induce a suspicion as to its fairness. The evidence of <em>Cole, </em>as to what <em>Otis </em>swore, as a witness at the former trial, was not admissible, without producing the record or <em>postea. </em>The rule, that testimony of what a witness swore at a former trial is not admissible, unless accompanied with the <em>postea, </em>was recognised by this court in <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Guernscy.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0r\"><em>Sedgwick, </em>contra. The note was not regularly endorsed or negotiated; it was delivered as a pledge, or for collateral security merely. <em>Daggett, </em>evidently, did not mean to negotiate it. Notes payable to order are transferable only by endorsement. Though the note was not due, yet, as the plaintiff took it, <em>knowing </em>that it had been paid, he took it subject to such payment. <em>Notice </em>of the equities of another before the execution of a contract, or the payment of the money, is equivalent to a notice before the contract.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> The plaintiff having taken the note, with full knowledge of its being paid, does not stand in ^ie situation of an innocent and <em>bona fide </em>holder; and having such notice, it can malee no difference whether the note was negotiated before or after it was due. The defendant was justified in making the payment, not having any knowledg\u00e9 of the transfer of the note. The note produced to him was not endorsed; there was no evidence, therefore, of the transfer of the title \u00a9r property in the note. For aught that appeared, <em>Otis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>may have been the agent of Daggett.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It cannot be pretended that the payment was fraudulent, as it regarded <em>Otis, </em>or the plaintiff, unless clear and positive notice of the transfer or assignment to him was shown.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AM4\"> <em>Prior </em>v. <em>Jacocks, </em>Johns. <em>Cas. 169 Stra. 1155.

The testimony is abundantly sufficient to show a payment of the note to the payee, and that the fact of such payment was communicated to the plaintiff, before the note was transferred or delivered to him. The only doubt that can arise is, as to the competency of the evidence admitted to prove the payment. This evidence principally consisted in the proof of what was sworn to by <em>William Otis </em>on a former trial of this cause, in the common pleas of <em>Jefferson </em>county. It was objected that this testimony was not admissible. As a general' proposition, this objection was not well taken, and was, therefore, properly overruled. There was no pretence that <em>Otis, </em>if living, would not have been a competent witness, and no such objection could have been made; for, even admitting him to have stood in the character of an endorsee of <em>the note, </em>yet he was a competent witness to prove a payment, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> We </em>must presume that the pendency of the former trial was admitted, as no objection appears to have been made, at the trial, on that ground. This testimony was, then, properly admitted; and shows, con-elusively, that when the note was delivered to the plaintiff, he was informed that it had been paid, and of the manner in which the endorsement, by <em>Daggett, </em>the payee, had been procured. There was no pretence that the payment to <em>Daggett </em>was fraudulent. If so, it was matter which ought to have been submitted to the jury. But the case does not furnish evidence from which \u00a1the jury could reasonably have inferred fraud. The motion for a now trial must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Judgment for the defendant-.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b141-12\"> 2 <em>East, </em>450, <em>Shitty on Bills, </em>284. <em>Peake\u2019s </em>N. <em>P. </em>6. <em>52.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
