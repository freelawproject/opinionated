It appeared that the debt for which the present suit was brought, was contracted in the state of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>where the parties were at that time resident, and that the defendant, on the 27th <em>March, </em>1812, obtained a discharge under the insolvent laws of that state, from imprisonment, and from all liability of <em>his person, </em>for any debts, before that time contracted. The plaintiff was, at the time of the defendant\u2019s obtaining his discharge, and still is, resident in <em>Pennsylvania.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-13\"><em>Fay </em>cited <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(2 <em>Johns.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ5i\">It is impossible to distinguish this case from that of Smith v. Spinolla. That case was decided on a sound principle, that if a foreign creditor pursues his debtor here, he is entitled to the remedy provided by our own laws. We look oniy to the course of proceedings established in our own courts. The lex loci contractus is not applicable on this motion. When the cause comes to issue, and the discharge is pleaded, it will be time enough to consider of its effect.</p>\n<author id=\"b205-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A3la\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
