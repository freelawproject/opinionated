The cause was tried before the <em>Chief </em>Justice, at the <em>New-York </em>sittings, in <em>November, </em>1813.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-9\">The bill of exchange was dated at <em>Baltimore, </em>the 23d <em>July, </em>1799, drawn by <em>C. F. C. Busche </em>on <em>J. A- </em>and <em>D. IT. Rucker, </em>Esqs. of <em>London, </em>for 120 pounds sterling, at sixty days\u2019 sight, in favour of <em>William Magruder, </em>who endorsed it to the defendant, who endorsed it to the plaintiff. The first of the set of exchange which had been protested, was lost with the vessel in which it <em>*\u25a0 </em>7 was sent, in its passage from <em>London </em>to Baltimore, m the autumn of the year 1799.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-13\">It appeared by a copy of the protest for non-acceptance, taken from the books of the notary, in <em>July, </em>1804, by another , . . , , . notary, (the notary who made the protest being since dead,) that the bill was regularly protested for non-acceptance the 14th <em>September, </em>1799 $ and it also appeared by a copy of the protest for non-payment, that it had been regularly protested for nonpayment on the 16th <em>November, </em>1799.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-19\">To prove notice to the defendant, as endorser of the bill, of die <em>non-acceptance </em>of it, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel read the deposition of <em>William Taylor, </em>residing in <em>Baltimore, </em>taken under a commission issued in the cause. The witness stated that he received the bill in question from <em>W. Bryden, </em>the plaintiff, in payment of a debt, and transmitted it to his correspondent in <em>London. </em>That some time in the month of <em>November, 1799, the </em>witness received a letter from his correspondent advising him that the bill had not been accepted; and within three days after the receipt of the letter, the witness himself gave verbal notice thereof to the defendant, who resided at the <em>Fountain Inn </em>tavern in <em>Baltimore; </em>that the witness also directed <em>William O. Payne, </em>who was then a clerk in his employment, to <em>give notice </em>to the defendant of the non-acceptance of the bill, and the defendant afterwards acknowledged to the witness that he had received such notice from his clerk; that his clerk had been dead for several years, and that the. witness was the holder ?of the bill at the time the notice ef the non-acceptance thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>was so given to the defendant; the witness did not recollect whether the notice given by <em>Payne </em>was verbal or written, but the purport of it rvas to inform the defendant of the non-acceptance \u00b0f the bill, and that the witness, as holder, looked to him for the payment of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">On this evidence, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a non-suit, on the ground that due notice of the non-acceptance of the bill had not been proved, but the motion was overruled by the <em>Chief Justice, </em>who, in his charge to the jury, stated that it was for them to decide, from the testimony and the circumstances of the case, whether or not there had been reasonable and due diligence in giving notice to the defendant of the dishonour of the bill; and that if they should be of that opinion, and to which opinion he inclined, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-6\"><em>T.

He also directed <em>Payne, </em>his clerk, who is since dead, to give notice to the defendant, who afterwards acknowledged to <em>Taylor </em>that he had received such- notice from <em>Payne ; </em>but <em>when Payne </em>\u2022 gave the notice does not appear. Tt is presumable, however, that it was after the notice given by <em>Taylor. </em>'</p>\n<p id=\"AiC\">The question then is, whether notice to an endorser, given <em>within three days </em>after advice is received of the dishonour of a bill, where the parties reside in the same place, is reasonable notice. What is a reasonable notice in such case, is a mixed question of law and fact; but when the facts are ascertained, it becomes purely a question of law. This results from the necessity of having some fixed legal standard, by which men may not .only know the law, but be protected by it. This principle-is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>~teitied in the Engtis1~ courts. (Kyd on Bills, (3d edit.) 127. an~ the cases cited.) In the case of Tindali v. Brown, (1 Term Rep. 167.) a bill was payable on the 5th October. The holder called on that day, ai~d on the 6th and 7th, on the acceptor. and was amused by fair promises. On the 7th October he gave no~ tice to the endorser, the parties living within 20 minutes' walk. The court held the notice too late, and, to enforce the law, granted a third trial. We have always required the earliest notice of the protest of a bill for non.acceptance, or non~pay~ ment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The <em>Chief Justice </em>submitted the question of law and fact to the jury, with an intimation in favour of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, when, in my judgment, he ought to have nonsuited the plaintiff, for not proving notice to the defendant, within a reasonable time. The transaction, it is true, is stale, and the de- . fendant has not pleaded the statute of limitation^; but the plaintiff can derive no benefit from these considerations. This <em>laches </em>ought not to work any prejudice to the .defendant, eir create any presumptions against him. There must b\u00e9' a new trial, A\u00edi\u00e1 the costs are to abide tite event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
