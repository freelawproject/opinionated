Hamilton and defendant Charles L. Johnston together entered the business of a financial consulting service which they incorporated under the name of Hamilton, Johnston, &amp; Co. Inc. (hereinafter \u201cplaintiff\u201d), around January 1977. The firm was joined by defendants James C. Dragon and Deborah L. Gochenour in 1983. Differences arose, and defendants Johnston, Dragon and Gochenour left plaintiff\u2019s firm. In October 1988 they formed a new concern under the name of Johnston, Dragon &amp; Associates, which is also a defendant herein. At the time of the breakup Johnston owned 10% of plaintiff\u2019s outstanding corporate stock and Hamilton held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>90%. Johnston contends that he was fired from his position with plaintiff by Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Plaintiff instituted this action against defendants in September 1989. Its amended complaint alleges misappropriation of trade secrets and customer requirements, interference with employment relationships, improper solicitation of plaintiffs customers and conspiracy. In bringing the action, plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages. Defendants denied the material allegations of the complaint and counterclaimed for distribution of their shares in plaintiff\u2019s profit sharing and retirement plan, tortious interference with defendants\u2019 ability to earn a living and breach of certain fiduciary responsibilities by Hamilton. Johnston also alleged that his employment was wrongfully terminated by Hamilton in breach of an oral contract between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">After a two-week trial a judgment was entered on December 7, 1990, and, after post-judgment motions, an amended judgment was entered on January 11, 1991. By its terms, the trial court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair competition, but determined that defendant Johnston, Dragon &amp; Associates had plagiarized plaintiff\u2019s client report form, thereby committing a trademark infringement. No compensatory damages were found, but defendant Johnston, Dragon &amp; Associates, Inc., was ordered to pay plaintiff $10,000 in punitive damages. Defendants were also enjoined from utilizing \u201cthe format and text of Hamilton &amp; Co.\u2019s work products.\u201d \u201cHamilton &amp; Co.\u201d is the name by which plaintiff is now known.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The trial court also ordered that plaintiff pay defendants their interests in plaintiff\u2019s profit sharing and retirement plan as of December 31, 1988, plus prejudgment interest, totaling $104,439.30 for Johnston, $37,149.84 for Dragon, and $10,458.70 for Gochenour. In addition, plaintiff was ordered to pay Johnston $55,000, \u201crepresenting the fair value of his shares in Plaintiff Corporation as of August 31, 1988, plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $9,072.60.\u201d Plaintiff was also ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to pay defendants\u2019 attorneys the sum of $2,500 as fees relating to defendants\u2019 claims in the Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan, and $7,500 relating to Johnston\u2019s claim \u201cfor redemption of his shares of stock in Plaintiff.\u201d Plaintiff was further ordered to pay Johnston $8000 for his accountant\u2019s fees relating to his claim for the shares of stock and Johnston was ordered to pay $1,250 to plaintiff for the services of a court-appointed expert and $180 for a deposition. Finally, plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for attorney\u2019s fees was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Plaintiff first contends that the trial court erred in taking jurisdiction over the individual defendants\u2019 profit sharing claims on the ground that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over actions involving breaches of fiduciary duties with respect to covered plans. <em>See </em>29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(e). The trial court did not consider this issue because it was not seasonably raised during the trial. The question of jurisdiction is usually recognized as an exception to the general rule that an appellate court will decline to consider issues, not properly presented to the trial court when there was an opportunity to do so. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973); <em>Saul v. Midlantic National Bank/South, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 82, 572 A.2d 650 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>319, 585 A.2d 338 (1990). <em>R. </em>4:6-7 states: \u201cWhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the matter except as otherwise provided by <em>R. </em>1:13-4.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:13-4 deals only with the duty of a court which lacks subject matter jurisdiction to transfer the matter to the proper tribunal. We will therefore consider the matter as though it had been properly raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Defendants agree that plaintiff's Profit-Sharing Retirement Plan is covered by ERISA, and that federal law governs under the broad preemption provision of 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1144. The issue here is whether this case comes within the concurrent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>jurisdiction set forth in 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132. Subsection (e)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">Except for actions under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this subchapter brought by the Secretary or by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary. State courts of competent jurisdiction and district courts of the United States shall have concurrent jurisdiction of actions under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">A civil action may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">(1) by a participant or beneficiary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Paragraph 8 of plaintiff\u2019s Profit-Sharing Retirement Plan concerns distribution upon termination of employment. Paragraph 8.2 allows the plan\u2019s committee to determine, \u201cin its sole discretion,\u201d the time and manner of payment of the participant\u2019s vested interest, provided that the commencement of benefits not be postponed later than 60 days after the plan year of the participant\u2019s normal retirement date.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Plaintiff argues that this granting of sole discretion removes defendants\u2019 claims from the scope of 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). According to plaintiff, defendants must prove more than that benefits were due to them under the terms of the plan; they must prove \u201cthat Trustee Hamilton breached his ERISA-defined fiduciary duties to them by \u2018arbitrarily and capriciously\u2019 abusing his discretion.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">Defendants here make no claim regarding \u201cERISA-defined fiduciary duties,\u201d as set forth in 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1104-1109. They claim only that benefits are due to them now under the plan. We differentiate between fiduciary duty, which is not in issue here, and an abuse of the discretion which the terms of the plan grant to the committee. Since the terms of the plan here grant discretion to the committee to pay the benefits due now or later, and since there is no claim that the trustee or committee has breached any \u201cERISA-defined fiduciary duties\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>or any other provision of ERISA, we regard this as an action to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan pursuant to 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) and therefore subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of the state and federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Plaintiff relies on <em>Young v. Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Assoc. Production Workers Welfare Fund, </em>112 <em>Misc.</em>2d 692, 447 N.Y.S.2d 798 (Sup.Ct.1981). There, some 200 employees were terminated from membership in the subject welfare fund because the employer\u2019s contributions were inadequate to support continued coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 693, 447 N.Y.S.2d at 799. Plaintiffs, the president and negotiating committee of the local union, sought to enjoin the fund from terminating the memberships, alleging that the fund\u2019s fiduciary, its board of trustees, \u201cwas motivated by bad faith, fraud and arbitrary and capricious conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court initially determined, after a trial, that plaintiffs did prove that the trustees\u2019 action was arbitrary and capricious, and made in bad faith. <em>Ibid. </em>However, to reach this determination, the court \u201cconsidered and applied ... the fiduciary duties of and standards applicable to a fiduciary as established by the Employment [sic] Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 29 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>and by the common law____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Apparently, the trustees had either negligently or in bad faith failed to collect required contributions from the employer. 112 Msc.2d at 693-694, 447 <em>N.</em>Y.S.2d at 799-800.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">On reconsideration, the court determined that it was without jurisdiction under 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132. The court cited <em>H.R.Rep. No. 533, </em>93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, </em>4639, 5107: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Young, supra, </em>112 Misc.2d at 700, 447 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 803. The court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The U.S. district courts are to have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to actions involving breach of fiduciary responsibility as well as exclusive jurisdiction over other actions to enforce or clarify benefit rights provided under title I [the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]. However, with respect to suits to enforce benefit rights under the plan or to recover benefits under the plan which do not involve application of the title I provisions, they may be brought not only in U.S. district courts but also in State courts of competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Upon the foregoing authority, the Court finds that the words \u201c... under the terms of the plan\u201d must be read restrictively. That is, actions falling within the scope of that exception include only those wherein the participant or beneficiary asks the Court, as in a typical contract action, to construe or apply the terms of the plan to the facts of his/her particular issue____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">The instant action concerns itself not with the clarification or enforcement of benefits or rights as prescribed by the plan, but rather, with an effort by plaintiffs to forestall what they allege to be their wrongful removal from coverage by the plan. Such an action calls into question issues beyond the plan itself and removes this action from this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-9\"><em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Here, defendants\u2019 claims are not \u201ca typical contract action\u201d requiring construction of the terms of the plan. This action is concerned solely with obtaining benefits prescribed by the plan. Unlike <em>Young, supra, </em>there is no question of \u201cwrongful removal from coverage\u201d or \u201cpropriety of fiduciary conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The issue here is whether the committee abused the discretion which the terms of the plan gave it. In contrast to <em>Young, supra, </em>this issue does not reach beyond the plan itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Plaintiff next contends that the trial court erred in ordering immediate distribution of the individual defendants\u2019 shares in plaintiff\u2019s profit sharing retirement plan, pointing out that Paragraph 8.2 gives the committee which administers the plan full discretion to determine the time and manner of payment. In <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>101, 108-109, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>948, 953, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>80, 91 (1989), the Supreme Court clarified \u201cthe appropriate standard of review in \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) actions challenging denials of benefits based on plan interpretations,\u201d explaining that the federal courts had adopted the arbitrary and capricious standard developed under the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 186(c). Looking to \u201cestablished principles of trust law,\u201d the Court determined that this standard of review was appropriate when, as here, \u201cthe benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>construe the terms of the plan.\u201d 489 <em>U.S. </em>at 115, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 956, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Although the trial court here did not clearly enunciate this standard, by necessary implication from its use of the phrase \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d when asking Hamilton why he decided not to make the early distribution, it found that Hamilton\u2019s denial was arbitrary and capricious. The court rejected Hamilton\u2019s testimony that payment of defendants\u2019 claims would harm the fund because \u201cit would be difficult to find an investment advisor to manage the funds.\u201d This finding of fact was based on sufficient credible evidence in the record, specifically the countering testimony of Dragon, on the basis of which the judge concluded that \u201cinvestment managers clamor to be the advisor to consultants such as the parties to this matter.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 <em>A.2d </em>495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The court further rejected Hamilton\u2019s testimony that his policy was to make distributions prior to retirement only in the event of hardship. Again, Dragon\u2019s credible testimony was that Hamilton told him that company policy was to make lump sum payments to departing employees. D-15, a memo entitled \u201cEarly Distributions from Profit-Sharing Retirement Plans,\u201d prepared by plaintiff\u2019s accountant, lists four individuals who received early distributions from plan 001, and the amounts, in 1983 through 1986, and two individuals who received early distribution from plan 002, and their amounts, in 1987. Hamilton explained that the first four early distributions were covered by a different plan; only the latter two were covered by the plan in question here, and they were both hardship cases. He complained that it was his policy to make it a \u201cretirement plan not a departure incentive plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">However, this contradicts the stated purpose of the plan in paragraph 1.2: \u201cThe purpose of the Plan is to provide retirement benefits and prior to retirement, certain death <em>and termination benefits, </em>for eligible employees through a fund created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>solely by contributions from the net profits and surplus of the Company\u2019s business.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, although the court did not cite this provision, it was entirely justified in finding that Hamilton\u2019s hardship policy was a \u201cguise,\u201d and that \u201cdefendants should receive the same treatment\u201d as other departing employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Plaintiff also argues that the trial court erred in selecting December 31, 1988, as the valuation date for defendants\u2019 interests in the profit sharing plan. It maintains that the correct date was December 31, 1987. The issue of the proper valuation date was not raised below and will not be considered on review. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indemnity Ins. Co., supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 300 A.2d 142. In <em>Skripek v. Bergamo, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 629, 491 A.2d 1336 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>303, 508 A.2d 189 (1985), the court declined to consider a theory of medical malpractice which was raised for the first time on appeal. Its refusal to review plaintiff\u2019s claim was regarded as a \u201cnecessary and fundamental principle of appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630, 491 A.2d 1336. Similarly here, plaintiff had every opportunity to raise the issue below but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In any event, as plaintiff points out, paragraph 6.1 of the plan, on which it relies, sets forth the valuation date for retirement purposes only. Although plaintiff contends that this should also be utilized for a non-retiring departing employee, we see no good reason why this should be done. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s utilization of the 1988 date appears to be reasonable since each of the individual defendants left plaintiff\u2019s employ in the latter half of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">As to plaintiff\u2019s contention that it is the wrong party to be ordered to distribute the funds, this also was not raised below. However, in our view the entry of judgment against the employer and not the plan clearly qualifies as an \u201cerror or omission ... of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u00a7 1132(d)(1) provides: \u201cAn employee benefit plan may sue or be sued under this subchapter as an entity.\u201d In <em>Gelardi v. Pertec Computer Corp., </em>761 <em>F.2d </em>1323 (9th Cir.1985), the court cited this section, as well as 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) and 1144(a), and concluded: \u201cERISA permits suits to recover benefits only against the Plan as an entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324. Other courts have also determined that an employer is not a proper party in an employee\u2019s suit to recover plan benefits under ERISA. <em>Boyer v. J.A. Majors Co. Employees\u2019 Profit Sharing Plan, </em>481 <em>F.Supp. </em>454, 458 (N.D.Ga.1979); <em>Barrett v. Thorofare Markets, Inc., </em>452 <em>F.Supp. </em>880, 884-885 (W.D.Pa.1978); <em>Cohen v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., </em>196 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>669, 242 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>84, 87 (Ct.App.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The matter will be remanded to the Chancery Division to enable defendants to join the profit sharing retirement plan as a third-party defendant pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:8-la, \u201cby leave of court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Plaintiff challenges the awards against it of pre-judgment interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and accountants\u2019 fees, as to Johnston\u2019s claim for his stock. Plaintiff's major argument is that Johnston arbitrarily rejected Hamilton\u2019s pretrial offer, citing the trial court\u2019s findings: \u201cSince the court has found that formula does not apply, but that the standard should be fair market value, Hamilton was closer to being correct than was Johnston.\u201d Plaintiff cites <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8)(d), which provides that interest shall not be allowed \u201cif the court finds that the refusal of the shareholder to accept any offer of payment was arbitrary, vexatious, or otherwise not in good faith.\u201d Plaintiff further contends that the award of counsel fees was an abuse of discretion since the trial court failed to consider the relevant factor of Johnston\u2019s arbitrary action. However, since the trial judge should have applied the formula set forth in the shareholders agreement for valuing Johnston\u2019s stock, as we explain further in this opinion, Hamilton was not closer than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Johnston to being correct, and the premise for plaintiff\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As to attorneys and accounts fees, this is nowhere provided for in the shareholders agreement. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7 cannot support a fee award because the action herein was not taken pursuant to that statute; it is an action based on contract. Thus, since the shareholders agreement is being enforced, Johnston is not entitled to any counsel fee on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Paragraph 6 of the shareholders\u2019 agreement of April 10, 1984, requires the corporation to purchase the stock owned by a shareholder who has died. If the corporation is unable to do so, the surviving shareholder has an option to purchase the deceased shareholder\u2019s stock. The purchase is to be at the \u201cprice and on the terms provided in paragraph 8 hereof.\u201d Paragraph 6(b) provides that if the corporation is unable to make the purchase, and the surviving shareholder elects not to, then \u201cthe Corporation shall be dissolved and its business and assets liquidated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Paragraph 7(a) of the agreement provides that a \u201cSale Event\u201d shall occur upon the incompetence or disability of a shareholder, or \u201cthe cessation of a Shareholder\u2019s full time employment with the Corporation for any reason whatsoever other than death.\u201d Paragraph 7(b) gives the corporation a first option to purchase the selling shareholder\u2019s shares upon the occurrence of a sale event, \u201cat the price determined in paragraph 8 below.\u201d If the corporation fails to exercise its option, then the remaining shareholder shall have an option to purchase the stock also \u201cat the price determined in paragraph 8 below.\u201d Paragraph 7(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">If the Corporation and/or the Remaining Shareholder do not elect to purchase all of the Common Stock of the Selling Shareholder, then the Corporation shall be dissolved and its business and assets liquidated. Such liquidation and dissolution shall be prosecuted by them with all reasonable speed and the distribution of assets of the Corporation shall be made as promptly as possible in accordance with the rights of the creditors and Shareholders of the Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Paragraph 8 sets the purchase price at the corporation\u2019s book value plus the average of its net sales for the year of the death or sale event, the preceding year and the following year, multiplied by the percentage owned by the deceased or selling shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">With no further explanation, the trial judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">An original shareholders agreement was amended in 1984, basically to put key man insurance in place to fund a redemption from either shareholder in case of death. A policy was purchased on Hamilton\u2019s life in the face amount of $1 million: none was purchased on Johnston\u2019s life. Although the agreement called for a payout based on a formula for ascertaining the value of each share, it is clear that the parties did not intend that formula to be the source of valuation for a redemption caused by something other than the death of a shareholder. The formula was created to set the value of Hamilton\u2019s shares to be equivalent to the key man insurance policy which the corporation bought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties did not intend that the formula set forth in paragraph 8 of the agreement be utilized \u201cfor a redemption caused by something other than the death of a shareholder.\u201d Apparently, it overlooked paragraph 7 of the agreement. This paragraph clearly provides that the formula of paragraph 8 is to be the source of valuation for a \u201csale event,\u201d which includes incompetence, disability and cessation of full time employment with the corporation for any reason other than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">As defendants point out, Hamilton admitted that the shareholders\u2019 agreement was \u201cvalid and binding.\u201d The court gave no reason for declining to enforce it except that dissolution was \u201ctoo harsh for the circumstances of this matter\u201d and Johnston would be better off without it. However, Johnston has consistently sought specific enforcement of the agreement, and the court erred in voiding an otherwise binding contract because it felt it is \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">We further disagree with the court that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7 applies here \u201cbecause the majority stockholder acted oppressively and unfairly to the minority.\u201d Defendants did not bring their action under that statute. In their counterclaim and third-party complaint they demanded specific performance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>shareholders\u2019 agreement and dissolution of plaintiff pursuant to that agreement. They also alleged that Hamilton violated \u201cthe minority shareholder doctrine in that he misused his position to his private advantage,\u201d but cited no statute or other authority and asked for no specific relief regarding this allegation. Defendants\u2019 theory has consistently been that Johnston is entitled to enforcement of the shareholders\u2019 agreement. Defendants have never sought dissolution, appointment of a custodian or provisional director, or a sale of stock pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Plaintiff cites <em>Hughes v. Sego International Ltd,., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>60, 469 A.2d 74 (App.Div.1983), which is similar to the instant case, but did not involve \u201cprecisely the same circumstances,\u201d as plaintiff claims. <em>Hughes </em>involved a close corporation owned by four shareholders, each with a 25% interest. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 469 A.2d 74. A shareholders\u2019 agreement, like the one here, provided primarily for the purchase of stock in the event of the death of one of the shareholders. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 469 A.2d 74. The agreement in <em>Hughes, </em>like the agreement here, valued the shares on the basis of the company\u2019s revenues. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the agreement in <em>Hughes, </em>unlike the agreement here, provided that the corporation and the other shareholders have \u201cthe right of first refusal at the same price that a deceased partner\u2019s shares would be valued if a partner wished to sell his stock during his lifetime.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, in contrast, the same price applies, pursuant to paragraph 7, not only if a stockholder wishes to sell during his lifetime, but also in the event of his incapacity or cessation of full time employment with the company for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In <em>Hughes, supra, </em>the other shareholders terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment because they were dissatisfied with his job performance, and plaintiff sought dissolution of the corporation \u201con the basis of unfair and oppressive treatment towards a minority shareholder.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(footnote omitted). The trial judge determined that the termination of plaintiff\u2019s employment constituted oppressive conduct under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(l)(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>and ordered dissolution of the corporation, but permitted defendants to purchase plaintiffs stock. Defendants thus moved to purchase plaintiff\u2019s stock under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 65, 469 A.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">Upon motion of the corporation or any shareholder who is a party to the proceeding the court may order the sale of all shares of the corporation\u2019s stock held by any other shareholder who is a party to the proceeding to either the corporation or the moving shareholder or shareholders, whichever is specified in the motion, if the court determines in its discretion that such an order would be fair and equitable to all parties under all of the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">(a) The purchase price of any shares so sold shall be their fair value as of the date of the commencement of the action or such earlier or later date deemed equitable by the court, plus or minus any adjustments deemed equitable by the court if the action was brought in whole or in part under paragraph 14A:12-7(l)(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(l)(c) provides for dissolution, appointment of a custodian or provisional director, or sale of stock when, in a small corporation, \u201cthe directors or those in control ... have acted oppressively or unfairly toward one or more minority shareholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The trial court in <em>Hughes, supra, </em>utilized the formula in the parties\u2019 shareholders\u2019 agreement to determine the value of the stock for the purpose of the buy-out. 192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 66, 469 A.2d 74. The Appellate Division determined that since <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8)(a) required that the purchase price be the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares, \u201cit became incumbent upon the trial court to determine the \u2018fair value\u2019 of the stock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 469 A.2d 74. The trial judge had erred in utilizing the formula without first determining whether it established the fair value of the stock. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">As to the application of the shareholders\u2019 agreement, the Appellate Division said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">In reaching our result we have not lost sight of the fact that shareholder agreements are normally enforceable. This rule of law, however, does not help plaintiff since the agreement by its very terms does not apply. The agreement expressly provides that the formula contained therein shall be used to determine the value of stock if: (1) the corporation purchases a stockholder\u2019s stock after his death or (2) if a stockholder desires to dispose of his stock during his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>lifetime and the corporation desires to exercise a right of first refusal. The parties, therefore, expressly provided the instances in which the valuation formula contained in the agreement would apply. Since the courts will not rewrite the contracts of litigants the terms of the agreement are not binding in a situation beyond the contemplation of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 69, 469 A. 2d 74 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Here, in contrast, the agreement expressly provides that it applies in the event a shareholder ceases employment with the corporation for any reason. Johnston\u2019s cessation of employment with plaintiff constituted a \u201csales event\u201d under the agreement. By its own terms, this agreement is binding; this very situation is what the parties contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">We conclude that Johnston is entitled to enforcement of the valid shareholders agreement of 1984 and to the valuation of his stock in accordance with the formula set forth in that agreement. Since there was conflicting evidence and no finding of fact regarding the valuation of Johnston\u2019s shares pursuant to the formula contained in the shareholders agreement, it is directed that a revaluation be made in accordance with the formula set forth in the shareholders agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Defendants contend that the trial court erred in determining that defendants\u2019 quarterly reports to their clients were plagiarized from plaintiff and constituted trademark infringement. Plaintiff concedes that there was no trademark infringement but argues that \u201c[djefendants\u2019 tort was actually that of misappropriation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The court found that defendants\u2019 reports were plagiarized because \u201cmost passages were copied word-for-word, with some passages ineptly rephrased but meaning the same as the original created for Hamilton &amp; Co.\u2019s clients.\u201d In addition, it found \u201cthe tables of statistics were presented in the same way as the Hamilton reports, as were the general design and logo,\u201d that defendants \u201cobtained the prior Hamilton reports from their clients,\u201d and \u201call the data in the reports, except for the comparison made with Hamilton\u2019s Yardstick program, was available from other public sources,\u201d and that defendants were \u201ccareful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>not to use the proprietary measure of comparison known as Yardstick.\u201d However, the \u201cformat/text of Hamilton\u2019s publications\u201d was also found to be proprietary.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">These findings were based on P-26, copies of plaintiff\u2019s June 30, 1989 Annual Report to the Board of Trustees, Sheet Metal Workers, Local 73, Pension Fund, and defendants\u2019 October 11, 1989 analysis of the investment performance of the same fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Hamilton testified extensively as to the similarities between these two documents, and complained that reports of other firms were \u201ccompletely different.\u201d The court did not refer to the testimony of Johnston and another investment consultant, Ronald Karp, that all financial reports are similar. Karp explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">[T]here aren\u2019t all that many different ways to represent this information____ You\u2019ve got time periods. You\u2019ve got asset classes. You\u2019ve got managers. You can put some across the top and some down the side. But, I think that if you [com]pared the reports of twenty or thirty or forty different consultants, that there would be a remarkable similarity among them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The formats of various consultants\u2019 reports are \u201call different ... but in essence they present the same information and wrap it slightly differently.\u201d According to Karp, a client choosing a consultant presumes \u201cability to process the data and calculate performance____ [W]hat differentiates consultants is the judgment that they ... bring to service the client, and also the confidence and rapport that they can develop with the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8f\">The court found trademark infringement but no compensatory damages, awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10,-000, and enjoined defendants from \u201cusing the format and text of Hamilton &amp; Co.\u2019s workproducts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">In support of its misappropriation theory, plaintiff relies upon <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Melody Recordings, Inc., </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 341 <em>A.</em>2d 348 (App.Div.1975). There, plaintiff recorded original productions of musical compositions; it obtained either ownership of or the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the recording, and to \u201cuse the name and likeness of the artist in the promotion, advertising and sale of the recordings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 341 A.2d 348. Defendant made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>unauthorized \u201chigh quality reproductions\u201d of plaintiffs original recordings and sold them to distributors for resale to retailers on defendants\u2019 \u201cown distinctive label.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372-373, 341 A.2d 348. Although defendants did not \u201cpalm off\u201d their products as those of plaintiff, the court determined that \u201c[misappropriation and tortious exploitation of another\u2019s product may constitute unfair competition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 341 A.2d 348. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">Permissible imitation entails the imitator bringing to bear its own efforts and resources in producing its own product, although it endeavors to simulate or ape the product of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">sic**#*#\u2019!'*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">What is involved in this case is the direct taking by defendants of the artistic and highly creative work of plaintiff \u2014 the recorded performance of a specially arranged musical composition. Defendants have thus appropriated the unique product of CBS by rerecording its original records. The commercial injury ensues because defendants have accomplished this at a minimal cost and then sold their \"original\u201d duplicates for a substantial profit. The actionable unfairness of this practice inheres in a combination of factors \u2014 the substantial investment of time, labor, money and creative resources in the product by plaintiff, the utilization of the actual product by defendant, the misappropriation or use of the appropriated product by defendant in competition with plaintiff, and commercial damage to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 378-379, 341 A.2d 348 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">The situation here, in our view, is permissible imitation, not misappropriation. Defendants have utilized their own efforts, money and resources to produce their own product. The essence of a financial report is the data or figures, not the format or text. The trial court recognized that the data \u201cwas available from other public sources.\u201d Defendants have not appropriated any unique, artistic or creative work in copying passages from plaintiff\u2019s financial reports, presenting tables of statistics in the same manner, or utilizing the same \u201cgeneral design and logo.\u201d They have copied a \u201cdesign or concept,\u201d not a finished product, 134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 379, 341 A.2d 348, as the court acknowledged. There is no basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cformat/text of Hamilton\u2019s publications\u201d was proprietary.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">In addition, Johnston testified that he had \u201cinput in the origination of [the] language\u201d allegedly misappropriated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Hamilton did not deny this, and there was no fact finding on this point. If Johnston had partly authored the text in question, he should not be liable for its misappropriation, especially since Hamilton wrongfully terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">So much of the amended judgment requiring plaintiff to pay Johnston $44,000, representing the value of Johnston\u2019s shares in plaintiff is vacated and the matter is remanded to the Chancery Division for a revaluation of Johnston\u2019s shares in accordance with the formula set forth in the shareholders agreement. The award to Johnston of attorneys and accountants fees on this claim is vacated. The award of $10,000 punitive damages to plaintiff for trademark infringement and the injunction restraining defendants from using the \u201cformat and text\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s reports is reversed. So much of the amended judgment requiring payment by plaintiff of the individual defendants\u2019 interests in plaintiff\u2019s profit sharing and retirement plan and specifying the amounts is affirmed. The matter is remanded, however, with respect to this part of the amended judgment for further proceedings necessary for defendants to join the plan as a necessary third-party defendant to make the required payments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
