The victim was age 11 at the time of the crime. Defendant was sentenced to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Avenel. As a repeat offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:14-6, defendant was sentenced to a five-year period of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">On this appeal defendant contends that the conviction and sentence must be vacated because there was no adequate factual basis to support his guilty plea to the charge of sexual assault. Even though defendant has entered a guilty plea, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>retains the right to question, on appeal, the existence of a factual basis for the plea. <em>State v.

Mr. Ridgeway, do you recall September 13, 1989?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">Q.

Was it your intention that she see what you were doing when you called her over to the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">A. I would say yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-15\">Q. And what did she do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">A. She ran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-17\">[Defense Counsel]: Okay. Judge, that\u2019s all I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-18\">The Court: [Prosecutor], are you satisfied with the factual basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARD\">[Prosecutor]: Very.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">Defendant contends that a conviction for a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b requires actual physical contact between the perpetrator of the crime and the victim. The literal language of the statute is to the contrary. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b states: \u201cAn actor is guilty of sexual assault if he commits an act of sexual contact with a victim who is less than 13 years old and the actor is at least 4 years older than the victim.\u201d Sexual assault is a crime of the second degree. <em>Id. N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-ld defines \u201csexual contact\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-20\">an intentional touching by the victim or actor, either directly or through clothing, of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s intimate parts for the purpose of degrading or humiliating the victim or sexually arousing or sexually gratifying the actor. Sexual contact of the actor with himself must be in view of the victim whom the actor knows to be present____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-21\">Defendant claims that the phrase \u201cwith a victim,\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, not the definition of \u201csexual contact,\u201d should be controlling in defining the crime. He claims that although the legislative history on any specific meaning of \u201cwith a victim\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b is inconclusive, the statute should be construed strictly to condemn an offense which involves touching or coercing the victim. Otherwise construed, he claims, the statute redundantly condemns the same conduct which <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>2C:14-4 terms \u201clewdness,\u201d a disorderly persons offense punishable by up to six months in jail, rather than five to ten years in prison for a second-degree crime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">A person commits a disorderly persons offense if he does any flagrantly lewd and offensive act which he knows or reasonably expects is likely to be observed by other nonconsenting persons who would be affronted or alarmed. \u201cLewd acts\u201d shall include the exposing of the genitals for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the actor or of any other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\"><em>See </em>J. Cannel, <em>Criminal Code Annotated, </em>Comment <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:14-1d, at 295 (1992) for a possible explanation of the statutory scheme based on the difference between assaultive and lewd conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention for several reasons. First, the statutory language is clear. We need not resort to techniques of construction to derive a fair meaning when the language is clear as written. Our duty is to apply the language \u201caccording to its terms\u201d when the meaning is plain and unambiguous. <em>State v. Maguire, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>508, 528, 423 <em>A.</em>2d 294 (1980); <em>Ingraham v. Travelers Cos., </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 129, 524 A.2d 1319 (App.Div.1987), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>67, 539 A.2d 733 (1988); 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.01, at 81-82 (5th ed. 1992). Secondly, Chapter 14 of the Criminal Code dealing with sexual offenses establishes a logical gradation of the type of conduct to which defendant pled guilty which depends on the age of the victim. Since the victim here was under age 13, the crime was a second-degree offense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. If the victim had been age 13 to 16 the crime would have been a fourth-degree offense under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:14-3b<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the victim had been older than age 16, the conduct would have been a disorderly persons offense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4. The statutory design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>to punish with greater severity where the victim is younger is both explicit and rational. <em>See generally </em>J. Cannel, <em>supra, </em>Comment <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1, at 293, 299-300 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\"An actor is guilty of criminal sexual contact if he commits an act of sexual contact with the victim under any of the circumstances set forth in section 2C:14-2c.
