(Regional) for a solid waste facility (SWF) permit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4b; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-26a; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.4. We reverse, for we conclude that DEP is statutorily barred from issuing an SWF permit to a facility not included in the approved solid waste management plan of the solid waste management district in which the facility is to be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Regional operates a recycling facility and transfer station<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at 295 Frelinghuysen Avenue in Newark, where it conducts business of two kinds. First, Regional receives solid waste generated in New York, removes the recyclable material, bales the residual solid waste and disposes of it outside New Jersey. Second, Regional receives solid waste generated in nearby New Jersey counties, removes and resells the recyclable waste, bales the residual solid waste and returns it to its county of origin for disposal in accordance with the applicable district solid waste management plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In October 1987, Regional applied to Essex County to be included in the Essex County Solid Waste Management Plan and also applied to DEP for an SWF permit. On November 23, 1987, Regional and DEP entered into an Administrative Consent Order authorizing Regional to operate pending completion and review of its permit application but for no longer than one year. The order recited that Regional had operated its transfer station \u201cwithout having received approval ... since an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>known date prior to February 27,1987\u201d and had \u201cpetitioned the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders to adopt an amendment to its County Solid Waste Management Plan to be included as a solid waste facility in the Plan.\u201d Regional was required to submit a complete \u201capplication package\u201d within 60 days; if the package was not timely submitted, \u201cthe application will be automatically rejected and [Regional] will cease operation immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Regional submitted its application package to DEP on December 7,1987. By letter of January 7,1988, DEP advised Regional that \u201cthe application is incomplete until such time as the facility is included within the approved Essex County District Solid Waste Management Plan.\u201d Apparently after some inconclusive discussions over the ensuing months, DEP, joined by the Board of Public Utilities, brought a Chancery Division action against Regional alleging, among other things, that Regional was \u201coperating in violation of the terms of the Administrative Consent Order.\u201d That action was resolved by a June 28, 1988 consent order permitting Regional to (1) dispose of waste generated in Essex County \u201cin accordance with Essex County Waste Management Plan and the Emergency Waste Redirection Order for Essex County\u201d and (2) receive waste generated outside New Jersey and dispose of its residue \u201cdirectly out-of-state or in any other fashion authorized by law.\u201d We are told that that order is still in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">By letter of February 16, 1989, the Division of Solid Waste Management of the Essex County Department of Planning and Economic Development advised Regional as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">Inasmuch as the state regulatory agencies have not set state standards for intercounty and interstate waste flow regulations, Essex County will seek guidance as to the disposition of your request. Therefore your request for inclusion in the Essex County Plan will not be granted at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Regional shortly filed this action against both DEP and Essex County. Its complaint demanded judgment requiring Essex County to include it in the Essex County Solid Waste Management Plan and requiring DEP to issue an SWF permit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Regional also sought to restrain DEP from terminating the November 23, 1987 Administrative Consent Order and asserted that termination of its right to operate would violate the June 28, 1988 Chancery Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We need not recite all that has since occurred in the trial court. Suffice it to say that Regional ultimately moved to compel DEP \u201cto undertake a review\u201d of its SWF permit application notwithstanding the fact that it was not yet included in the Essex County Solid Waste Management Plan. The Chancery Division judge granted the motion based upon a ruling he had earlier made that \u201cRegional does not have to be included in the County Plan, but must simply conform to it.\u201d That ruling is the focus of the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The Solid Waste Management Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-1 <em>et seq.) </em>grants DEP \u201cpower to supervise solid waste collection and disposal facilities or operations\u201d and directs DEP to \u201crequire the registration of new and existing solid waste collection and disposal facilities and operations.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4a. In determining whether and under what conditions to approve a solid waste facility or operation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4b provides that DEP</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">shall not approve the registration of any new operation or facility that does not conform to the solid waste management plan of the solid waste management district in which such operation or facility is to be located, as such plan shall have been approved by the department as hereinafter provided. Prior to the approval by the department of the solid waste management plan of any solid waste management district, the department may grant approval to any new solid waste collection or disposal operation or facility planned to be located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>any such district and that district shall include said operation or facility in its plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Similarly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-26 mandates that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">No person may proceed to construct, acquire, or operate any solid waste facility without having first obtained the approval of the commissioner. Such approval shall be granted only if the commissioner determines that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">a. The proposed construction, acquisition, or operation is consistent with the adopted and approved or promulgated solid waste management plan of the solid waste management district within which the solid waste facility is to be located; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">b. Any such proposed solid waste facility will be constructed or acquired, and operated, pursuant to the standards adopted and promulgated therefor by the department pursuant to the provisions of section 6 of the act to which this act is amendatory and supplementary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">In its rules, DEP has provided that the processing of an SWF permit application \u201cshall not begin ... until the applicant has fully complied with the submission requirements of this subchapter\u201d <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.4(g)l); those requirements include \u201c[documentation establishing that the facility has been included in the applicable district solid waste management plan.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.4(b)2.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Regional contends that its operations \u201cconform to\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4b) and are \u201cconsistent with\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-26a) the Essex County Solid Waste Management Plan because, following removal of recyclable material, the residual New York-generated solid waste is returned to New York and the residual New Jersey-generated solid waste is returned to the solid waste management district whence it came for disposal in accordance with that district\u2019s plan. Since the waste flow emanating from its operations is directed as the Essex County Plan requires, Regional urges that the statutes cannot sensibly be read to foreclose DEP from granting a permit. The trial judge essentially adopted that view, stating that Regional was not statutorily barred from licensure as long as it \u201cgive[s] to the County all the waste the County is entitled to based upon the amount of waste picked up from within the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">DEP argues, to the contrary, that a solid waste facility must be included within the solid waste management plan of the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>district in order to \u201cconform to\u201d or be \u201cconsistent with\u201d that plan. Any other reading of the statutory provisions, DEP says, \u201chas the capacity to throw solid waste management planning in the State of New Jersey into chaos.\u201d DEP\u2019s brief elaborates that argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">If facilities are allowed to operate without being included in district plans as long as they ship their waste to the same disposal facility used by everyone else in the district ..., then the role of solid waste planning expressly entrusted by the Legislature to the solid waste management districts and the DEP has been emasculated. Indeed, based on the flawed reasoning employed below, a solid waste facility could be set up by anyone in any location, consistent with the local zoning ordinances, thus depriving the solid waste management district and the DEP of any control over where such solid waste facilities should be located. Such a result flies in the face of the legislative intent underlying the Solid Waste Management Act and would prevent district and State officials from accomplishing the unequivocal goals of the Act \u2014 proper regional solid waste management planning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Our reading of the relevant statutory sections persuades us that DEP\u2019s position is sound. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-20a mandates the formulation of \u201ca solid waste management plan for each respective solid waste management district.\u201d The plan must be based upon and accompanied by a report containing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">[a]n inventory and appraisal, including the identity, location and life expectancy, of all solid waste facilities within the solid waste management district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-21a(3). The report must also contain \u201c[a]n analysis of existing solid waste collection systems and transportation routes\u201d within the district. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-21a(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The solid waste management plan itself must include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">A site plan, which shall include all existing solid waste facilities located within the solid waste management district, provided that they are operated and maintained in accordance with all applicable health and environmental standards, and sufficient additional available suitable sites to provide solid waste facilities to treat and dispose of the actual and projected amounts of solid waste contained in the report accompanying the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-21b(3). Following formulation of the plan, the board of freeholders is required to prepare \u201ca map showing the boundaries of the solid waste management district and the location of all existing and proposed solid waste facilities.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-23b. A public hearing on the adoption of the plan is required. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-23c. A notice of hearing must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>be mailed to the owner \u201cof each parcel of property within or without the district on which it is proposed to locate any solid waste facilities pursuant to the district\u2019s solid waste management plan.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-23d.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Following adoption of a plan, the board of freeholders must submit it and all supporting documentation to DEP. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-23g. DEP is required to \u201cstudy and review\u201d the plan and determine whether to approve, modify or reject it. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-24b. If DEP determines to modify or reject the plan, it must state its reasons and direct the board of freeholders to make the appropriate modification, either with or without holding another public hearing in the district. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E\u2014 24d. The district plan must provide for \u201cautomatic review\u201d by the board of freeholders at least every two years; DEP may review the plan at any time and, if DEP determines it to be \u201cinadequate for the purposes for which it was intended,\u201d the freeholders \u201cshall develop and formulate\u201d a new plan for promulgation pursuant to the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Those provisions make clear that a district solid waste management plan is designed to do more than direct the district\u2019s waste flow and determine locations for its ultimate disposition. The district plan is required to describe the types, numbers and locations of the solid waste facilities to handle the district\u2019s waste flow. That fixing of the district\u2019s solid waste facilities serves not only to assure that adequate facilities are established, but also to fulfill the legislative declarations that collection and disposal service be \u201cefficient and reasonable\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-2a), \u201ccoordinated\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-2b(l)) and \u201ceconomical\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-2b(5)). Permitting solid waste facilities beyond those contemplated by the district plan would surely subvert those legislative goals. The district plan would be largely meaningless if unplanned and uncoordinated proliferation of facilities were permitted to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Our case law has long and consistently read the Solid Waste Management Act as evidencing \u201ca comprehensive plan on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>part of the State to control all facets of this industry.\u201d <em>Ringlieb v. Tp. of Parsippany Troy Hills, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>348, 350, 283 A.2d 97 (1971); see also <em>So. Ocean Landfill v. Mayor &amp; Coun. Tp. Of Ocean, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>190, 194, 314 A.2d 65 (1974). The Act has thus been held to preempt municipal zoning and subdivision ordinances which would foreclose locating a solid waste facility as provided in a district plan. <em>Chester Tp. v. DEP., </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 438 A.2d 334 (App.Div.1981); <em>Little Falls Tp. v. Bardin, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 414 A.2d 559 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>286, 412 A.2d 792 (1980). In <em>Little Falls Tp. </em>we noted the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-21b(3) requirement of a site plan describing all district solid waste facilities; we held that a zoning ordinance prohibiting a use contemplated by the plan was invalid because it \u201cfrustrates the objectives\u201d of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 418, 414 A.2d 559. So too, here the objectives of the Act would be frustrated if DEP were required to license solid waste facilities other than those described in the site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We therefore conclude that DEP may not grant an SWF permit for a facility which is not included in the adopted and approved district solid waste management plan: a facility cannot be said to \u201cconform to\u201d <em>{N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4b) or be \u201cconsistent with\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-26) the district plan if it is not provided for in that plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the narrow reach of the interlocutory order under review, we find it both unnecessary and inappropriate to determine whether Regional has any avenue of redress other than its prerogative writs action against Essex County, which is still pending in the Chancery Division; whether Regional is in a \u201c \u2018Catch-22\u2019 situation,\u201d as our dissenting colleague says, has not yet been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The trial judge also ruled that DEP must process the permit application notwithstanding Regional\u2019s failure to submit a \u201cdisclosure statement\u201d concerning Clark Credit Corporation, a secured creditor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-I27e(l), (2); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-128b(l). In light of our holding that DEP may not grant a permit unless and until the Regional facility is included in the district plan, we choose not to address DEP\u2019s challenge to that ruling at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The June 13, 1990 order directing DEP to \u201cimmediately commence a review\u201d of Regional\u2019s SWF permit application is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">A \"recycling or reclamation facility\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzN\">any place, equipment or plant designed and/or operated for the purpose of recycling or reclamation ... to collect, store, process or to redistribute separated waste so as to return the material to market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">A \"transfer station\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">a facility at which solid waste is transferred from one solid waste vehicle to another solid waste vehicle for transportation to a solid waste facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-1.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Since DEP sought leave to appeal only from the order requiring it to review Regional\u2019s permit application, we do not consider the propriety of the Chancery Division\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over DEP <em>(see R. </em>2:2-3, 4; <em>Enertron Industries, Inc. v. Mack, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 89, 576 A.2d 28 (App.Div.1990)) or any other proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-5\">DEP does have authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4a to \u201cexempt from the requirement of registration any class of solid waste collection or disposal facility or operation\" <em>(see also N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-1.7, 1.8) and can grant approval to a facility before the district solid waste management plan has been approved by DEP <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4b). Those statutory provisions are not implicated here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b135-7\">SHEBELL, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8L\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">I am unable to lend my support to the perpetuation of the \u201cCatch-22\u201d situation imposed upon the plaintiff. I am willing to accept the position of DEP that, despite the contention of the Essex County Solid Waste Management District, DEP does indeed have sufficient regulations in place to regulate enterprises such as Regional Recycling, Inc. However, it is fairly commonplace that a county or district plan, as adopted locally, may fail to include facilities which are or seek to locate within the solid waste management district. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-20a and -21a.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">I do not perceive that the failure of a district or county plan to abide by one or more of its statutory obligations to include a facility can \u201cstatutorily bar[] [DEP] from issuing an SWF permit to a facility not included in the approved solid waste management plan of the solid waste management district in which the facility is to be located,\u201d as held here today. The holding of the majority runs contrary to the legislative intent we found to exist in our holdings in <em>Chester Tp. v. Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 438 <em>A.</em>2d 334 (App.Div.1981) and <em>Little Falls Tp. v.
