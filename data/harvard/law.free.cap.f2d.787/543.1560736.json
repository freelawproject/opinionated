The company does not grant a right to defer payment of a debt or to incur debt and defer its payment. It simply assesses a charge in light of the customer\u2019s failure to pay the company at the time the service is performed, in accordance with customary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">Moreover, we hold that the charge in issue is not a \u201cfinance charge\u201d within the meaning of the Act, but rather is more in the nature of a \u201clate payment charge\u201d exempt from the Act\u2019s reach under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(c)(2) (\u201cCharges for actual unanticipated late payment, for exceeding a credit limit, or for delinquency, default, or a similar occurrence.\u201d). The charges do not vary over time or relate to the amount of the total bill; it is a one-time flat fee to cover the increased costs to the ambulance company resulting from being forced to carry the outstanding bill on its books and records. The fact that it is labelled a \u201ctime pay price differential\u201d does not affect its underlying nature. <em>See Bright v. Ball Memorial Hospital Association, </em>616 F.2d 328 (7th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
