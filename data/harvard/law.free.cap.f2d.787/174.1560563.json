The district court has supplemented the record on appeal with such findings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">The district court granted leave to Walden to file an amended counterclaim but denied the counterclaim because it found that \u201cit would be unjust to award costs and attorney\u2019s fees against Bright Products, in its good faith effort to collect a just debt, because its counsel chose the wrong legal avenue.\u201d We affirm the court\u2019s decision to deny the amended counterclaim against Bright Products under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">The district court also denied Walden\u2019s motion to file a third-party complaint against Lawrence Beck, Bright Product\u2019s attorney, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(i), because that section authorizes awards against petitioners, not their attorney. The court noted, however, that Walden might still find a remedy under Bankruptcy Rule 9011(a) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We affirm the court\u2019s decision not to initiate such a proceeding but do so without prejudice to Walden\u2019s right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
