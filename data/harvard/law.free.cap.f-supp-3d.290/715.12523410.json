The parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether arson is an excluded loss under a homeowner's policy which prohibits coverage for \"vandalism and malicious mischief\" when a home has been vacant for 30 or more consecutive days. The Court has been advised, having reviewed the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law. For the reasons set forth below, Wells Fargo's motion is granted and Defendant's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Stipulated Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The stipulated facts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1. The terms of Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company Homeowners Policy No. 9 80 584930 09/20 (the \"Policy\"), executed with Antoniano Delsignore for a single-family home located at 7376 Yellow Creek Drive in Poland, Ohio (the \"Property\"), govern the dispute between the parties in the above-captioned action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2. At all relevant times, Wells Fargo was the insured mortgagee under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3. Mr. Delsignore defaulted on his mortgage payments in 2013, and by the end of the year, the Property was vacant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   4. On February 6, 2014, a fire caused by an unknown arsonist (the \"Arson\") damaged the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   5. The Policy was in effect at the time of the Arson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   6. Wells Fargo filed an insurance claim under the Policy for the damage caused by the Arson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   7. Allstate denied Wells Fargo's claim based upon the exclusion in the Policy which precludes coverage for losses caused by vandalism and/or malicious mischief when the Property has been vacant or unoccupied for 30 or more consecutive days prior to the loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   8. Wells Fargo and Allstate disagree over the applicability of the exclusion described in Paragraph 7 (above) to the Arson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wells Fargo filed the within lawsuit against Allstate in February 2015. There is no Ohio legal precedent deciding whether \"malicious mischief\" or \"vandalism\" exclusions in homeowners' insurance policies include losses that occur as a result of arson. The Court certified the question to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and the high court accepted the certification on September 30, 2015. On May 18, 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued an order that the certification was improvidently allowed and declined to answer the question presented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.
