(\"Healy Tibbitts\") as a subcontractor to provide labor and equipment for a portion of the work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The accident occurred when buoy D-8-H, which had been hoisted overhead by a crane barge (\"Weeks 544\") and suspended above the deck of a Navy barge, slid down the riser or anchor chain onto a sinker block on the deck of the Navy barge, killing two workers and injuring Claimants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.

The United States, owner of the Navy barge, filed its complaint on April 4, 2016. ECF No. 1 in Civ. No. 16-00156 JMS/KJM.

It then filed a third-party complaint against Global, claiming that as the \"civilian contractor whose responsibility it was to maintain ... the subject buoy,\" Global caused the accident by failing to maintain the buoy, painting over corrosion, and failing to warn Truston about the buoy's condition. ECF No. 119 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-38, 45.

Global, in turn, filed a fourth-party complaint against Pacific Shipyards, alleging that if anyone was negligent in maintaining the buoy, painting over corrosion, or failing to warn Truston, it was Pacific Shipyards and not Global.

Global's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Similarly, Global contends that it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor because, although it conducted surface inspections of the subject buoy, there is no evidence that it was ever hired to or actually performed any painting or maintenance work on the buoy. Mot. at 3, ECF No. 359.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Global submits statements from its project manager and from the retired director of the Navy Inactive Ship Maintenance Office to the effect that the terms of its contract with the Navy required a \"task order\" or \"technical direction letter\" before any maintenance could be performed. Steven Copeland Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, ECF 359-2 and Walter Leonard Dep., ECF No. 359-4 at 5-6. And it contends that no such document has been found. Mot. at 9. Further, it submits deposition testimony from the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Fleet Mooring Manager that he never directed Global to paint or refurbish the buoy at D-8-H, where the subject buoy was located just prior to the accident. ECF No. 388-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Regarding Global's inspection of buoys in the harbor, Global admits that it inspected the subject buoy at least twice, but\n   it contends that (1) it could not have seen the deteriorated bolts inside the buoy during these inspections, (2) its inspections were for the purpose of determining the safety of the moored ships, not determining whether the buoy could be safely lifted from the water, and (3) its inspection reports were never given to Truston, so they could not have been relied upon in connection with the lift. Mot. at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, Global's motion essentially asserts that there is no evidence that it caused or contributed to the accident because there is no evidence that it (1) painted the buoy at all-let alone painted over corrosion-or (2) could have discovered the corrosion that led to the accident-no matter how thorough its inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In its opposition, Truston points to evidence that \"the buoys at use in the Pearl Harbor Middle Loch (including D-8-H) were interchangeable, were interchanged, and were renumbered,\" so that the subject buoy might not always have been located at the D-8-H mooring. Opp'n, ECF No. 462 at 3-4. It also points to Global's inspection reports noting that the capture plate on the buoy was in \"good\" condition. Opp'n at 6. And it contends that this evidence creates a question of fact \"as to the exact scope and role of Global's maintenance, inspection, refurbishment or repainting of the subject buoy.\" Opp'n at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Truston also contends that a material question of fact exists as to \"the adequacy of Global's inspections and maintenance of the mooring system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=693%20Fed.%20Appx.%20729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It cites deposition testimony of experts involved in the OSHA investigation who stated that the mooring system buoys were \"suspect\" because they showed paint had been applied over corrosion and because they had suffered from an apparent lack of regular maintenance-including maintenance that would have required taking the buoys out of service and taking them apart.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Truston further points to the declaration of its forensic engineer, Randy Kent, who opined that the accident was \"largely attributable to D-8-H's severely corroded state,\" which was in turn \"largely attributable\" to design defects. But Kent also opined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [t]hese design defects left D-8-H particularly susceptible to water intrusion and the type of corrosion it experienced, and which, more likely than not, could have been at least detected, if not prevented by more careful maintenance or inspection than that which was performed, as evidenced by the application of paint over areas of severe corrosion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Kent Decl. at \u00b6 6, ECF No. 463-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But Truston has not submitted evidence to counter Global's assertion that it was never tasked with painting the buoy or performing any maintenance work on it. Rather, it cites only generally to Global's contract with the Navy and does not refute Global's evidence that painting or other maintenance would have required a specific task order or direction.
