Throughout this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court will refer collectively to the class members and the collective action members as \"Plaintiffs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is now before the Court on three motions. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiffs' SJ Motion\"), [ECF No. 132]; Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defendants' SJ Motion\"), [ECF No. 142]. Defendants also have filed a motion to decertify the Rule 23 class action and the FLSA collective action. Defendants' Second Amended Motion to Decertify the FLSA Collective Action and Motion to Decertify the Rule 23(a) Class Action (\"Defendants' Motion to Decertify\"), [ECF No. 140]. The parties have briefed these motions and the Court heard oral argument. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 132] is denied, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 142] is denied, and Defendants' Motion to Decertify [ECF No. 140] is denied. As the Court notes throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the record developed by the parties in discovery-or at least the record as presented in support of the parties' respective motions-is not adequate to justify granting any of the motions now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Motter is HTS's president and sole owner. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 2. Plaintiffs are current and former foremen and tower technicians employed by HTS and Motter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Typically, HTS sends a four-person crew consisting of one foreman and three tower technicians to work on each tower. Defendants Heights Tower Service, Inc. and Mark Motter's Memorandum of Law in Support of Collective Action Decertification and in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification (\"Defendants' Prior Decertification Brief\"), [ECF No. 94], at 8. At the tower, foremen and tower technicians install, repair, upgrade, and maintain towers and related equipment. Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    Pietrzycki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Foremen also are responsible for assigning work, supervising tower technicians, and tracking the work performed.\n   <em>\n    Pietrzycki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The differences between the roles of foreman and tower technician are not material to the resolution of the motions now before the Court. To save a few words, the Court will refer to foremen and tower technicians as \"employees\" (or \"employee,\" as appropriate).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To record how much time employees work in a given week, HTS relies on foremen\n   to fill out daily activity reports (\"DARs\") for their respective crews. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 16; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 20. A DAR reports each crew member's start time, end time, \"work hours,\" and \"travel hours.\" Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6\u00b6 17-19; Sample DAR, [ECF No. 134-5]. HTS then collects the information recorded in the DARs and uses it to prepare Employee Job Detail Reports, Timecard Lists, and Payroll Stubs. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   HTS services towers in at least seven states, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and South Dakota. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 7; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 6. Most of HTS's business is concentrated in the first three states, which collectively accounted for 97% of its business in 2014. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 7; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 6. HTS has warehouses in Yorkville, Illinois, and Mount Vernon, Ohio. Defendants' Prior Decertification Brief, [ECF No. 94], at 7. HTS's employees reside in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. To get to or from a tower on a given day, employees may have to travel a significant distance. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case has to do with the time that employees spend traveling to and from towers. Employees' travel options can be broken into two categories. First, employees are allowed to arrange their own transportation if they want to do so. Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Combined Reply in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment and in Response to the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiffs' Combined Brief\"), [ECF No. 147], at 3. Typically, this involves driving a personal vehicle or riding in another crew member's personal vehicle. Alternatively, HTS provides a free transportation option, allowing a crew's members to travel in an HTS-owned truck (\"HTS truck\") to and from their tower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7. One member of the crew, typically the foreman, drives the HTS truck and all other crew members who opt to travel in the HTS truck ride as passengers. If employees want to travel in an HTS truck, HTS requires them to meet at a designated location-normally an HTS warehouse at the start of the day-by a certain time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defendants' Opening SJ Brief\"), [ECF No. 144], at 6; Defendants' Reply in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defendants' SJ Reply\"), [ECF No. 156], at 7 n.3. It seems that employees usually choose to travel in an HTS truck and only infrequently arrange to travel in a personal vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In approximately 2012, HTS decided to implement the travel time compensation arrangement at issue in this case by paying $10 per hour for travel hours (the \"Drive Time Rate\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13. HTS took this step so that it could remain compensation-competitive and attract employees. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 9; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 12. HTS and Motter intended the new arrangement to be a uniform policy applied in a consistent manner. Defendants' SJ Reply, [ECF No. 156], at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Motion to Decertify, [ECF No. 140], at 14 (stating \"Defendants expected one application on [sic] the Drive Time [Rate]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under HTS's new plan, employees should receive at least some compensation for all of the time that they spend traveling in an HTS truck. Time spent driving an HTS vehicle should be recorded as normal work hours. Defendants' Motion to Decertify, [ECF No. 140], at 12. Time spent riding as passengers normally should be recorded as travel hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Passengers' time should be recorded as normal work hours, though, if the passengers perform work in the truck while traveling. Defendants Heights Tower Service, Inc. and Mark Motter's Reply in Support of Their Second Motion to Decertify the FLSA Collective Action and Motion to Decertify the Rule 23(a) Class Action (\"Defendants' Decertification Reply\"), [ECF No. 152], at 3-4, 9. Passengers' time also should be recorded as normal work hours if they perform what Defendants call \"substantial\" work before getting in the truck at the start of the day or after exiting it at the end of the day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even under this new compensation arrangement, the time that employees spend traveling in personal vehicles-regardless of whether the employees drive or ride as passengers-should not be recorded as either work hours or travel hours. Defendants' Motion to Decertify, [ECF No. 140], at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties dispute whether HTS consistently paid the Drive Time Rate in accordance with this plan. Plaintiffs say HTS largely followed it except that HTS also usually recorded the time spent traveling in personal vehicles as travel hours. Defendants, however, claim foremen distorted HTS's intended policy by recording \"travel hours\" on DARs in a haphazard and inconsistent manner. The Court will address this dispute-including whether it presents a genuine issue of material fact within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 -later in this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties agree that HTS treated all time that it recorded as travel hours and paid at the Drive Time Rate in a consistent manner when calculating how much overtime compensation to pay employees. When determining how many hours employees worked in a given week, HTS excluded all time that was recorded as travel hours and paid at the Drive Time Rate. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 21; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24. When calculating the overtime rate of pay for employees, HTS excluded all payments at the Drive Time Rate of $10 per hour, and just multiplied employees' regular wages by 1.5. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 23; Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 23. It is these two overtime compensation practices that are at issue in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 25, 2014, Pietrzycki filed the original complaint in this case on behalf of himself and similarly situated persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Collective Action Complaint, [ECF No. 1]. A little less than one year later, Pietrzycki filed the Second Amended Complaint, which is the extant complaint at the present time. Second Amended Complaint, [ECF No. 74]. The Second Amended Complaint asserts two counts. Count I is brought under the FLSA and Count II under the IMWL. Both counts allege Defendants underpaid Plaintiffs for their overtime work. Plaintiffs now have refined their case to two claims, which are identical under the two statutes. Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support of His Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiffs' Opening SJ Brief\"), [ECF No. 133], at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    Pietrzycki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d at 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, Plaintiffs claim HTS should have counted Drive Time as \"hours worked\" for the purposes of determining how many overtime hours Plaintiffs worked. Second, Plaintiffs claim HTS should have included the amounts paid at the Drive Time Rate when determining each Plaintiff's regular rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 1, 2015, at the joint request of the parties, the Court conditionally certified a FLSA collective action. Order Authorizing Notice to Similarly Situated Persons pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), [ECF No. 34]. The following year, Pietrzycki moved to certify a Rule 23 class and Defendants moved to decertify the collective action.\n   <em>\n    Pietrzycki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d at 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the parties' arguments and the record then before it, the Court certified, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and (3), \"a class of Illinois workers under the IMWL that is comprised of 'all current and former HTS Tower Technicians and Foremen who received compensation for Drive Time as reflected in HTS's payroll records and who worked in Illinois since August 25, 2011,' \" and denied the motion to decertify the collective action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n    at 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In doing so, the court explained that \"ordinary home-to-work travel was not viewed as hours worked[ ] even prior to the enactment of the [PPA],\" and, therefore, that \"the travel at issue...did not qualify as hours worked, even if [the defendant] had a custom or practice of paying for it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 707.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wren v.

The plaintiff employee claimed the post-March 2004 policy violated the FLSA because, among other reasons, the travel time counted as hours worked. The court recognized travel between home and work is a normal incident of employment and does not count as hours worked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The court explained this rule applies even when employees travel together in an employer-provided vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court ultimately concluded the travel at issue in that case\n   constituted no more than ordinary home-to-work travel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The court then went on to reject the plaintiff's argument that the defendant employer's policy of paying for travel made that time into worktime, reaffirming that a custom or practice does not make time into hours worked when the time would not count as hours worked in the absence of the policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on three cases to support their argument that a custom, practice, or contract of compensating for travel time can make that time count as hours worked. None of the cases actually supports this proposition. In\n   <em>\n    Raper v. State\n   </em>\n   , the Iowa Supreme Court case never addressed whether the plaintiff peace officers' travel time would have counted as hours worked in the absence of the PPA, possibly because the state patrol regulations relevant to the plaintiffs' claims in that case provided the peace officers were \"on duty at any time they [were] in uniform or in a state vehicle.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9147161\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/688/29/#p46\">\n    688 N.W.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (Iowa 2004). Instead, the court focused on the narrower factual question of whether there was a custom or practice of paying for the travel time at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9147161\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/688/29/#p46\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9147161\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/688/29/#p46\">\n    at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. R &amp; M Erectors, Incorporated\n   </em>\n   , there is no indication that the defendants disputed whether the travel time at issue counted as hours worked and the court never explicitly addressed the issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920987\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/429/771/#p776\">\n    429 F.Supp. 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776-79 (D. Del. 1977). Finally, Plaintiffs over-read the statement in\n   <em>\n    Vega v. Gasper\n   </em>\n   that \"[o]rdinary home-to-work travel is clearly not compensable under the [PPA] unless a contract or custom of compensation exists between the employer and the employees.\" 36 F.3d at 424. In that case, the plaintiffs did not argue that the employer had a custom or practice of compensating for that time, and the Fifth Circuit did not address the issue. Moreover, the broad reading espoused by Plaintiffs would be inconsistent with Department of Labor regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20790.5\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20790.7\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In summary, none of the cases cited by Plaintiffs squarely deals with whether ordinary home-to-work travel can be made into hours worked solely by a custom, practice, or contract of compensating for that time. On the other hand, the regulations discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Wren\n   </em>\n   all directly address the issue. All of them agree that a custom, practice, or contract under the PPA does not make ordinary home-to-work commuting time into hours worked because that time was not compensable before Congress enacted the PPA. The Court agrees with that line of reasoning. Therefore, Plaintiffs' first argument is of no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court recognizes that Plaintiffs assert this is not a run of the mill home-to-work commuting case. Plaintiffs point out that, at least when traveling in HTS trucks, they went to designated meeting locations and did not commute directly from or to home. Plaintiffs emphasize that HTS implemented its new Drive Time compensation arrangement in 2012 to compensate employees for long travel times and to attract qualified workers. Plaintiffs also contend HTS considered Drive Time to be payment for regular hours worked because it included Drive Time payments as taxable \"Earnings\" on paystubs and foremen marked start/end times on DARs that incorporated Drive Time. For all these reasons, Plaintiffs say, Drive Time is more than ordinary home-to-work travel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court is not convinced by these arguments on the record now before it. HTS did not require employees to go to a designated meeting site at the start or end of the day. Instead, they were free to go directly from their homes to their assigned towers at the start of the day and directly to their homes from their assigned towers at the end of the day. HTS also did not require employees to travel in an HTS truck. As\n   <em>\n    Wren\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   show, an employer's decision to provide transportation and designate a meeting location does not transform ordinary commuting into hours worked. Although employees sometimes had to travel significant distances to get between their homes and their assigned towers, Plaintiffs do not contest the fact that such travel was a contemplated and normal part of employees' jobs with HTS. The record on summary judgment is poorly developed with respect to how much time Plaintiffs spent traveling to job sites in company vehicles. It may be that Plaintiffs could establish that the amount of time spent in this way should not be characterized as ordinary home-to-work travel. But Plaintiffs have not done so on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At oral argument, Plaintiffs directed the Court to three Supreme Court decisions that they contend show Drive Time counts as hours worked. Those cases, however, all are easily distinguishable because they involved travel on an employer's premises that was controlled by the employer and was necessarily and primarily performed for the employer's benefit.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Plaintiffs first say some Drive Time counts as hours worked under the \"continuous workday rule\" because some Plaintiffs performed work either before they traveled to the first tower of the day or on their way back at the end of the day. Plaintiffs also contend some Drive Time counts as hours worked because Plaintiffs sometimes performed additional activities while traveling as a passenger during Drive Time. Plaintiffs lastly assert some Drive Time counts as hours worked because they traveled away from their home communities. Each of these variations will be addressed in turn. None of them justify granting summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor on the record presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Continuous Workday Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs argue at least some Drive Time counts as hours worked under the \"continuous workday rule,\" which also\n   is known as the \"whistle-to-whistle rule,\" because employees sometimes performed work at a warehouse either before traveling to the first tower of the day or after traveling back from the last tower of the day. The parties' Local Rule 56.1 statements address activities performed at warehouses in a haphazard and incomplete manner again depriving the Court of an adequate record on which to decide the summary judgment motions. Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56.1(a) statement does not contain any statements related to activities performed at warehouses. Plaintiffs addressed the issue at some length in their Statement of Additional Material Facts, but Defendants did not respond to that statement. As a result, the parties' conflicting factual positions about activities performed at warehouses is most clearly revealed in Plaintiffs' response to Defendants' Local Rule 56.1(a) statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 148], at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8, 9, 15, 19. But the Court will summarize each party's version on this issue, including facts to which the other has not responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, when employees arrived at HTS's warehouse in the morning, they often performed pre-trip activities. \"Examples of the work performed\" include cleaning, loading, and servicing the HTS trucks they would travel in. Plaintiffs' Additional SoF, [ECF No. 149], \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Plaintiffs say that pre-trip activities benefited HTS because they helped crews get to towers faster and that the activities were integral to the employees' work because the tasks had to be completed before going to a tower.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5. Plaintiffs contend pre-trip activities took 30 or more minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. Plaintiffs claim that employees were asked to do pre-trip activities and that, if they refused, they could be written up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Plaintiffs also assert employees performed work at customers' warehouses, including loading materials, on their way to towers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Likewise, Plaintiffs claim that, at HTS's warehouse at the end of the day, employees sometimes moved boxes to be burned or cleaned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because Defendants did not respond to Plaintiffs' Statement of Additional Facts, it is not entirely clear to what extent they dispute what Plaintiffs say about activities at warehouses. But Defendants' Local Rule 56.1(a) statement breaks with much of what Plaintiffs say. As an initial matter, Defendants claim tower technicians were not required or directed to perform the pre-trip activities described by Plaintiffs. Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6\u00b6 9, 15, 19. Defendants say tower technicians rarely performed work-related activities at HTS's warehouse and normally only loaded their personal belongings into an HTS truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 15. When employees performed work at a warehouse, Defendants assert HTS paid their regular wages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. Defendants only refer to employees \"readying the HTS truck or trailer or loading materials,\" and do not indicate whether those employees also did things like training or assisting the warehouse manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Defendants also claim it is \"a very rare occurrence\" that any employee performed work at a customer's warehouse at HTS's direction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Defendants do not address what activities, if any, employees performed after returning to HTS's warehouse at the end of the day. Plaintiffs dispute virtually everything Defendants say in this regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 148], at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8, 9, 15, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The parties' briefs concerning the application of the continuous workday rule also are not helpful. Plaintiffs did not raise the issue until their combined response and reply brief. Even in that brief, Plaintiffs do not discuss activities performed at warehouses at the end of the day (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , taking boxes to be burned or cleaned) or activities performed at customers' warehouses. Instead,\n   Plaintiffs focus only on activities performed at the start of the day at HTS's warehouses. Defendants' responsive argument in their reply brief consists of no more than a general statement of the law, a few conclusory assertions, and an attempt to distinguish two cases cited by Plaintiffs. Because no party develops or supports their respective arguments regarding what activities were performed at customers' warehouses and at HTS's warehouse at the end of the day, the Court will not address whether those activities marked the beginning or end of the workday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The law in this area is clearly established. Under the continuous workday rule, \"workers must be compensated for time they spend doing what might otherwise be non-compensable activities if those activities occur during the 'period between commencement and completion on the same workday of an employee's principal activity or activities,' subject to FLSA carve outs.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Defendants claim no tower technicians were required to clean, service, or load HTS trucks while Plaintiffs say they sometimes were asked to do so and were subject to discipline if they refused. No party addresses to what extent cleaning and servicing HTS trucks was necessary to the employees' performance of their duties at towers. Plaintiffs have cited evidence that loading HTS trucks was beneficial to HTS because it saved time and was necessary because the equipment, materials, and tools were used at towers. Plaintiffs' Additional SoF, [ECF No. 149], \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5. Defendants do not address either necessity or benefit in their statements of material fact or briefs. But, as discussed above, they dispute enough of what Plaintiffs say to muddy the waters on work performed at the beginning and end of the day. The Court is not prepared to say, based on the deficient record developed at this juncture, that Defendants have waived that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To the extent employees spent periods of time performing activities such as loading HTS trucks, the Court does not see why that would not be sufficient to mark the start of their workdays. Although there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether employees are required to perform these activities, they are done for HTS's benefit and are integral and indispensable to the principal activities performed at towers. But this is not enough on its own for the Court to find Drive Time counts as hours worked. The parties dispute how often employees performed these activities and it is not clear whether employees largely did the same activities or whether there was significant variation in what they did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Defendants\n   default, to some extent, in responding to Plaintiffs' argument on this point, Plaintiffs do not make enough of an affirmative showing to entitle them to summary judgment on this issue. And Plaintiffs did not raise this argument in their opening brief. Therefore, neither party is entitled to summary judgment based on their continuous workday arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Additional Activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs argue at least some Drive Time counts as hours worked because, at times, employees performed other compensable work while traveling as passengers. The record now before the Court is poorly developed with respect to what employees did during Drive Time (besides travel as passengers). During oral argument, Plaintiffs conceded that employees usually slept or otherwise used their time as they pleased and did not perform other activities that constituted work. The parties seem to agree, though, that at least sometimes employees performed activities related to their work for HTS. Plaintiffs' Additional SoF, [ECF No. 149], \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Motion to Decertify, [ECF No. 140], at 12. Defendants have not identified what activities were performed. Plaintiffs say the \"passengers would pass along site plans, discuss job requirements, fill out paperwork,...and have telephone calls with management.\" Plaintiffs' Additional SoF, [ECF No. 149], \u00b6 16. That sounds plausible as a matter of common sense. Neither party, however, has clearly shown how often employees performed any such activities although, based on the parties' statements during oral argument, it was the exception, not the rule. It also is unclear whether and, if so, how often HTS compensated time spent in these activities as regular work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants argue the Drive Time spent performing these activities does not count as hours worked because the activities are\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   . \"The\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine allows employers to disregard otherwise compensable work when only a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours are in dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Kellar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861064\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/169/#p176\">\n    664 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   176 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.47\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The parties' statements of material fact are silent about how much time employees spent in the activities identified by Plaintiffs, how regularly the activities were performed, the aggregate amount of compensable time, and the administrative difficulty of tracking the time spent performing these activities. The parties also do not address in any depth either these factual matters or the legal principles governing the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   analysis in their briefs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, neither Plaintiffs nor Defendants have shown that, based on the undisputed facts, they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Travel Away from Home\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   During oral argument, Plaintiffs raised for the first time the argument that at least some Drive Time should be counted as hours worked because it involved travel away from home overnight. Plaintiffs cited\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.39\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which states that \"[t]ravel that keeps an employee away from home\" and \"cuts across the employee's workday\" is worktime.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.39\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs made various factual representations, saying, among other things, that employees traveled away from home during their workday when they were \"on\" for a few consecutive days. But Plaintiffs conceded no party's Local Rule 56.1 statements included any of these facts. Understandably, Defendants did not offer a specific response to this theory raised for the first time at oral argument. Because Plaintiffs did not develop and support this argument in their written filings, the Court will not base a decision on the pending motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' travel away from home theory. That does not preclude Plaintiffs from making this argument as the case progresses if it can be better supported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs have not shown based on the undisputed facts that Drive Time counts as hours worked and Defendants have not shown based on the undisputed facts that Drive Time does not count as hours worked. Therefore, the Court cannot grant summary judgment to either party on the issue of whether Defendants improperly excluded Drive Time from their calculation of hours worked by Plaintiffs including for purposes of determining overtime. The Court will, however, go on to address Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants improperly calculated their regular rate by not including payments made at the Drive Time Rate in that calculation, including for purposes of paying overtime compensation, because that could be helpful in moving this case forward to an eventual resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

An employer violates the IMWL and the FLSA when it pays \"less than one and one-half times the regular rate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ; 820 ILL. COMP. STAT. 105/4a. As noted above, the regular rate is calculated \"by dividing [an employee's] total remuneration for employment (except statutory exclusions) in any workweek by the total number of hours actually worked by him in that workweek for which such compensation was paid.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.109\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because, as discussed in the preceding section of this Memorandum Opinion, the Court cannot say whether all, some, or none of Drive Time counts as hours worked, the Court cannot determine whether HTS paid Plaintiffs too low of an hourly rate for their overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs have not pointed to undisputed facts that establish Plaintiffs who worked overtime were underpaid. For example, Plaintiffs do not argue that any Plaintiff had a regular wage of less than $10 per hour. Instead, all of the regular wage rates reflected in the parties' briefs and Local Rule 56.1 statements are higher than $10 per hour. If, for instance, all Drive Time counts as hours worked (as Plaintiffs argue it does), then Defendants may well have paid Plaintiffs higher overtime rates than they were required to pay under the IMWL and the FLSA. That is because if Drive Time counts as hours worked, then the Drive Time Rate of $10 per hour should be included on a weighted average basis in HTS's determination of a proper overtime rate. That, in turn, would result in a lower overtime rate than would apply if HTS used only employees' regular wage rates to determine overtime compensation due.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.115\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, because of the uncertainty regarding Plaintiffs' hours worked and the uncertainty about how the exclusion of Drive Time from hours worked would affect the amount, if any, of overtime compensation due to them, Plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on their regular rate claim. To be clear, the deficiencies in the record go not only to the determination of damages but also to liability for an alleged underpayment of overtime compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

As discussed above, the Court disagrees with Plaintiffs that a custom, practice, or contract under the PPA alone can make travel time into hours worked.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III(1)(A). Plaintiffs also need to show that Drive\n   Time is not ordinary home-to-work commuting, which they have not yet done on this record. That leaves Defendants' argument that the PPA shields them from liability as a matter of law because they do not have a custom, practice, or contract to pay for Drive Time. As discussed below, however, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants had a custom, practice, or contract to compensate employees for traveling as passengers in an HTS truck or other vehicle. That means if Plaintiffs can show on a more developed record that this category of Drive Time is not ordinary home-to-work commuting, then Plaintiffs will prevail on their FLSA claim in this respect. It is useful to begin the analysis with a discussion of the various provisions of the PPA and how they work together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Plaintiffs dispute this point, contending Drive Time is more than just travel to or from the actual place of performance of their principal activities. Plaintiffs devote more of their attention, though, to arguing HTS had a custom, practice, or contract within the meaning of \u00a7 254(b) of compensating employees for Drive Time.

I would say [foremen] know that mobilization from the warehouse to the job site falls under drive time, as does mobilization from the job site back to the warehouse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Q.

According to Defendants, Motter and Overholt were unaware of this fact when they were deposed in this case. Defendants' Decertification Reply, [ECF No. 152], at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In their summary judgment briefs, Defendants repeatedly contend HTS did not have a custom or practice of compensating for any travel as passengers. Defendants' argument is set forth in conclusory and general sentences, four of which cite to the same three paragraphs in their Local Rule 56.1(a) statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' SJ Response, [ECF No. 141], at 2, 5, 6, 7, 8; Defendants' Opening SJ Brief, [ECF No. 144], at 2, 5, 6, 8, 9; Defendants' SJ Reply, [ECF No. 156], at 2, 12-13. With a few exceptions discussed below, Defendants do not discuss the specific facts that supposedly show a custom or practice did not exist or how the law applies in light of those facts. Defendants mostly fall back on the assertion that the Drive Time arrangement was \"not uniformly applied.\" But this contention sets up a straw man. A custom or practice to compensate for travel as a passenger can exist even if, at times, HTS deviated from that custom or practice. For example, a person may have a custom or practice of parking his car at the curb in front of his house even if he occasionally parks in the garage. If, on the other hand, Defendants are saying the record does not support the conclusion that HTS did not have a custom or practice of paying for travel as a passenger at all, then that position is not supported on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   One of Defendants' few specific arguments is that HTS sometimes awarded the Drive Time Rate for activities other than traveling as passengers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' SJ Reply, [ECF No. 156], at 11-12. Specifically, Defendants cite an exchange in one deposition in which a foreman said he paid the Drive Time Rate to employees for time spent performing \"any task that needed to be done at a customer's warehouse\" if the employees were at the warehouse for only a short period of time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20790.10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even if that is true, however, that does not show HTS failed to compensate employees for Drive Time, it just means sometimes HTS also paid the same hourly rate for an activity other than traveling as passengers to or from a job site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20790.10\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\" 'The custom or practice' by which compensability\n   of an activity is tested under the statute is one 'covering such activity.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants also argue foremen did not consistently differentiate between regular wages and the Drive Time Rate and sometimes paid regular wages for travel as passengers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' SoF, [ECF No. 143], \u00b6 17. Defendants, though, do not cite any case law holding that the custom or practice exception does not apply when employees are compensated at two rates for an activity. Such a conclusion is inconsistent with common sense and the broad definition of \"compensable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20790.9\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"compensable\" includes compensation \"in any amount\").\n   <em>\n    Pietrzycki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if HTS paid its employees at two different rates for the same activity, that does not mean that there was not a custom or practice to compensate employees for that activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As noted above, employees mostly traveled in HTS trucks but, on infrequent occasions, they traveled in personal vehicles. That means most Drive Time occurred in HTS trucks and some smaller portion of Drive Time occurred in personal vehicles. The record regarding HTS's custom or practice (though not, as explained above, its nonwritten contract) is different with respect to travel in these two types of vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendants never actually state, much less cite evidence showing, that HTS routinely failed to pay employees any compensation for traveling as passengers in an HTS truck. As noted above, Defendants rely on three paragraphs in their Local Rule 56.1(a) Statement when arguing no custom or practice existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those paragraphs, however, do not contain assertions related to a failure to compensate employees in any amount. More importantly, the Court has reviewed all of the deposition testimony cited in the three paragraphs. At no point did any deponent testify that HTS did not provide any compensation to employees for traveling as passengers in an HTS truck. To the contrary, every deponent's testimony supports Plaintiffs' position that HTS routinely paid either the Drive Time Rate or the regular wage rate for that activity. Therefore, in the Court's view, the material facts are undisputed and show that HTS had a custom or practice of compensating employees for traveling as passengers in an HTS truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   With respect to a custom or practice of compensating for traveling as passengers in a personal vehicle, the analysis may be different. Defendants have identified evidence in the record that employees sometimes were compensated for time spent traveling as passengers in a personal vehicle and sometimes were not. This evidence creates an issue of fact as to whether HTS had a custom or practice of compensating employees for traveling as passengers in a personal vehicle. Because travel in a personal vehicle is a different activity than travel in an HTS truck, the issue of fact does not affect whether HTS had a custom or practice of compensating employees for Drive Time in an HTS truck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20790.10\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\" 'The custom or practice' by which compensability of an activity is tested under the statute is one 'covering such activity.' \"). It also does not affect the Court's conclusion as to the nature of HTS's nonwritten contract with its employees, even if HTS did not always comply with that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   To sum up, HTS had a nonwritten contract with employees to compensate them for the activity of traveling as passengers in a vehicle regardless of whether it was an HTS truck or a personal vehicle. HTS also had a custom or practice of compensating employees for traveling as passengers in an HTS truck. It remains an open question whether HTS had a custom or practice of compensating employees for traveling as passengers in a personal vehicle, but that issue is not material in light of HTS's nonwritten contract. Therefore, if Plaintiffs can prove that Defendants violated the FLSA, then the PPA will not shield Defendants from liability on their hours worked or regular rate claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Defendants have not shown they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the PPA given the undisputed facts in the present record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Sept. 28, 2015) (\"An employee therefore need not, as Defendants argue, allege facts supporting a 'willful' violation to successfully plead an FLSA claim.\"). To the extent Defendants are arguing that they did not know, as a factual matter, what was happening during Drive Time, they have not shown the undisputed facts support this position. Of course, the Court has not yet found Drive Time constitutes hours worked, so it seems to be somewhat premature to ask whether Defendants knew Drive Time involved work. Regardless, it seems quite clear that Defendants knew employees were traveling as passengers during Drive Time and that payments at the Drive Time rate were not included when calculating employees' regular rates. Whether Defendants knew about more detailed matters, such as if and when employees performed additional activities\n   during Drive Time, is not addressed by either party's briefs or Local Rule 56.1 Statements.

Defendants concede that Motter is Plaintiffs' \"employer\" within the meaning of the IMWL and the FLSA. Plaintiffs' SoF, [ECF No. 134], \u00b6 2. Defendants do not explain why this concession alone, coupled with Motter's undisputed involvement in the creation of the Drive Time arrangement, is not dispositive. Motter is the sole owner of HTS, as well as its president. He is involved in HTS's day-to-day operations, supervises and directs employees' work, and has the authority to hire and fire.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195903\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/819/740/#p743\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Motter was involved in setting the compensation rates for employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.

Therefore, Motter will be jointly and severally liable with HTS to the extent HTS is liable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' Motion to Decertify\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Defendants have moved to decertify the Rule 23 class action and the FLSA collective action. Defendants' argument that this case is not susceptible to classwide treatment seems to be at least somewhat in tension with the fact that they have moved for summary judgment on a classwide basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costello v. BeavEx, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061051\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/1045/#p1059\">\n    810 F.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1061 (7th Cir. 2016). Moreover, as already noted, the Court denied a motion to decertify the collective action and certified a Rule 23 class action just last year.\n   <em>\n    Pietrzycki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n    197 F.Supp.3d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants only identify one new basis for decertification that was not raised in last year's motion practice. Defendants contend the deposition testimony of several foremen, who were deposed after the Court's previous ruling, shows there was no custom or practice of compensating employees for Drive Time. As explained above, the Court largely disagrees with Defendants' assessment of the custom or practice issue, even in light of this new testimony, or at least with Defendants' proposition that all the facts are undisputed on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Outside of that testimony, Defendants more fully develop and support the arguments that they asserted during last year's motion practice. In particular, Defendants' attempt to make a more fulsome showing that individualized issues concerning how foremen awarded the Drive Time Rate will predominate over common issues because HTS did not have a custom or practice of compensating for Drive Time, enabling Defendants, therefore to take advantage of the PPA's protection from liability. As explained above, the Court disagrees with Defendants to the extent they contend HTS did not have a custom, practice, or contract to compensate employees for the activity of traveling as passengers in a vehicle. Whether HTS had a custom or practice of compensating for travel as passengers in a personal vehicle remains an open question. But the answer to that question is not determinative for the reasons discussed above. Based on the arguments asserted by Plaintiffs at summary judgment, Drive Time potentially may be hours worked if it is more than ordinary\n   home-to-work commuting. At this time, therefore, the question with respect to personal vehicles is not a basis upon which to decertify the class. For the reasons explained in its prior ruling,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179642\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/197/1007/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and above, the Court denies Defendants' Motion to Decertify [ECF No. 140].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   For all of the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 132] is denied, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 142] is denied, and Defendants' Motion to Decertify [ECF No. 140] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    HTS has employees with other titles, including Warehouse Manager.
