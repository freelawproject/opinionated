And, as noted above, Perrigo has not actually asked the Court to compel any agency action in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Perrigo suggests that the case presents an actual controversy between the two ANDA applicants concerning whether Perrigo will have forfeited its exclusivity as of Monday, December 4. That issue is not ripe since the FDA has not yet granted Aurobindo's application, and it is possible that the FDA will determine that the consent decree did not start the clock and that Perrigo has not forfeited its exclusivity. But as Perrigo points out, if the FDA grants Aurobindo's ANDA, the moment Perrigo's claim becomes ripe, it will also become moot: the 75 days will have elapsed. Perrigo urges the Court to act given those unique circumstances. The Court is not persuaded that this gives rise to subject matter jurisdiction, but in any event, the Court observes that there several significant problems with Perrigo's approach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    First of all, the conundrum is largely self-inflicted since there is no allegation that either the FDA or Aurobindo has interfered in any way with Perrigo's launch of its product under the terms of the ANDA it obtained twenty-eight months ago. And second, Perrigo's claimed lack of certainty about the legal landscape seems entirely inconsistent with the law and the facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    On September 20, 2017, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey signed a consent decree in a declaratory judgment action,\n    <em>\n     Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. v. AstraZeneca AB\n    </em>\n    , No. 3:16-cv-5079 (D.N.J. Aug. 18, 2016). It said:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    In light of the license granted under Article 5 of the Settlement Agreement, the Court enters final judgment in Civil Action No. 3:16-cv-07330-MLC-TJB that the making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or distributing of the Aurobindo Product by Aurobindo or any of its Affiliates, successors and assigns does not infringe the AstraZeneca Patents.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Consent Judgment and Decree. This certainly appears to be a \"consent decree that enters a final judgment that includes a finding that the patent is ... not infringed,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (j)(5)(D)(i)(I)(bb)(BB), and therefore this Court would not have been inclined to enter judgment in plaintiff's favor on Count II. The Consent Judgment and Decree dated September 20, 2017 is a consent decree, it entered final judgment, and it found that the patent is not infringed, whether it utilized the word \"find\" or not. The fact that the judgment was predicated on a license is immaterial-the definition of the forfeiture event in the statute does not make any distinction between patent cases resolved through licensing arrangements or other negotiated dispositions and those that require judicial analyses of the underlying patents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Plaintiff alleges in its complaint:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    The September 20 Consent Judgment contains no finding that the relevant patents (the '616 and '810 patents) are invalid or not infringed by Aurobindo's application. Indeed, it does not identify any patents. Instead, the September 20 Consent Judgment contains a very different type of conclusion, namely that pursuant to a license granted in a non-public settlement agreement, Aurobindo can (once its application is approved by FDA) market its product with the consent of AstraZeneca.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Compl. \u00b6 11. But this sort of judicial determination seems to be plainly covered by the section of the statute related to forfeiture of the 180-day exclusivity period. Subsection (D)(i)(I)(bb)(BB) specifically provides that a \"settlement order or consent decree\" in a declaratory judgment action, such as the one filed by Aurobindo in this case, may serve as the critical forfeiture event that starts the clock ticking; there is no legal requirement in that provision that the judgment include a ruling on the infringement question on the merits. This seems even more clear when one reads the previous provision, subsection (D)(i)(I)(bb)(AA), which states that the failure-to-market date could also fall 75 days after a court enters \"a final decision ... that the patent is invalid or not infringed\" in an infringement action brought against the other applicant or a declaratory judgment brought by that applicant. In other words, it is subsection (AA) that deals with final determinations on the merits and subsection (BB) that reflects Congress's recognition that patent actions are often resolved by agreement of the parties. Indeed, plaintiff cites no authority for its strained interpretation of the word \"finding,\" other than Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52, which deals with \"an action tried on the facts without a jury,\" and has no bearing on a consent decree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Plaintiff also suggests that the operative paragraph in the consent decree is too vague to constitute the necessary finding that a patent is not infringed since it does not specifically identify the patents involved but simply refers to them as \"the AstraZeneca patents.\" But the consent decree was not handed down in a vacuum-it is the final document on the docket in a lawsuit concerning the only patents that could have any bearing on this case-the two patents listed in the Orange Book for the listed drug.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Aurobindo Compl. \u00b6 1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Thus, while Perrigo has urged the Court to give unambiguous language its plain meaning, it appears that it is Perrigo that is resisting the commonsense interpretation of the texts involved.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
