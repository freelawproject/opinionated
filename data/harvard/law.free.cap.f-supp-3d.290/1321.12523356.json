(\"Teva\" or \"Defendant\") on September 25, 2017. ECF No. [11] (\"Motion\"). The Court has carefully reviewed the Motion, all opposing and supporting materials, the record in this case and the applicable law, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Teva is a manufacturer of alendronate, the generic version of osteoporosis drug Fosamax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [5-1] \u00b6\u00b6 7, 18. The FDA approved Teva to manufacture this generic drug, a nitrogenous bisphosphonate, in September 1995.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. According to the Complaint, throughout the 1990's and 2000's, patients taking alendronate reported severe negative side effects, including osteonecrosis in the jaw, as well as other dental and bone complications.\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\u00b6\n   </em>\n   25, 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Anita Allbright (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Allbright\") was prescribed alendronate either sometime in 2008 or in September 2009.\n   <em>\n    Cf. id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 58\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. She took alendronate\"on-and-off until January of 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. In the months prior to when she ceased taking the drug, Allbright began experiencing symptoms affecting her jaw, mouth, and teeth with increasing severity. In November 2014, Allbright sought dental treatment for pain in the back of her jaw.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. On December 17, 2014, Allbright developed \"a lump on the right side of her jaw\" and \"extreme swelling under her tongue,\" for which she was prescribed an antibiotic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. On January 21, 2015, \"a piece of [ ] Allbright's jaw bone was protruding during a routine dental cleaning,\" and on February 4, 2015, \"another piece of jaw bone became dislodged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    \u00b6\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69-70. These bone pieces were subsequently pathologically evaluated and Allbright was diagnosed with \"necrotic bone osteonecrosis of the jaw from bisphosphonates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70-71. In the months following of 2015, Allbright experienced tooth and jaw pain, shingles, painful lumps of the jaw, loss of teeth fixation, and a full tear and retraction of the supraspinatus tendon which required a reverse shoulder replacement.\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72-77. In May of 2017, Allbright re-fractured her right shoulder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she has \"developed osteonecrosis of the jaw and/or other jaw and bone injuries after ingesting alendronate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 65. \"Before taking bisphosphonates, [Allbright] was asymptomatic and in reasonably good health.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Allbright alleges that the injuries she has since sustained are \"severe and permanent\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10) and that her injuries will \"continue into the indefinite future\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). Plaintiff \"would not have taken these drugs if she had been informed of the\n   unreasonable risk of osteonecrosis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that generic manufacturer Teva knew or should have known that alendronate was defectively designed because it was unreasonably dangerous and its foreseeable risks exceeded any benefits. Despite this knowledge, Defendant continued to manufacture, market, and distribute alendronate. ECF No. [5-1] \u00b6\u00b6 80-86. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant failed to properly warn her and her physician of the risks of taking alendronate because Defendant (1) failed to investigate reports of negative side effect like those experienced by Allbright and conduct post-market surveys regarding those side effects; (2) concealed alendronate's negative side effects and its \"unreasonably dangerous risks\"; (3) provided misleading and incomplete information for publication in the packaging inserts of the drug and in the Physician's Desk Reference, a publication widely used and relied upon by physicians when prescribing medications; and (4) failed to update the labels of alendronate pursuant to direction by the FDA in 2004.\n   <em>\n    See id. \u00b6\u00b6\n   </em>\n   11-14, 16, 26-27, 31, 33, 42, 45-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With regard to allegations regarding failure to update alendronate's labels, Plaintiff alleges that on August 25, 2004, in its post-marketing safety review of bisphosphonates including alendronate, the FDA advised Defendant that it \"should amend the labeling for the respective bisphosphonates medication to specifically warn of the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. According to the Complaint, Defendant \"has refused to accede to the FDA request timely and to this day still does not adequately and/or specifically warn of the exceptional medical complication risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw in the label for alendronate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\u00b6\n   </em>\n   41.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   FDA cited Teva for violating federal regulations by overstating the benefits of alendronate and minimizing its risks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. The Complaint also alleges that Teva failed to engage in the FDA's process of implementing stronger warnings, known as the \"changes being effected\" or CBE process. ECF No. [5-1] \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiff originally filed her Complaint in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida on August 11, 2017. ECF No. [5-1]. Plaintiff asserts three causes of action against Defendant: Count I: Strict Liability-Defective Design; Count II: Strict Liability-Failure to Warn; and Count III: Negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On September 18, 2017, Defendant timely removed the action to this Court based on diversity. ECF No. [1]. Defendant now moves to dismiss the Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because the claims asserted by Allbright are preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, while the Supreme Court reviewed the conflicting arguments presented by the parties and the FDA as to this duty, it declined to decide whether any duty existed at all, stating: \"Because we ultimately find pre-emption even assuming such a duty existed, we do not resolve the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 617,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334435,12450499\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/604/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court declines to apply these authorities as urged by Plaintiff. Within this framework of the parties' arguments, the Court will analyze each of Plaintiff's claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count I: Strict Liability-Defective Design\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff's first cause of action alleges that alendronate is \"defective in its design or formation\" because it is \"unreasonably dangerous\" and \"its foreseeable risks exceed[ its] benefits ....\" ECF No. [5-1] \u00b6 84. Plaintiff further alleges that Teva knew or should have known that alendronate was defective, was aware of the foreseeable harm that alendronate could cause Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff was harmed as a proximate cause of the defective design.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88. Defendant moves to dismiss this claim under\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, arguing that the claims are preempted under federal law. ECF No. [11] at 10-11. In its Opposition to the Motion, Plaintiff does not appear to respond to Defendant's arguments based on design defect, and to the extent that her arguments regarding failure to warn can be construed as related to a design defect, as noted above, that authority is inapplicable here.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court agrees that under\n   <em>\n    Mensing\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bartlett,\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's claims based on design defect are preempted. To comply with its design obligations under the FDCA, Teva must manufacture alendronate such that it is identical in all material respects to the brand name drug, Fosamax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(2)(A). Teva may not change the design of alendronate since the basis of its FDA approval under the expedited process for generics relies on alendronate's \"sameness\" in design as the bioequivalent of the brand name. Under state law, however, Teva may have had a conflicting duty to change the design of alendronate given information about its risks. Because it would be impossible for Teva to both change the design and fulfill its \"duty of sameness,\" Plaintiff's state law claims based on design defect are preempted. Accordingly, Count I is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

ECF No. [5-1] \u00b6\u00b6 105-06.
