Payne, Senior United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on HANKOOK TIRE COMPANY LIMITED'S AND HANKOOK TIRE AMERICA COMPANY'S MOTION TO EXCLUDE TESTIMONY OF PLAINTIFF'S EXPERT DAVID SOUTHWELL (ECF No. 54). The Court previously denied the motion, with one minor exception, by ORDER (ECF No. 221) dated November 27, 2017. This Memorandum Opinion sets out the reasoning for that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this products liability action, Robert Benedict sues Hankook Tire Company Limited (\"HTCL\") and Hankook Tire America Corporation (\"HTAC\") for the production and distribution of an allegedly defective tire. Defendants seek to exclude the testimony of Benedict's tire expert, David Southwell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A detailed overview of the facts of this case appears in the Court's Opinions resolving Benedict's and Defendants' motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 341, 343). In short, however, this action involves a single-vehicle accident that occurred when the front right tire (the \"subject tire\") of a cement truck driven by Benedict experienced a tread separation, after which the truck collided with an embankment on the side of the road. First Am. Compl. 2-3. The subject tire was a Hankook Aurora TH08 Radial 425/65 R22.5 manufactured by HTCL in South Korea in 2005. Defs.' Br. 2; First Am. Compl. 2. Benedict alleges that the subject tire's failure was caused by manufacturing defects, and he relies on the expert testimony of Southwell to substantiate his claim. First Am. Compl. 2-9; Nov. 20, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 4; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Benedict initially asserted three claims: (1) products liability negligence (including manufacturing defect, design defect, and failure to warn); (2) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; and (3) breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. First Am. Compl. 5-11. He is now pursuing only the negligent manufacturing and implied warranty of merchantability claims. Nov. 20, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both sides moved for summary judgment. Benedict sought summary judgment as to Defendants' contributory negligence defense. Defendants sought summary judgment as to Benedict's active claims. Related to their motion, Defendants sought exclusion of the testimony of Southwell. The Court ruled on these three motions during a hearing held on November 20, 2017, Nov. 20, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 152, and\n   issued an ORDER (ECF No. 221) on November 27, 2017 formalizing that decision. This Opinion is thus one of three detailing the Court's reasoning in this matter. (ECF Nos. 341-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Southwell's Testimony and Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To examine whether Southwell's testimony should be excluded, it is necessary first to examine what his testimony is and what qualifications he possesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Southwell's Defect Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Benedict's tire expert, Southwell, posits that the subject tire failed for two primary reasons: (1) the subject tire's components did not sufficiently adhere to each other; and (2) excessive oxidation led to degradation of the subject tire. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 11, 25, 38-39. Each will be discussed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Southwell's first theory, in essence, is that the subject tire's components were \"not properly 'stuck together.' \" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 11. Tires generally contain several rubber components.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 11-13, 17-19. In a finished tire, these components adhere to each other through, at least as relevant here, interdiffusion and sulphur cross linking.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 11-13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The first of these processes, interdiffusion, involves \"the spontaneous movement of [rubber molecule] chains across the interface of two adjoining components.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 12. This means that, when two rubber components come into contact, the rubber molecules within each component begin to migrate across the physical boundary between them. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 12-14. This process \"causes the interface between the two components to in effect disappear,\" thereby binding them together. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 12-13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The second process, sulphur cross linking, further strengthens the bonds between components.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 12-13. During tire production, sulphur is typically added to the rubber used to create the tire's components.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 11-12. Once these components are assembled, they are subjected to heat and pressure over time, which causes the sulphur to form molecular \"bridges\" or cross links between the rubber molecule chains.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 11-13. If there is sufficient interdiffusion and cross linking, the rubber components of a tire should be \"indistinguishable.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 12-13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    There are, however, factors that can limit the component adhesion created by these processes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 14-15, 19-20. For example, it is possible that the surface of a compound can be become contaminated. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 14. If it does, interdiffusion will be inhibited at the contamination site, \"given the extremely small lengths of the chains crossing the interface.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 14. Likewise, after sulphur has been added to the rubber, but before the rubber components come into contact with one another, cross links will begin forming\n    <em>\n     within\n    </em>\n    each component.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 13, 19-20. If too many appear, this premature cross linking will reduce interdiffusion \"because the cross-linked polymer chains are far less mobile and therefore less able to move across the interface.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20. It also reduces the extent to which further cross linking can occur\n    <em>\n     between\n    </em>\n    components \"because some of the sulphur molecules at the surface have been consumed.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20. The susceptibility of rubber components to these and other issues that reduce bond strength results in a definite \"shelf life\" of pre-assembly components.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Southwell asserts that there was \"incomplete interdiffusion and component adhesion\" in the subject tire. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20. He concludes that this is because \"[t]he subject tire displays multiple areas of liner imprint.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Southwell's \"liner imprint\" conclusion is based on the fact that rubber tire materials are often initially covered by a liner to guard against layers of the same compound adhering to each other \"and to reduce the possibility of contamination.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 18. When this liner is removed, it can create a visible \"impression\" on the rubber. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 19. After tire production is complete, this \"residual liner impression is normally obliterated as the adjacent components are chemically bonded.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 19. Where there has been \"a lack of complete interdiffusion and cross-linking across the interfaces,\" however, the liner imprint may remain.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 19-20. Thus, Southwell concludes, \"pervasive liner imprint in a finished tire is clear evidence of compromised component bonding that is highly likely to result in mechanical separation of the components when in service.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Southwell's second theory is that the subject tire permitted too much air to permeate its components and therefore prematurely oxidized, thereby causing the tire to become brittle and weak. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23, 25, 38-39. In general, exposure of a tire's rubber components \"to oxygen in sufficient concentration will, with time, [cause them to] undergo changes ... that impact their physical and mechanical properties\" and \"inevitably reduce the overall durability of [the] tire, making it susceptible to component separation.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 21. Internal components of a tire can come into contact with oxygen when air permeates through the \"inner liner,\" which is situated between these components and a tire's \"inner cavity.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Southwell opines that, here, the inner liner was too thin to prevent excessive oxidation. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22-23, 25, 38-39. Specifically, he asserts that the subject tire's inner liner varied from \"1.6mm to 2.2mm, with an average of 1.8mm\" and that \"an average inner liner gauge of 1.8mm in a truck or bus tire is-regardless of compound-highly inadequate.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22. He also maintains that the subject's tire's inner liner gauge was below Defendants' own specifications and that \"Hankook can provide no confirmation that they were regularly checking the inner liner gauge of cured tires.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Southwell concludes, moreover, that \"the subject tire exhibits clear signs of oxidation.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23. This conclusion is based on his tactile and visual inspection of the subject tire's physical properties. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23; Defs.' Br. Ex. E 95-98.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Southwell's Other Testimony\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Southwell also opines on several other relevant matters.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    First, Southwell considers and dismisses alternative explanations for the subject tire's failure. Specifically, he evaluates the chronological age of the subject tire, its load, inflation pressure, and speed, whether the subject tire was appropriate for the purposes for which it was used, whether there were cuts to the subject tire that could have led to its failure, whether an impact to the subject tire could have resulted in its failure, and whether the subject tire suffered from \"compression set,\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \"the tendency of the material to fail to return entirely to its original size following a period of sustained compression.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 25-29. In addition, Southwell concludes that service conditions did not\n    contribute to the failure. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 25-26, 29, 38. Finally, he bolsters his defect findings and undermines alternative explanations by pointing to \"detachment textures\" in the subject tire,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , polished areas indicative of long-term component separation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Second, Southwell testifies to the sufficiency of Defendants' quality testing procedures. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 30-36. This opinion involves several subparts. He first asserts that Defendants' own technical standards suggest awareness \"of the importance of limiting the age of unassembled components in order to minimise the probability of producing a tire with poor adhesion.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 30. However, he claims that Defendants \"have been unable to provide production records to confirm that they actually had in place processes to detect and track compliance\" with these standards. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 30. He believes that such records \"would in fact be kept for a period well in excess of the possible operating life of the tires ... and [is] therefore surprised that they could not be produced.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Another subpart contends that Defendants' quality testing regime in general was insufficient. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 30-31. He reviews results of Defendants' testing and concludes that these results \"can in no way be represented to indicate the manufactured durability level of the subject tire.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 30-31. He observes that the \"manufacturers with whom [he has] worked\" employed more rigorous practices, and he determines that had Defendants adopted a \"more stringent\" testing program, \"it would have been far more likely than not that the defects in the subject tire would have been detected.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 31.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    A third subpart evaluates Defendants' reliance on \"indoor test wheel durability testing.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 31-34. Southwell explains that regulations require durability testing but that the tests they require are useful for examining \"design durability\" or \"manufactured short-term durability,\" not \"long term structural integrity.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 32-34. He asserts that, during his time in the industry, tire production lots that had \"easily passed the legislated minimum requirement\" contained a \"significant portion of tires\" that \"failed in service,\" and he claims that several tires have been recalled despite passing the required tests. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 33-34. Furthermore, he notes that the manufacturers with whom he has worked never \"relied solely on these tests as an indicator of market suitability.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 33. He maintains that Defendants \"relied solely on wheel test data\" and that \"if more thorough, longitudinal monitoring processes were in place, and the results used appropriately, (a) the [test] data would have been retained, and (b) it is far more likely than not that the defects in the subject tire would have been avoided.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 34.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    A fourth subpart claims that Defendants did not test enough tires to ensure statistical effectiveness. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 35-36. He asserts that the size of a production run only has a small impact on the number of tires that must be tested to detect durability problems. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 35. He observes that the 425/65 R22.5 TH08 seems to have been a low volume product, based on the North American sales data provided by Defendants.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 35-36. Accordingly, he indicates that a fairly large proportion would need to be evaluated for testing to be statistically sufficient to find defects.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 35-36. He then performs an illustrative statistical analysis, relying on the sales data, to demonstrate his conclusion (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , assuming a 5% proportion of defective tires, a sample of 70 out of 1325 tires\n    would need to be tested \"to achieve results that are accurate to within 5%,\" and reducing the sample to just 2 tires would create results only \"accurate to within 24%\").\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 36. After reviewing the testing-related information shared by Defendants, he concludes that Defendants' testing regime \"was highly unlikely to be effective in detecting either of the manufacturing defects\" at issue here, as they \"simply did not test samples from their production often enough.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 30-31, 36.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Southwell's Other Documents\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In addition to his report and deposition testimony, Southwell has submitted two other documents worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    First, Southwell authored a rebuttal report, which responds to the opinion of Defendants' expert Joseph Grant. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. AA 1-9. In response to Grant, Southwell further substantiates his own opinions and offers commentary on the articles upon which Grant relies. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. AA 4-16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Second, Southwell executed a declaration on November 5, 2017 that largely responds to Defendants' arguments in support of the motion to exclude his testimony.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. T. It contains a fair amount of new information, such as details about Southwell's work experience and qualifications as well as a tire study conducted at Bridgestone.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. T 1-12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Southwell's Qualifications\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Southwell has spent several decades in the business of inspecting, studying, analyzing, and recommending improvements to tires.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 4-5, 77-79. For example, he worked for Bridgestone Australia from 1987 to 1999 and, while there, \"[t]est[ed] new and revised truck tire designs,\" \"[i]nspect[ed] hundreds of tires each year to determine reasons for removal [and] propose and implement countermeasures,\" \"[c]onduct[ed] and analyse[d] large-scale longitudinal surveys of truck tires,\" \"contribute[d] to the design of new truck tires,\" \"[p]rovide[d] training and advice on truck tire inspection and maintenance practices,\" had \"responsibility for all Bridgestone tire technical matters within SA/NT,\" served as \"Director of the Tire and Rim Association of Australia,\" which \"formulates and publishes engineering standards for the design, manufacture and fitment of [tires],\" \"prepare[d] compound and construction specifications for new and revised products,\" \"plan[ned] and manage[d] new product development programmes,\" and \"design[ed] and conduct[ed] extensive field trials to assess/confirm suitability of new products and/or specification changes,\" among other things. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 4-5, 77-79.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    After leaving Bridgestone, Southwell served as the proprietor of \"The Tyreman\" from 1999 to 2000. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 5, 77. In this position, he sold truck tires, provided \"inspection and maintenance services,\" and acted as an \"[i]ndependent consultant to transport and tire industry bodies on a range of tire quality and maintenance matters.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    From 2001 to 2004, Southwell worked as Technical Manager for Bridgestone Corporation of Japan. There, he implemented in various regions \"the tire technical service procedures [he] developed\" previously and trained \"Bridgestone and other staff\" from various regions on,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , \"tire design, development and production processes,\" \"production quality systems,\" \"tire materials,\" \"assessment of tire designs for market suitability,\" \"international regulations, design standards &amp; test methods,\" and \"tire performance monitoring and measurement.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 5, 77.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Southwell next worked as New Product Manager for South Pacific Tires, a \"[m]anufacturer\n    of Goodyear, Dunlop and related brands,\" from 2004 to 2005. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 77. In this role, he had \"[r]esponsibility for new product design and development processes,\" \"[m]anag[ed] indoor and outdoor tire test activities,\" \"[r]ecommend[ed] and implement[ed] construction and compound specifications,\" and \"[e]nsur[ed] product compliance with all necessary legislative requirements.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 77.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Lastly, from 2005 to the present, Southwell has served as an \"[i]ndependent tire industry consultant and failure analyst,\" providing services to \"manufacturers, importers, Government and industry bodies, lawyers, insurers etc.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Southwell additionally possesses a variety of relevant educational credentials. For example, he studied at \"Firestone University,\" where he learned about \"[t]ire design factors,\" \"[p]erformance measurement and analysis,\" \"[c]onstruction,\" \"[c]ompounding,\" etc. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 76. Likewise, he received training from the Stahlgruber Foundation in,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , \"[r]epair failure analysis\" and \"[d]amage and failure modes.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex.

Br. 17-20. This argument fails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    As an initial matter, the Court adopts the following analytical framework. Given that\n    <em>\n     Nease\n    </em>\n    advises that the\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    factors should be considered in products liability cases,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nease\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277341\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/219/#p229\">\n     848 F.3d at 231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the Court first discusses these factors. Given the \"experiential witness\" test,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wilson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734986\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/267/#p274\">\n     484 F.3d at 274\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and the fact that the relevant authorities indicate that \"the test of reliability is 'flexible,' \"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kumho\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/\">\n     526 U.S. at 141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/\">\n     119 S.Ct. 1167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nease\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277341\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/219/#p229\">\n     848 F.3d at 232\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the Court then explores additional considerations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The first\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    factor, testing, favors Benedict. It is true that Southwell cannot identify any\n    <em>\n     public\n    </em>\n    testing of his theory or recall having documentation of testing he conducted. Defs.' Br. Ex. E 80-82. However, it is apparent from the record that testing of this theory\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    performed at Bridgestone during Southwell's tenure. Defs.' Br. Ex. E 81-87;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. AA 5. This testing, furthermore, followed an \"investigation process involving cutting up multiple tires ... cutting up recent production tires, doing some wheel durability testing, doing pull testing, [and] investigating a whole range of variables in the production plant,\" and it showed that \"liner imprint was visible in the great majority of\" tires analyzed that had component separations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. Ex. E 82-85. Southwell can knowledgeably rely on this testing, moreover, given that he was one of five or six people associated with it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. Ex. E 85. And the liner pattern theory was, according to Southwell, part of a training course that he taught at Bridgestone,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. Ex. E 87, and use in a training course is an indicator of reliability.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Finally, although Southwell does not provide documentation of the Bridgestone testing, this is a matter that goes to the weight of Southwell's testimony, not its reliability.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.'

On one hand, there are very few citations in the section of Southwell's report discussing the role of liner imprints in evaluating adhesion problems.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex.

E 80-81.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    On the other hand, however, Southwell's report includes many published academic and industry sources to substantiate the conceptual bases of the liner imprint theory. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 15-16, 19-20. Nothing in\n    <em>\n     Mendez\n    </em>\n    , moreover, is controlling here. Furthermore, the\n    <em>\n     Mendez\n    </em>\n    decision notwithstanding, Southwell offers additional, less inferential support for his liner imprint theory in his rebuttal report, including a source that, according to Southwell, is relied upon by Defendants' tire expert.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. AA 5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In short, this factor does not support admission of Southwell's testimony but neither is it fatal to it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The third factor, the error rate and standards for controlling the technique, favors Benedict. Defendants are correct that Southwell does not quantify how much liner pattern visibility is necessary to be \"pervasive,\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \"highly likely to result in mechanical separation.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 18; Defs.' Br. Ex. E 79-80. Rather, to him, pervasive means \"widespread.\" Defs.' Br. Ex. E 79.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Nevertheless, Southwell's testimony does contain sufficient detail to satisfy this factor. For example, he explains that \"three or four fingernail-sized areas of liner imprint distributed around a tire\" would likely not be problematic but that he would be \"concerned\" if he saw more liner imprint. Defs.' Br. Ex. E 78-79;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20 (\"Small areas of poorly bonded interfaces rarely present problems in the finished tire.\"). He also adds explanation to his \"pervasive\" and \"widespread\" terminology, stating that \"an isolated area [\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , a non-pervasive area, of liner imprint], by its nature, is significantly displaced from other areas.\" Defs.' Br. Ex. E 80. Here, these principles not only guide Southwell's technique, but they also teach that the potential for error is quite low. This is because Southwell has identified numerous liner pattern marks throughout the subject tire at the precise layer where he posits \"the catastrophic failure commenced.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 8, 17, 40-42.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In addition, Southwell acknowledges that there are circumstances in which his theory offers less accurate results. Specifically, he recognizes that pervasive liner imprint marks might not coincide with a tire failure where \"a tire is used in a far less demanding operation,\" such as \"if the subject tire had been fitted to a crane ... where the speed is very low or ... the mileage is very low.\" Defs.' Br. Ex. E 79. He also notes that the probability of a failure occurring \"is dependent on a number of factors, including the degree to which the bond is compromised, the relative area of the compromised bond, and the service conditions of the tire.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 20. Again, these statements teach that the potential for error here is likely low (in addition to providing useful guidance for applying his technique), for two reasons. First, the subject tire\n    <em>\n     did not\n    </em>\n    face abnormally mild service conditions\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    but rather had \"covered approximately 10,000 miles\" in the 7 months before the accident and had a tread depth roughly 53% worn. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 6, 8. Second, the compromised bond area appears large, given the extent of liner imprint detected.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 17, 20, 40-42.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    On this record, it is clear that, although Southwell's theory may not be as error tested as Defendants would like, it is guided by specific standards and does not seem prone to an impermissibly high rate of error. This factor hence counsels in favor of admission.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The final factor, general acceptance, also tends to support Benedict. On one hand, as noted above, little publicly available research on the liner pattern theory has been cited. Further, Defendants offer sources that, at minimum, suggest a lack of undisputed acceptance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 17-18; Defs.' Br. Ex. J1 (\"The appearance of ... liner marks has been and continues to be an issue of contention in the realm of forensic tire analysis.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    PI.'s Opp'n Ex. AA 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    On the other hand, theories similar to Southwell's have been presented in other tire defect cases, indicating fairly common acceptance, having been subject to the rigors of litigation.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

Inner Liner Gauge and Oxidation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Defendants also argue that Southwell's opinion that the inner liner gauge was too thin to prevent oxidation is unreliable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 20-21. Its contentions are unavailing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The first\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    factor, testing, favors Benedict. Defendants are correct that Southwell has not performed testing of the subject tire or measured the extent of oxidation degradation he detected other than through physical inspection.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 20-21; Defs.' Br. Ex. E 96-97; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23. And they are likewise correct that he has not measured expected oxidation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 20-21; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23. That does not mean, however, that Southwell's theory\n    <em>\n     cannot\n    </em>\n    be, or\n    <em>\n     has never\n    </em>\n    been, tested.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Southwell's inner liner gauge theory has been tested and is eminently testable. Southwell provides a specific numerical measurement for when an inner liner is too thin to prevent excessive air permeation, supported by his own industry experience and academic research. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22; Defs.' Br. Ex. E 120-22. He details, moreover, how, where, and how frequently he measured the inner liner in the subject tire to determine that this inner liner was inadequate. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. U 101-09. He also highlights Defendants' inner liner specification documents, which teach, at minimum, that the proper inner liner gauge has been researched and could be tested.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22. This point is corroborated, furthermore, by Defendants' own corporate designee, who agrees that the possibility of air permeation into a tire \"would of course go up\" if the inner liner were too thin.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. D 155-56. Finally, Southwell cites tire recalls where the defect was \"insufficient tire liner gauge,\" which again supports the view that the appropriate liner gauge has been and could be tested.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Southwell's opinion that oxidation contributed to the subject tire's failure and that he could detect this oxidation by way of physical inspection is also testable and has been tested. Southwell explains, for instance, that \"experienced tire inspectors who have had sufficient exposure to relevant product development programmes are often able to detect subtle signs of oxidation,\" which shows that the methodology of physical inspection has been tested and that other experts could evaluate Southwell's conclusions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. Ex. E 95-97. This point is confirmed by\n    <em>\n     Cone\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Stallings v. Michelin Americas Research &amp; Development Corp.\n    </em>\n    , in which courts admitted expert evidence of oxidation based on physical inspection.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cone\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20238448\">\n     2017 WL 238448\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7-8 ;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <em>\n     Stallings v.

Ga. Mar. 12, 2010). Southwell also cites multiple sources in support of the proposition that oxidation increases the likelihood of tire failure and changes the\n    <em>\n     physical\n    </em>\n    characteristics of rubber, thereby indicating that the effects of oxidation on rubber have been extensively examined and that using a physical inspection to detect these effects is feasible and testable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22-23. Finally, Southwell describes precisely the characteristics he observes in the subject tire that evince oxidation and provides inspection notes detailing where in the subject tire he finds these characteristics; thus, other analysts could easily scrutinize his results.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23, 25, 38-42; Defs.' Br. Ex. E 97-98.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The second factor, peer review and publication, also supports Benedict. Southwell proffers many published sources discussing the physical effects of oxidation on rubber and tires and the impact of inner liner gauge on air permeability. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 21-23. Given Southwell's citations to these materials, his theory and methodology seem reasonable and supported by the literature.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The third factor, the relevant error rate and standards governing the technique, is neutral or slightly favors Benedict. Defendants are correct that Southwell has not measured the oxidation degradation in the subject tire, notwithstanding the fact that there are ways of quantifying oxidation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 20-21; Defs.' Br. Ex. E 96-97; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23. More importantly, Southwell provides little information as to the amount of oxidation required to reflect a likelihood of tire failure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 21-23, 25, 38-39. Rather, he simply observes that the subject tire \"exhibits clear signs of oxidation\" and then concludes that oxidation was a cause of its failure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 23, 25, 38-39.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Nevertheless, Southwell does offer specifics that guide his technique and demonstrate a low likelihood of error here. First, he establishes a minimum inner liner width that is sufficient to ensure adequate impermeability, and he indicates that the average measurement in the subject tire fell below both this minimum and Defendants' specifications. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. U 107-08, 121. Second, he describes the physical characteristics that are reflective of oxidation, and he detects these characteristics at many locations in the subject tire and specifically at the layer where he believes the failure occurred.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 8, 23, 25, 38-42. Third, Southwell acknowledges that \"ambient temperature,\" \"[i]nflation pressure,\" and \"operating temperature\" can affect the degree of oxidation, but he explains why these factors actually support his findings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. Ex. E 99; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 25-26; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. AA 9.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    In sum, Southwell's theory is not devoid of specifics or likely to have an exceedingly high rate of error as applied here. This factor is thus largely neutral or slightly in Benedict's favor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The fourth factor, general acceptance, favors Benedict. It is true that the proper inner liner gauge and how it should be measured are disputed.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 10-11, 11 n.2, 20,\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n 18-19. This point notwithstanding, Southwell cites many sources to substantiate the various facets of his theory. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 21-23. Furthermore, he makes it clear that his general theory is well understood by the industry and that experienced tire inspectors are \"often\" able to detect oxidation by physical inspection.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 21-23; Defs.' Br. Ex. E 120-22. His suggestion as to the general acceptance of his methodology is corroborated, moreover, by Defendants' own expert, who has asserted that physical inspection is the\n    accepted method of determining the cause of a tire failure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. Y 171-73, 189-90. Finally, as noted above, the\n    <em>\n     Cone\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Stallings\n    </em>\n    courts admitted testimony of experts who analyzed oxidation by physical inspection, further indicating that Southwell's theory and methodology are common.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cone\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20238448\">\n     2017 WL 238448\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7-8 ;\n    <em>\n     Stallings\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20966865\">\n     2010 WL 966865\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4.

These decisions further counsel in favor of admission.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    In sum, Southwell's inner liner and oxidation opinion is sufficiently reliable to be admitted.

Testing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Defendants also challenge Southwell's opinion about Defendants' testing regime. This challenge is unsuccessful.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    As an initial matter, nothing in Federal Rule of Evidence 702 indicates that Southwell cannot testify as to this issue. His testing opinion, even more than his liner imprint and oxidation analyses, is an \"experiential opinion,\" given that testimony by a tire industry participant about the types of testing utilized in the industry and the effectiveness of different testing regimes is inherently based on experience. And the\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    factors are not especially useful for determining the reliability of such an opinion.

C 4-5, 77-79. And, moreover, he describes in detail, based on his direct experience with\n    and knowledge of different forms of testing as well as the information he was provided by Defendants and other sources, why Defendants' testing practices were insufficient to detect and prevent the alleged defects in the subject tire.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex.

E 143-44.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Defendants' primary argument as to why Southwell's testing opinion should be excluded rests on products liability law. Specifically, they claim that this body of law would reject Southwell's \"industry standards\" opinion because Defendants complied with federal standards and because his testimony is based only on experience with two manufacturers. Defs.' Br. 23-26.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Products liability law, however, does not necessitate excluding Southwell's testimony. First, to establish liability for an allegedly defective product, a plaintiff need only show a violation of \"(1) a government standard, (2) an industry standard, or (3) the reasonable expectations of consumers.\"\n    <em>\n     Norris v.

Defendants' alleged compliance with a government standard, therefore, does not, as discussed further in the Court's opinion denying Defendants' motion for summary judgment, insulate them from expert scrutiny. (ECF No. 343).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Second, the cases Defendants cite do not\n    <em>\n     require\n    </em>\n    exclusion of Southwell's otherwise admissible testimony. In\n    <em>\n     Norris\n    </em>\n    , the court held that that expert testimony\n    <em>\n     could not defeat summary judgment\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Norris\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196560\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/742/#p747\">\n     139 F.Supp.3d at 754\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

It is true that the court affirmed the district court's exercise of discretion in excluding\n    <em>\n     a competitor's ladder\n    </em>\n    (and testimony about it) as evidence of an industry-wide standard.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513810\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/417/#p422\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513810\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/417/#p422\">\n     at 421-22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But this case is in no way analogous.

Document Retention\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Defendants assert that Southwell is not permitted to draw adverse inferences from the fact that Defendants did not retain documents relating to the subject tire.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Br. 23; Defs.' Reply Br. 13-14. Defendants' arguments are largely correct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Numerous statements by Southwell suggest that he reached certain conclusions based on the fact that Defendants could not produce or did not retain documents.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pl.'s Opp'n Ex.

He mentions that he is not familiar with tire companies' document retention policies as a general matter and that he was not even aware of whether there was one when he worked at Bridgestone. Defs.' Br. Ex. E 141. He does note that he is familiar with the Bridgestone and South Pacific Tires policies. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. U 137-38. However, familiarity is not expertise.

C 4-5, 76-79.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Furthermore, whether an adverse inference is appropriate is governed by specific legal standards.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Silvestri v.

Consequently, any adverse inferences drawn by Southwell are improper and thus excluded.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    There is one caveat, however. Southwell\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    discuss the absence of documents from Defendants to the extent that he is explaining that he has received no information from Defendants on a certain topic. He is permitted, therefore, to rely on the documents he has been given, acknowledge when these documents do not contradict his theories, and highlight where the available evidence runs out.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 22 (\"Hankook can provide no confirmation that they were regularly checking the inner liner gauge ....\"). He is not authorized, however, to imply that Defendants\n    <em>\n     should have\n    </em>\n    kept these records or\n    <em>\n     would have\n    </em>\n    done so had they adopted certain practices (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , more rigorous testing procedures).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    In sum, any true adverse inferences are excluded. Defendants' motion was, accordingly, granted to that limited extent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    <strong>\n     E. Alternative Explanations\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Defendants argue that Southwell's testimony should also be rejected because he does not consider alternative explanations for the subject tire's failure. Specifically, they assert that Southwell has not sufficiently addressed impact damage, tire cuts, tire age and service conditions, or why the defect caused a failure \"nearly nine years and thousands of miles\" after production. Defs.' Br. 21-22, 26-29. These arguments are meritless because Southwell\n    does evaluate each of those issues. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 7-8, 24-29, 38-39; Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. AA 5-7. To the extent that Defendants deem Southwell's analysis of these alternative explanations inadequate, they may cross-examine him or introduce contradictory evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Defendants' motion was thus denied as to this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    <strong>\n     F. Tire Manufacturing Standard of Care\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Defendants' final argument is that Southwell has not offered and is unqualified to provide an opinion on the tire manufacturing standard of care. Defs.' Br. 29-30.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    They claim that: (1) Southwell never states a standard of care in his report; and (2) Southwell is unqualified because he has never been to a Hankook plant and has limited experience in manufacturing tires and the tire industry generally. Defs.' Br. 29-30. Defendants' contentions here are unpersuasive and, indeed, border on frivolous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    First, the question of whether a party has presented adequate evidence of a standard of care goes to whether summary judgment is proper, not whether that party's expert should be excluded. Southwell's testimony, moreover, is sufficient under the governing legal standards to defeat summary judgment. (ECF No. 343).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Second, it is patently clear that Southwell is qualified to testify as to the manufacturing standard of care. He has spent several decades in the tire manufacturing industry and has worked at multiple prominent tire manufacturers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 4-5, 77-79. Furthermore, as detailed above, he has extensive experience in tire production, design, testing, quality assurance, and failure analysis, and he has spent his entire career determining how manufacturers can prevent tires from failing, why tires fail when they do, and how to correct defects once they have been uncovered.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. C 4-5, 76-79. Indeed, it is hard to imagine an expert more qualified to testify to the tire manufacturing standard of care.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Defendants' proffered authorities are not to the contrary because they all involved testimony about issues substantially attenuated from the expert's area of proficiency. In\n    <em>\n     Garlinger v. Hardee's Food Systems\n    </em>\n    , a thermodynamics expert was deemed unqualified to offer an opinion as to the reasonableness of serving coffee at a particular temperature because \"he possesses no knowledge or experience in the food or beverage industry.\"\n    <em>\n     Garlinger v.

Likewise, in\n    <em>\n     Anderson v. National Railroad Passenger Corp.\n    </em>\n    , the court rejected experts who were \"eminently qualified in a number of railroad related areas\" but had no experience related to railroad dispatch systems.\n    <em>\n     Anderson v.

Va. 1994). And in\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    , this Court rejected the expert testimony of a nuclear engineer who had no previous experience \"in the fields of ballistics, trajectory analysis, or crime scene\n    reconstruction.\"\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205092715\">\n     2014 WL 5092715\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9. Defendants cannot reasonably claim that Southwell's relationship to the tire manufacturing standard of care is comparable to a nuclear engineer's relationship to crime scene analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    In sum, Defendants' arguments as to the standard of care issue are unpersuasive, and the Court therefore denied their motion as to this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <strong>\n     V.

Moreover, although Southwell's analysis relies on certain assumptions, it appears to be merely an illustrative exercise in support of his broader points that a large proportion of 425/65 R22.5 TH08 tires would need to be tested to detect defects and that, based on Defendants' testing information and his experience and understanding of the industry, Defendants' testing regime was insufficient to catch the defects alleged here.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Pl.'s Opp'n Ex.
