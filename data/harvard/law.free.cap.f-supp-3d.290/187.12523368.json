(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff alleges that the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, Inc. (\"NYSPHSAA\") and Section IV of the New York Public High School Athletic Association, Inc. (\"Section IV\") unlawfully denied him extended athletic eligibility to play a fifth consecutive year of high school basketball in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012132\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"ADA\"), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section 504\").

Specifically, Plaintiff contends that NYSPHSAA and Section IV discriminated against him because of his disabilities by refusing to provide him with a reasonable accommodation permitting his participation in interscholastic basketball during his fifth and final year of high school. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). On August 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which Plaintiff joined Maryellen Elia, in her official capacity as Commissioner of Education of the State of New York (the \"Commissioner\"), with NYSPHSAA and Section IV, as a defendant in this action (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Dkt. 19). While Plaintiff further elaborates upon his factual allegations in the amended complaint, the nature of those allegations remains largely unchanged. However, Plaintiff now requests that the Court order the Commissioner to \"promptly promulgate an emergency regulation by which students with disabilities who, because of their disabilities, must attend high school for more than four years may request extended athletic eligibility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 38), and the Commissioner's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 46).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, both motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a high school senior who resides in Horseheads, New York, and attends Horseheads High School. (Dkt. 19 at 2, 4). Plaintiff suffers from various health issues, including \"chronic complex migraine headaches\"; \"patent foramen ovale,\" which is \"a small hole in the heart\"; Factor V Leiden, which is a \"blood clotting disorder\"; and POTS, which \"creates chronic difficulty standing upright due to\n   lightheadedness and other symptoms associated with reduced blood flow to the brain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). These disabilities prevent Plaintiff from carrying a full high school course load. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). As a result, on July 18, 2016, Plaintiff received notification that he would not progress to the 12th grade, and that he would not graduate in June 2017, as originally planned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff entered the 9th grade at Horseheads High School in September 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Although Plaintiff's disabilities limited the frequency in which he participated in competitive interscholastic basketball, Plaintiff has, in fact, entered competition for each year since September 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-39). Despite having participated in high school basketball for four consecutive seasons, Plaintiff sought extended athletic eligibility to participate in varsity basketball during his fifth and final year of high school. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    at \u00b6 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 15, 2016, the Horseheads Central School District (the \"District\") submitted an application for extended athletic eligibility to Section IV on Plaintiff's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53). Section IV did not consider this application because, at the time, Plaintiff had not yet completed four years of high school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54). Subsequently, Plaintiff requested that he receive a \"reasonable modification under the ADA,\" permitting extended eligibility for basketball, a contact sport, because no such exception currently exists for students who must attend more than four years of high school due to a disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-59). Plaintiff has yet to receive a response to this request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 24, 2017, the District submitted a second application to Section IV, which included a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA on Plaintiff's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   <em>\n    \u00b6\n   </em>\n   61). On July 20, 2017, Section IV denied this application without mentioning the requested reasonable accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63). On August 7, 2017, Bert Conklin, the District's Athletic Director, appealed Section IV's decision on Plaintiff's behalf, and requested that Plaintiff receive a reasonable accommodation under the athletic eligibility rules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38-3 at 8-9 (Conklin's affidavit)). On August 14, 2017, Section IV's Appeals Committee affirmed the initial decision without mentioning the request for a reasonable accommodation. (Dkt. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 65-66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are all public entities for purposes of the ADA (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 77-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and that they each receive \"federal financial assistance\" for purposes of Section 504 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88). Plaintiff further alleges that his requested extension of athletic eligibility constitutes a reasonable modification under the ADA and does not frustrate the purposes of the four-year athletic eligibility standard (hereinafter, the \"Duration of Competition Rule\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82, 90). Plaintiff claims that Defendants have discriminated against him because of his disabilities by refusing to grant a reasonable modification in violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 83, 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requesting the Court enjoin Defendants from denying him extended athletic eligibility for the 2017-18 Section IV High School Boys Varsity Basketball Season. (Dkt. 38 at 4). Plaintiff also filed a motion to expedite a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. (Dkt. 39). On October 16, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion to expedite, and set a briefing schedule and an oral argument date. (Dkt. 43). On October 24, 2017, the Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the amended\n   complaint, arguing that Plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, that the abstention doctrine strips this Court of subject matter jurisdiction, and that the Commissioner enjoys legislative immunity against Plaintiff's request for an emergency regulation. (Dkt. 46-1). All Defendants have submitted papers in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 47; Dkt. 48; Dkt. 49; Dkt. 50), and Plaintiff has opposed the Commissioner's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 52). On November 17, 2017, the Court held oral argument, and reserved decision on both motions.

The Commissioner's Reliance on the Formal Legal Requirements of the Duration of Competition Rule is Misplaced\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Commissioner first argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege that he is a \"qualified individual with a disability\" because Plaintiff indisputably does not satisfy the four-year limitation within the Duration of Competition Rule. (Dkt. 46-1 at 6-9). However, this argument presupposes that the Duration of Competition Rule is not just a prerequisite for athletic eligibility, but is an \"\n   <em>\n    essential\n   </em>\n   eligibility requirement\" for competition. In response, Plaintiff argues that the Commissioner's position is contrary to the holding and rationale in\n   <em>\n    Mary Jo C.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 52 at 9-11). Given the procedural posture in which these arguments are presented, the Court is inclined to agree with Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mary Jo\n   </em>\n   C., the plaintiff alleged that she suffered from a mental illness that caused her to miss a filing deadline to apply for disability retirement benefits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3535779\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/144/#p157\">\n    707 F.3d at 149-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the Duration of Competition Rule is \"Essential\" Requires Resolution of Factual Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At oral argument, the Commissioner posited that this Court could determine whether the Duration of Competition Rule is an \"essential eligibility requirement\" based upon the allegations in the amended complaint and without resolving factual issues. The Court notes that while there may be some instances where the \"essential\" nature of an eligibility requirement can be discerned as a matter of law, \"the essentialness of an eligibility requirement generally need[s] a fact-specific inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Castellano,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7653834\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/946/249/#p253\">\n    946 F.Supp. at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As discussed above, a requested accommodation will not be deemed \"reasonable\" if it would \"impose an 'undue hardship' on the operation of [the] program, or 'fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dean,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357453\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/178/#p187\">\n    804 F.3d at 186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

At oral argument, the Commissioner posited that the Duration of Competition Rule's waiver provisions constitute a built-in mechanism for the appropriate provision of requested \"reasonable accommodations,\" and that this remedy is sufficient to satisfy the modification provisions of the ADA and Section 504. This argument does not withstand this Court's review. Indeed, as the Second Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Mary Jo C\n   </em>\n   ., \"perhaps most fundamentally, reading 'essential eligibility requirements' to mean all formal legal eligibility requirements seems ... to run counter to the ADA's broad remedial purpose by allowing states to insist that whatever legal requirements they may set are never subject to reasonable modification under Title II of the ADA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3535779\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/144/#p157\">\n    707 F.3d at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, the Court rejects the Commissioner's argument that Plaintiff's failure to satisfy the Duration of Competition Rule prevents Plaintiff from plausibly alleging his status as a \"qualified individual with a disability.\" As such, whether or not the Duration of Competition Rule is \"essential\" to the operation of interscholastic high school sports programs in this State is not appropriately decided on this motion. Likewise, the Commissioner's assertion that the requested waiver of the Duration of Competition Rule would create a fundamental alteration to the nature of interscholastic high school sports competitions is also premature. Indeed, in their papers and at oral argument, the parties themselves dispute the administrative hardship that would befall Defendants should a waiver be permitted.

In other words, the application of the Duration of Competition Rule would lead to the same result had one of Plaintiff's non-disabled peers sought extended eligibility after participating in four consecutive seasons of basketball. Accordingly, Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request does not simply seek to secure the same opportunities as his non-disabled peers; rather, this request seeks an additional benefit over and beyond what is contemplated by the ADA and Section 504.

The Court finds both cases inapposite. Plaintiff relies upon\n   <em>\n    Teahan\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a generally applicable rule-such as the Duration of Competition Rule-does not obviate Defendants from their obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54 at 15-16).\n   <em>\n    Teahan\n   </em>\n   involved an employment termination based upon the plaintiff's \"absenteeism.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teahan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521628\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/511/\">\n    951 F.2d at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, although the adverse action was facially based on a neutral reason, the ultimate cause to that action was the disability itself and the general applicability of the rule was irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In the instant matter, Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence that the Duration of Competition Rule has not been neutrally applied in this case. As noted above, Plaintiff was denied extended athletic eligibility because he had already entered competition in high school basketball for at least four consecutive years. Plaintiff's ineligibility was not a result of his disability, it was due to the fact that he, like any other student, entered competition each and every year of his high school career-in spite of his alleged disabling impairments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiff also appears to suggest that an individual with a disability is entitled to preferential treatment over-and-above the benefits afforded to his peers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54 at 18). Although Plaintiff relies upon\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   in asserting this argument,\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiff's position.\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   indicates that \"preferences will sometimes prove necessary to achieve the [ADA]'s basic equal opportunity goal,\" but the Supreme Court carefully stated that reasonable accommodations are necessary so that \"those with disabilities [can] obtain the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   ... opportunities that those without disabilities automatically enjoy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 397,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The ADA mandates reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities in order to put them on an\n   <em>\n    even playing field\n   </em>\n   with the non-disabled; it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   authorize a preference for disabled people generally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Felix v.

To reiterate, under the Duration of Competition Rule, if a non-disabled student participated in four consecutive seasons of basketball, but was required to complete a fifth year of scholastics for whatever reason, that student would be equally ineligible to participate in varsity basketball during his fifth year of high school.

In addition, it appears inconsistent for Plaintiff to argue that the present waiver conditions represent a \"narrow exception\" and are \"rarely applicable\" (Dkt. 38-2 at 6; Dkt. 52 at 12), and simultaneously that the existence of these provisions \"strongly suggest\" that the Duration of Competition Rule is not an \"essential eligibility requirement\" (Dkt. 54 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Specifically, Plaintiff argues that he has only just turned 18 years old during this academic year, he has remained the same height and weight as he was during the previous season, his extended eligibility request is not an attempt at \"red shirting,\" he is not a safety risk, and he would not displace other student athletes as he would only take the position of an \"extra player\" on the basketball team.

That, of course, would have the potential of opening floodgates for waivers, while until now, there have been only a handful of cases deemed appropriate for waivers. Assessing one or two students pales in comparison to the task of assessing a large number of students; an increase in number will both increase the cost of making the assessments, as well as increase the importance of doing so correctly.\"). Such an outcome would impose an undue hardship upon the administration of interscholastic high school sports programs, and would threaten to fundamentally alter the nature of these competitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff argues that any such administrative burden would be minimal, and that NYSPHSAA already performs an \"individual analysis for students requesting use of special devices and prosthesis, religious accommodations, or other special accommodations.\" (Dkt. 54 at 22-23). However, such evaluations do not appear internally inconsistent with the stated purposes of the Duration of Competition Rule, in contrast to Plaintiff's approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Safety is of critical importance to the regulation in question. (Dkt. 48 at \u00b6 15). An individualized approach would require administrative findings upon the safety and physicality of each student applicant at the micro-level. The calculus would likely differ between one sport and another, depending upon the risks involved. Furthermore, administrators would be tasked with evaluating the specific height and weight differentials between the student applicant and the athlete pool. This review would have to account for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   athletes, including those in competing school districts. Although the Duration of Competition Rule's waiver provision appears to contemplate \"an assessment of the student's level of physical development and maturity,\" as well as a determination of whether the student's participation would \"present a safety or health concern,\" this inquiry pertains only to the safety and health of \"such student.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 NYCRR \u00a7 135.4(C)(7)(ii)(d)(1)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Noncontact sports may be absent certain risks to others, but the physicality of each student applicant compared to all other students on competing teams, as well as any attendant safety issues, would significantly weigh upon the effective administration of this program. The extent of the\n   inquiry requested by Plaintiff would be especially important in cases, such as this one, which pertain to contact sports and athletes that maintain above-average athletic skills.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7809276\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/913/663/#p669\">\n    913 F.Supp. at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the plaintiff \"is, without dispute, always the slowest swimmer in the pool\" and that \"[s]wimming is not a contact sport\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 48 at 4 (averring that Plaintiff was \"selectively classified\" for participation in basketball in the 8th grade because \"he was an exceptional athlete\"). This task would not only devolve into a calculation of inches and pounds, but would also likely entail a subjective orientation of the student's relative skill level, as Plaintiff asks this Court to do here. (Dkt. 38-2 at 13-15; Dkt. 54 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 55 at 1, 4-6, 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court finds that the significant variance of such considerations would likely place an \"undue hardship\" on Defendants' administration of the interscholastic high school sports program. Indeed, even Plaintiff's purported placement as an \"extra\" player requires additional inquiry. Jeff Limoncelli, the Head Coach of the varsity basketball team, averred that there is \"no limit to the number of players on the team\" (Dkt. 38-3 at 112), and that he \"plan[s]\" to keep a \"standard 12 player roster\" for the upcoming season, with Plaintiff \"added as a 13th player\" (Dkt. 55 at 32). However, Plaintiff, citing to NYSPHSAA's rules, indicates that a team can have no more than 16 players. (Dkt. 54 at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt 48 at \u00b6 45 (noting that the number of athletes on a team is limited)). Limoncelli does not indicate whether he generally maintains \"extra players\" in his roster, but it does appear that the potential for at least one additional \"extra player\" would be removed under the rules noted by Plaintiff himself. Whether this fact is material may be dependent upon the nature of the sport, the quality of the competitions, the coach's preferential rotation system, or any number of other variables.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff is not likely to succeed in establishing that the Duration of Competition Rule is not an \"essential eligibility requirement,\" and that the request to waive this requirement is a \"reasonable accommodation\" because it would impose an \"undue hardship on the operation\" of the interscholastic high school sports program, and would \"fundamentally alter [its] nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Dean,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357453\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/178/#p187\">\n    804 F.3d at 186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McPherson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199932\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/453/\">\n    119 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   461-62 ;\n   <em>\n    Lyon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20309205\">\n    2013 WL 309205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    Reaves,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"160958\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/904/120/\">\n    904 F.Supp. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Preemption Doctrine is Not Implicated by This Matter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Lastly, the Court will briefly address Plaintiff's suggestion that federal preemption is appropriate here. Plaintiff argues that \"[t]he Commissioner's eligibility regulation at issue here is at odds with the reasonable accommodation mandate of the ADA, as strict application of the regulation means that a student, like [himself], cannot have a fifth year of eligibility as an accommodation.\" (Dkt. 54 at 9). As a result, Plaintiff argues that this Court should determine that the Duration of Competition Rule is preempted by the ADA under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Court disagrees with this circular argument. As noted above, the ADA does not require public entities \"to provide a disabled individual with every accommodation he requests or the accommodation of his choice.\"\n   <em>\n    McElwee,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638628\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/635/#p641\">\n    700 F.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Requested accommodations that \"impose an 'undue hardship' on the operation of [a public entities'] program or fundamentally alter[ ] the nature of the service, program, or activity\" may be rejected without violating the ADA or Section 504.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dean,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357453\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/178/#p187\">\n    804 F.3d at 186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). To the extent that Plaintiff relies upon\n   <em>\n    Mary Jo C.\n   </em>\n   in asserting a separate preemption attack upon this regulation, the Court finds Plaintiff's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Mary Jo C.\n   </em>\n   to be incorrect.\n   <em>\n    Mary Jo C.\n   </em>\n   simply \"conclude[d] that the ADA's reasonable modification requirement contemplates modification to state laws, thereby permitting preemption of inconsistent state laws,\n   <em>\n    when necessary to effectuate Title II's reasonable modification provision\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 163 (emphasis added). Thus, preemption of inconsistent state laws is only warranted where the law would otherwise prevent the application of a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   accommodation. In other words, the ADA does not preempt state laws simply because an accommodation is denied as unreasonable; if the accommodation requested would impose an \"undue hardship\" or would \"fundamentally alter[ ] the nature of the service, program, or activity,\" the preemption doctrine is inapplicable. Here, because the Court determines that Plaintiff's requested accommodation-a waiver of what is likely an \"essential eligibility requirement\"-is not likely to be determined to be \"reasonable,\" any assertion of preemption is misdirected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a \"clear\" or \"substantial\" likelihood of success on the merits of this action, and thus, his motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's (Dkt. 46) motion to dismiss is denied, and Plaintiff's (Dkt. 38) motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    On November 17, 2017, by oral motion, Plaintiff sought leave to substitute himself as party plaintiff in this action because he had since reached the age of majority.

The next day, the Clerk of Court terminated K.M. from this action, and named Brewster Marshall as the new party plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    NYSPHSAA and Section IV have both answered the amended complaint.
