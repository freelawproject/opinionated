The Court referred this matter to the magistrate judge for an evidentiary hearing regarding the threshold question in this matter: whether Rojas requested Alicea to appeal. Rojas first claimed that he unequivocally instructed Alicea to file an appeal. (Civil Docket No. 1 Ex. 1 at p. 7.) Were this statement true, Alicea would\n   have acted unreasonably pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    528 U.S. at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rojas, however, retracted this allegation. Neither Alicea nor Rojas assert that Rojas directed Alicea to file a notice of appeal. (Civil Docket No. 31; Docket No. 32.) In the absence of an explicit request to file a notice of appeal, the Court must examine preliminarily whether Alicia possessed a duty to consult Rojas \"about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal, and making a reasonable effect to discover [Rojas's] wishes.\"\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    528 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

No Rational Defendant Would Wish to Appeal the Sentence Imposed on Rojas by this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   No reasonable defendant in Rojas's position would seek to file a notice of appeal. The R &amp; R provides an incomplete analysis of the section 2255 motion pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   . (Civil Docket No. 33 at p. 7.) Rojas's testimony at the evidentiary hearing predominates the magistrate's analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at pp. 7 &amp; 8. The factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   , however, should serve as the basis for determining whether a rational defendant would seek an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Every factor set forth in\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   reinforces the Court's denial of Rojas's section 2255 motion. Rojas's conviction resulted from a guilty plea, not a trial. (Criminal No. 15-718, Docket No. 35.) By pleading guilty, Rojas demonstrated a desire to conclude Criminal Case No. 15-718. Because Rojas relinquished his right to a trial, fewer issues remain susceptible to review on appeal. Moreover, Rojas received a sentence consistent with the plea agreement. Rojas has failed to identify non-frivolous grounds for an appeal. The Court disagrees with the magistrate judge's finding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Rojas may have a [sic] non-frivolous grounds to appeal his conviction because although he signed a plea agreement with a very broad waiver of his right to appeal, he may still be able to appeal the consecutive sentence and the lack of a downward departure as [the magistrate judge] could not find any First Circuit precedent directly addressing this issue based on the language of the Plea Agreement at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Civil Docket 33 at p. 12.) The \"lack of a downward departure\" and \"consecutive sentence\" are immaterial to the section 2255 motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Any challenge to the sentence that this Court imposed on Rojas is frivolous. Rojas received a 70-month sentence, which is the lowest sentence within the guideline range for a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of V. (Criminal Docket No. 26 at p. 3.) Rojas's negotiations with the United States resulted in a plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plea agreement explicitly identified 70 months as within the range of possible sentences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court imposed a sentence commensurate with the parties' recommendation for a \"sentence at the lower end of the applicable Guideline Sentencing Range.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rojas pled guilty with the understanding that the Court would determine the applicable criminal history category. Rojas and the United States concurred that Rojas could \"request\" and \"argue for\" a concurrent sentence and a downward departure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court considered Rojas's arguments regarding the concurrent sentence and downward departure requests, but retained the discretion to reject these arguments. A concurrent sentence and a downward departure were recommendations, not entitlements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Rojas \"received the sentence bargained for as part of the plea.\"\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    528 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The final\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   factor instructs the Court to determine whether the defendant waived his or her right to appeal. The plea agreement adopted by the United States and Rojas contained an expansive appeal waiver. The plea agreement and the Court's explanations of the appeal waiver at the change of plea hearing and at sentencing were unequivocal. Rojas waived the right to appeal contingent on a sentence rendered in accordance with the plea agreement. Rojas received a sentence congruent with the plea agreement. Consequently, the Court has no reason to disregard the appeal waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Notably, the circumstances of this case mirror a hypothetical situation presented by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   For example, suppose that a defendant consults with counsel; counsel advises the defendant that a guilty plea probably will lead to a 2 year sentence, the defendant expresses satisfaction and pleads guilty; the court sentences defendant to 2 year's imprisonment as expected and informs the defendant of his appeal rights the defendant does not express any interest in appealing, and counsel concludes that there are not non-frivolous grounds for appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    528 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this instance, the Supreme Court would refrain from finding that counsel's representation was deficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After considering the\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   factors in the context of\n   this case, the Court holds that no reasonable person would seek an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Rojas Possibly Showed an Interest in Filing a Notice of an Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Sufficient evidence exists, however, establishing the possibility that \"Rojas reasonably demonstrated an interest in [an appeal].\" (Civil Docket No. 33 at p. 11.) Rojas and Alicea conferred with each other immediately after the sentencing hearing. (Civil Docket No. 37 at p. 8.) The gravamen of Rojas's argument hinges on this brief interaction. According to Rojas, the dissatisfaction he conveyed to Alicea regarding the 70-month sentence reasonably demonstrated an interest in an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. The interest Rojas exhibited in filing an appeal, he contends, prompted a duty to consult.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court finds that the allegations set forth by Rojas present \"issues [that] are debatable among jurists of reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

As evidenced by the divisive precedent among sister circuits and within the First Circuit, the Court finds that reasonable jurists may arrive a different conclusions concerning Rojas's section 2255 motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202178\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Rojas remained detained. (Civil Docket No. 37 at p. 8.) Alicea immediately reconvened with Rojas in the courthouse cellblock.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202178\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rojas questioned Alicea about the severity of his sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202178\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Rojas, he informed Alicea that he \"wanted to appeal because the sentence was too high.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202178\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Alicea advised Rojas that the sentence could not be appealed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202178\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rojas testified that he again expressed an interest in challenging the sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202178\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In Rojas's narrative, Alicea responded that only an appeal pursuant to section 2255 remained available to Rojas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202178\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Alicea confirmed that he and Rojas discussed the sentence. According to Alicea, he explained the appeal waiver to Rojas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 21. Despite the appeal waiver, Alicea offered to file a notice of appeal \"if [Rojas thought there was anything that could be appealed, that [Rojas] had fourteen days and he had to inform [Alicea] so [Alicea] could file something.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 21. Alicea discussed with Rojas a possible motion to reconsider the sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 37. The meeting concluded, however, without an agreement that Alicea would file the motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alicea received no further communication from Rojas or his family regarding an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. The meeting between Rojas and Alicea spanned no more than two minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Rojas anticipated the motion for reconsideration prior to the sentencing hearing. Rojas understood that \"[Alicea] would be able to request a lesser sentence,\" and that \"[Alicea] was going to put in like a motion to have [his] sentence reconsidered, a letter.\" (Civil Docket No. 37 at p. 7.) Alicea did so, filing a motion for reconsideration the same day as the sentencing hearing. (Criminal Docket No. 37.) Consequently, the Court remains dubious that Rojas was in fact dismayed at the motion for reconsideration. Moreover, Rojas exhibited confusion between an appeal and a motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10. Rojas alleged that the \"motion to reduce the sentence that [he] had asked [Alicea] to make\" was missing from the docket sheet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The motion for reconsideration, however, immediately followed the entry of judgement and the sentencing hearing minute entry on the docket. (Criminal Docket No. 37.) During his direct-examination, Rojas referred\n   only to an appeal when his attorney, Franco Lorenzo Perez-Redondo (\"Perez\"), prompted Rojas to do so with a leading question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Perez: I'm sorry. You mentioned that you did not see a motion. Would that be a notice of appeal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   AUSA Mainon Schwartz: Objection, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Judge McGiverin: Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Perez: Could you please describe for us what you did not see in the docket.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   ASUA Mainon Schwartz: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Judge McGiverin: Overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Rojas: The appeal, my appeal, that he did not appeal the sentence. When I was sentenced, I wanted to appeal the sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (Civil Docket No. 37 at pp. 10-11.) On cross-examination, Rojas once more testified that he was upset at the missing motion to reduce to his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13. Rojas conflates a notice of appeal with a motion for reconsideration. His testimony from the evidentiary hearing served only to obfuscate the Court's determination of whether Rojas reasonably demonstrated an interest in an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court finds that Rojas potentially demonstrated an interest in appealing his sentence. Rojas and Alicea discussed the appeal waiver repeatedly before sentencing. (Civil Docket No. 37 at p. 16.) The Court informed Rojas about the appeal waiver at the change of plea hearing and at sentencing.

During the evidentiary hearing, Rojas's counsel repeatedly questioned Alicea regarding the lack of citations to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in his motion for reconsideration.
