(Doc. 64 (\"P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp.\") \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff Brian Silver was employed there as an armed nuclear security officer from 2008 until his termination on February 24, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22, 136.)

C), and a written UAA Program, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. D). Under the FFD policy, \" 'when there are indications that an individual ... may be in violation of Entergy's FFD program or is otherwise unable to safely and competently perform his or her duties,' \" a process is initiated called a determination of fitness for duty. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 12 (quoting Schmid Aff. Ex. C at 51).) In accordance with NRC regulations, this determination \" 'must be made by a licensed or certified professional who is appropriately qualified ... to evaluate the specific fitness issues presented by the individual.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13 (quoting Schmid Aff. Ex. C at 51.)) If a licensed psychologist conducts an in-person clinical interview of an individual and determines that individual is untrustworthy, unreliable, or a potential risk to that individual's self or others, that individual's UAA shall be denied for one year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 263-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Although there is no NRC regulation that mandates this one-year denial period, it is consistent with industry standards.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) This position required, among other things, obtaining and maintaining a valid license to carry firearms, meeting the requirements of NRC psychological testing regulations, satisfying NRC requirements to obtain UAA to the nuclear facility, and complying with Entergy's FFD Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25.) Plaintiff was aware of these requirements and understood he was subject to periodic psychological evaluations and for-cause drug testing pursuant to the FFD Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about March 5, 2013, Plaintiff sought treatment from a licensed psychiatrist, Thomas Van Aken, M.D., to address personal and financial issues. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n    \u00b6 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiff reported a long-term history of anxiety and \"an element of depression,\" for which Dr. Van Aken prescribed the drug Tofranil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47.) Approximately one month later, Plaintiff elected to stop taking that medication, and Dr. Van Aken prescribed the drug Neurontin, which is also known as gabapentin, to treat Plaintiff's anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Dr. Van Aken considered Neurontin a safe drug based, in part, on the fact that he had never seen patients experience major side effects from it, nor did he recall learning from patients or medical literature that Neurontin caused major side effects like hallucinations. (Schmid Aff. Ex. M at 27:3-18, 67:12-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After not having seen Dr. Van Aken since April 2013, Plaintiff returned to the psychiatrist in October 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   reported that he had ceased taking Neurontin, and\n   requested a prescription for Adderall to treat his Attention Deficit Disorder. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 167-68.) Plaintiff next returned to Dr. Van Aken on December 17, 2013, at which time Plaintiff reported that he had resumed taking Neurontin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Then, on December 22, 2013, while he was at home and off duty, Plaintiff believed he saw an Entergy supervisor and two children going through his belongings in his living room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.) He called Entergy's security department several times as well as the New York State Police to report the unauthorized intrusion into his home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.) The responding police officers found Plaintiff in a confused and disoriented state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) Eventually, however, Plaintiff realized that he had imagined the episode. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.) The next day, he called in sick and went to see a doctor about his hallucination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.) He also received a call from Entergy instructing him to report to IPEC the next day for a for-cause drug test and evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 24, Plaintiff reported to IPEC and met with Defendant Griffin, Entergy's Supervisor of Access, Fitness for Duty and Medical at IPEC, who suspended Plaintiff's UAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-99, 175.) Plaintiff was upset and crying during the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) Due to the behavioral concern stemming from the December 22 hallucination incident, Defendant Griffin directed Plaintiff to report for a \"for cause\" test as well as an in-person psychological assessment with Dr. Laurence Baker, a psychologist, regarding Plaintiff's fitness for duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-99, 193.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   That same day, Plaintiff met with Dr. Baker, who conducted a clinical interview and administered a standard written psychological test called the Millon Multiphasic Personality Inventory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.) Dr. Baker observed that Plaintiff was \"uneasy\" and \"anxious,\" as \"[a]lmost anybody in that situation would appear,\" as well as \"highly emotional,\" \"obviously upset,\" \"off-and-on teary,\" \"resentful and demanding,\" \"troubled,\" \"over-reactive,\" and \"hypersensitive to criticism.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101, 108, 111; Schmid Aff. Ex. G at 51:2-8.) Plaintiff disclosed financial pressures, his history of alcohol and substance abuse, his hallucination, and his unreliability with his medications. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 102, 104-05, 109.) Plaintiff also told Dr. Baker that he believed the Neurontin caused his hallucination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 200.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ultimately Dr. Baker concluded that Plaintiff \"did not seem to be in a stable situation at that moment,\" and that Plaintiff's level of anxiety was \"beyond the interview-based anxiety.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, he told Plaintiff he did not think he should return to work, and Plaintiff agreed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) Dr. Baker then wrote a report stating his opinions that Plaintiff was not fit for duty as an armed nuclear security officer and that Plaintiff's UAA should be revoked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110, 116.) Dr. Baker did, however, believe that with treatment Plaintiff could return to fit-for-duty status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 212; Doc. 65 (\"Bellantoni Decl.\") Ex. 7 at 66:19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Baker's report also recommended that Plaintiff be put on short-term disability. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 116.) During an annual audit in early January 2014, however, Defendant Griffin informed Dr. Baker that his role was to make a determination as to Plaintiff's trustworthiness and reliability, not to make a recommendation as to whether he should receive short-term disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119-21, 175.) Defendant Griffin then directed Dr. Baker to complete a standard-form Psychological Assessment Report, which Dr. Baker completed on or about January 7, 2014, indicating that Plaintiff had \"not been found\n   to be acceptable for access authorization at a nuclear facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-23.) Dr. Baker then revised his initial written report to delete his reference to short-term disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) Like the initial report, the revised version indicated that Plaintiff was not fit for duty and recommended that his access be denied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schmid Aff. Ex. P at 7;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. DD at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 9, 2014, Plaintiff met with Dr. Van Aken and discussed the hallucinatory episode. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 126.) Plaintiff reported that he had not been sleeping for three days prior to the episode and that he had since ceased taking Neurontin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 127-28.) Dr. Van Aken agreed with Plaintiff's decision to stop taking the medication and instead prescribed a thirty-day supply of Adderall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 128-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 16, 2014, Defendant Griffin denied Plaintiff's UAA for one year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.) A few days later, Plaintiff submitted a letter to Defendant Griffin requesting an appeal of that decision, along with a note from Dr. Van Aken stating that Plaintiff no longer was taking gabapentin as of January 1, 2014, and a note that Plaintiff spoke with a pharmacist who indicated that 2700 mg per day of gabapentin could induce abnormal thinking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132-33, 298-99.) Entergy upheld the denial of UAA on February 13, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A few days later, Thomas SanFratello, a nuclear security officer and the Chief Shop Steward of Plaintiff's union at IPEC, heard a rumor that Plaintiff was going to be terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 283, 285.) According to SanFratello, he called Defendant Griffin, who informed him that Defendant Daniel Gagnon, the Manager of Security at IPEC, had made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 286;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n    \u00b6 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) SanFratello testified at his deposition that he responded, \"Really? Do you think that maybe we jumped the gun here?,\" to which Defendant Griffin replied, \"That's per Danny. He terminated him and he shouldn't have been terminated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 287-88 (quoting Bellantoni Decl. Ex. 18 at 17:1-15).) SanFratello further testified that Defendant Griffin told him that Plaintiff was supposed to have a second evaluation with Dr. Baker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 289.) According to SanFratello, he then followed up with Defendant Gagnon to ask him if he jumped the gun in firing Plaintiff, and Defendant Gagnon responded, \"I can't have him working here.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 291-92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Meanwhile, Defendant Gagnon proceeded with Entergy's formal review process for termination of employment based on just cause. (Bellantoni Decl. Ex. 4 at 19:6-20:6.) Once that process was complete, Defendant Gagnon sent a letter on Entergy's behalf that terminated Plaintiff's employment, effective February 24, 2014, for failure to meet the psychological standards required for UAA. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Believing he was entitled to a reevaluation, Plaintiff asked Dr. Baker to reevaluate him in April 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 138-39.) Although Dr. Baker would have conducted a reassessment of Plaintiff on Entergy's request, he told Plaintiff he was unable to do the reevaluation and directed Plaintiff to his recommendations in his prior reports. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141-42; Schmid Aff. Ex. X.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In June 2014, Plaintiff submitted to Entergy two notes concerning his mental health. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 143, 145; Schmid Aff. Exs. X, Y). The first was a note from Dr. Van Aken stating that Plaintiff was \"mentally stable to hold the position of nuclear security officer.\" (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 143; Schmid. Aff. Ex. X.) Dr. Van Aken, however, has no recollection of speaking with Plaintiff in June 2014 and subsequently testified at his deposition that he should not have signed off on the statement that Plaintiff was \"mentally stable\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   because he did not conduct a full examination of Plaintiff at that time. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 144.) The second note was from Marilyn Rosenberg, a licensed clinical social worker whom Plaintiff had seen for three sessions and who opined that Plaintiff was stable and mentally competent to work as a nuclear security officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145; Schmid Aff. Ex. Y.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff and his Union filed two grievances challenging the denial of his UAA and the termination of his employment, both of which Entergy denied. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 152.) After the Union demanded arbitration, Entergy and the Union jointly selected an arbitrator and scheduled an access arbitration hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153.) That hearing began in September 2014 and continued in 2015, but was adjourned without date at Plaintiff's request in April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 154, 156-57.)

Ga. 2016) (\"[C]ourts have found being fit for duty an essential job function at NRC-regulated nuclear facilities.\"). The undisputed facts indicate that Dr. Baker evaluated Plaintiff on December 24, 2013, and determined he was unfit and should not return to work. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 101, 103, 110.) Indeed, even Plaintiff does not seem to dispute that, at least on the day of the evaluation, he was not fit for duty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) Because fitness for duty is legally required for UAA, Plaintiff was not qualified under the ADA at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although Plaintiff's arguments are not entirely clear, he seems to assert that Dr. Baker's conclusion regarding Plaintiff's fitness was based on an anxiety disorder that Plaintiff openly had for years but which had never rendered him unfit, and that his hallucination likely was caused by the Neurontin that Plaintiff asserts he ceased taking by January 9, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P's Mem. at 6.) Plaintiff provides no support, however, for this characterization. To the contrary, it is undisputed that Dr. Baker regarded Plaintiff as \"a troubled man\" who \"greatly minimized\" and failed to \"tak[e] ownership of his behavior\"; whose mind by his own account \"is constantly scattered [and] races\"; who suffered from \"a combination of a generalized anxiety disorder and a bipolar disorder, manic\"; and who \"has been unreliable about his medications\" and has not gotten the psychotherapy he also needs out of \"a disinclination to trust therapy.\" (Schmid. Aff. Ex. P at 4, 6.) It is also undisputed that Dr. Baker recommended that Plaintiff should be referred for \"both psychotherapy and reevaluation of his psychoactive medication regimen,\" and that Plaintiff's access should be revoked \"[u]ntil such ti[m]e as, and unless, the treating professionals agreed that he is fit for\n   duty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, on the undisputed facts it is clear that Dr. Baker did not suggest that Plaintiff's impairment was transitory or that Plaintiff would be fit for duty once he stopped taking Neurontin. Rather, he concluded that Plaintiff would be unfit until his medications were adjusted, he underwent psychotherapy and he was cleared by his treating doctors. Plaintiff presents no facts suggesting that those things had occurred at the time his access was terminated. Even if Plaintiff disagrees with Dr. Baker's conclusions, it is undisputed that Dr. Baker's evaluation was the information on which Defendant Griffin relied in suspending Plaintiff's UAA, and Plaintiff provides no basis on which a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Griffin should have, or responsibly could have, ignored or otherwise overruled Dr. Baker's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Termination of Plaintiff's Employment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff's second asserted adverse employment action is the termination of his employment.

That some plaintiffs had actual disabilities, whereas here Plaintiff only asserts that he was \"regarded as\" disabled, is likewise irrelevant.

Dr. Baker recommended that Plaintiff's UAA be revoked because he was not fit for duty, and that it not be reinstated until Plaintiff was treated with medication and psychotherapy and was cleared to return by his providers. (Schmid Aff. Ex P at 7.) Entergy's written access authorization policy provides that if an individual is denied UAA based on a psychological assessment that indicates the individual is \" 'untrustworthy, unreliable, or a potential risk to self or others' \"-or, in other words, not fit for duty (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.23\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 26.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )-that individual's UAA shall be denied for a period of one year, which is a period consistent with industry standards.

Likewise, Plaintiff has not shown that Defendants did not reasonably believe that, under Entergy's policies, Dr. Baker's determination required that Plaintiff's UAA be suspended for one year, and that the loss of UAA provided reasonable grounds for terminating Plaintiff from a position for which maintaining UAA was an essential function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments to the contrary are undeveloped, unsupported by citations to the record or unclear, or simply miss the mark.

He asserts that Defendant Griffin terminated his access and Defendant Gagnon terminated his\n   employment because they believed he was psychologically impaired, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15), but this characterization is a gross oversimplification that ignores the ramifications of the psychological assessment. Defendant Griffin testified that he made his decision to terminate Plaintiff's access based on Entergy's policy requiring a one-year denial period for individuals who are found unfit after a psychological assessment, (Schmid Aff. Ex. F at 84:5-85:10;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272621\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/1372/#p1379\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Ex. U; P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 136). Plaintiff cites no evidence suggesting that the existence of a psychological impairment\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to an impairment precluding access, was the basis of Defendants' decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that Defendants cannot claim that they were acting lawfully while they were disregarding their obligations to accommodate Plaintiff, provide him with a second evaluation, and refer him to a medical doctor for further assessment. (P's Mem. at 16-20.) But, as discussed above, Defendants had no obligation to accommodate Plaintiff under the ADA, and Plaintiff does not point to any policy that required a second evaluation or a referral to a medical doctor where a psychological assessment resulted in a finding that the individual was unfit. Plaintiff further argues that Defendants failed to consider whether Plaintiff's condition was temporary and whether he should have been evaluated by a medical doctor, and that Defendant Griffin was not obligated to terminate Plaintiff's UAA and should have categorized the issue as an \"Uncategorized Event,\" for which the UAA denial period is determined on a case-by-case basis.

(P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 54-60.) His UAA was revoked but eventually restored after he entered a mandatory substance abuse program and, after problems there, completed a more intensive program.

Ex. P)), and therefore a medical, as opposed to a psychological, event, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    P's Mem. at 17-19). To whatever extent that may be the case, it is insufficient to raise an issue of fact because it is clear from Dr. Baker's evaluation that his recommendation of denial of access was not based on the hallucination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The record reveals little about the amount of time spent on tasks requiring UAA, but common sense suggests that an armed security officer at a nuclear plant must access protected areas both routinely and in emergencies.
