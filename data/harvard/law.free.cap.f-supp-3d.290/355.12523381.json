ROBRENO, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this criminal action, the Government sought to introduce at trial fifteen documents withheld by a law firm in response to a subpoena, the testimony of the law firm's partner, who represented one of the defendants, concerning the subject matter of the documents, and the testimony of two other attorneys, who represented a company which was alleged to be owned by one of the defendants. Defendant Charles M. Hallinan and an uncharged third party intervenor objected to the admission of the\n   documents and testimony on the basis that they are protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product privilege, or the community-of-interest privilege. The Government disputed the assertions of privilege, and argued that, to the extent any privilege exists, it was unavailable here by application of the crime-fraud exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court reviewed the documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , and held two hearings, portions of which were\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , at which it allowed Hallinan and the third-party intervenor to object to the testimony of the attorney witnesses on the basis of privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following each of the hearings, the Court determined that, in the first instance, all of the documents before it and portions of the testimony of the three attorneys are protected by the attorney-client, attorney work product, or community-of-interest privileges. Nevertheless, with respect to the fifteen documents and the testimony of one of the attorneys, the Court found that the protection is lost by application of the crime-fraud exception, and allowed the Government to introduce the documents and that attorney's testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court issued its ruling in orders dated October 11, 2017, October 23, 2017, and October 30, 2017. The case proceeded to trial, and the defendants were convicted. The Court now supplements the legal reasoning for the issuance of those orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants Charles M. Hallinan, Wheeler K. Neff, and Randall P. Ginger (\"Defendants\") were indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (\"RICO\") Act, conspiracy to commit fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A second grand jury was later empaneled and returned a superseding indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The superseding indictment charged that, from at least 1997 until 2013, Defendant Hallinan owned, operated, controlled, and financed numerous business entities based in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, which issued, serviced, funded, and collected debt from small, short-term, high-interest loans, commonly referred to as \"payday loans\" because they were meant to be repaid when the borrower received his or her next paycheck (\"the Hallinan Companies\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 2, ECF No. 87. According to the superseding indictment, Hallinan directed some of his companies to charge fees of approximately thirty dollars for every one hundred dollars borrowed, which translated to annual percentage rates of interest of approximately 780 percent, given the short-term nature of the loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The grand jury charged that the payday loans issued by the Hallinan Companies violated the laws of Pennsylvania and more than a dozen other states restricting the amount of interest permissible on personal loans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the superseding indictment, Hallinan, aided and abetted by Defendant Neff, attempted to avoid the operation of state lending laws restricting the issuance of payday loans by entering into multiple partnerships with Native American tribes, who would then claim sovereign immunity from the state lending laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. The superseding indictment charged that these partnerships were a sham, as the tribes had very little connection to the day-to-day operations of the payday lending operations, and did not\n   provide the money advanced for the payday loans, service the loans, collect on the loans, or incur any losses if the borrowers defaulted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The grand jury further charged that Hallinan paid the tribes at least $10,000 a month in return for the tribes' agreement to claim ownership of the various Hallinan Companies and assert sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Apex 1 Processing, Inc. (\"Apex 1\") is a payday lending corporation incorporated by Hallinan in Florida in July 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. According to the superseding indictment, in November 2008, Hallinan pretended to sell Apex 1 to an entity owned by Defendant Ginger, a purported chief of a Canadian-based Native American tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. As part of their agreement, Hallinan promised to pay approximately $10,000 per month to Ginger, and Ginger promised to claim that his tribe owned Apex 1 whenever necessary to evade state payday lending laws and regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 23, 2010, payday loan borrowers filed a class action lawsuit in Indiana state court against Apex 1 (\"the Indiana Litigation\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. The borrowers alleged that Apex 1 issued payday loans to them that violated Indiana law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   On May 8, 2013, the Indiana state court certified a class of 1,393 plaintiffs in the Indiana Litigation (\"the Indiana Plaintiffs\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. According to the superseding indictment, beginning around July 2013, Hallinan, Neff, and Ginger engaged in a scheme to defraud the Indiana Plaintiffs by deceiving them into believing that Apex 1 was effectively judgment proof so that they would accept a discounted settlement offer on their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The superseding indictment further charged that, in order to convince the Indiana Plaintiffs that Apex 1 was judgment proof, Defendants defrauded the plaintiffs into believing that (1) Ginger was the sole owner of Apex 1, (2) Ginger was a Canadian Indian chief who lived on tribal lands in Canada, (3) Apex 1 had few if any assets that could be recovered, and (4) Hallinan did not exercise managerial control over Apex 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35. According to the grand jury, Hallinan took part in this scheme after Neff warned him, in July 2013, that if the Indiana Plaintiffs established that Hallinan had not actually sold Apex 1 to Ginger in 2008, Hallinan could face personal exposure of up to $10 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In April 2014, the Indiana Plaintiffs agreed to settle their claims for approximately $260,000, although their attorneys had valued their clients' cause of action at greater than $2.6 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. According to the superseding indictment, Hallinan caused one of the Hallinan Companies to pay the entirety of the settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants were first charged by indictment on March 31, 2016. ECF No. 1. A superseding indictment was issued on December 1, 2016. ECF No. 87. Defendants Hallinan and Neff filed a motion to dismiss the charges against them on February 8, 2017, ECF No. 149, which the Court denied on August 15, 2017, ECF No. 203. A jury trial commenced on September 26, 2017 against Hallinan and Neff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the jury returned a guilty verdict against both Defendants on all counts of the superseding indictment on November 27, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to trial, the Government issued a subpoena to the Chartwell Law Offices LLP (\"Chartwell\") to produce various categories of documents related to the Indiana Litigation. In response to the subpoena, Chartwell withheld fifteen documents on the basis of the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product privilege with respect to the firm's representation of Apex 1 and Hallinan in his personal capacity in the Indiana Litigation (\"the Chartwell Documents\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, the Government sought to introduce all fifteen of the Chartwell Documents, on the basis that even if the documents are protected by the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product privilege in the first instance, any privilege is lost through the application of the crime-fraud exception. The Government also sought to introduce the testimony of (1) Kenneth M. Dubrow, Esquire, a Chartwell attorney who represented Apex 1 and Hallinan in the Indiana Litigation; (2) Susan Verbonitz, Esquire, an attorney employed by Weir &amp; Partners, LLP (\"Weir\"), who represented Apex 1 at an earlier point in the Indiana Litigation; and (3) Lisa Mathewson, Esquire, an attorney and sole practitioner from the Law Offices of Lisa A. Mathewson LLC, who represented Apex 1 in the grand jury investigation in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Government filed a motion under seal requesting that the Court perform an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the Chartwell Documents pursuant to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Zolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n    491 U.S. 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), and conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing of the testimony of the three attorney witnesses, using questions provided by the Government, in order to determine whether the crime-fraud exception applied to the documents and testimony. ECF No. 216. The Government claimed that, to the extent any of the documents and testimony fell within the scope of the attorney-client privilege, attorney work product privilege, or any other privilege, there was a sufficient basis to hold an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the documents and testimony to determine whether the crime-fraud exception to the privilege applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Government further argued that Defendants and their counsel should be excluded from any\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing, because Judge Surrick, who presided over the grand jury proceedings, had excluded Defendants from\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   reviews for the purpose of evaluating the applicability of the crime-fraud exception during the grand jury investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After finding that the Government had met the standards articulated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   to hold an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the documents and testimony, the Court conducted an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the Chartwell Documents, and held two hearings, portions of which were also\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , at which the three attorney witnesses testified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n    491 U.S. at 568-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (permitting district courts to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of documents to assess the applicability of the crime-fraud exception).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the Chartwell Documents, the Court found that portions of the documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege, but that they fell within the crime-fraud exception. The Court ordered Chartwell to produce the\n   documents on October 11, 2017. ECF No. 257.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court held a hearing on October 12, 2017, at which Verbonitz, Dubrow, and Mathewson testified. During the hearing, the Court permitted the Government to ask Verbonitz and Dubrow questions, with counsel for Hallinan asserting objections to the testimony on the basis of attorney-client privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For each question for which counsel for Hallinan asserted a privilege, the witness was instructed not to answer. The Court then conducted an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing (without the Government present), asking each witness the questions that they had previously not answered on the basis of privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With respect to Mathewson, who never represented Hallinan personally, the Court allowed the Government to ask questions about the applicability and scope of the community-of-interest privilege, but did not allow the Government to proceed with substantive questions about her conversations with Hallinan and his attorneys. Instead, the Court instructed the parties to file supplemental submissions regarding whether a community-of-interest privilege existed between Hallinan and Apex 1, and whether, if the privilege existed, there was a sufficient basis to hold an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   to determine whether the crime-fraud exception applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following the October 12, 2017, hearing, and on the basis of Mathewson's testimony, the Court concluded that Apex 1 and Hallinan had met their burden to establish the existence of a community-of-interest privilege with respect to certain communications between Mathewson and Hallinan's attorneys. Accordingly, the Court scheduled a\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   hearing for October 25, 2017, at which time Hallinan could assert any objections to Mathewson's testimony on the basis of the community-of-interest privilege. ECF No. 267.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Government filed a post-hearing submission regarding Mathewson on October 16, 2017, arguing that there was no community-of-interest privilege between Hallinan and Apex 1, but if even there was, the crime-fraud exception applied. ECF No. 261. In response, Apex 1 filed a motion to intervene in this action to assert the attorney-client privilege, attorney work product privilege, and/or the community-of-interest privilege on its own behalf with respect to Mathewson's testimony. ECF No. 264. Apex 1 also argued that the crime-fraud exception did not apply to any of the privileged testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   hearing held on October 25, 2017, the Court granted Apex 1's motion to intervene for the purpose of asserting privilege objections to Mathewson's testimony. Hallinan and Apex 1 then objected to all of the Government's questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court\n   then conducted an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing (without the Government present), at which it asked Mathewson the questions that she had previously refused to answer on the basis of privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Following the\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   hearings on October 12 and 25, 2017, the Court reviewed the transcript of the testimony of each attorney witness in order to determine whether the answers are protected by the attorney-client, attorney work product, or community-of-interest privileges, and if so, whether the crime-fraud exception applies. The Court then issued orders dated October 23, 2017, and October 30, 2017, sustaining in part and overruling in part Hallinan and Apex 1's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Those communications all request or provide legal advice to Hallinan, the client, regarding the Indiana Litigation, and therefore are protected by the attorney-client privilege. A small number of the Chartwell Documents are email exchanges that contain both attorney-client communications and communications with third parties. To the extent that portions of the Chartwell Documents contain communications with third parties, those portions of the documents are not privileged. However, the remaining portions of the documents are privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Having determined that all of the Chartwell Documents are protected by the attorney-client privilege in whole or in part, the Court next analyzed whether the crime-fraud exception applied to those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Third Circuit, in an earlier proceeding in this case, found that there was a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan was committing or intending to commit a crime or fraud with respect to the Indiana Litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Matter # 3\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185153\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/157/#p165\">\n    847 F.3d at 165-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the Third Circuit previously concluded, there is at least a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan was committing or intending to commit the crime or fraud alleged based upon the recording in which Hallinan discusses the Indiana Litigation and states that he offered to pay Ginger to claim that he owned Apex 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With respect to the second prong of the crime-fraud test, the Government asserted that Hallinan defrauded the Indiana Plaintiffs by lying at his deposition in the Indiana Litigation, and that any advice provided by his counsel in the communications at issue was used in furtherance of Hallinan's alleged fraud. Based upon the July 12, 2013 email, in which Neff provided information to Hallinan regarding Hallinan's potential liability in the Indiana Litigation through the piercing of the corporate veil with respect to Apex 1, and Hallinan's subsequent deposition testimony in that case disavowing any ownership interest in Apex 1, there is a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan retained counsel in the Indiana Litigation in order to escape personal liability by misrepresenting his ownership of Apex 1. Hallinan was not named as a party in the Indiana Litigation. Therefore, there is a reasonable basis to suspect that the sole purpose of Hallinan's retention of counsel to represent his interests in the Indiana Litigation, and solicitation of the advice of counsel with respect to that lawsuit, was to avoid potential liability through fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In that manner, all of the advice that Hallinan received from Dubrow in the Indiana Litigation was \"used in furtherance of [the] alleged crime or fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    ABC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658578\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/133/#p155\">\n    705 F.3d at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, all of\n   Hallinan's communications with Dubrow relating to the Indiana Litigation fall within the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, including the Chartwell Documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The documents at issue here differ from the Third Circuit's consideration of the July 12, 2013 email in\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Matter # 3\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185153\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/157/#p165\">\n    847 F.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in two important respects. First, in\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Matter # 3\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit found that there was no evidence that Hallinan completed the crime identified by the Government-amending his prior tax returns to omit or misstate his ownership of Apex 1-after receiving the July 12, 2013 email. Here, however, the Government alleges that Hallinan committed a different crime: defrauding the Indiana Plaintiffs by lying at his deposition in order to convince them that he did not have any managerial control over Apex 1. Although there was no evidence that Hallinan completed the tax fraud, there is evidence that Hallinan completed the fraud against the Indiana Plaintiffs by lying at his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, also unlike in\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Matter # 3\n   </em>\n   , there is a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan began the crime or fraud\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to soliciting the advice of the Chartwell attorney, and therefore the advice was\n   <em>\n    sought\n   </em>\n   in furtherance of the crime or fraud. Here, all of the communications at issue post-date Hallinan's awareness of his potential liability in the Indiana Litigation pursuant to the veil-piercing doctrine, which he learned of no later than July 12, 2013. Therefore, there is a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan's entire act of retaining counsel and soliciting legal advice was in furtherance of his alleged crime or fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Kenneth Dubrow\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Prior to the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   portion of the October 12, 2017, hearing, Dubrow testified that he represented Hallinan personally in the Indiana Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 142:23-25, 143:1, Oct. 12, 2017. According to Dubrow, the representation began in January 2014, about a month prior to Hallinan's deposition, and ended in approximately July 2014, when the lawsuit was settled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 143:2-25; 144:1-10. On the basis of that testimony, the Government conceded that an attorney-client relationship existed starting in January 2014 and continuing until July 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 148:10-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   During Dubrow's testimony at the hearing, Hallinan objected to sixteen questions posed by the Government on the basis of the attorney-client privilege, and the Court instructed Dubrow not to answer those questions. After the Government left the hearing, however, the Court posed all sixteen of those questions to Dubrow, and permitted him to answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Upon consideration of Dubrow's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony, the Court found that all of Dubrow's responses to the sixteen questions are protected by the attorney-client privilege, but that the crime-fraud exception applies to all of Dubrow's answers. As explained above, the July 12, 2013 email provides a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan retained counsel in the Indiana Litigation for the purpose of furthering his intended fraud: concealing his true ownership and control of Apex 1, so that the Indiana Plaintiffs would settle their claims against the company for a smaller amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on Dubrow's testimony, Hallinan used Dubrow in furtherance of this fraud by representing to Dubrow that he did not own Apex 1, that he did not have any documents related to Apex 1, and that his testimony at his deposition in the Indiana Litigation was truthful. Therefore, there is a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan used Dubrow's advice in furtherance of his\n   fraud, and that the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applies to Dubrow's entire representation of Hallinan in the Indiana Litigation. As a result, the Court allowed the Government to ask Dubrow all sixteen challenged questions at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Susan Verbonitz\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   During the initial portion of Verbonitz's testimony, prior to the portion of the hearing held\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , Verbonitz testified that she represented Apex 1 in the Indiana Litigation from May 17, 2010, through October 9, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 78:9-20, Oct. 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Verbonitz testified that she did not represent Hallinan personally during the Indiana Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:11-19. However, she also testified that (1) she previously represented Hallinan on a personal basis on other matters; (2) Hallinan was her primary contact for Apex 1 during the Indiana Litigation; (3) Hallinan's companies paid her legal bills for her representation of Apex 1 in the Indiana Litigation; (4) she provided advice to Hallinan regarding the potential for personal, managerial liability against him in the Indiana Litigation; and (5) she authored a letter to Hallinan providing legal advice to Apex 1 that stated \"Confidential-Subject to Attorney-Client Privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:10-87:12. Verbonitz admitted that based on those facts, Hallinan may have reached an understanding in his mind that Verbonitz was acting as his attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 86:25-87:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Counsel for Hallinan objected to seven questions posed by the Government on the basis of the attorney-client privilege created by Hallinan's perception of the attorney-client relationship. Upon hearing Verbonitz's answers to the questions, Hallinan withdrew his attorney-client privilege objection to the first four questions. Therefore, the Court allowed the Government to ask those four questions at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court then reviewed the transcript of Verbonitz's answers in order to determine the applicability of the crime-fraud exception to the three remaining questions, and determined that the crime-fraud exception did not apply to Verbonitz's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Unlike Dubrow's representation of Hallinan, the majority of Verbonitz's representation of Apex 1 in the Indiana Litigation occurred prior to the July 12, 2013 email. Therefore, the July 12, 2013 email does not provide a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan used Verbonitz's representation in furtherance of the alleged crime or fraud of defrauding the Indiana Plaintiffs, as it did for Dubrow's representation. Based on the Court's review of Verbonitz's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony, the testimony did not provide any other reasonable basis to suspect that Verbonitz's representation was used in furtherance of Hallinan's alleged crime or fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Lisa Mathewson\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At the October 12, 2017, hearing, Mathewson testified that she represented Apex 1, and never met Hallinan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 17:17-19, 22:15-17, 43:2-3, Oct. 12, 2017. She testified that the initial scope of her representation was to assert Apex 1's attorney-client privilege in connection with grand jury subpoenas sent to Weir and Chartwell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:20-18:1. Her representation later expanded to include asserting Apex 1's attorney-client privilege in connection with grand jury subpoenas for the testimony of Verbonitz, Dubrow, and Mathewson herself, as well as a subpoena\n   for documents issued to Mathewson's law firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:8-19:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As Mathewson did not represent Hallinan personally, the only privilege Hallinan could assert over Mathewson's testimony would be the community-of-interest privilege. In order for Mathewson's communications with Hallinan's attorneys to be protected by the community-of-interest privilege, there must be evidence that (1) Mathewson \"agree[d] to exchange information\" with Hallinan's attorneys; (2) concerning a \"litigated or nonlitigated matter\"; (3) in which Apex 1 and Hallinan had a \"common interest.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Teleglobe Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091072,3510189\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/345/\">\n    493 F.3d at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 76(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Mathewson testified that she agreed to exchange information with Hallinan's attorneys with respect to the Indiana Litigation, and that she did in fact exchange information. Apex 1 and Hallinan both had a common interest, during the grand jury investigation, in defending against any potential charges against either of them relating to the Indiana Litigation. Although, ultimately, Apex 1 was not charged, it was a subject of the investigation. Therefore, Apex 1 and Hallinan have established a community-of-interest privilege with respect to certain communications between Mathewson and Hallinan's attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   During the October 25, 2017, hearing, Hallinan asserted the community-of-interest privilege with respect to all seventeen of the Government's questions. Apex 1 asserted the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product privilege, and/or the community-of-interest privilege with respect to all seventeen questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Although Hallinan and Apex 1 objected to all of the Government's questions on the basis of privilege, two of the seventeen questions, as well as subparts of two other questions, do not call for privileged testimony. Those questions and subparts ask Mathewson to testify regarding (1) the identity and authority of Apex 1's authorized representative, including whether Mathewson believes Ginger is authorized to assert or waive privileges on behalf of Apex 1; and (2) the payment of Apex 1's legal fees, including the amount of the fees and the identity of the person or entity paying the fees. The identity of a corporate client's authorized representative is not privileged information. Nor is information regarding legal fees and billing. As those topics are not privileged, the Court permitted the Government to ask Mathewson questions regarding those topics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 283.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The remaining questions the Government asked call for testimony regarding Mathewson's beliefs about the ownership of Apex 1, and Mathewson's conversations with counsel for Hallinan and Neff on a variety of topics relating to Apex 1's ownership and assertions of privilege. Those questions are subject to Hallinan's community-of-interest privilege, Apex 1's attorney client privilege and community-of-interest privilege, and/or the attorney work product privilege. Therefore, the testimony would not have been admissible at trial unless it fell within the crime-fraud exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In its October 13, 2017, submission regarding Mathewson's testimony, the Government argued that the crime-fraud exception applied to any of Mathewson's testimony that the Court determined was privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Submission, ECF No. 261. The Government asserted that there was a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan was committing or intending to commit the uncharged crime of obstruction of justice by limiting the Government's access to documents and testimony regarding the true ownership of Apex 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The Government\n   then argued that there was a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan used his attorneys' communications with Mathewson in furtherance of the obstruction of justice, because he hired Mathewson for the sole purpose of invoking Apex 1's attorney-client privilege to block the Government's access to information that would reveal the prior fraud he committed with respect to the Indiana Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In response, Apex 1 argued that (1) there is no legal basis for the Government's contention that the valid assertion of an attorney-client privilege is an obstruction of justice; (2) neither Hallinan nor his counsel urged Mathewson to assert Apex 1's privilege or conditioned the payment of fees on any particular course of action; and (3) the community-of-interest privilege cannot be voided by the crime-fraud exception unless both clients intended to misuse the community-of-interest arrangement to further the crime or fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apex Mot. to Intervene, ECF No. 264.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Prior to the October 25, 2017, hearing, the Court had concluded that there was \" 'a factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person' that\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review\" of Mathewson's testimony \"may reveal evidence to establish the claim that the crime-fraud exception applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n    491 U.S. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   , 644 P.2d at 33 ). However, Mathewson's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   testimony ultimately did not reveal such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Based upon Mathewson's testimony, there is no evidence, aside from the Government's speculation, that Apex 1's assertions of privilege were not legitimate. Apex 1, as a subject of the grand jury investigation, had an interest in keeping the corporation's privileged communications with its attorneys private, and an interest in keeping the communications between Apex 1's attorneys and Hallinan's attorneys private as well. Although there is a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan may have desired, or even attempted, to influence Mathewson's assertions of privilege on behalf of Apex 1, there is insufficient evidence that he actually did so, aside from the mere fact that Apex 1 has asserted privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Mathewson testified at length during the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearing regarding her communications with Hallinan's attorneys, and that testimony does not support a finding that they, or Hallinan, influenced her assertions of privilege on behalf of Apex 1. Therefore, even if there is a reasonable basis to suspect that Hallinan intended to commit obstruction of justice by convincing Mathewson to assert privileges on behalf of Apex 1, there is no evidence that he was able to use his attorneys' communications with Mathewson in furtherance of that crime. As a result, the crime-fraud exception does not apply to Mathewson's privileged testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Hallinan and Apex 1's objections to the admission of the documents and testimony on the basis of privilege were sustained in part and overruled in part. Defendants' objections to the fifteen Chartwell Documents and the testimony of Kenneth Dubrow on the basis of the attorney-client privilege were overruled, and the Government was permitted to introduce those documents and testimony at trial. Hallinan's objections to the testimony of Susan Verbonitz, and\n   Hallinan and Apex 1's objections to the testimony of Lisa Mathewson, were sustained, except with respect to two questions and two subparts that are not protected by any privilege. The Court did not permit the Government to ask Ms. Verbonitz any of the questions subject to Hallinan's objections. The Court also did not permit the Government to ask Ms. Mathewson the questions that are protected by privilege.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendant Neff was not indicted on the charges of money laundering.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Ginger did not appear for trial.

At the hearing, the Court found that the Government had met its burden to demonstrate that a\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Zolin\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    hearing was warranted on the basis that Apex 1 was a defunct corporation with no assets, and that it was asserting a privilege, at least in part, to the benefit of Hallinan, who was in turn paying the fees of Apex 1's counsel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Hr'g Tr. at 59:22-60:7, Oct. 25, 2017.

The grand jury court found that one of the communications, a July 12, 2013 email in which Neff advised Hallinan of his potential personal liability in the Indiana Litigation, was protected by the work product privilege, but that the crime-fraud exception applied, and allowed the Government to show the email to the grand jury. Hallinan filed an interlocutory appeal, and the Third Circuit reversed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Grand Jury Matter # 3\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185153\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/157/#p165\">\n     847 F.3d at 165-67\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    In the version of the document that the Government obtained, Hallinan had forwarded the email to his accountant, waiving the attorney-client privilege.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185153\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/157/#p165\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185153\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/157/#p165\">\n     at 165\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
