Courts apply a two-step framework when analyzing extraterritoriality issues: first courts ask whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted, and if it has not been rebutted then courts determine whether the case at hand presents a domestic issue.\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco, Inc. v.

The Supreme Court recently applied this framework to \u00a7 1964(d) and determined that the statute does not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n    at 2106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because Plaintiff suffered injuries one and two before he arrived to the United States, the harms are not domestic injuries. Consequently, they are not actionable under \u00a7 1964(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the injuries suffered in Mexico are actionable because Defendants conducted the alleged racketeering in the United States. ECF 67, PgID 1108. In support of his position, Plaintiff argues that\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   held that RICO applies to some foreign racketeering activity. ECF 67, PgID 1111. But Plaintiff's argument is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To properly apply the holding in\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   , one first must understand how the RICO statute is structured: \u00a7 1962 provides a list of prohibitions that are all premised on \"racketeering activity.\" The statute defines \"racketeering activity\" as acts in violation of a laundry list of separate criminal statutes, which are known as predicates.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The statute provides two enforcement measures to deter violations of \u00a7 1962 : criminal penalties under \u00a7 1963 and civil remedies under \u00a7 1964. Accordingly, for a private plaintiff to prevail, he needs to show that (1) he can bring a cause of action under \u00a7 1964(c), and (2) there was a violation of \u00a7 1962.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because of the RICO Act's structure,\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   addressed two distinct questions: (1) whether the substantive prohibitions listed in \u00a7 1962 apply extraterritorially, and (2) whether the private cause of action provided by \u00a7 1964(c) applies to injuries that are suffered in foreign countries.\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2099-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In answering the first question, the Supreme Court noted that some predicates apply to foreign conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n    at 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court therefore held that some violations of \u00a7 1962 apply extraterritorially-not directly through \u00a7 1962-but to the extent that the statute that provides the predicate act applies extraterritorially.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n    at 2102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A violation of \u00a7 1962 may be based on a pattern of racketeering that includes predicate offenses committed abroad, provided that each of those offenses violates a predicate statute that is itself extraterritorial.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff is correct to argue that the alleged violations of \u00a7 1962 occurred either domestically or as the result of predicate acts derived from violations of statutes that apply extraterritorially. But that is not where the analysis ends. Plaintiff must show not only a violation of \u00a7 1962, but also that he can bring a private cause of action under \u00a7 1964(c). In the analysis of \u00a7 1964(c), the Supreme Court held that the statute does not apply extraterritorially.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n    at 2106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Irrespective of any extraterritorial application of \u00a7 1962, we conclude that \u00a7 1964(c) does not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.\"). Accordingly, Plaintiff needs to show a domestic\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   -not domestic racketeering activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/#p2101\">\n    at 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 1964(c) requires a civil RICO plaintiff to allege and prove a domestic injury to business or property and does not allow recovery for foreign injuries.\"). Plaintiff incurred expenses to travel to the United States while he was in Mexico,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the job he left was also in Mexico. Because those harms are not domestic, they are not actionable under \u00a7 1964(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B. The lost salary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plain language of \u00a7 1964(c) limits actionable harms to injuries to business or property. Accordingly, the question of whether Plaintiff's lost salary is actionable under \u00a7 1964(c) turns on whether Plaintiff had a property interest in the salary. The underlying contract provided at-will employment, so Plaintiff did not have a property interest in the salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties agreed at oral argument that Michigan law governs the question of whether the underlying contract provided at-will employment. When interpreting a contract governed by Michigan law, the Court's primary obligation is to determine the intent of the parties.\n   <em>\n    Quality Prods. &amp; Concepts Co. v.

If the contract's language is unambiguous, it should be construed and enforced as written as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1411232\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/469/362/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiff conceded at the hearing that there is no ambiguity in the contract, and the Court accepts the concession-at least for the present analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The contract refers to an \"offer of employment at will,\" ECF 59-1, PgID 697, therefore a plain reading of the contract suggests Plaintiff's employment was at will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, the Court must decide whether an at-will employment contract creates a property interest cognizable under \u00a7 1964(c). Although state law plays a role, the Court must focus on Congress's intended meaning of a property interest because the Court is interpreting a federal statute.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Plaintiff therefore cannot bring an action for his lost salary under \u00a7 1964(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C. The Intangible Harms\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plain language of \u00a7 1964(c) limits actionable harms to injuries to business or property. Plaintiff's separation from his family as well as any fear or distress he suffered are not injuries to business or property. Consequently, injuries\n   five and six are not actionable.\n   <em>\n    Fleischhauer v. Feltner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539759\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/1290/#p1300\">\n    879 F.2d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1300 (6th Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Remaining RICO Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's only remaining injury is the funds he spent to reside in the United States. Plaintiff has a property interest in his money and he expended his funds in the United States, so the harms are actionable under \u00a7 1964(c). To prevail, however, Plaintiff must show that Defendants violated \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) or (d). The Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact on that question, and therefore, summary judgment is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that the alleged wrong here is breach of contract-which is not a predicate act under the RICO statute-therefore Plaintiff cannot show a RICO violation. Defendants' argument is legally sound and the point is well taken, but Plaintiff alleges more than a breach of contract. The complaint lists violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343, and 1351, ECF 1, PgID 10, all of which are predicate RICO acts under \u00a7 1961(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And at least the \u00a7 1351 claim can survive a motion for summary judgment: Defendants sent communications to Plaintiff (and those like him), that a reasonable jury could find materially false or fraudulent, to recruit or hire him. That said, Plaintiff must show that the violations were both a \"but for\" cause and a proximate cause of the costs incurred to live in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anza v.

That issue is genuine and one of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties dispute when Plaintiff knew that he would not be paid until his services were contracted to a third party, and the record does not provide a clear answer to the question. First, the reasonable inferences flip depending on which motion the Court considers. There is an executed offer letter between the parties that suggests Plaintiff is a direct employee of SUSA entitled to an annual salary, and the letter does not indicate that Plaintiff's services must first be contracted to third party. ECF 59-1, PgID 697. But there are also several emails exchanged. ECF 57-4-57-9. The emails state that Plaintiff would be working on projects, and they also say Plaintiff would be an employee of SUSA upon receiving a visa and then SUSA would \"take care\" of his salary. ECF 57-6, PgID 619. Taken together with all appropriate inferences, the record does not clearly reveal when Plaintiff knew about the prerequisites to payment and whether he was misled. The jury, as fact-finder, will have to make the determination after evaluating the credibility of the facts presented. Because the disputed fact is material and would establish or refute causation, it presents a genuine issue. Accordingly, summary judgment for either party is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Fraud Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants committed actual and constructive fraud by making a false offer of employment, and that Plaintiff relied on the offer to his detriment. ECF 1, PgID 13. Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff knew that his employment would not begin until his services were contracted to a third party and therefore his reliance was unreasonable. As discussed in Section II, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to when Plaintiff knew that he would not be paid his full\n   salary until he was placed with a third party. Consequently, summary judgment on the fraud claim is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Breach of Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under Michigan law, \"a party claiming a breach of contract must establish (1) that there was a contract, (2) that the other party breached the contract[,] and (3) that the party asserting breach of contract suffered damages as a result of the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunn v.

ECF 58, PgID 672-73. At the hearing, Defendants argued that parol evidence should be considered because the executed offer letter did not include a merger or integration clause-and that the parol evidence here sufficiently draws the alleged breach into question to render summary judgment improper. The Court finds Defendants' argument persuasive and will deny Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is proper to consider parol evidence here. Under Michigan law, parol evidence is not admissible to vary the terms of a contract which is clear and unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    UAW-GM Human Res. Ctr. v. KSL Recreation Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"307030\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/228/486/#p492\">\n    228 Mich.

But there are four exceptions: \"extrinsic evidence is admissible to show (1) that the writing was a sham, not intended to create legal relations, (2) that the contract has no efficacy or effect because of fraud, illegality, or mistake, (3) that the parties did not integrate their agreement or assent to it as the final embodiment of their understanding, or (4) that the agreement was only partially integrated because essential elements were not reduced to writing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20N.W.2d%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20N.W.2d%20411\">\n    at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20N.W.2d%20411\">\n    579 N.W.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The contract here falls under the third and fourth exceptions. The contract is a one page letter, entitled \"Employment Offer,\" and it excludes an integration clause. ECF 59-1, PgID 697. The letter also states that the offer of employment is contingent upon an attached employment agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20N.W.2d%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the parties submitted at the hearing that the employment agreement was never executed, the formatting and content of the letter suggest that the parties-at least at the time of signing-anticipated additional agreements to be executed. Consequently, the offer letter did not embody the final or entire agreement between the parties. It is therefore appropriate for the Court to examine parol evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The extrinsic evidence here renders summary judgment improper. In an email exchange with Plaintiff, Defendant Rodriguez stated \"what we offer is to have a decent life in the US, also depending on experience and technology, many times depends on the client.\" ECF 57-6, PgID 619.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   She added, \"[y]ou go to work for one\n   of our client's projects at whatever location he is\" and \"[a]lso once you are confirmed for a project we sent you whatever you need to go for project[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20N.W.2d%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff responded: \"[t]hanks for your information, i have a better idea of the job now, and there is no problem for me to work by projects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 618. After making all reasonable inferences in favor of Defendants, the exchange could be read as an agreement between the parties that Plaintiff's employment did not begin until he was assigned to a project. Under that reading, Defendants did not breach the contract. So although Plaintiff may ultimately prevail at trial, he is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Case Management\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The following claims remain active: (1) the RICO claims, but only as to the funds Plaintiff spent to remain in the United States; (2) the FLSA claims; (3) the fraud claims; (4) the breach of contract claims; and (5) Defendants' counterclaim alleging unjust enrichment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now that there is greater clarity as to the remaining issues for trial, the Court finds that the parties would benefit from additional facilitation. The Court will therefore refer the remaining issues to a second mediation with Patrick Seyferth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court recognizes that mediation may delay trial preparation, so the Court will reset the remaining schedule.

Although failure to reimburse in the United States could be a domestic injury, it is not alleged in the complaint and Plaintiff's counsel admitted that there is nothing on the record to show that the parties agreed to reimbursement. Consequently, the issue is not before the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The concession conflicted with Plaintiff's position in his briefs. Out of an abundance of caution, the Court will address Plaintiff's written argument. Plaintiff points to extrinsic evidence-namely, a letter sent to the U.S. Embassy in support of Plaintiff's visa application-to rebut the position that the employment here was at will. ECF 71, PgID 1182-83. But the letter was not an agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant-it was directed at the U.S. Embassy and Plaintiff neither provided any consideration nor executed the document. The letter is therefore insufficient to draw into question the plain terms of the executed offer letter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Court recognizes that Plaintiff may have framed his argument differently in portions of his briefs addressing the current motions, but the Court does not find those errant remarks to operate as concessions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    This holding could be read as inconsistent with the Court's rejection of parol evidence in Section I.B. But there are two key differences in the two decisions. First, Plaintiff is the party that may have benefited from the consideration of parol evidence in Section I.B, and he chose to concede at the hearing that the contract governed as written. Even if the Court had considered parol evidence there, the extrinsic evidence is unpersuasive that the parties agreed to anything other than at-will employment, whereas in the present context the extrinsic evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material as to whether Defendant breached.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The email exchange contains many grammatical errors, but the Court will not correct each one so as to not distract the reader.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Defendants filed counterclaims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.
