BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration, filed January 8, 2016 (Doc. 2)(\"Motion\"); and (ii) the Defendant's Motion\n   to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint to Compel Arbitration and Memorandum Brief in Support, filed February 4, 2016 (Doc. 15)(\"Zangara's Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on March 29, 2016. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction in this case because of the parties' diversity, despite the existence of possible non-diverse parties in the underlying state court action who are not before this Court; (ii) whether decedent Lucille Asher's conservator had the authority to bind Lucille Asher and her estate to the Arbitration Agreement, Resident Admission Agreement at 3, filed January 8, 2016 (Doc. 3-2)(\"Arbitration Agreement\"); (iii) whether the Arbitration Agreement is within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 16 (\"FAA\"); (iv) whether the claims asserted are within the Arbitration Agreement's scope; (v) whether Plaintiff Jerry Erwin Associates, Inc. (\"Erwin Associates\") has the power to enforce the Arbitration Agreement, even though it is not a party to the Arbitration Agreement; and (vi) whether the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable. The Court concludes that: (i) the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction in this case, because the parties before the Court are diverse, and the Court should not \"look through\" to the state court action to determine diversity; (ii) Lucille Asher's conservator had the authority to bind her and her estate to the Arbitration Agreement; (iii) the Arbitration Agreement is within the FAA's scope; (iv) the claims asserted are within the Arbitration Agreement's scope; (v) Erwin Associates has the power to enforce the Arbitration Agreement; and (vi) the relevant part of the Arbitration Agreement is not unconscionable. Accordingly, the Court grants the Plaintiff's Motion and denies Zangara's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2011, a state district court issued an order appointing a Guardian of Person and a Conservator of the Estate for an elderly woman named Lucille Asher (\"L. Asher\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Appointing Guardian of Person and Conservator of Estate of An Incapacitated Person at 3-4, filed January 8, 2016 (Doc. 3-1)(\"Guardianship Order\"). Specifically, the Guardianship Order appointed William R. \"Randy\" Asher (\"W. Asher\"), L. Asher's son, as Guardian of Person, and Urbielewicz Murphree CPAs, P.C. (\"Murphree CPAs\") as Conservator of the Estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guardianship Order at 3-4. The Guardianship Order declares that \"William R. 'Randy' Asher shall have the final and ultimate authority to make all medical decisions for the incapacitated person, including but not limited to making decisions regarding where the incapacitated person should reside.\" Guardianship Order at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   W. Asher \"decided to try to admit Lucille to North Ridge\" Alzheimer's Special Care Center (\"North Ridge\"), a nursing home that Erwin Associates manages and operates. Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration at 3, filed January 29, 2016 (Doc. 14)(\"Response 1\"); Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration at 1, filed January 8, 2016 (Doc. 3)(\"Memorandum\"). Erwin Associates has a Management Services Agreement with Albuquerque Care Group, LLC (\"Albuquerque Care\"), a company that owns the nursing home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Management Services Agreement at 1, filed February 16, 2016 (Doc. 17-3)(\"Management Agreement\"). According to the Management Agreement, Erwin Associates \"will perform all services necessary to provide and maintain quality care and management for the Facility and the Residents ... including ... [r]epresenting the Facility in all dealings with regulatory authorities, creditors,\n   Residents, Facility Employees and other personnel and insurers.\" Management Agreement at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   L. Asher was admitted to North Ridge, and Murphree CPAs, but not W. Asher, signed the Resident Admission Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 3. The other party to the Arbitration Agreement is \"Albuquerque Care Group, LL[C], doing business as North Ridge Alzheimer's Special Care Center\" and not Erwin Associates. Arbitration Agreement at 1. In key part, the Arbitration Agreement reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Agreement to Resolve Disputes Through Arbitration:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Facility, Resident, and the Resident's Representative agree, as an important and integral part of this Agreement, that any and all claims and disputes arising from or related to this Agreement or to Resident's care, services, or residency at the Facility shall be resolved by submission to neutral, binding arbitration rather than a trial before a judge or jury (except for the specific claims and disputes set forth in the following paragraph).... This arbitration clause binds all parties to this Agreement and their spouses, heirs, representatives, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, as applicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Actions Not Subject to Arbitration:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties agree that any claim or dispute involving or related to unlawful detainer (eviction) proceedings shall not be subject to arbitration unless both parties agree to arbitrate such proceedings. Furthermore, any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement for which arbitration is not allowed by law, or which the parties have agreed (herein or otherwise) not to arbitrate, shall be brought in the appropriate court before a judge rather than a jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 3. W. Asher, and not Murphree CPAs, signed other forms on L. Asher's behalf, including an Authorization for Medication Assistance and a Notification of Rights and Responsibilities with Incident Reporting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   L. Asher died in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 4. Allegedly, \"Ms. Asher went to the emergency room ... [and] [f]ollowing abdominal surgery, she was diagnosed with suspected perforated appendicitis resulting in an abscess and a large area of infection.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Lucille Asher, Deceased, by and through Personal Representative, Kevin Zangara v.

According to the State Court Complaint, \"Ms. Asher died ... of septic shock due to the abdominal infection.\" State Court Complaint \u00b6 14, at 3. Allegedly, North Ridge was negligent \"by failing to timely and properly diagnose Ms. Asher's appendicitis.\" State Court Complaint \u00b6 16, at 3. According to the State Court Complaint, \"North Ridge was negligent in hiring unqualified staff and in granting clinical privileges to and permitting the continued exercise of clinical privileges by physicians North Ridge knew or reasonably should have known were not qualified to exercise clinical privileges with reasonable skill.\" State Court Complaint at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Kevin Zangara was appointed L. Asher's Personal Representative for the purpose of bringing a wrongful death action against Erwin Associates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 4. Zangara filed such an action in state district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Court Complaint \u00b6 1, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Erwin Associates moves the Court to compel Zangara to arbitrate claims that\n   Zangara has asserted in state court against Erwin Associates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 1. Zangara moves to dismiss the Plaintiff's Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zangara's Motion at 1. The Court will summarize the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Erwin Associates' Motion and Memorandum\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Erwin Associates contends that the claims which Zangara asserts in the state court action are subject to a binding arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 4. Erwin Associates further contends that the FAA governs the Arbitration Agreement, because there is a valid written arbitration agreement and the dispute is within the agreement's scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 6. Erwin Associates asserts that, because Murphree CPAs signed the Arbitration Agreement on L. Asher's behalf, L. Asher and her estate are bound.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 4. In the alternative, Erwin Associates argues that L. Asher was \"bound to arbitrate as the intended beneficiary and third-party beneficiary\" of the Arbitration Agreement, because \"the resident is the person named in the agreement who is admitted to the facility and is conferred certain rights and benefits.\" Memorandum at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Next, Erwin Associates asserts that the Defendant is \"estopped from denying the validity of the arbitration provision.\" Memorandum at 12. Specifically, Erwin Associates argues that Murphree CPAs \"made a promise to JEA to be bound by the terms in the Admission Agreement, including the arbitration provision. Thus, Erwin Associates reasonably relied on ... Murphree's promise to abide by the terms of the arbitration provision.\" Memorandum at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, Erwin Associates contends that the \"Defendant's claims are clearly within the scope of the arbitration provision.\" Memorandum at 13. Erwin Associates notes that the Arbitration Agreement says that \" 'any and all claims and disputes' \" are subject to arbitration, and that the Arbitration Agreement binds all \" 'spouses, heirs, representatives, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns.' \" Memorandum at 13-14. Erwin Associates thus concludes that the claims at issue are within the Arbitration Agreement's scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 14. Regarding relief, Erwin Associates requests the Court to grant the Motion and stay the state court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Zangara's Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Zangara responds to the Motion and Memorandum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 1. First, Zangara argues that Erwin Associates is not a real party in interest to this suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 6. Zangara concludes that, because Erwin Associates is not a real party in interest, Erwin Associates cannot enforce the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, Zangara contends that Erwin Associates \"cannot enforce the agreement because Erwin Associates is not an intended beneficiary of the agreement.\" Response 1 at 7. According to Zangara, because Erwin Associates is not mentioned anywhere in the agreement, one cannot say that the parties intended for the agreement to benefit Erwin Associates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 9. For this reason, Zangara concludes that Erwin Associates \"has no right to enforce the Agreement.\" Response 1 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, Zangara asserts that the Arbitration Agreement is both substantively and procedurally unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 12. Regarding substantive unconscionability, Zangara contends that, because the Arbitration Agreement excludes claims from arbitration \"involving or related to eviction, the Agreement requires the\n   arbitration of the vast majority of claims that would be brought by the patient, who is the weaker party, while excluding those disputes that would exclusively be pursued by the nursing home.\" Response 1 at 12. Regarding procedural unconscionability, Zangara asserts that, because \"the Agreement was offered ... on a take-it-or-leave-it basis,\" and because the Arbitration Agreement was mandatory, the Arbitration Agreement is procedurally unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 13. Zangara adds that the nursing home \"had all the bargaining power.\" Response 1 at 13. Zangara concludes that the Court should deny the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Erwin Associates' Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Erwin Associates replies to Zangara's Response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply in Support of Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration, filed February 16, 2016 (Doc. 17)(\"Reply 1\"). Erwin Associates contends that it is a real party in interest, noting that in the state court action, \"Defendant sued and served JEA. Defendant, now to avoid arbitration, is claiming that JEA is not a real party in interest.\" Reply 1 at 3. Erwin Associates also contends that it is a third-party beneficiary to the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 1 at 3. It notes that the Arbitration Agreement binds the parties' \"representatives,\" \"administrators,\" and \"assigns.\" Reply 1 at 5. Erwin Associates asserts that it is \"a representative of, administrator, and assign of Albuquerque Care Group, LLC pursuant to a Management Services Agreement.\" Reply 1 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Erwin Associates further argues that the Arbitration Agreement is not unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 1 at 9. It argues that \"the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico has held that a nursing home admission agreement is not procedurally unconscionable just because it contains an arbitration provision.\" Reply 1 at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    THI of New Mexico at Hobbs Ctr., LLC v.

He adds that the Arbitration Agreement never mentions Erwin Associates, and that the only party to the agreement-other than L. Asher-is Albuquerque Care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zangara's Motion at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Zangara next re-asserts that the Arbitration Agreement is both substantively and procedurally unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zangara's Motion at 13-14.

He contends\n   that Erwin Associates \"fails to meet its burden of proving the diverse citizenship of\n   <em>\n    each real party in interest.\n   </em>\n   \" Zangara's Motion at 17 (emphasis in original). Specifically, he alleges that \"[t]he only named parties to the Agreement for which Lucille Asher or her representatives could have intended the Agreement to benefit are ABQ Care, LL[C], North Ridge, or ABQ Care, LL[C] doing business as North Ridge.\" Zangara's Motion at 17. Zangara concludes that because all of these entities are New Mexico citizens, the Court has no diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zangara's Motion at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Erwin Associates' Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Erwin Associates responds to Zangara's Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, filed February 22, 2016 (Doc. 19)(\"Response 2\"). Erwin Associates begins by arguing that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 2 at 3. Erwin Associates alleges that \"Ms. Asher and the personal representative of her estate, were at all relevant times New Mexico residents, [and] JEA is a Washington corporation with its principal place of business in Vancouver, Washington.\" Response 2 at 3.

Erwin Associates further contends that it may enforce the Arbitration Agreement, because it is a third-party beneficiary of the Arbitration Agreement, re-alleging that the Arbitration Agreement binds Albuquerque Care's \"representatives,\" \"administrators,\" and \"assigns.\" Response 2 at 8.

Turning to substantive unconscionability, Erwin Associates argued that \"the Tenth Circuit addressed an arbitration agreement and exclusions regarding guardianship, collection, and eviction claims and specifically stated that under the FAA, you cannot treat arbitration agreements as inferior to litigation.\" Tr. at 15:23-16:3 (Hernandez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Zangara began his argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:19 (Wood).

The Court then asked if a New Mexico case existed in which a court found procedural unconscionability, but not substantive unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:8-13 (Court). Zangara responded that he had not seen such a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:14 (Wood). Zangara added, however, that the cases \"do establish that you can have both or one. It doesn't require both. And then the case law is clear on that because it's been decided as a matter of substantive unconscionability on [more than] one occasion.\" Tr. at 21:16-19 (Wood). Zangara added that \"the FAA has explicitly allowed state law to govern the matter of whether or not a contract was formed under the equitable principle of unconscionability ... so New Mexico case law on matters of unconscionability is the controlling law on this issue.\" Tr. at 25:2-11 (Wood).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Zangara continued that the Arbitration Agreement\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   is signed by the conservator who as an initial matter really doesn't even have the authority to bind Lucille Asher to decisions regarding where she lives ... but when we get to the procedural unconscionability issue, I think it's significant that William Asher was known to exist ... [and] was given two exhibits to\n   sign ... but was never given the [Arbitration Agreement].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Tr. at 33:8-34:1 (Wood).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Erwin Associates responded to some of Zangara's arguments. Regarding the request for an evidentiary hearing, Zangara contended that the \"defendant is in control of the evidence that would be relevant here.... I don't see why we need an evidentiary hearing for defense counsel to get evidence from his own client with respect to any procedural unconscionability.\" Tr. at 41:13-24 (Hernandez). Erwin Associates also expressly stated that it withdraws its request for this Court to stay the state court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 47:22-23 (Hernandez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court concluded the hearing by saying \"the substantive/procedural unconscionability, my initial reaction is those are not going to prevent a granting of the Plaintiff's motion.\" Tr. at 51:3-5 (Court). The Court added: \"I also think that I have jurisdiction, at least over the limited case that I have.\" Tr. at 51:5-7 (Court). The Court also noted: \"I guess the thing I'm most concerned about is the fact that the agreement is with Albuquerque [Care] and the party that's ... trying to enforce this arbitration agreement is not a signatory to that agreement.\" Tr. at 51:11-15 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW REGARDING DIVERSITY JURISDICTION AND ARBITRATION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Subject-matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) requires: (i) complete diversity among the parties; and (ii) that 'the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.' \"\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Although the Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit have not ruled on whether a federal court should \"look through\" to the state court complaint to determine diversity jurisdiction in an FAA motion to compel arbitration, the Court concludes that it should not \"look through\" to the state court complaint, but rather, should look only at the diversity of the parties before the federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Supreme Court has held that \"a federal court may 'look through' an [FAA motion to compel arbitration] to determine whether it is predicated on an action that 'arises under' federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaden v.

In facilitating the exercise of his or her enumerated powers to contest or settle a claim against the incapacitated person, the conservator may decide that, should any claims arise against the incapacitated person, the incapacitated person may prefer the speed and privacy of arbitration. Indeed, many people do not want their financial or health information to become public record via litigation. Thus, a conservator may choose to sign arbitration agreements to \"facilitate\" his or her ability to \"contest any claim\" that may arise against the incapacitated person. The Court therefore concludes that a conservator has the power to enter into an arbitration agreement to \"facilitate\" his or her enumerated conservator powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   An arbitration agreement also survives an incapacitated person's death for the purposes of a wrongful death action.

According to Zangara, \"Ms. Asher died ... of septic shock due to the abdominal infection.\" State Court Complaint \u00b6 14, at 3. Zangara alleges that North Ridge was negligent \"by failing to timely and properly diagnose Ms. Asher's appendicitis.\" State Court Complaint \u00b6 16, at 3. Given these allegations of medical negligence, it is not \"legally certain that the stakes of the arbitration are $75,000 or less.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Society v.

It is difficult to imagine a wrongful death claim for less than $75,000. Zangara has not stated that he will not take more than $74,999.99. Nor has he argued that his case is worth less than $75,000. Accordingly, this suit meets the amount in controversy requirement. Because this case meets the diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy requirements, the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     L. ASHER'S CONSERVATOR HAD THE AUTHORITY TO BIND HER AND HER ESTATE TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   L. Asher's conservator, Murphree CPAs, had the power to bind L. Asher and her estate to the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under New Mexico law, a conservator has the abilities to \"pay or contest any claim; to settle a claim by or against the estate or the protected person by compromise, arbitration or otherwise.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2045-5-424\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 45-5-424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C)(19). A conservator is also empowered to \"execute and deliver all instruments which will accomplish or facilitate the exercise of the powers vested in the conservator.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2045-5-424\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 45-5-424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C)(25). The power to \"execute ... all instruments which will accomplish or facilitate the exercise of the powers vested in the conservator\" must logically include the power to execute an arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   For example, in facilitating the exercise of his or her enumerated powers to contest or settle a claim against the incapacitated person, the conservator may decide that, should any claims arise against the incapacitated person, the incapacitated person may prefer the speed and privacy of arbitration. Indeed, many people do not want their financial or health information to become public record via litigation. Thus, a conservator may choose to sign arbitration agreements to \"facilitate\" his or her ability to \"contest any claim\" that may arise against the incapacitated person. The Court therefore concludes that a conservator has the power to enter into an arbitration agreement to \"facilitate\" his or her enumerated conservator powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Further, an arbitration agreement does not have to be executed before there is a prospect of litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Arbitration and Mediation,\" Justia,\n   <em>\n    https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/arbitration-mediation/\n   </em>\n   (last viewed November 7, 2017). The parties could have a dispute, and then enter into an arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Arbitration and Mediation,\" Justia,\n   <em>\n    https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/arbitration-\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    mediation/\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   (last viewed November 7, 2017)(explaining that an arbitration agreement can be \"signed after a dispute has arisen, wherein the parties agree that the dispute should be resolved by arbitration\"). The Court therefore concludes that a New Mexico conservator logically has the power to enter into an arbitration agreement on an incapacitated person's behalf to facilitate the conservator's enumerated powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Here, Murphree CPAs signed the Arbitration Agreement on L. Asher's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 3. A court lawfully appointed Murphree CPAs as L. Asher's conservator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guardianship Order at 4. Because Murphree CPAs had the power to enter into an arbitration agreement on L. Asher's behalf to facilitate Murphree CPAs' enumerated power to contest any claim against L. Asher, the Arbitration Agreement binds L. Asher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   It may be plausible that a guardian should sign a nursing home agreement that contains an arbitration provision, because a guardian, not a conservator, \"is entitled to custody of the incapacitated person and may establish the incapacitated person's place of abode within or without New Mexico.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2045-5-312\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 45-5-312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(1). In this case, W. Asher, L. Asher's guardian, was given \"final and ultimate authority to make all medical decisions for [L. Asher], including but not limited to making decisions regarding where [L. Asher] should reside.\" Guardianship Order at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Zangara does not argue, however, that W. Asher was somehow deprived of his authority to make a decision regarding where L. Asher would live when Murphree CPAs signed the Arbitration Agreement. On the contrary, \"William decided to try to admit Lucille to North Ridge,\" which he eventually did. Response 1 at 3. Murphree CPAs did not in some way infringe on W. Asher's power to determine where his mother lived by signing the Arbitration Agreement, because W. Asher had already decided where L. Asher would live. The Court therefore concludes that Murphree CPAs, as conservator, had the power to enter into the Arbitration Agreement on L. Asher's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   There can be, in some cases, a distinction between who decides something and who signs the documents effectuating the decision. For example, a client often makes decisions, but the attorney signs the necessary documents. Hence, even though W. Asher did not sign the Arbitration Agreement, nothing indicates that he did not decide where his mother would live. Murphree CPAs' signature on the Arbitration Agreement does not, without more, suggest that W. Asher did not make the decision. On the contrary, \"William decided to try to admit Lucille to North Ridge,\" which he eventually did. Response 1 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Murphree CPAs' signature also binds L. Asher's estate following L. Asher's death. An arbitration agreement survives an incapacitated person's death for the purposes of a wrongful death action. In\n   <em>\n    Krahmer\n   </em>\n   , the \"[p]laintiff filed a wrongful death action against the nursing home, which responded with a motion to compel arbitration, pursuant to an agreement signed\n   when [the decedent] entered the nursing home.\"\n   <em>\n    Krahmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077751\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2014/001/4077751/\">\n    2014-NMCA-001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20P.3d%20298\">\n    315 P.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals of New Mexico held that, \"because a wrongful death action is entirely derivative of the decedent's right to sue, a valid arbitration agreement signed by a competent party binds that party's estate and statutory heirs in a subsequent wrongful death action.\"\n   <em>\n    Krahmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077751\" index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2014/001/4077751/\">\n    2014-NMCA-001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20P.3d%20298\">\n    315 P.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, an arbitration agreement survives death for the purposes of a wrongful death action. The Court therefore concludes that L. Asher's obligation to arbitrate the claims alleged in the state court wrongful death action survived L. Asher's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS WITHIN THE FAA'S SCOPE\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court concludes that the Arbitration Agreement is within the FAA's scope.
