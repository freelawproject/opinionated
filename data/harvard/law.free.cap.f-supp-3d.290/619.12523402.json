Amaya claims that as he was drying a customer's vehicle that was parked in front of the automated car wash, another vehicle that was exiting the car wash pinned Amaya between the two vehicles. On February 11, 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Clean N Go in Denton County, Texas, District Court, styled\n   <em>\n    Alvarez, et al. v. Spencer, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-01118-431, which asserted claims of negligence and gross negligence against Clean N Go (the \"Amaya litigation\" or \"underlying litigation\"). Amaya and Elizabeth Alvarez (\"Alvarez\"), as next friend of Amaya, assert that Amaya suffered injuries due to Clean N Go's failure to provide and maintain a place of employment that is reasonably safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Allied commenced this action on February 16, 2017, seeking a declaration that it has no duty to defend Clean N Go (Dkt. # 1).

Defendants Amaya and Alvarez joined in on the response (Dkt. # 25). On August 30, 2017, Allied filed its reply (Dkt. # 28).
