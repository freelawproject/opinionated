(Doc. 3). For the reasons discussed below, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 5, 2011, Janie Mae Washington was admitted to Golden Living Center in Tifton, Georgia. Golden Living Center is a long-term care skilled nursing facility. Prior to Washington's admittance, her daughter, Plaintiff Ange Davis, met with a staff member of Golden Living Center (\"the Facility\") on January 4, 2011. On that day, Davis signed an admissions package entitled \"Admission and Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreements\" that contained two separate agreements. (Doc. 9-1, p. 2). One agreement was a contract for the general terms of admission. The other was an arbitration agreement naming her mother and the nursing home as parties. Ange Davis signed the agreement on the line designated for the signature of the Resident's Legal Representative. Immediately below Davis's signature is an acknowledgment that states: \"By my signature, I represent that I am a person duly authorized by Resident or by law to execute this Agreement and that I accept its terms.\" (Doc. 3-4, p. 6). The agreement required the signatory to \"Specify Capacity of Legal Representative (e.g. Power of Attorney, Agent, Next of Kin),\" but Davis left that line blank. Washington was not present when her daughter signed the arbitration agreement or other admissions paperwork, nor was it discussed with her by either her daughter or a representative of the Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about February 24, 2011, Ms. Washington executed a general power of attorney appointing Ms. Davis as her attorney-in-fact. Ms. Washington continued to reside at the Facility until December 2015. On January 15, 2016, Ms. Washington passed away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Davis filed this action in Tift County on April 26, 2017, alleging that the negligence and professional negligence of Defendants \"in failing to prevent the injuries that Janie Mae Washington sustained while a resident at the Facility\" resulted in her death. (Doc. 9-1, p. 3-4). Defendants removed the complaint to this Court and on June 9, 2017, filed a Motion to Dismiss and Compel Arbitration. (Doc. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Enforceability of the Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants allege that the arbitration agreement must be enforced because by signing the document Davis created an enforceable arbitration agreement between her mother and the Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Applicability of the FAA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants argue that the federal law governing the arbitration agreement mandates the parties submit to arbitration. Specifically, Defendants contend that because the arbitration agreement is part of a contract involving interstate commerce, it must be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 16. Defendants state that under the application of the FAA, its \"liberal policy favoring arbitration\" requires that the parties submit to arbitration. (Doc. 3-1, p. 5). Additionally, Defendants contend that the FAA supersedes and preempts state law that may require a result contrary to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The FAA provides that agreements to arbitrate in contracts involving commerce are \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, the Court must first determine if the Defendants have met their burden of proving that the arbitration agreement is valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Agency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Washington never signed the arbitration agreement, and her daughter's signature on that agreement can only bind Washington and her estate if Davis is deemed to have been an agent of her mother for this purpose. Here, Davis argues that \"[b]ecause [she] had no authority to execute the Arbitration Agreement on Janie Mae Washington's behalf, the Plaintiffs have not waived their rights to have the claims set forth in the Complaint for Damages heard by a jury before this Court.\" (Doc. 9-1, p. 4). In support of this argument, Davis states that at the time she signed the admissions paperwork, she had no legal authority to sign on behalf of her mother for admission into the Facility or otherwise. Further, Davis states that Defendants do not contend that either express or apparent authority existed, and their reliance on her status as Washington's daughter is insufficient evidence of any contractual relationship. Thus, Davis ultimately argues that Defendants have not met their burden in proving \"all the essential elements of the contract, including the assent to the contractual terms.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TranSouth Fin.

Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Triad Health Management of Georgia, III, LLC v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , where, as in this case, a child signed an arbitration agreement on behalf of a parent upon admission to a nursing facility.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131029\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/298/204/\">\n    298 Ga.

Those same facts are not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Washington did not execute a power of attorney until after the signing of the admission documents. Defendants argue that\n   \"Ange Davis' Agreement is valid, enforceable and binding since she signed it.\" (Doc. 3-1, p. 13). Davis' signature alone, however, is not enough to support the contention that she had the authority to create a valid and binding agreement between her mother and the Facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205069\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/329/507/#p509\">\n    329 Ga.

Here, there is no evidence that Washington gave Davis express authority to enter into the arbitration agreement on her behalf either before her admission to the Facility or at the time the admission documents were signed on January 4, 2011. To the contrary, Davis has filed an affidavit stating that Washington was not present at the time she signed the agreement, nor did she inform her mother of the nature of the agreement after it was signed.

In\n   <em>\n    McKean\n   </em>\n   , the appellees contend that Patricia, McKean's mother, later ratified her son's actions when she executed a general\n   power of attorney nineteen days after signing an arbitration agreement on her behalf.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205069\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/329/507/#p509\">\n    329 Ga.

The Georgia Court of Appeals rejected appellees argument: \"the simple fact that Patricia granted McKean power of attorney to act on her behalf did not ratify his earlier action of signing the ADR agreement on her behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205069\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/329/507/#p509\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205069\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/329/507/#p509\">\n    at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205069\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/329/507/#p509\">\n    765 S.E.2d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Davis admits in her affidavit submitted to the Court that her mother had no knowledge of her signing the arbitration agreement, nor did she have any knowledge regarding of all the material facts surrounding the signing of the arbitration agreement and the consequences that would stem therefrom. Without evidence that Washington had sufficient knowledge, her subsequent decision to grant Davis power of attorney and her receipt of benefits under the agreement as a resident of the Facility do not support a finding of ratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Necessity of Arbitrator Involvement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants also make the argument in their Reply brief that an arbitrator must be involved to make a determination as to any disputes concerning the scope and applicability of the arbitration agreement. In support of their argument, Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Terminix Int'l Co., LP v. Palmer Ranch Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556348\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/1327/\">\n    432 F.3d 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2005). As stated above, this argument is not properly raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9039780\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/1338/#p1342\">\n    397 F.3d at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if the argument were properly raised, however, this Court has previously rejected the very same argument made by the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Stringfield v. GGNSC Tifton, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:12-CV-18 (HL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204584907\">\n    2012 WL 4584907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Ga. Oct. 1, 2012). In\n   <em>\n    Stringfield\n   </em>\n   , a nearly factually identical case to the one at hand, the defendants cited\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Terminix\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   in support of their position that an arbitrator rather than the court should determine the validity of the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. This Court found the defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Terminix\n   </em>\n   misplaced: \"[t]he primary difference is that\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Terminix\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   did not involve an unenforceable contract based on lack of agency. Instead, the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Terminix\n   </em>\n   was allegedly unenforceable based on remedial restrictions.... The\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Terminix\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   parties had authority to bind themselves to arbitration, but here, the Court has determined that Stringfield did not have authority to bind Marsh to arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Stringfield\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Stringfield\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Terminix\n   </em>\n   is improper as Davis did not have authority to bind Washington to the terms of the agreement. Thus, Washington is not bound by any of the terms, and it is unnecessary to have an arbitrator determine the validity of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Request for Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, Defendants state in their Reply brief that \"\n   <em>\n    at this time\n   </em>\n   , there is a lack of information regarding the existence of express or apparent agency, as the parties have not conducted any discovery regarding the signing of the ADR Agreement.\" (Doc. 10, p. 6). As a result, Defendants request that the Court allow \"limited discovery related to the signing of the ADR Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court denies Defendants' request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the reasons addressed above, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Compel Arbitration (Doc. 3) is denied. The stay in\n   this case is hereby lifted. The Court will issue a new Rules 16 and 26 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , this 22nd day of November, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Defendants explain at length that the arbitration agreement involves interstate commerce. (Doc. 3-1, pp. 9-12). However, it is not in dispute that the agreement involves interstate commerce.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 3-4, p. 2 (\"The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that upon execution by Resident, this Agreement becomes part of the Admissions Agreement, and that the Admission Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Defendants incorrectly assert that \"Plaintiff has the burden of establishing that her claims are not subject to arbitration.\" (Doc. 3, p. 7).
