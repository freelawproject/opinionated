MTD 11-12. Nor could it, since the Data Use Policy Plaintiffs cite and rely on did not exist until several months after Facebook published the most recent version of its SRR that Plaintiffs attach to their complaint. Plaintiffs do not address this deficiency in their opposition brief.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   MTD 11-12 (noting that the Data Use Policy \"was active starting on September 7, 2011,\" and that the policy \"was not incorporated into any of the SRR versions attached to the TAC, and was therefore not a part of the contract\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 4-5 (arguing that the SRR \"expressly refers to the Privacy Policy,\" but offering no response to Facebook's point that the Data Use Policy was not operative at the time the cited SRR was published).

The relevant Help Center pages were not incorporated by reference into the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that various Help Center pages were incorporated by reference into the SRR. Opp'n 5-8. Facebook notes, and Plaintiffs do not dispute,\n   that the SRR contains no direct references to any Help Center pages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD 8-9 (\"the SRR does not reference-or even hint at-a single one of the Help Center pages Plaintiffs quote from\"); Opp'n 6 (\"the Help Center pages are the third link in the contractual chain.... the Privacy Policy linked to the Help Center pages and directed users to them\"). Rather, Plaintiffs' theory is that certain Help Center pages were incorporated by reference into the Privacy Policy, and that the Privacy Policy was in turn incorporated into the SRR. Opp'n 7 (\"the SRR incorporates the Privacy Policy, and, in turn, the Help Center pages\"); TAC \u00b6\u00b6 61 (\"The Help Center pages are incorporated by reference into the Privacy Policy and are a part of the contract.\"), 135 (stating that two questions common to all members of the proposed class are \"whether the SRR incorporates by reference the Privacy Policy\" and \"whether the Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Help Center pages\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even if the Court assumes that the Privacy Policy was incorporated into the SRR, Plaintiffs' argument fails because the Help Center pages were not incorporated into the Privacy Policy. In the TAC, Plaintiffs cite several Help Center pages that, according to Plaintiffs, contained promises not to track logged-out users.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 62-67. Some Help Center pages contain explicit promises to that effect-for instance, one page states: \"When you log out of Facebook, we remove the cookies that identify your particular account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62, Ex. I. However, none of those Help Center are referenced in the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy does not link to them, mention them, or otherwise reference them directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Instead, Plaintiffs appear to argue that the individual Help Center pages are subparts of a single \"broader document.\" Opp'n 5-6 (\"a mainstay of Internet contract law teaches that customers are often contractually bound to individual provisions ... even when the hyperlink only links to the broader document\"). This argument finds little factual support. The Help Center pages exist independently at different URLs, as underscored by the fact that Plaintiffs attached Help Center pages as separate exhibits to their TAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 62-67 (citing, in order, TAC Exs. I, J, M, L, MM, NN, OO, PP, R, S). No evidence suggests that a Facebook user who reads one Help Center page has also read, or is even aware of, any of the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the Help Center in its entirety is incorporated into the Privacy Policy because the Privacy Policy links to some of its pages. Opp'n 6 (\"Here, the TAC demonstrates clearly how that the Help Center\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   (not just specific pages) are incorporated into the SRR.... [T]he Privacy Policy linked to the Help Center pages and directed users to them, without exclusion.\") (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' argument that the Privacy Policy \"directed\" users to Help Center pages \"without exclusion\" is at odds with TAC, which alleges that the Privacy Policy linked to\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   Help Center pages, but\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to the Help Center pages containing Facebook's promises to not track logged-out users.

Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6 172, Dkt. No. 93. In the order granting Facebook's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's SAC, this Court dismissed the majority of Plaintiffs' claims without leave to amend. MTD Order 14. This Court granted leave to amend only as to Plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and only \"[b]ecause Plaintiffs [did] not identif[y] the specific contractual provisions they allege were breached.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In their TAC, Plaintiffs allege a new class period that begins on April 22, 2010, and ends on \"a later date to be determined upon the completion of discovery.\" TAC \u00b6 132. This expanded class definition exceeds the scope of leave to amend that the Court granted in its order dismissing Plaintiffs' SAC. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) provides that \"a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\" Plaintiffs did not obtain Facebook's consent or this Court's leave to expand its class allegations. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' expanded class allegations are stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Plaintiffs base this argument on the following statement from the SRR: \"By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.\" TAC Ex. D. Under this theory, Plaintiffs argue that they agreed to the SRR on or after September 7, 2011, which means that the Data Use Policy would have been incorporated into the contract between the parties as of that date. This argument fails for two reasons: first, the TAC does not identify the dates that Plaintiffs \"used or accessed\" Facebook; and second, Plaintiffs have not alleged that the April 26, 2011, version of the SRR remained in effect as of September 7, 2011.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
