Boglin's reports were exclusively made at the workplace and directed toward other Alabama A &amp; M employees. Moreover, it is apparent from the complaint that both of Boglin's verbal reports concerned the routine details of her job duties. Doc. 1 at 3-4. Indeed, processing various forms related to requisitions and travel requests was one of Boglin's basic professional responsibilities,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, and her internal reports directly relate to the content of those forms and the misconduct their processing purportedly revealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.

In short, Boglin was concerned about the duties she was asked to perform and whether her duties were being properly carried out.

While reporting mismanagement and malfeasance may not formally be part of Boglin's duties, implicit in her role as a Senior Secretary \"is the duty to inform ... those that would appear to have the most need to know and the best opportunity to investigate and correct the barriers to [Boglin's] performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Alves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358030\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/1149/#p1159\">\n    804 F.3d at 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court therefore concludes Boglin was not speaking as a citizen when she made her internal complaints and, as such, her speech was not protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    2. Whether Boglin's Speech Involved a Matter of Public Concern\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Alternatively, the Defendants' motion is due to be granted because Boglin has failed to adequately allege that her speech was on a matter of public concern. The complaint focuses primarily on two verbal reports of misconduct Boglin made to Dr. Bennie McMorris, the then Vice President of Student Affairs at Alabama A &amp; M. Doc. 1 at 4. Although the complaint contains no specific allegations regarding the details of those verbal reports, it generally alleges that Boglin approached Dr. McMorris due to her concerns about being asked to sign off on fraudulent reimbursement forms, a task outside the scope of her usual duties, and the improper completion of various forms which Boglin was required to process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. This type of complaint does not reflect any particular political or civic concerns Boglin may have had with respect to the behavior of her supervisor or coworkers.

As pleaded, the court lacks any basis to infer that Boglin's complaints were primarily motivated by a public purpose, i.e. a concern over the potential waste of taxpayer funds. Instead, the plain inference from the complaint is that Boglin was concerned about acting outside of her usual job responsibilities and her inability to properly process various internal documents because of the allegedly fraudulent activities occurring in her department.

Boglin has failed to demonstrate that her speech is constitutionally protected under\n   <em>\n    Garcetti's\n   </em>\n   threshold inquiry and consequently her complaint does not allege a plausible First Amendment violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Defendants' motion, doc. 19, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Boglin's claims against Alabama A &amp; M, the board, and the individual members of the board in their official capacities, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment and are accordingly\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   . The official capacity claim against Clayton is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, although Boglin's individual capacity claims against Clayton and the members of the board, as currently pleaded, fail, Boglin has requested an opportunity to amend before the court dismisses these claims, doc. 27 at 12 n.5, and the court will allow Boglin this opportunity. Any such amendment must be filed within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   the 6th day of February, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The Defendants have also filed a reply brief and supporting exhibits, doc. 28, which the court\n    <strong>\n     STRIKES\n    </strong>\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    based on the Defendants' failure to follow the page limitations of this court's Uniform Initial Order available on the website for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama at http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-abdul-k-kallon. Counsel for the Defendants are experienced practitioners in this District and the court is confident they are aware of the existence of this order which, among other things, strictly limits reply briefs to a maximum of five pages. The Defendants' reply brief, not counting exhibits, is over 27 pages long, nearly twice the length of its initial brief, and consists of well over 5,000 words. Accordingly, the court relies solely on the Defendants' initial brief and Boglin's response to rule on the Defendants' motion. The court places counsel for the Defendants on notice that the court's orders are not instruments of fiction that parties can ignore. Instead, the court's uniform initial order is critical in enabling it \"to maintain control over its docket ... [a] power [that] is necessary for the court to administer effective justice and prevent congestion.\"\n    <em>\n     Young v.
