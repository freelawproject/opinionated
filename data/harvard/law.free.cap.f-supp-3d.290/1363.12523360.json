Counsel for the ITC pointed out that even if the value added data for the integrated producers was improperly inflated, the value added data for National Refrigerants was also cited and relied upon by the ITC and contained no such flaws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201677\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Similar to the problem with the data set selection in the \"dedicated for use\" prong, the court agrees with Plaintiffs. It appears that the ITC relied upon the incorrect data in determining the A to B range as the approximate percentage of value added by the integrated producers in the blending of HFC Components into HFC Blends. The\n   <em>\n    Views\n   </em>\n   provide very limited discussion of how the ITC used this range, in conjunction with the value added data from National Refrigerants, in considering the \"value added\" prong and the ultimate separate like product determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Views\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (citing value added and average unit value data, without any comment on how that data influenced the separate like product determination and the subsidiary \"value added\" finding);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201677\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201677\">\n    at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Conclusion\" section describing how each factor,\n   <em>\n    except \"value added\"\n   </em>\n   , supported the ITC's determination that HFC Components and Blends are separate like products). The\n   <em>\n    Views\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Staff Report\n   </em>\n   are unclear as to how much weight the ITC placed on these data points and how it weighed the \"value added\" prong in comparison to the other four prongs in reaching the ultimate determination. Accordingly, the court will remand so that the Commission may reconsider the use of the data in the A to B range and the weight assigned to this prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the ITC included an overly broad set of \"conversion costs\" in its value added calculation. Plaintiffs seek to narrowly limit the \"blending\" process to include only the actual mixing of the HFC Components into a resultant HFC Blend, with no regard to any attendant or subsequent processes required to produce, transport, and maintain the final product. The court disagrees. The ITC requested and evaluated the full ambit of\n   conversion costs incurred in transforming HFC Components into the final product of HFC Blends, including associated expenses for packaging.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 19-20 (\"conversion costs (direct labor and other factory costs-those costs associated with transforming a more basic product into a salable product) have been consistently treated by the Commission as the relevant numerator in the value added calculation\"). Additionally, it appears from the record that Plaintiffs were well aware that the ITC viewed costs associated with blending operations broadly as including packaging costs and related overhead, but failed to object to the questionnaires' language with respect to this data or provide the ITC with a breakdown of their data that separated out these costs. The ITC's decision to consider the full set of data associated with the \"conversion costs\" of blending, including attendant costs covering the expense of packaging the HFC Blends into cylinders suitable for storage and sale, is reasonable given the available data on the record for calculating the \"value added\" to HFC Components by blending them into HFC Blends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that even if the Commission's evaluation of the \"value added\" prong is supported by substantial evidence, the Commission nevertheless acted contrary to prior ITC practice. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that, by not finding HFC Blends and Components to be a single like product, the ITC departed from past practice in that it had previously found a single like product where the value of a component accounted for 50-70% of the final product's value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Plaintiffs maintain that a similar determination that components and blends are a single like product is appropriate in this action given that the Commission found that \"the ratio of the average unit value of ... subject HFC components to the average unit value of HFC blends ranged from [E to F] percent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Views\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Commission distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Outboard Engines from Japan\n   </em>\n   , noting that, in that proceeding, \"it determined a single like product, in part, based on its findings that there were significant differences in costs and values between the component and the finished product.... [A]lthough the component comprised a significant percentage of the value of the finished article, the Commission found that the upstream article (powerhead) had no separate market as it was internally consumed by the producer in the manufacture of another article.\" Def.'s Resp. at 30. Plaintiffs argue that the Commission's distinction is unavailing because it eliminates any difference between the Commission's consideration of the \"dedicated for use\" prong and the \"value added\" prong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply Br. at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Given that the ITC may reasonably place more weight on the finding that there were independent uses and markets for the HFC Components, and give little weight to the finding that the total cost of HFC Components was a high percentage of the HFC Blends, the ITC's consideration of the \"value added\" prong did not deviate from past practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiffs' limitation, however, ignores the data conveying the broader costs associated with creating the HFC Blends as marketable products. The Commission's questionnaires requested a data set to provide a full picture as to the magnitude and complexity of the processes of creating a final HFC Blend product from HFC Components. Therefore, the ITC acted reasonably in using this full dataset, rather than the limited and narrow data specifically relating to particular \"blending operations\" preferred by Plaintiffs.
