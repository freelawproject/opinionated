For the reasons set forth below, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action and thus the case should be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Bracken filed a complaint on September 16, 2015 (Docket # 1), and an amended complaint on November 4, 2015 (Docket # 14) (\"Am. Compl.\"). The amended complaint named MH Pillars Inc., Obopay, Inc. and Ultralight FS, Inc. as defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The complaint alleged that MH Pillars, under its trade name Payza and in conjunction with co-defendants Obopay, Inc. and Ultralight FS, Inc. (collectively, \"Obopay\"), provided \"money transfer services\" to Bracken's online business, Bidxcel, LLC, in addition to the general public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, 7. Bracken established a corporate account with MH Pillars, in the name of Bidxcel, in the fall of 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. At the time he filed the amended complaint, in November 2015, Bidxcel's account with MH Pillars had a balance of $38,871.30, representing payments to Bidxcel from customers. Id. \u00b6 8. Despite repeated requests, MH Pillars had refused to release the funds, claiming that the funds were frozen due to a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. MH Pillars \"improperly blamed the entire\n   situation on Obopay,\" whom it had employed as its agent for the distribution of funds throughout the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10-11. Pursuant to their agreement, Obopay agreed to supply MH Pillars with the required licensing to operate and provide services to its U.S. customers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but Obopay, in fact, \"was an illegitimate provider of [such] banking services,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. The investigation was ongoing as of the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Obopay moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Motion to Dismiss, filed Feb. 4, 2016 (Docket # 25). On December 29, 2016, the Court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice to renewal following jurisdictional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bracken v.

Dec. 29, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Bracken\n   </em>\n   \"). Obopay later entered into a stipulation of dismissal with Bracken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation of Discontinuance Against Obopay, Inc. and Ultraight [sic] FS, Inc., filed Mar. 6, 2017 (Docket # 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MH Pillars never responded to the complaint, however. Bracken obtained a Clerk's Certificate of Default on May 26, 2017 (Docket # 48) and then moved for a default judgment against MH Pillars,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Motion for Default Judgment, filed June 7, 2017 (Docket # 49). The motion papers included a declaration and documentary evidence supporting his request for an award of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affirmation of Dayton Haigney, in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for a Default Judgment, filed June 7, 2017 (Docket # 50) (\"Haigney Aff.\"). Bracken sought a judgment for $38,871.30.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 29, 2017, MH Pillars was ordered to show cause why a default judgment should not be entered in favor of Bracken for the relief requested in the amended complaint. (Docket # 51). MH Pillars did not appear or otherwise respond to the order to show cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Support of Default Judgment, filed Oct. 12, 2017 (Docket # 60) (\"Pl. Supp. Mem.\"), at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 1, 2017, the district court referred Bracken's motion for a default judgment to the undersigned for a report and recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order of Reference, dated Sept. 1, 2017 (Docket # 55). On September 6, 2017, this Court instructed Bracken to file a supplemental memorandum and related affidavits by September 20, 2017, providing the factual and legal bases for subject matter jurisdiction and for personal jurisdiction over MH Pillars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, dated Sept. 5, 2017 (Docket # 56). Bracken filed a supplemental memorandum of law in response to the Court's September 6 Order, but did not attach an affidavit or provide citations for factual statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Default Judgment, filed Sept. 20, 2017 (Docket # 57). Accordingly, the Court ordered Bracken to resubmit a memorandum of law providing citations for factual assertions and to supply an affidavit supporting any facts relevant to his arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, dated Sept. 28, 2017 (Docket # 58). On October 12, 2017, Bracken filed an amended memorandum of law and an affidavit from himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Supp. Mem.; Affidavit of Andrew Bracken, dated Oct. 12, 2017 (Docket # 59) (\"Bracken Aff.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    EFFECT OF ENTRY OF DEFAULT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The default entered in this case establishes MH Pillars's liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bambu Sales, Inc. v.

In the default judgment context, the only issue that usually needs to be decided is whether the plaintiff has provided adequate support for the damages or other relief he seeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    GAKM Res.

In other words, the contract created the obligation to make the payments that Bracken seeks here. Accordingly, Bracken's tort claims must assert some legal duty independent from the duty to \"pay [Bracken] the amounts [he] w[as] owed under the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For both his fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims, Bracken contends that MH Pillars violated either its duty to \"release payments when requested\" or \"refused to pay [Bracken] the money to which [he is] entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28.
