Sept. 15, 2014) (unpublished).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Petitioner was diagnosed with autism at 2 years of age, and was later also diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\"). It is undisputed that he is eligible for services under the IDEA. Petitioner attended school through second grade at Heritage Elementary, and then moved to Summit View Elementary for third and most of fourth grade, both District schools. In May of 2010, at the end of his fourth grade year, Petitioner's parents decided to withdraw him from Summit View and enroll Petitioner at the Firefly Autism House (\"Firefly,\" previously known as the Alta Vista School), a private school that specializes in the education of children with autism. It is undisputed that Petitioner has been able to access education at Firefly where he is making academic, social and behavioral progress. Petitioner's parents believe that he stopped making meaningful educational/functional progress during second grade year, which continued until he withdrew from Summit View prior to his fifth grade year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Petitioner and his parents argue that the final IEP presented by the District in November of 2010 was not reasonably calculated to provide him with a FAPE, as it was not substantively different than his prior IEPs that failed to evidence progress on his educational/functional goals and, in turn, had failed to provide an appropriate education in the past. Moreover, despite his maladaptive and disruptive behaviors that prevented his ability to access education, the District failed to conduct a functional behavioral assessment, implement appropriate positive behavioral interventions, supports or strategies, or develop an appropriate Behavior Intervention Plan (\"BIP\"). Therefore, Petitioner's parents rejected the educational placement and IEP proposed by the District in April of 2010, and they unilaterally enrolled him at Firefly prior to the start of his fifth grade year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Petitioner's parents subsequently sought reimbursement for Petitioner's private school tuition expenses and the reasonable transportation costs and the District refused. After a due process hearing, the ALJ with the Colorado Office of Administrative Courts issued an Agency Decision concluding that the District provided Petitioner with a FAPE and, as such, did not violate the IDEA. The ALJ found the evidence established that Petitioner made \"some measurable progress\" towards the academic and functional goals in his IEPs during the time that he was enrolled in the District, as well as contemplated in the April 2010 IEP drafted for his fifth grade year. The ALJ concluded that Petitioner and his parents did not meet their burden of establishing a claim for the costs of the Petitioner's unilateral private school placement under the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioner and his parents then filed this lawsuit, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(2)(A), seeking review and reversal of the ALJ's Agency Decision, and requesting an order awarding them the costs associated with his education placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   They argued that the District's failed to provide Petitioner with a FAPE. Specifically, Petitioner's parents referred me to the lack of past progress on the goals and objectives in Petitioner's previous IEPs, the inadequacy of the proposed April 2010 IEP, and the District's failure to perform a functional behavioral assessment and develop an appropriate BIP for him. They argued that Petitioner's lack of progress, and a proposed IEP that was a continuation of that pattern, coupled with the failure to provide reporting and behavior assessment/intervention, resulted in a denial of a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After an extensive review of the administrative record, I ruled that while the additions and modification in his IEP objectives from second grade and continuing through the April 2010 IEP proposed for his fifth grade year \"did not reveal immense educational growth, they were sufficient to show a pattern of, at the least, minimal progress.\" Specifically, I determined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   While some of the objectives carried over from year to year, and some are only slightly modified, it is clear that the expectation in the objectives are increased over time. Petitioner's past IEPs revealed a pattern of some progress on his education and functional goals, and that the proposed IEP for the fifth grade continues that pattern....I disagree with Petitioner's parents' argument that the modifications were insufficient to show any meaningful progress. Rather, I agree with the ALJ that Petitioner made progress towards his academic and functional goals in his IEPs and although this does not mean that he achieved every objective, or that he made progress on every goal, the evidence shows that he received educational benefit while enrolled in the District. As such, Petitioner's parents have failed to show that the District's IEPs-both past and proposed for the future-were not reasonably calculated to provide him with some educational benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In so ruling, I relied upon the Tenth Circuit's standard of assessing whether a school district has provided a FAPE; specifically, whether the student's IEP was calculated to confer an educational benefit that is merely more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson R2-J Sch.

The District argues that although the IEP it offered to Petitioner at the time his parents placed him at Firefly in April of 2010 was not \"ideal,\" it was a reasonable calculation of educational progress. The District points to various objectives in the April 2010 IEP-in reading comprehension, writing, math, and communication, as well as inter-/intrapersonal goals based on his behavior problems-that were increased or enhanced from the prior IEP objectives. [Doc # 52 pg 10-12] The District further argues that Petitioner's circumstances results in significant impediments to his ability to access and participate in his education. These include his autism, ADHD, \"exceedingly low cognitive skills,\" serious behavior problems, and his pronounced sensory needs. The District contends that the April 2010 IEP addressed Petitioner's special and unique circumstances and it provides for challenging educational and functional objectives given those restrictive circumstances. In support of this argument, the District refers me to recent decisions that have applied the new standard and determined that the student made sufficient progress, when such progress/goals were viewed relative to the severity/impact of his or her disabilities, so that the school provided a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Educ. of Albuquerque Pub.

While Petitioner's educational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances, the Supreme Court was clear that every child, including Petitioner, should have the chance to meet challenging objectives. In this case, Petitioner's past educational and functional progress-as evidenced by the changes to his yearly IEPs after second grade-was minimal at best. Those changes consisted of only updates and minor or slight increases in the objectives, or carrying over the same goals from year to year, or abandonment if they could not be meet. The April 2010 IEP was clearly just a continuation of the District's educational plan that had previously only resulted in minimal academic and functional progress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition, I agree with Petitioner that the minimal progress evidenced in his educational plan, and culminating with the proposed April 2010 IEP, was clearly impacted by the District's lack of success in providing a program that would address Petitioner's maladaptive behaviors. During my initial review of this case, I found that Petitioner's increasingly disruptive behaviors were impacting his ability to meet his educational goals. The record revealed that the District was attempting to address Petitioner's behavioral issues, as I determined that \"the District was, at the very least, addressing Petitioner's behavioral issues and that a new behavior plan was deemed necessary and was in progress at the time that Petitioner withdrew from the District.\" Thus, the evidence revealed that while the District was unable \"to manage Petitioner's escalating behavioral issues at the time of his withdrawal, it was in the process of reassessing his BIP in order to address the issue\" and I therefore ruled that the Petitioner was unable to show that the District's inability to manage his behaviors denied him a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. v. Douglas Cty., supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204548439\">\n    2014 WL 4548439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At oral arguments the District conceded that there was no formal plan addressing Petitioner's behavioral issues at the time his April 2010 IEP was proposed, but it argued that functional behavioral assessment principles and goals were imbedded into his IEPs and were being implemented with the cooperation of Petitioner's parents. The District again noted that a formal BIP was in progress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The District's inability to develop a formal plan or properly address Plaintiff's behaviors that had clearly disrupted his access to educational progress starting in his second grade year does, under the new standard articulated by the Supreme Court in this case, impact the assessment of whether the educational program it offered to Petitioner was or was not reasonably calculated to enable him to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances. The District's inability to properly address Petitioner's behaviors that, in turn, negatively impacted his ability to make progress on his educational and functional goals, also cuts against the reasonableness of the April 2010 IEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paris Sch.

The Tenth Circuit's characterization of this case conforms with my review and conclusions regarding the nature of the evidence of record. And, it is axiomatic that because this was \"without a question a close case\" under the previous \"merely more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   standard,\" the facts of this case do not meet the rigor of the undeniably higher standard set by the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. v.

While I am not faulting the IEP team's work, nor am I implying that they were looking to provide Petitioner with \"only the bare minimum,\" the April 2010 IEP that was developed was a continuation of the poor progress on his educational and functional goals of his past IEPs. And, as such, the District was not successful in creating an educational program that was reasonably calculated to enable Petitioner to make progress in light of his circumstances, in order to provide him with a substantive FAPE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, I note the District's argument that Petitioner's progress since he enrolled at Firefly is not relevant to the inquiry of whether the educational program it offered to Petitioner was or was not reasonably calculated to enable him to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances. The District contends that whatever the quality of the services provided to Petitioner at Firefly, they cannot serve as the benchmark or as comparison for the appropriateness of the District's educational plan in the April 2010 IEP. The record at the time of my initial review was that the parties agreed that Petitioner was receiving a FAPE and making educational progress at Firefly. Although Petitioner's parents now aver that he has experienced rapid and substantial progress in his educational, functional and behavioral objectives at Firefly-in support of their argument that the District could have provided him with more challenging functional and academic goals despite his unique circumstances-I do not consider this claim as I have ruled that the District failed to provide Petitioner with a FAPE without considering his subsequent progress/advancement at Firefly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, I conclude that Petitioner and his parent have met their burden to\n   prove that the District's April 2010 IEP failed to create an educational plan that was reasonably calculated to enable Petitioner to make progress, even in light of his unique circumstances. The IEP was not appropriately ambitious because it did not give Petitioner the chance to meet challenging objectives under his particular circumstances. Specifically, the IEP proposed by the District was not reasonably calculated for Petitioner to \"achieve academic success, attain self-sufficiency, and contribute to society that are substantially equal to the opportunities afforded children without disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. v.

DAMAGES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As a final matter, I address the District's claims related to the limitation of Petitioner's damages if I determine, as I have, that Petitioner's educational plan, culminating in the proposed April 2010 IEP, was not providing Petitioner with a FAPE in violation of the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The District first contends that because Petitioner \"disclaimed\" review of an IEP subsequently offered to him by the District in November 2010 on appeal to the Tenth Circuit-by arguing that although it was no more adequate that the April 2010 IEP, it was crafted after Petitioner enrolled at Firefly and \"so it is not relevant here\"-Petitioner is only entitled to tuition reimbursement from enrollment of Firefly in April 2010 until November of 2010. The District provides me with no authority for its claim that Petitioner's alleged failure to challenge the November 2010 IEP in the appellate process would foreclose its right to reimbursement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(10)(C)(ii) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.148\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Instead, the law is clear that parents are entitled to reimbursement under the IDEA if: (1) the school district violated the IDEA; and (2) the education provided by the private school provides the child with a FAPE in that it is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\n   <em>\n    Thompson R2-J Sch.
