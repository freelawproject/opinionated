Esper in his official capacity as Secretary of the Army.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hambrick asserts claims for race and gender retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Right Act of 1964. Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Secretary Esper asks the Court to dismiss count two and part of count three of Mr. Hambrick's third amended complaint because the Court may not review as part of this action the Army's decisions concerning security clearance matters. (Doc. 28). For the reasons explained below, the Court grants the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) enables a defendant to move to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a district court accepts as true the allegations in the complaint and construes the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brophy v. Jiangbo Pharms. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074895\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1296/#p1301\">\n    781 F.3d 1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1301 (11th Cir. 2015). The Court presents Mr. Hambrick's factual allegations accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since June 20, 2002, Mr. Hambrick, an African-American man, has worked for the United States Army at the Redstone Army\n   Garrison in Huntsville, Alabama. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4). From October 2012 until February 2014, Mr. Hambrick worked in a GS-11 position as an EEO Specialist. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As an EEO Specialist, Mr. Hambrick was responsible for receiving, processing, and investigating claims of employment discrimination at Redstone Arsenal and counseling employees who made allegations of workplace discrimination. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 2). Mr. Hambrick reported to Jacqueline Williams and Martha Miller. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 1). Mr. Hambrick received \"top performance ratings and was considered a very dependable employee.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 5). Supervisors praised Mr. Hambrick for \"frequently exceed[ing] standards,\" and Mr. Hambrick's last performance evaluation before his EEO activity states that Mr. Hambrick's \"co-workers have a high regard for his knowledge and will seek him out when they need a second opinion.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2011 and November 2013, Mr. Hambrick filed EEO complaints against his supervisors. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 8). Mr. Hambrick has not provided details about the nature of these complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At some point during Mr. Hambrick's employment, the agency placed a GS-12 program analyst in the EEO office. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 10). Mr. Hambrick did not qualify for the GS-12 program analyst position because the position was available only through management's intern program. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 10). Therefore, Mr. Hambrick believed that he could not advance beyond a GS-11 position. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 10). According to Mr. Hambrick, \"[h]is GS-11 status was his career ceiling in the EEO office.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2013, after management placed the GS-12 program analyst in the EEO office, Mr. Hambrick sent emails to his supervisors and \"complained that he was performing the same duties as a high level Caucasian female intern, Ms. Corlew, who as a GS-12, was receiving substantially more pay than Mr. Hambrick.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 11). Mr. Hambrick contends that from 2010 through December 2013, supervisors assigned him more work and less favorable work assignments than Ms. Corlew. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 14). In a December 18, 2013 email to Ms. Williams, Ms. Miller, and Deputy Commander Curtis Clark, Mr. Hambrick stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I show more initiative th[a]n your analyst and yet my pay grade is less ... not fair or right. Without an explanation of these disparities, I consider this subtle discrimination. Like I've said time and time before, I would like to be treated the same as all of the other folks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Doc. 27, \u00b6 12). In his email, Mr. Hambrick also stated that the job duties that he and Ms. Corlew performed required the same knowledge, skill, and responsibility, but Ms. Corlew had no previous EEO experience that justified a $14,500 salary difference. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2014, Mr. Hambrick filed an EEO complaint. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 22). Mr. Hambrick has not provided details about the nature of the January 2014 EEO complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Hambrick alleges that after he complained about the agency placing Ms. Corlew in the GS-12 position, his working relationship with Ms. Miller and Ms. Williams became \"very strained.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 15). Ms. Miller and Ms. Williams \"constantly ... harassed\" Mr. Hambrick for \"extremely minor issues.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 16). According to Mr. Hambrick, the \"constant degrading\" and \"verbal abuse\" continued on a daily basis, and Mr. Hambrick believed that Ms. Miller and Ms. Williams were belittling him to try to force him to resign. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 17). In addition, Ms. Miller asked Redstone police to provide \"close patrol\" near the EEO office and to\n   walk through the building occasionally. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 4, 2014, Ms. Williams called Mr. Hambrick into the conference room in the EEO office and gave him a letter of counseling. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 7). According to Mr. Hambrick, the letter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   criticized [him] for a series of email inquiries he had made in December 2013 regarding the handling of a new GS-12 position in the EEO office, which would have constituted a promotion for him, and his feeling that he was being treated in a discriminatory fashion due to his race and sex as it relates to job duties and pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Doc. 27, \u00b6 9). The counseling letter revoked Mr. Hambrick's access to the internet and a job-related database, both of which Mr. Hambrick needed to do his job. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 19). Before he received the counseling letter on February 4, 2014, Mr. Hambrick had not been disciplined. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 6). Mr. Hambrick believes that Ms. Williams issued the February 4, 2014 counseling letter in retaliation for his complaints of race, sex, and pay discrimination because Ms. Williams and Ms. Miller knew about Mr. Hambrick's prior EEO activity. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Hambrick acknowledged the counseling, signed the letter, and went to his office. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 20). Ms. Williams asked Mr. Hambrick to return to her office. Mr. Hambrick refused, and Ms. Miller ordered Mr. Hambrick to leave the office and take the rest of the day off. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 23). Mr. Hambrick had parked his car in a lot off base that morning, so Mr. Hambrick called security to request an escort to his car. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When Ms. Miller and Ms. Williams learned that Mr. Hambrick called security, Ms. Miller called Redstone Arsenal's Emergency Services Director and Chief of Police and reported that Mr. Hambrick had \"created a disturbance in the office.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 26). Mr. Hambrick contends that Ms. Miller knew that her report to police about him was \"false, exaggerated, and misleading.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 27). Mr. Hambrick also maintains that Ms. Miller told EEO staff that he had been disorderly when Ms. Miller knew that this information was not true. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When police arrived at the EEO office, Mr. Hambrick was waiting quietly outside for a ride to his car. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 31). At Ms. Miller's direction, police questioned, searched, handcuffed, and arrested Mr. Hambrick. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 32). Police later released Mr. Hambrick and instructed him not to return to the EEO office. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 32). One of Mr. Hambrick's co-workers in the EEO office witnessed Mr. Hambrick's arrest and stated that \"considering the tense race relations in this office[,] I can't rule out that intolerance wasn't a factor preceding the arrest.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 19, 2014, Ms. Miller advised Mr. Hambrick that he could return to full duty on February 24, 2014, but Mr. Hambrick could not work in the EEO office. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 38). Ms. Miller told Mr. Hambrick to report to a non-supervisory safety specialist who was located in a different building. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 38). Mr. Hambrick alleges that in violation of the rules governing civilian personnel, Ms. Miller transferred him to a position outside of his job classification, under the supervision of a non-supervisory employee, to an office having no connection with his EEO duties. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 39). Since his return to work at the end of February 2014, Mr. Hambrick has not been allowed to return to the EEO office or the building where the office is located, and Mr. Hambrick has not received meaningful work. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 40). According to Mr. Hambrick, he \"merely report[s] to work and occup[ies] a desk.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 19, 2014, the agency delivered a memo to Mr. Hambrick. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 42). The memo was dated March 10, 2014. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 42). In the memo, Ruby Childers, Redstone Arsenal's Security Manager, advised that Redstone had suspended Mr. Hambrick's access to classified information and IT systems because of Mr. Hambrick's \"disorderly conduct\" and his \"argumentative, aggressive, and non-compliant behavior.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 42). Ms. Childers's memo informed Mr. Hambrick that \"pending further adjudication of your case, you will be reassigned to non-sensitive duties.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 28, 2014, Ms. Miller gave Mr. Hambrick notice of a proposed 10-day suspension for \"creating a disturbance in the workplace and discourtesy\" related to the events on February 4, 2014. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 55). On June 17, 2014, Deputy Commander Clark converted the proposed suspension to a final decision and suspended Mr. Hambrick for 10 days without pay. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 57). The suspension was effective June 23, 2014. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 57). Mr. Hambrick had named Deputy Commander Clark as a \"discriminating official\" in at least two of his (Mr. Hambrick's) EEO complaints. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 58).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After Deputy Commander Clark officially suspended Mr. Hambrick without pay, Mr. Hambrick learned that Deputy Commander Clark previously had denied without explanation a \"time off\" award for which Mr. Hambrick had been recommended based on Mr. Hambrick's service between December 14, 2012 and October 5, 2013. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60). Based on Deputy Commander Clark's decision to deny the \"time off\" award, Mr. Hambrick has one less merit award than other similarly-situated GS-11 personnel which, according to Mr. Hambrick, makes him less competitive for promotional opportunities. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 62). Mr. Hambrick alleges that all other non-supervisory female employees in Redstone's EEO office, including Ms. Corlew, received their \"time off\" awards, and none of these female employees filed EEO complaints. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 63, 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 24, 2014, Ms. Childers submitted an incident report to the Department of Defense's Central Adjudication Facility or CAF and formally sought suspension of Mr. Hambrick's security clearance. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49). CAF is the entity that determines whether to suspend or revoke an Army employee's security clearance. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 48). In the incident report, Ms. Childers stated that Mr. Hambrick posed a security threat and had \"psychological conditions\" which made Mr. Hambrick \"unfit for duty.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 53). Mr. Hambrick alleges that the incident report contained false and misleading information. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 49). According to Mr. Hambrick, the agency submitted the incident report and sought to revoke his security clearance in retaliation for his EEO complaints. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 50). Mr. Hambrick contends that since Ms. Childers submitted the incident report, CAF has not acted upon Ms. Childers's report or suspended his security clearance. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 78). Mr. Hambrick continues to perform \"meaningless tasks\" at a desk away from his EEO work station. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 27, \u00b6 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because Mr. Hambrick has not performed work in the EEO office since February 2014, Mr. Hambrick contends that he has missed three annual performance evaluation cycles, and his job application and resume will have a gap in service. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 77). On at least three occasions during 2014, Mr. Hambrick's supervisors denied requests for leave without pay, sick leave, and annual leave. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In February 2015, Deputy Commander Clark called Mr. Hambrick to his office to discuss Mr. Hambrick's pending EEO claims and to attempt to force Mr. Hambrick to settle the claims. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 65). The proposed settlement involved reinstatement of Mr. Hambrick's security clearance and his transfer to another Army facility out of state. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 67(e) ). Specifically, Redstone Arsenal offered to \"reverse the\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   suspension of [Mr. Hambrick's] access to classified information and Information Technology (IT) Systems.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 67(e);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-3, p. 2, \u00b6 3(e) ) (emphasis added). Mr. Hambrick asserts that the Army's attempt to transfer him \"to Fort Leonard Wood is a clear indication of the lack of validity of the security clearance issues raised by the Defendant against Mr. Hambrick.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Hambrick contends that on the Army's side, \"[a]ll management figures were involved with the settlement discussions, including agency counsel,\" but his attorney was not included in the settlement discussions until agency counsel contacted his attorney to ask for \"permission to communicate with Mr. Hambrick to obtain his signature on the settlement documents.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 69, 71). Mr. Hambrick asserts that \"Mr. Curtis' attempt to force a resolution of Mr. Hambrick's EEO complaints without the knowledge of his counsel was another act of retaliation and a retaliatory hostile work environment.\" (Doc. 27, \u00b6 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to Mr. Hambrick, Ms. Miller, Ms. Williams, and Deputy Commander Clark have resigned from their positions with the Army. (Doc. 27, \u00b6 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on these allegations, Mr. Hambrick asserts four counts of Title VII race and gender retaliation claims against Secretary Esper. In his third amended complaint, Mr. Hambrick alleges that Secretary Esper, through his managerial employees, retaliated against Mr. Hambrick by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Submitting a false police report about Mr. Hambrick's conduct on February 4, 2014, (Count I, Doc. 27, \u00b6 82);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 Submitting false information to CAF as a basis to revoke Mr. Hambrick's security clearance, (Count II, Doc. 27, \u00b6 83);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Transferring Mr. Hambrick from the EEO specialist position to a desk with no duties for over three months before officially seeking to revoke his security clearance; issuing a 10-day suspension without pay; and denying the \"time off\" award that Mr. Hambrick earned, (Count III, Doc. 27, \u00b6 84);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Attempting to force Mr. Hambrick to settle his EEO claims by requiring him to move out of state without notifying Mr. Hambrick's attorney, (Count IV, \u00b6 85).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Secretary argues that the Court must dismiss count two and part of count three of Mr. Hambrick's third amended complaint to the extent that these retaliation claims concern security clearance investigations and determinations because, according to the Secretary, \"[i]t is well-established that government agency security investigations and determinations are not reviewable as alleged retaliation or other discrimination under Title VII and other discrimination statutes.\" (Doc. 23, p. 4) (citing\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Navy v.

The Supreme Court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The grant of a clearance requires an affirmative act of discretion on the part of the granting official.

A clearance does not equate with passing judgment upon an individual's character. Instead, it is only an attempt to predict his possible future behavior and to assess whether, under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons, he might compromise sensitive information. It may be based, to be sure, upon past or present conduct, but it also may be based upon concerns completely unrelated to conduct, such as having close relatives residing in a country hostile to the United States. \"[T]o be denied [clearance] on unspecified grounds in no way implies disloyalty or any other repugnant characteristic.\"\n   <em>\n    Molerio v.
