Although GEMSA initially brought these cases in the district court for the Eastern District of Texas, the cases were transferred here, where venue was proper including because the defendant companies' principal places of business are in California.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    3:17-cv-02178-WHA, ECF No. 50.

Nothing close to that is present here, where GEMSA has demonstrated that it knows how to sue EFF in Australian court, how to litigate against others in this court, including regarding the patent at issue, has been properly served, and failed to enter any appearance, including to contest service or\n    jurisdiction. This factor also favors granting default judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <strong>\n     6.

The only relief that EFF seeks is a declaration (1) that the Australian Injunction is repugnant to the United States Constitution and the laws of California and the United States; and (2) that the Australian injunction cannot be recognized or enforced in the United States.
