Our circuit said as much when it held that \"state law can create interests that support standing in federal courts. If that were not so, there would not be Article III standing in most diversity cases, including run-of-the-mill contract and property disputes. State statutes constitute state law that can create such interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Cantrell v.

While this conclusion pre-dates\n   <em>\n    Spokeo I\n   </em>\n   , nothing there undercuts it. To be sure, state law\n   cannot create Article III standing where none exists under our federal precedents. But there is no good reason why the judgment of a state legislature should be treated as less important than that of Congress in deciding when the violation of a statutory grant in itself amounts to a real and concrete injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our circuit has adopted decisions from sister circuits to hold that \"an alleged procedural violation [of a statute] can by itself manifest concrete injury where Congress conferred the procedural right to protect a plaintiff's concrete interests and where the procedural violation presents 'a real risk of harm' to that concrete interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1112\">\n    867 F.3d at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (brackets in original).

Concrete Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plain language of BIPA drives the standing analysis in this case. BIPA expresses the judgments of the Illinois legislature about the rights of Illinois citizens with respect to the collection of personal biometric data by corporations and businesses.\n   <em>\n    In re Facebook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138941\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/185/1155/#p1159\">\n    185 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1169 (citing 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/5(b) ). Specifically, BIPA manifests the Illinois legislature's conclusions that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) Biometrics are uniquely sensitive identifiers. \"Biometrics are unlike other unique identifiers... [and] are biologically unique to the individual; therefore, once compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at heightened risk for identity theft, and is likely to withdraw from biometric-facilitated transactions.\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/5(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) Biometric technology is a new frontier subject to unpredictable developments. \"The full ramifications of biometric technology are not fully known.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138941\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/185/1155/#p1159\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 14/5(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) People are apprehensive of transactions involving their biometrics. The \"overwhelming majority of members of the public are weary of the use of biometrics when such information is tied to finances and other personal information\" and are \"deterred from partaking in biometric identifier-facilitated transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138941\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/185/1155/#p1159\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 14/5(d)-(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (4) Regulation of biometric collection, use, and storage serves the public interest. The \"public welfare, security and safety will be served by regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, retention, and destruction of biometric identifiers and information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14/5(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To address these concerns and protect the rights of its residents to control their biometric information, the Illinois legislature enacted several measures. Section 15(a) of BIPA requires private entities possessing biometric data to publish written policies on data retention and destruction. Section 15(b) provides that biometric data may not be obtained without (1) written notice that biometric data is at issue, (2) written notice of why and for how long the data is being collected and stored, and (3) written consent from the subject. Sections 15(c) and (d) limit the sale, trade, and disclosure of biometric data, and Section 15(e) sets security standards for storing data. Plaintiffs have sued under Sections 15(a) and (b) for lack of notice and consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   These provisions, along with the plain text of BIPA as a whole, leave little question that the Illinois legislature codified a right of privacy in personal biometric information. There is equally little doubt about the legislature's judgment that a violation of BIPA's procedures would cause actual and concrete harm. BIPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   vested in Illinois residents the right to control their biometric information by requiring notice before collection and giving residents the power to say no by withholding consent. As the Illinois legislature found, these procedural protections are particularly crucial in our digital world because technology now permits the wholesale collection and storage of an individual's unique biometric identifiers-identifiers that cannot be changed if compromised or misused. When an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air. The precise harm the Illinois legislature sought to prevent is then realized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Consequently, the abrogation of the procedural rights mandated by BIPA necessarily amounts to a concrete injury. This injury is worlds away from the trivial harm of a mishandled zip code or credit card receipt. A violation of the BIPA notice and consent procedures infringes the very privacy rights the Illinois legislature sought to protect by enacting BIPA.

In those cases, the plaintiffs indisputably knew that their biometric data would be collected before they accepted the services offered by the businesses involved.\n   <em>\n    Vigil\n   </em>\n   had the specific fact of prior written notice and click-through consent. In each case, the plaintiffs had sufficient notice to make a meaningful decision about whether to permit the data collection. That factual difference makes these cases of little value in addressing the allegations in the consolidated complaint that Facebook afforded plaintiffs no notice and no opportunity to say no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Facebook's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   is also misplaced. It highlights a comment in a footnote that a plaintiff might have a hard time showing standing under FCRA provisions \"which do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   turn on any alleged reporting inaccuracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1112\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1116 n.2 (emphasis in original). This point appears to be a further elaboration on Facebook's \"real harm\" contention and\n   is unpersuasive for the same reasons. But even taken on its own, it is again of little relevance because BIPA, unlike FCRA, targets the unauthorized collection of information in the first instance. The two statutes are sufficiently distinct so that\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   's FCRA concerns simply do not apply here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eichenberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266316\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/979/#p983\">\n    876 F.3d at 983-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Spokeo I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   distinguishable because Video Privacy Protection Act, unlike FCRA, identifies a substantive right to privacy). In addition, as the footnote itself suggests, the comment is likely dicta because the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   did not allege a claim independent of a reporting inaccuracy.\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1112\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1116 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition to its legal arguments, Facebook has submitted its user agreement and data policy, deposition excerpts and other extrinsic evidence to contend that BIPA's notice and consent requirements were actually satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 227 at 10-11. While that may or may not prove true in the end, the salient point for present purposes is that notice and consent are inextricably intertwined with the merits of plaintiffs' claims.
