BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Beth Harrison has been an employee of Defendant The Procter &amp; Gamble Company Distributing, LLC (\"P&amp;G\") since 2000. Defendant has worked in several different departments at P&amp;G and currently works in P&amp;G's Trademark Licensing department. (Doc. 34, at 13)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . However, for purposes of this suit, most relevant activity took place while Plaintiff was employed in P&amp;G's U.S. Customs Compliance department as a customs broker from August 2011-May 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For nearly all of Plaintiff's tenure with P&amp;G, Plaintiff has been approved to take certified leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") as needed to care for her son, who suffers from a serious health condition that requires life-long care and\n   can \"flare up\" intermittently and unpredictably. (Doc. 1, at 10). There was no significant friction between Plaintiff and Defendant arising from Plaintiff's taking FMLA leave for her son on an as needed basis before 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The changing factor that appears to have been the catalyst for the conflict leading to this lawsuit was the arrival of a new manager in the U.S. Customs Compliance department, Barbara Konerman, in February 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34, at 3). According to P&amp;G, it was around this time that Plaintiff began having issues with attendance and with maintaining a consistent work schedule as required. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Defendant alleges that \"throughout 2012 and much of 2013, [Plaintiff's] availability was an issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Plaintiff frequently notified Ms. Konerman that Plaintiff would be coming in late to work, leaving work early, or missing a work day entirely with very little notice, often same day notification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34-1). It is undisputed that many of these absences were for FMLA reasons, including doctor's appointments for Plaintiff's son. However, Plaintiff also admitted to unilaterally deciding that she could arrive at work at varying hours, despite having received instructions to the contrary. (Doc. 29, at 34-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Barbara Konerman had a meeting with Plaintiff on August 6, 2013 to discuss the perceived problems with Plaintiff's unavailability during core work hours. (Doc. 34, at 3-4; Doc. 40-3, at 64). Plaintiff was instructed on the need to provide proper advance notification for FMLA absences in non-emergency situations. (Doc. 40-4, at 20). Additionally, as a result of her continued problems with unavailability, Plaintiff's ability to work from home was limited to one day per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Typically, employees in the U.S. Customs Compliance department were permitted to work from home 40-50% of the time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32, at 31-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   P&amp;G uses an annual employee performance rating system wherein each employee receives either a \"1\", \"2\", or \"3\" ranking, with a 1 indicating that the employee exceeded expectations, a 2 meaning an employee met expectations, and a 3 meaning an employee performed below expectations. (Doc. 34, at 3 fn. 2). The scores are distributed in a bell curve for each department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's annual review scores had varied in the years before her 2011-2015 stint in the U.S. Customs Compliance department. Plaintiff had earned a 3 ranking for the 2011 fiscal year, the year immediately preceding her transfer to U.S. Customs Compliance, reflecting her performance in the Baby Care Regulatory department. (Doc. 29, at 18). Plaintiff automatically received a 2 rating for the 2012 fiscal year as she had transferred to a new department. (Doc. 40-3, at 65). At the August 6, 2013 meeting referenced above, Plaintiff was informed that she would be receiving below a \"2\" rating for the 2013 fiscal year. (Doc. 40-3, at 64). Plaintiff was informed on October 18, 2013 that she had in fact received a 3 rating. (Doc. 34, at 5). As a result of her 3 rating, Plaintiff was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\") on November 1, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.1.b,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the negative feedback she received for fiscal year 2013, Plaintiff began seeking to transfer to another position within P&amp;G. (Doc. 29, at 110-11). She also began to show signs of distress at work, including episodes where she lost control and cried at her desk for extended periods of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120-23). Plaintiff had been encouraged by Barbara Konerman to apply for FMLA leave for herself based on excessive absences due to personal illness (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96, 110, 118), and in late November 2013 Plaintiff successfully applied for FMLA leave for her depression. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As part of Defendant's continuing feedback regarding Plaintiff's perceived attendance issues, Ms. Konerman issued to Plaintiff a document titled \"2014 Performance Expectations\" on December 13, 2013. (Doc. 40-4, at 23). The document identified additional restrictions on Plaintiff's schedule and on how she would be able to use and report FMLA leave in the future. Plaintiff had previously been allowed to take unpaid leave for FMLA leave if she wanted to conserve her vacation time, but moving forward Plaintiff was required to use vacation time for her FMLA leave for the first 10 work days of absences, and could use unpaid time off afterwards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This change was not applied only to Plaintiff, and was in fact a reflection of a change in P&amp;G company policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33, at 21-22 (deposition testimony of former HR manager Tayyib (\"Ty\") Rashid) ). P&amp;G company policy also required any employee taking vacation time to take at least 4 hours at a time; accordingly, Plaintiff was required to use at least 4 hours of vacation time for any FMLA leave, no matter how long any particular appointment actually took. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's work from home privileges were entirely revoked at this time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, the document required Plaintiff to be available to work from the \"core hours\" of 9:00 a.m.-5:30 p.m. as opposed to her previous core hours of 9:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant continued to have concerns regarding Plaintiff's non-FMLA absences and her failure to timely report anticipated FMLA appointments. Of particular note was an instance on December 16, 2013, when Plaintiff requested leave to attend a funeral on December 19, 2013. (Doc. 34, at 7). Plaintiff's request stated that she would be attending a \"visitation, funeral, and burial\" on the 19th. (Doc. 29-1, at 82). Plaintiff's leave request was granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The visitation and funeral service in question was actually held on the evening of the 18th. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83). Plaintiff did not attend any of the funeral related events on the 19th; during the time of the burial, Plaintiff was at home sending messages to a colleague in a different department at P&amp;G inquiring about a transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84). This incident damaged Defendant's trust in Plaintiff's credibility. (Doc. 34, at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 8, 2014, Ms. Konerman sent Plaintiff an email imposing an additional requirement on Plaintiff's use of FMLA leave. (Doc. 40-3, at 119). Moving forward, Plaintiff would be required to provide to P&amp;G a note signed by a doctor for each FMLA appointment. The notes were required to contain the doctor's name, date of visit, time left, and time arrived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff's FMLA leave increased after she began taking FMLA leave for her own condition as well as her son's. Ms. Konerman accordingly informed Plaintiff on January 30, 2014 that a portion of Plaintiff's responsibilities would be reassigned to other employees in the U.S. Customs Compliance department in response. (Doc. 29-1, at 119). During that time period, Plaintiff was on FMLA leave approximately 25% of the time, and a proportionate percentage of her responsibilities were reassigned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 2, 2014, in response to the reassignment of a portion of her responsibilities, Plaintiff contacted her HR representative at P&amp;G, Ty Rashid, to claim that Ms. Konerman was retaliating against her for taking FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Rashid and Tracy Stanton, an HR Administrator at P&amp;G, met with Plaintiff on February 4, 2014, to discuss her concerns. (Doc. 34, at 8-9). Plaintiff outlined her concerns regarding her decrease in work responsibilities, her newly imposed requirement to use vacation time for FMLA leave, and her belief that her continued failure to successfully be reassigned to a new job at P&amp;G was due to Ms. Konerman's retaliation for FMLA use. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-1, at 15-20 (Tracy\n   Stanton's notes of the meeting) ). Plaintiff also generally stated her belief that Ms. Konerman was \"aggressive\" toward Plaintiff and generally unwilling to accommodate Plaintiff's need for FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Rashid explained that Plaintiff's decrease in workload was necessary given her FMLA leave removing her from work for a significant portion of the time and that Plaintiff's 3 rating and ongoing PIP were significant factors affecting her ability to be hired at a transfer position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Rashid also agreed to Plaintiff's request that he be present at future meetings between Plaintiff and Ms. Konerman regarding Plaintiff's performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff indicated at the end of this meeting that her concerns had been addressed by Mr. Rashid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Shortly afterwards, Jason Hall, Barbara Konerman's supervisor, transitioned Plaintiff from reporting to Ms. Konerman to reporting directly to him. (Doc. 33-1, at 27). This was done out of concern for both Plaintiff and Ms. Konerman, who was becoming increasingly distressed by the difficulties associated with managing Plaintiff. (Doc. 31, at 28). Plaintiff was in favor of this transition when informed on February 14, 2014. (Doc. 33-1, at 27). However, Plaintiff reiterated her suicidal thoughts to Mr. Hall in a meeting on February 18. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Due to [redacted], as well as the results of a recent audit demonstrating that Plaintiff's work product was deficient in multiple ways, Plaintiff was sent out for a fitness-for-duty exam on March 4, 2014. (Doc. 34, at 11). As part of her exam, Plaintiff was interviewed in detail by an independent examiner, Dr. Chris Modrall, Ph. D. (Doc. 40-3, at 174). Dr. Modrall prepared a detailed report for P&amp;G based on this interview, as well as a discussion between Dr. Modrall and Plaintiff's treating therapist, Valerie Wevers, LPCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174-88). Dr. Modrall's report stated her opinion that Plaintiff should not return to work immediately as a result of her emotional fitness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185). The report suggested that Plaintiff go on short term disability until a future evaluation deemed her fit to return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 186). The report also stated that \"it would be beneficial to let [Plaintiff] transfer to another position given Plaintiff's ingrained distrust of Ms. Konerman and Mr. Hall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187). Following the exam, Plaintiff left work and entered into a treatment center for two to three weeks. (Doc. 29, at 356). Plaintiff returned to work on June 25, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 26, 2014, while Plaintiff was on her leave of absence, she contacted Ty Rashid and requested an accommodation in the form of a transfer to another department, citing Dr. Modrall's statement that such a move would be beneficial. (Doc. 33-1. at 109-10). Mr. Rashid responded that, as Plaintiff was still able to perform the essential duties of a customs broker despite her disability, it was P&amp;G's position that a transfer was not an appropriate accommodation for disability status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109). Mr. Rashid requested that Plaintiff communicate with her doctor and contact him if there were any accommodations she required to perform her role as a customs broker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff reiterated her desire to transfer, but requested no other accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally while Plaintiff was on leave, she made a complaint through P&amp;G's employee complaint line. (Doc. 29, at 195-96). This prompted Defendant to initiate a second investigation into Plaintiff's allegations of discrimination and retaliation for use of FMLA leave. The investigation was conducted by P&amp;G HR executive Lisa Thorner, who interviewed Ms. Konerman, Mr. Hall, Mr. Rashid, and others. Ms. Thorner's investigation returned the same results as the initial investigation conducted\n   by Mr. Rashid-while P&amp;G conceded that \"there were things that could have been managed better\" with respect to Plaintiff's feedback and disciplinary measures, no discrimination, harassment, or retaliation took place. (Doc. 35-1, at 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following Plaintiff's return to work on June 25, 2014, Plaintiff's PIP was closed in order to give Plaintiff a fresh start. (Doc. 31, at 12). Plaintiff was given a 3 rating for the 2014 fiscal year due to her ongoing performance issues, including several performance issues in her work that had been discovered during her leave of absence. (Doc. 34, at 12). Plaintiff was offered the opportunity to receive an \"out of cycle\" performance rating six months into the new fiscal year to give her an early opportunity to demonstrate improved performance and increase her chances of transferring to another department within P&amp;G. (Doc. 29-1, at 147). At the six-month out of cycle rating, Plaintiff was upgraded to a 2 ranking in recognition of her improved performance. (Doc. 29, at 188). Plaintiff was then able to transfer to the Trademark Licensing department at P&amp;G where she works today. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 317-18). Plaintiff remains qualified for FMLA leave (for her son's medical condition as well as her own), which she takes as needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff filed the complaint commencing this civil action on August 6, 2015. (Doc. 1). The complaint raises claims of FMLA retaliation, FMLA interference, and disability discrimination in violation of O.R.C. \u00a7 4112. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8). Following discovery, Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment on August 11, 2017. (Doc. 34). That motion is now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 34, at 18). While an employer can be given constructive notice that an individual is disabled without receiving an actual diagnosis based on that individual's behavior, \"[t]he fact that an employee is generally sickly or possesses a constitution that is prone to illness is not enough to bring that employee within the protection of the ADA.\"\n   <em>\n    Kocsis v.

(Doc. 44, at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, the evidence on the record raises a genuine dispute of material fact that would allow a jury to conclude that Defendant had constructive notice of Plaintiff's disability as early as October 2013, before many of Defendant's allegedly discriminatory actions. Plaintiff had been known to break down, lose control, and cry at her desk on several occasions in the fall of 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40, at 19-20; Doc. 40-4, at 1). Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, Barbara Konerman, was also informed about [redacted] in October 2013. (Doc. 32, at 12). [redacted] was relayed to Ms. Konerman's supervisor, Jason Hall.

These facts individually may not have been sufficient to give constructive notice of Plaintiff's depression, but together they raise at least enough of a factual dispute for a reasonable juror to conclude that P&amp;G should have known Plaintiff was disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Defendant took no adverse employment action against Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim must be dismissed because the evidence\n   before the Court demonstrates beyond a genuine dispute of material fact that Defendant took no employment actions against Plaintiff as a result of her disability that could be considered adverse under O.R.C. \u00a7 4112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's memorandum in opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment identifies several actions taken by Defendant that were allegedly adverse actions motivated by Plaintiff's disability. The allegedly adverse employment actions are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   1) Plaintiff received a \"3\" rating on her annual performance evaluation in the 2013/2014 Fiscal Year;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   2) Plaintiff did not receive a raise from August 2012 until August 2015;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   3) Plaintiff was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) by Defendant on November 1, 2013;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   4) At one point, Plaintiff's immediate supervisor forbid Plaintiff from working at home even though other employees in Plaintiff's department were permitted to do so up to 50% of the time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   5) Beginning in late 2013, Defendant began requiring Plaintiff to use four hours of paid vacation time whenever she had an FMLA absence, regardless of the length of the absence. Prior to this, Defendant had allowed Plaintiff to use unpaid off time to handle these absences, and only as much as was required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   6) Beginning in December 2013, Defendant required Plaintiff to present a doctor's note to the P&amp;G Health Center after every FMLA appointment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   7) Approximately 20% of Plaintiff's work responsibilities were reassigned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40, at 13-17). It is undisputed that Plaintiff never received a demotion in title or a reduction in salary during the time period in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although each of the actions listed above is undoubtedly \"adverse\" in a general sense, that does not necessarily mean they merit intervention from the Court pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 4112. Adverse employment actions that are actionable under antidiscrimination laws are those \"of the magnitude of a termination of employment, a demotion, a decrease in salary, or a material loss of benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Worthy v.

(Doc. 34, at 3 fn. 2). The scores are distributed in a bell curve. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff was assigned a 3 rating in both her 2013 and 2014 fiscal year evaluation; the latter\n   took place after Plaintiff had taken off work from March 4, 2014 to June 25, 2014 to receive treatment for her depression. (Doc. 31, at 8). Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, Barbara Konerman, testified at her deposition that Plaintiff was assigned a 3 rating because she was the poorest performer in the U.S. Customs Compliance department, specifically citing unreliability and lack of dependability with regard to attendance, customer service, and productivity. (Doc. 32, at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A negative performance evaluation unaccompanied by a demotion, decrease in pay, or other adverse change in the material terms and conditions of employment is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    Primes v.

Plaintiff argues that by receiving a 3 rating she was completely foreclosed from receiving any raises or performance share economic incentives. However, the evidence before the Court demonstrates beyond a dispute of material fact that this is not the case. Tayyib Rashid, who worked for P&amp;G as a human resources manager during the period implicated by the complaint, testified during his deposition regarding the relationship between an employee's performance evaluations and his or her ability to receive pay raises:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q: ... What if you are a three rated, do you know whether you can receive a pay raise if you were rated a three?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A: It depends. Typically if you are rated a three, the way that P and G pays their people is there are different rating scales and different salary ranges within those rating scales. If someone has been historically rated a two and all of a sudden they are rated a three, then they are probably being overpaid according to their rating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     So that means they can get a raise, yes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . It is probably going to take a while depending on what they have been paid historically compared to where they are on the rating scale on the pay scale now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   So if they still have room based on the three rating, if they still have room, then potentially yes, but if they are rated or been paid kind of high towards the upper end of the two rated spectrum and all of a sudden three rated, probably going to be a while before they get a pay raise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     It should be clear that just by you being rated a three does not exclude you from getting a pay raise\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . It really depends on the situation and where the employee is on the pay scale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Doc. 33, at 34-35 (emphasis added) ). Plaintiff's testimony during her own deposition confirmed her understanding of P&amp;G's policy on how raises are impacted by performance evaluations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q: Does it typically-would you typically get a raise every year?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A: No. It wouldn't be every year. It would depend on-it depended on the different things. So it didn't-it wasn't necessarily every year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q: Okay. So some years, even if you weren't 3 rated, if you were 1 or 2 rated, you may not have gotten a raise, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q: Okay.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     So the rating doesn't drive whether you get a raise or not; is that right?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A:\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Yes.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Doc. 29, at 30 (emphasis added) ). Accordingly, while Plaintiff's performance evaluation may have had some impact on her future raises, there was no direct correlation, and Plaintiff never actually saw her salary reduced. Therefore, Plaintiff's negative\n   evaluation is not in and of itself an adverse employment action that raises grounds for a discrimination claim under O.R.C. \u00a7 4112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2)\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff did not receive a raise from August 2012 until August 2015;\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant took a discriminatory adverse employment action against her by failing to award her a pay raise. However, the phrase \"adverse employment action\" implies that an action must be taken to apply, and the Sixth Circuit has accordingly defined an adverse employment action as \"a materially adverse\n   <em>\n    change\n   </em>\n   in the terms and conditions of [a plaintiff's] employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    White v.

The failure to increase Plaintiff's pay does not reflect a change in Plaintiff's employment, and is therefore not actionable under an O.R.C. \u00a7 4112 discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   3)\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) by Defendant on November 1, 2013;\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On November 1, 2013, Plaintiff's then-immediate supervisor, Barbara Konerman, placed Plaintiff on a \"Performance Improvement Plan\" (PIP). The plan identifies \"focus areas\" that require improvement and sets out tasks that both Plaintiff and her manager needed to accomplish to achieve success, as well as objective measurements of what success in these identified problem areas would look like. (Doc. 40-3, at 78-81). Ms. Konerman, whose motivations for assigning Plaintiff a \"3\" rating for both the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years were discussed above, stated during her deposition that all employees assigned a 3 rating were placed on a PIP. (Doc. 32, at 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The analysis of Plaintiff's being placed on a PIP is similar to that of her \"3\" rating. It is undisputed that Plaintiff retained her same salary, job title, and basic responsibilities during the time period implicated by Plaintiff's claims. The PIP did not represent a significant change in Plaintiff's employment, and accordingly cannot be considered an adverse employment action giving rise to an O.R.C. \u00a7 4112 discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   4)\n   <em>\n    At one point, Plaintiff's immediate supervisor forbid Plaintiff from working at home even though other employees in Plaintiff's department were permitted to do so up to 50% of the time;\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Following Plaintiff's 3 rating and placement into a PIP, P&amp;G revoked Plaintiff's work from home privileges in December 2013. (Doc. 40-4, at 23). Other employees within the U.S. Customs Compliance Department were permitted to work from home 40-50% of the time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32, at 31-32). Plaintiff argues that this elimination of work-from home privileges was a discriminatory adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Unlike the previous alleged actions against Plaintiff, the Court recognizes that removing an employee's privileges to work from home is an action undertaken by an employer that reduces the overall benefits of one's employment. However, only a\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   change to the terms and conditions of one's employment can constitute an adverse employment action under an O.R.C. \u00a7 4112 discrimination claim. Defendant's reply memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment cites to significant case law finding that the denial of work from home privileges is not an adverse employment action. (Doc. 44, at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Stone v.

La. 2016) (collecting cases) ) ). The Court agrees that the denial of work-from-home privileges, without any significant change in salary, job title, or responsibilities, is not sufficiently severe to be considered an adverse employment action under an O.R.C. \u00a7 4112 discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   5)\n   <em>\n    Beginning in late 2013, Defendant began requiring Plaintiff to use four hours of paid vacation time whenever she had an FMLA absence, regardless of the length of the absence.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40, at 24). Prior to this, Plaintiff had been permitted to take unpaid time off for FMLA leave and return to work as soon as she was able. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). This directive forced Plaintiff to use what in her mind was unnecessary vacation time for brief FMLA absences such as an early morning doctor's appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   However, the evidence before the Court demonstrates that this change in scheduling for FMLA time was not specifically directed toward Plaintiff, but was in fact a policy implemented company-wide by P&amp;G sometime in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33, at 21-22 (deposition testimony of former HR manager Tayyib Rashid) ). P&amp;G began requiring employees taking FMLA leave to use vacation time for the first two weeks of FMLA leave, and P&amp;G policy also required employees to take leave in four hour increments.

Employers are specifically authorized by statute to require that FMLA leave be taken as substitution for any accrued paid leave in accordance with the paid leave policy in place, so long as the employer pays the employee for the substituted paid leave and does not discriminate against employees taking FMLA leave in the administration of FMLA policies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.207\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Doc. 29-1, at 125). Ms. Konerman stated at this time that the reassignment of work was necessary because Plaintiff was working approximately 75% of normal employee hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (specifically referencing January 2014) ). Plaintiff argues that this reassignment of her workload was detrimental to her employment as it made it harder for her to compete with her peers.

Defendant had a responsibility to accommodate Plaintiff's FMLA leave, which included the appropriate reassignment of some responsibilities as necessary to ensure that Plaintiff could perform adequately. Plaintiff never suffered a reduction in either job title or salary throughout the period implicated in the complaint, and her responsibilities were reduced in an appropriate proportion with the time she was unable to work. (Doc. 43, at 170 (indicating that approximately 20% of Plaintiff's workload was reassigned) ).

While Plaintiff was still on medical leave in March 2014, she contacted then-HR Manager Ty Rashid about a potential transfer to a new department. Rashid explained the P&amp;G believed that a department transfer was an inappropriate accommodation given that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job (a position which, as explained above, was correct), and requested additional information from Plaintiff about other possible accommodations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Please work with your doctor and P&amp;G Health Services on the timing of your return as well as the necessary accommodations you will need, if any, to perform your role as a customs broker for P&amp;G.

D. Ohio Dec. 19, 2011) (Black, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff has made an adequate\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for FMLA interference. There is no dispute about the first two factors of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case-she was engaged in protected activity and her employer had notice. As previously discussed, Defendant took adverse employment actions against Plaintiff (as defined by the FMLA and interpreting case law).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.1. Furthermore, Defendant admits that several of the negative actions taken against Plaintiff, such as the negative performance review, corresponding PIP plan, and loss of work from home privileges, stemmed from Plaintiff's FMLA absences. Defendant argues that the reason behind these negative actions was Plaintiff's failure to provide adequate warning for qualifying absences as required by the FMLA. This argument is relevant in evaluating whether Defendant had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, but, at the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evaluation stage, the fact that the motivations behind Defendant's actions stemmed from Plaintiff's FMLA use is sufficient to find that Plaintiff has indeed made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claim of FMLA retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendant has offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Because Plaintiff has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for both FMLA interference and FMLA retaliation, the burden shifts to Defendant to justify the adverse employment actions taken against Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As previously discussed, many of the allegedly adverse actions attributed to Defendant by Plaintiff's response to the pending motion for summary judgment are explicitly permitted by the FMLA; Defendant is not required to provide further justification for these actions, as they are not properly the basis for an FMLA interference claim or an FMLA retaliation claim. These explicitly permitted actions include requiring Plaintiff to provide a doctor's note justifying her appointments, requiring Plaintiff to use vacation time for FMLA leave in accordance with P&amp;G policy, and reassigning a portion of Plaintiff's duties proportional to the time she was unable to be at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendant's justification for the other adverse employment actions taken against Plaintiff revolves around Plaintiff's frequent non-FMLA absences, her inability or refusal to maintain a consistent schedule as required (outside of FMLA leave), and her repeated failure to notify P&amp;G of her need to take FMLA leave as soon as was practicable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34, at 20 (\"[Plaintiff] was given a \"3\" rating in 2012-2013 because of her constant last-minute scheduling changes and her excessive non-FMLA absences ...\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The FMLA imposes extensive ongoing obligations on employees to give notice of the need for intermittent leave. When an employee knows they will need FMLA leave, the law requires them to notify their employer at least 30 days in advance.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20825.302\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 825.302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   825.304(b).

Plaintiff's admitted disregard for the instructions given by her employer regarding maintaining a consistent work schedule is unrelated to any FMLA protection and was a legitimate reason for Defendant to take disciplinary action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Additionally, the evidence on record shows that Plaintiff had issues with last-minute notification of FMLA leave, including in several instances when Plaintiff could have informed P&amp;G of the leave much earlier. Defendant compiled a list of Plaintiff's alleged non-FMLA related availability issues and last-minute schedule changes (both FMLA and non-FMLA). (Doc. 34-1). The list attributes to Plaintiff 34 such issues between April 2012 and July 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's response to the motion for summary judgment included a detailed list of responses to each of these 34 alleged incidents. (Doc. 41-3). Plaintiff's response list identified which incidents were FMLA leave and which were leave for other reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For some of the marked incidents, Plaintiff has alleged that the FMLA time requested was in response to a sudden medical emergency (for either herself or her son whose condition qualified her for FMLA leave). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Were those the only incidents identified by Defendant, disciplinary action for failure\n   to notify of upcoming FMLA absences would not be warranted. However, the Court's review of Plaintiff's response reveals that on at least seven occasions Plaintiff admits to giving last minute notice to P&amp;G about FMLA appointments where no emergency was claimed. These last minute notifications failed to meet Plaintiff's notice obligations under the FMLA, and were therefore appropriately a motivation for the relatively minor disciplinary employment actions taken by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant has adequately articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions was merely pretext\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Because Defendant has adequately articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment actions, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the offered reason is merely a pretext for an unlawful motivation in order to succeed on either her FMLA interference claim or her FMLA retaliation claim. \"[P]laintiff can show pretext in three interrelated ways: (1) that the proffered reasons had no basis in fact, (2) that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate the employer's action, or (3) that they were insufficient to motivate the employer's action.\"\n   <em>\n    Romans v.

Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the proffered reasons either had no basis in fact or were insufficient to motivate the employer's action, and so must demonstrate that Defendant's disciplinary actions were in fact motivated by her taking FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Plaintiff argues in her response to the motion for summary judgment that Defendant's given reasons for its actions lacks credibility. Plaintiff's main argument relies on the alleged discrepancies in how Defendant treated Plaintiff's FMLA leave requests prior to 2012, when she took FMLA leave only for her son's qualifying condition, and how Defendant treated Plaintiff's FMLA requests once she began to take qualifying FMLA leave for her depression as well. Specifically, Plaintiff states that prior to taking leave for her own condition Plaintiff was allowed to take FMLA leave without using her vacation time and Plaintiff did not have to get a doctor's note for FMLA appointments. (Doc. 40, at 58-59; Doc. 40-4, at 3). Plaintiff also cites Defendant's decision to extend Plaintiff's core work hours from 9:00-3:00 to 9:00-5:30 and instructions that Plaintiff was to go home if she could not stop crying at work, both implemented in December 2013, as a reflection of Defendant's retaliation for Plaintiff's FMLA use. (Doc. 40, at 58-59; Doc. 40-4, at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Plaintiff compares her case to\n   <em>\n    Green v.

The defendant had defended the termination as the result of Plaintiff's progression through the company's \"progressive disciplinary plan,\" which outlined specific coaching steps for various numbers of unexcused absences that would ultimately result in termination. However, the record demonstrated that the employer had not\n   actually applied its disciplinary plan consistently; the plaintiff had in the past acquired enough unexcused absences to trigger steps in the plan, but it was only once Plaintiff began taking FMLA leave that the plan was ever initiated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. This discrepancy raised a genuine issue of material fact that it was the FMLA leave itself that triggered the employer's increased scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   That is not the case here. Plaintiff has been using approved FMLA leave for \"almost the entirety of\" her 17 year career at P&amp;G, and did so without significant incident until 2012. (Doc. 40, at 10). The record in this case clearly demonstrates that disciplinary actions taken against Plaintiff either: (1) were not taken against Plaintiff at all but were the result of changed company policy, as with the requirement that FMLA time be used as vacation time (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33, at 21-22) or (2) were the culmination of Plaintiff's failure to improve after consistent feedback from her supervisors regarding their justifiable concerns related to her non-FMLA absences and lack of notification for FMLA non-emergency absences. The fact that Plaintiff was able to use FMLA leave without incident for over a decade belies any argument that Plaintiff's use of FMLA leave caused Defendant to retaliate against Plaintiff, especially in light of Defendant's well-documented legitimate reasons for taking the minor disciplinary actions against Plaintiff that occurred. No reasonable juror could look at the evidence before the Court and conclude that Defendant's proffered reasons for the actions taken against Plaintiff were pretext for FMLA interference or FMLA retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's FMLA interference and FMLA retaliation claims are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons outlined above, Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 34) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   This case is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk shall enter judgment accordingly, whereupon this case shall be\n   <strong>\n    TERMINATED\n   </strong>\n   in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    All citations to the record cite to the document number and document page number assigned by the Court's ECF electronic filing system.
