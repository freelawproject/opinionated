FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this suit, Troyer seeks to hold the NFA, a self-regulatory organization\n   (\"SRO\") for the futures industry, liable for an allegedly fraudulent scheme perpetuated by Thomas Heneghan, a broker and an associate member of the NFA. Troyer alleges that from December 2009 to April 2015, all while Heneghan was an associate member of the NFA, Heneghan solicited and accepted funds from Troyer for the purpose of purchasing commodities futures. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 10-17, 25-31, 37-39, 43-54). Troyer alleges that he has never received any of the more than $500,000 in assets purportedly held in his account with Heneghan; nor has he been able to recover any of the more than $200,000 that he invested through Heneghan. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 10-17, 25-31, 43-41, 63). More particularly, Troyer alleges the following facts in his amended complaint:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2009, Heneghan was registered as an associated person (\"AP\") of Statewide FX Inc. (\"Statewide\"), an introducing broker registered with the NFA that functioned as an introducing broker for Vision Financial Markets LLC (\"Vision\"). (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6). At Heneghan's request, Troyer opened a commodities trading account with Vision, and on December 24, 2009, Troyer purchased futures contracts by issuing a check to Vision. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 18, 2010, Heneghan's registration with Statewide was terminated. (DE 47 \u00b6 8). Heneghan, however, instructed Troyer to work with another Statewide AP, Oliver Livolsi, and to continue purchasing commodities futures contracts through Statewide in Troyer's account at Vision. (DE 47 \u00b6 9). Troyer did so, issuing seven more checks to Vision for the purpose of purchasing commodities futures contracts. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 9-16). Throughout this time, Troyer received monthly statements from Vision showing that he held futures contracts in currencies and commodities; additionally, Heneghan repeatedly assured Troyer that the value of his account was increasing. (DE 47 \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the same day that his registration with Statewide was terminated, Heneghan applied for registration with Atlantis Trading Corp. (\"Atlantis\"), an introducing broker registered with the NFA. (DE 47 \u00b6 22). The NFA approved Heneghan's registration as an AP and principal with Atlantis. (DE 47 \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 29, 2010, Troyer, at Heneghan's request, opened an account with Peregrine Financial Group Inc., d/b/a PFG Best (\"PFG\"), an introducing broker registered with the NFA. (DE 47 \u00b6 23). Although Heneghan had been registered with PFG from January 1999 to July 2001, he was not registered with PFG during the time period relevant to this suit. (DE 47 \u00b6 24). From March to October 2010, Troyer issued six checks to PFG for the purpose of purchasing futures contracts, mailing\n   the checks to Heneghan's attention at PFG's address. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 25-31). Troyer also requested that his accounts at Vision be transferred to PFG. (DE 47 \u00b6 28). Throughout this time, Troyer received monthly statements from PFG showing that he held futures contracts in currencies and commodities; additionally, Heneghan assured Troyer that the value of his account was increasing. (DE 47 \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In March 2010, December 2010, and January 2011, on Heneghan's recommendation, Troyer issued three checks to Crossland, LLC (\"Crossland\"), for the purpose of purchasing futures contracts, sending at least two of the checks to Heneghan's attention. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 37-39). Heneghan was never registered with Crossland. (DE 47 \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In December 2010, unbeknownst to Troyer, the NFA issued a complaint charging Statewide and several of its principals with making deceptive and misleading sales solicitations. (DE 47 \u00b6 18). In May 2011, the NFA issued a complaint against Vision for failing to supervise several of its broker-dealers, including Statewide; the NFA never notified Troyer that it had uncovered issues with Vision at the time Troyer held accounts with Vision. (DE 47 \u00b6 21). In July 2011, unbeknownst to Troyer, the NFA terminated Statewide's registration and ordered it to never reapply for NFA membership or to act as a principal of an NFA member. (DE 47 \u00b6 19). The NFA never notified Troyer that it had terminated Statewide's registration. (DE 47 \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2012, unbeknownst to Troyer, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\"the CFTC\") filed a complaint against PFG and its owner, Russell Wasendorf, alleging fraud, misappropriation of customer funds, violation of customer fund segregation laws, and making false statements. (DE 47 \u00b6 33). The following month, unbeknownst to Troyer, Wasendorf was indicted on 31 counts of lying to regulators. (DE 47 \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October 2012, Heneghan applied for registration as an AP with Portfolio Managers, Inc. (\"PMI\"), an introducing broker registered with the NFA. (DE 47 \u00b6 41). The NFA approved Heneghan's registration. (DE 47 \u00b6 41). By this time, Heneghan had been registered with 13 different NFA-member firms over a 27-year period. (DE 47 \u00b6 42). Many of those firms had been accused of serious violations. (DE 47 \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In February 2013, unbeknownst to Troyer, the CFTC issued an order permanently barring PFG and Wasendorf from the industry. (DE 47 \u00b6 35). The NFA never notified Troyer of the fraud uncovered regarding PFG, and never investigated that PFG was receiving checks from Troyer in Heneghan's name even though Heneghan was not registered with PFG at the time. (DE 47 \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At some point in early 2013, while Heneghan was registered as an AP of PMI, Heneghan encouraged Troyer to participate in a new commodities trading program. (DE 47 \u00b6 43). Heneghan told Troyer that the program was set up under Heneghan's trading account in order to avoid account maintenance fees and additional commissions. (DE 47 \u00b6 43). Heneghan then instructed Troyer to issue checks directly to Heneghan so that he could deposit them into the program. (DE 47 \u00b6 43). Heneghan assured Troyer that his funds would be segregated into a separate sub-account. (DE 47 \u00b6 43). From April 2013 to April 2015, Troyer issued 11 checks payable to Heneghan for the purpose of purchasing commodities futures contracts through this program. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 44-54). Throughout this time, Heneghan repeatedly assured Troyer that his futures contracts were performing well and that the value of his account was increasing. (DE 47 \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In July 2014, Crossland's registration as an NFA member was terminated. (DE 47 \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At some point in 2015, Heneghan informed Troyer that his futures contacts were performing well and that the value of his account exceeded $500,000. (DE 47 \u00b6 55). Troyer instructed Heneghan to close his account and wire the funds to him. (DE 47 \u00b6 56). Heneghan, however, repeatedly made excuses as to why he could not transfer the funds to Troyer. (DE 47 \u00b6 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In December 2015, Troyer filed a complaint against PMI, its president Amanda Murphy (\"Murphy\"), Heneghan, and two other APs who worked with Heneghan in PMI's Los Angeles (\"LA\") branch. (DE 47 \u00b6 59). In the complaint, the NFA noted, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   8. Heneghan, who, as previously alleged, was an AP at the LA branch, had also worked at several firms which were the subject of prior disciplinary actions brought by this Committee for sales practice fraud. Like [another AP defendant], Heneghan had also worked at Statewide. Prior to that, Heneghan had worked at a number of different firms, including Siegel Trading Co., another firm which was permanently barred from NFA for sales practice fraud. Additionally, Heneghan worked at Jack Carl Associates, Inc. and Trading Centers of America, Inc., two other firms which were the subject of disciplinary Complaints by this Committee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   9. In the course of its exam of PMI, NFA reviewed customer activity statements and tax forms for the various branch offices. NFA's review revealed that between October 2012 and August 2015 all but two of the LA branch office's 68 customers lost money, totaling about $1.2 million, and paid over $660,000 in commissions. Additionally, many of these accounts had commission to equity ratios equal to or exceeding 20% and traded both outright long options and option spreads, which may be indicative of abusive trading practices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (DE 47 \u00b6 60 (alteration in original) ). Additionally, as to Heneghan, the NFA's complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   22. NFA's review of the customer trading activity showed that 97% of PMI's LA branch customers had net losses and that 98% of all Heneghan's customers had net losses and, on average, lost 94% of their investment. NFA's review also found that Heneghan routinely made misleading and deceptive sales solicitations that downplayed the impact of commissions on profitability; exaggerated profit potential and minimized risk of loss; and failed to disclose that 97% of PMI's LA branch customers low money trading with PM[I].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (DE 47 \u00b6 61). As to Murphy, the NFA's complaint alleged that she failed to adequately supervise the LA branch to ensure that it complied with the NFA's sales practice rules. (DE 47 \u00b6 62). The NFA also faulted Murphy for failing to apply heightened supervision to Heneghan, given his past employment with NFA firms that had been disciplined. (DE 47 \u00b6 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As stated earlier, Troyer has never received any of the more than $500,000 in assets allegedly held in his account with Heneghan, nor has he been able to recover any of the more than $200,000 that he invested through Heneghan. (DE 47 \u00b6 63). On May 8, 2016, Troyer filed the instant case against Heneghan, Livolsi, PMI, and the NFA, alleging various violations under the Commodities Exchange Act (\"the CEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (DE 1). On January 30, 2017, Troyer filed an amended complaint, dismissing Heneghan and Livolsi and advancing four claims against PMI and the NFA. (DE 30). On May 7, 2017, Troyer voluntarily dismissed PMI from\n   this suit (DE 44), leaving the NFA as the sole Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As explained earlier, on July 12, 2017, the Court granted the NFA's motion to dismiss Troyer's amended complaint, affording him to and including August 2, 2017, to file a second amended complaint against the NFA in an attempt to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. (DE 46). On August 1, 2017, Troyer filed his proposed second amended complaint (DE 47), which is the subject of the instant motion to dismiss (DE 48). In Count 1, Troyer alleges that the NFA failed to enforce a rule or bylaw that it was statutorily required to enforce, in violation of \u00a7 25(b)(2) of the CEA; and in Count 2, Troyer alleges that the NFA is vicariously liable for Heneghan's purported violations of \u00a7\u00a7 6b(a) and 6b(e) of the CEA and its related regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Section 21(b)(3)(C) states that the association's rules must provide that, except with the approval of the CFTC, \"no person shall be admitted to or continued in membership...if such person...whether prior or subsequent to becoming a member, by his conduct while associated with a member, was a cause of any suspension, expulsion, or order... which is in effect with respect to such member....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2021\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(C) ; (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 47 \u00b6 65). NFA Bylaw 301(a)(ii)(D) provides, in essence, that no person shall be permitted to become or remain affiliated with an NFA Member if that person was a cause of any suspension, expulsion, or order of another NFA Member. (DE 47 \u00b6 66; DE 50-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the context of these provisions, Troyer makes the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   67. NFA conducted an audit which found that, in 2009, 95% of Statewide FX's customers lost money because of manipulative trading practices used by the firm's APs and that those losses totaled over $5 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   68. Although NFA brought charges against Statewide FX's President, CEO, and three of its APs, NFA's complaint also noted that \"...other Statewide AP's consistently recommended trades to customers which were not in their best interest but maximized commissions for Statewide.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   69. NFA also alleged Statewide's owners \"developed this trading strategy, and implemented it through Statewide's sales force.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   70. According to NFA's membership records, Heneghan was registered as an AP of Statewide FX from January 8, 2007 until March 18, 2010, which meant he was part of the sales force that employed the firm's manipulative trading practices in 2009, resulting in $5 million in customer losses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   71. As such, Heneghan's conduct while registered as an AP with Statewide FX was \"a cause\" of NFA's decision to permanently expel the firm from its membership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   72. Therefore, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2021\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(C) and NFA Bylaw 301(a)(ii)(D), NFA should have terminated Heneghan's registration when it expelled Statewide FX on July 28, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 67-72). Troyer then further alleges that had NFA investigated Heneghan at the time it terminated Statewide's membership, it would have uncovered Heneghan's other alleged misdeeds, including his using Livolsi as a straw man after Heneghan's registration with Statewide ended, and his soliciting payments to PFG and Crossland when he was not registered with either firm. (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 73-74). Troyer alleges that had the NFA followed its own membership rules, it would have avoided not only the future losses Troyer suffered as a result of Heneghan's ongoing fraud, but it also would have enabled Troyer to recover those funds that Heneghan wrongfully directed to Statewide, PFG, and Crossland when those firms were still solvent. (DE 47 \u00b6 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The NFA acknowledges that Troyer's allegations now identify a bylaw that NFA purportedly violated-a deficiency that the Court identified in its Order dismissing Troyer's first amended complaint. (DE 46 at 18). The NFA argues, however, that Troyer's second amended complaint still fails to state a claim under \u00a7 25(b)(2) because\n   Troyer's claim that Heneghan was a cause of Statewide's supposed expulsion is \"contradicted by the facts of the pleadings\" and \"is a legal conclusion that must be disregarded for the purposes of this motion.\" (DE 49 at 3-4). In that regard, the NFA points to the complaint that the NFA filed against Statewide in December 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 50-1). The NFA argues that it never mentioned Heneghan by name in the Statewide complaint and never found in the complaint that Heneghan was a cause of Statewide's supposed expulsion. (DE 49 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While \"[l]egal conclusions will be ignored where specific facts are pleaded that are to the contrary,\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Ill. 2000), Troyer does not plead facts contrary to his allegation that Heneghan was a cause of the NFA's decision to expel Statewide from its membership. (DE 47 \u00b6 71). The Statewide complaint does not, on its face, contradict Troyer's allegation that Heneghan was a cause of Statewide's supposed expulsion. Although the Statewide complaint does not mention Heneghan by name, it does make various allegations about \"Statewide's APs,\" which included Heneghan at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In that regard, the Statewide complaint alleges, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \u2022 \"For the most part, the trade recommendations that Statewide's APs made to their customers were not in the customers' best interest and were intended, instead, to benefit Statewide by generating high commissions.\" (DE 50-1 \u00b6 17).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 \"Statewide's APS routinely recommended option and bull call option spreads to customers that had little chance of being profitable due to their high break even points.\" (DE 50-1 \u00b6 18).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 \"[A]ll of Statewide's APs recommended and placed trades in their customers' accounts that had extremely high break even points....\" (DE 50-1 \u00b6 21).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 \"Statewide's strategy of recommending trades to maximize commissions without regard for the best interests of its customers was developed by Hennequin and Colin and implemented by Statewide's APs and constituted a failure on their part to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.\" (DE 50-1 \u00b6 25).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 \"Statewide APs also used misleading sales tactics in order to persuade customers to enter into the recommended trades and/or deposit additional funds into their accounts.\" (DE 50-1 \u00b6 26).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 \"Statewide's APs exaggerated the profit potential and downplayed the risk of loss of trading futures and options and failed to disclose that nearly 95% of Statewide's customers lost money in 2009.\" (DE 50-1 \u00b6 26).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 \"Statewide's APs failed to make adequate disclosures and/or clearly explain the way in which commissions would be charged and how they would affect the trading, including any likelihood of achieving a profit, in customer accounts.\" (DE 50-1 \u00b6 26).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As such, the Court does not see anything in Troyer's complaint or the additional documents that contradicts his allegation\n   that \"Heneghan's conduct while registered as an AP with Statewide FX was 'a cause' of NFA's decision to permanently expel the firm from its membership.\" (DE 47 \u00b6 71). Therefore, the NFA's first argument in support of its motion to dismiss Count I of Troyer's second amended complaint is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moving on to the NFA's second argument, the NFA contends that Troyer still fails to plausibly allege that the NFA acted in \"bad faith\" when failing to enforce its bylaws, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2025\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). In that regard, Troyer makes the following allegations, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   79. In the complaint it filed against PMI and Murphy, NFA admitted knowledge of Heneghan's past associations with firms NFA had expelled from its membership based upon their fraudulent activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   80. In the same action, NFA admitted its own Compliance Manual required consideration of Heneghan's past association with firms it had previously disciplined before he could register with another NFA member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   81. In fact, pursuant to NFA Bylaw 301(e), given his disqualification, NFA could only permit Heneghan to remain registered as an NFA Associate Member if the CFTC directed it to do so or upon a finding by NFA's Membership Committee that his participation in Statewide FX's manipulative trading scheme did not cause him to pose a threat to Members, Associates or customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   82. However, the CFTC did not order NFA to maintain Heneghan's registration and its Membership Committee never investigated his activities to determine if he posed a threat to commit additional fraudulent acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   83. Instead,...NFA delegated the authority granted to it by the CFTC to determine whether Heneghan would be permitted to maintain his registration to PMI, an introducing broker-dealer, and Murphy, who served as PMI's president.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   84. PMI and its President had strong financial interests in allowing Heneghan and other brokers to join their firm-despite their past involvement in fraudulent trading schemes-as they needed APs to generate business for the firm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   85. Similarly, NFA's operating income consists of dues, assessments, fees and other charges upon its Members. This includes an assessment NFA collects on every commodities futures contract and option trade.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   86. As a result, NFA also had a financial interest in allowing its Member firms to hire APs who had previously engaged in fraudulent trading activity because those APs were needed to solicit trades that financially supported NFA's operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   92. NFA has an established pattern of ignoring its own membership rules to permits its Members and Associate Members to continue to solicit commodities trades-after finding they had previously participated in conduct that contributed to the expulsion of other Member firms-so they can continue to generate activity that supports NFA's funding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   93. By abdicating its registration duties to a for-profit Member to maintain its own funding source, NFA acted in bad faith in failing to enforce a rule that required it to dismiss Heneghan based upon his prior involvement in a manipulative trading scheme and led to Troyer suffering financial and emotional damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 92-93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The NFA asserts that Troyer's allegations of bad faith are based on \"pure speculation\" and consist of \"nothing more than a standard negligence claim-alleging that NFA erred in investigating and registering Heneghan.\" (DE 49 at 5). The NFA argues that allegations of negligence and even gross indifference cannot support a claim under \u00a7 25(b). (DE 49 at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    DGM Invs., Inc. v. N.Y.

In support, Troyer points to the following allegations in his amended complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   117. NFA manifested its consent for Heneghan to act as its agent by accepting his application to conduct commodities trades as an NFA Member. In fact, pursuant to NFA Compliance Rule 2-22, Heneghan had NFA's permission to advertise his status as an NFA Associate Member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   118. Pursuant to NFA Bylaw 301(F)(ii)(c), Heneghan's application to bec[o]me an NFA Associate Member constituted,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   ...an express agreement by the applicant that, if admitted to NFA membership or registered as an Associate, the applicant shall become and remain bound by all NFA requirements as are then and thereafter in effect and that such agreement shall apply each time the applicant becomes a Member or Associate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   119. Therefore, NFA consented to allow Heneghan to operate as its agent and Heneghan accepted NFA's authority to control his trading activities by requiring that he comply with its conduct rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   120. NFA exercised further control over Heneghan by assigning an NFA Member and Associate Member to supervise his activities pursuant to NFA Compliance Rule 2-9(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   121. NFA's control over Heneghan in this regard is best exhibited by the fact-based in part on the allegations in this complaint-NFA permanently barred him from its membership for violating its rules....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   126. In addition, Troyer reasonably relied upon Heneghan's representation he was an Associate Member of NFA as indicating Heneghan's trading activities were valid and authorized by NFA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   127. NFA supported that belief by asserting on its website:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Investor confidence is crucial to the success of the derivatives markets, and the best way to gain investor confidence is to demand the highest\n   levels of integrity of all market participants and intermediaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Rigorous registration screening\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . NFA thoroughly screens all firms and individuals wishing to register with the CFTC and become Members of NFA. Applicants must meet stringent fitness requirements and must provide fingerprint cards for FBI background checks. In addition, individual registrants must pass comprehensive proficiency testing requirements. NFA has the authority to deny, revoke, suspend, restrict or condition any firm's or individual's registration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   128. Troyer reasonably believed that, when Heneghan [was] advertising his services as an \"NFA Associate Member,\" he was authorized to act on NFA's behalf in providing those services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   130. By allowing Heneghan to advertise as an NFA Associate Member and making public representations that its members were thoroughly screened and subject to its strict oversight, NFA created a reasonable impression in Troyer's mind that Heneghan was operating under NFA's auspices-thus establishing an apparent agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   131. Therefore, Heneghan was acting as the actual, inherent, and apparent agent of NFA when he perpetrated his fraudulent acts on Troyer and, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), NFA is vicariously liable for the damages Troyer suffered as a result of Heneghan's violations of the CEA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (DE 47 \u00b6\u00b6 117-131).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Here, even if a private right of action were to exist under the CEA for a vicarious liability claim against a registered futures association,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Troyer fails to plead a plausible agency relationship between Heneghan and the NFA, because Troyer's allegations in his second amended complaint still rest solely on Heneghan's status as an associate member of the NFA. As this Court held in its Order (DE 46) dismissing Troyer's first amended complaint, Heneghan's status as an associate member of the NFA, without more, does not make him an agent of the NFA for purposes of vicarious liability under the CEA. Troyer is conflating Heneghan's registration as an NFA associate member (apparently, the NFA has tens of thousands of associate members (DE 49 at 8) ), with permission to act on the NFA's behalf. As the NFA persuasively asserts, merely issuing a license or registration to an individual does not constitute an approval by the registering agency for the licensee to act on the registering entity's behalf. Expanding agency law in this manner would reach an absurd result where any licensing agency would become vicariously liable for the acts of all of its licensees, merely by the fact that it issued a license to the professionals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   To cut to the chase, there are no allegations in the amended complaint that the NFA ever employed Heneghan, directed his day-to-day activities, or authorized him to act on the NFA's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gibraltar Monetary Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034673\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1180/#p1182\">\n    575 F.3d at 1187-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the legal test for vicarious liability under the CEA);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leon v.
