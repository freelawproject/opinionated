Plaintiffs allege that during that time period Defendants conspired to fix chicken prices higher than the market would naturally support, in violation of the Sherman Act \u00a7 1 and state law.

The Chicken Industry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Broilers\" are \"chickens raised for meat consumption to be slaughtered before the age of 13 weeks, and which may be sold in a variety of forms, including fresh or frozen, raw or cooked, whole or in parts, or as a meat ingredient in a value added product, but excluding chicken that is grown, processed, and sold according to halal, kosher, free range, or organic standards.\" R. 212 \u00b6 79. Broilers constitute approximately 98% of all chicken meat sold in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants are industrial Broiler producers. As of 2015, Defendants controlled 88.8% of Broiler production in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 286. Defendants own or tightly control all aspects of producing Broilers, including laying eggs; hatching chicks;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   raising chicks; slaughtering chickens; and processing and distributing the meat.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 270-74. The technology and process of industrial scale Broiler production is well known among Defendants, and all defendants use the same types of equipment and processes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 330. Entry into the market would cost in excess of $100 million,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 319-22, and \"no company has created a new poultry company from scratch in decades.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 323. Defendants Tyson and Pilgrim's Pride maintain the largest market shares, approximately 22% and 17% respectively, while the other defendants maintain market shares no greater than 8-9%, with several below 5%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 286 (including the following chart).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants' businesses also have relatively similar cost structures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 330. The primary costs of production are labor and feed for the chickens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 327-38. Labor costs have declined significantly over the past two decades, while labor productivity has substantially increased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 328. Defendants feed their chickens corn and soybean meal, and purchase these ingredients on the open market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 327, 330. \"Feed prices have varied widely from 2007-2016, reaching 71% of the cost of producing Broilers in 2012, but falling to only about 50% by 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 327. \"Since January 1, 2008, corn prices have declined roughly 21% and soybean prices have declined 13%.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 329.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants purchase their breeder flocks (the chickens that lay the eggs Defendants raise into Broilers) from three \"global genetics conglomerates\" that account for 98% of Broilers raised in the United States, and 80% of Broilers raised globally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 275. These three genetic companies own a \"biological lock\" on their unique Broiler lines, meaning they tightly control the purebred genetic strain they develop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 274. These genetic strains have special hybrid characteristics, such as a tendency to product a large chicken breast.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because all aspects of Defendants' methods of production are nearly identical, Broilers are substantially uniform across all Defendants' brands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. For this reason, Broilers are considered a commodity product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-81. Commodity industries are particularly susceptible to agreements that violate antitrust laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411822\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/651/#p658\">\n    295 F.3d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"[When] the product is uniform (a 'commodity') ... competition would be expected to prevent any one seller from raising his price to any of this customers above cost.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Agri Stats\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants communicated their conspiracy to restrain production and inflate prices in part through an entity called Agri Stats. Agri Stats is a subsidiary of Eli Lilly &amp; Co. that produces subscription reports about the Broiler industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67, 118. Agri Stats collects data directly from Defendants' Broiler production facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. Only Broiler producers that supply data to Agri Stats are permitted to receive the Agri Stats reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Agri Stats reports provide information about where Broiler producers buy their breeder stock and feed, the size of production facilities, and actual production numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130. The reports also provide detailed information regarding production capacity, including numbers of eggs, the size of breeder flocks, and other inventory numbers, as well as financial information about each company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130, 135C. Although the reports do not identify the Broiler producers by name, the reports are so detailed that a reasonably informed producer can discern the other producers' identities, and it is common knowledge among producers that this is possible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124. This ability to identify each other by the information in the reports is enhanced by tours Defendants' executives take of each other's production facilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 313, and by the relatively frequent movement of employees and executives among the Defendant companies, without the protection of noncompete clauses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 314.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants have publicly stated that Agri Stats reports provide them knowledge of their competitors' production plans, and that they rely on this information to plan their own production.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131A (defendant Sanderson Farms reported that \"every year we review our operations and every facet within [Agri Stats] ... we set operational goals every year ... and [we] try to improve our operations within this benchmarking service we call [Agri Stats]\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131B (Sanderson Farms CEO was quoted as saying, \"my judgment is that based on what I see in Agr[i] [S]tats nobody is planning on, pullet placements say no ramp up and what I've gleaned from Agr[i] [S]tats, people are not planning on ramping up.

Agri Stats also offers to meet with Broiler producer executives on a quarterly basis to make detailed presentations\n   about company and industry data, including whether the industry is over- or undersupplying the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127.

The Years 2008-2010\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that prior to 2008, there was a \"historic pattern of annual increases in Broiler production,\" of about 3%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 335. Industry publications noted that 2008 was the \"first time in decades [that] total broiler production ... remained virtually unchanged from the year before.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   These production cuts began in 2007 when defendants Tyson, Pilgrim's, Foster Farms, Peco Foods, and Perdue cut back their Broiler production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143. Plaintiffs allege that these production cuts did not result in a \"meaningful\" price increase, so Tyson and Pilgrim's-the industry's two largest producers-realized that production cuts by the industry as a whole were necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' executives and employees attended the International Poultry Expo in Atlanta from January 23-25, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. After that meeting, executives from Tyson, Pilgrim's, and Sanderson made statements that their companies would raise prices or cut production in response to market prices that were below the cost of production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 146-48, 150, 154. Pilgrim's CFO stated that \"the rest of the market is going to have to pick-up a fair share.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147. And Sanderson's CEO stated that he expected the industry to make production cuts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148. Five more defendants-Fieldale Farms,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simmons, Wayne Farms, O.K. Foods, and Koch Foods (plus non-defendant producer, Cagle)-followed suit with their own production cuts in April 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151. Additionally, Sanderson's CEO stated at a conference presentation, \"I know some companies have cut back and have not announced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 21, 2008, the Wall Street Journal noted the production cuts, and reported that prices had started to increase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157. The paper also noted that \"it is unusual for egg sets to decline at this time of year,\" because demand is usually highest in August when chickens hatched in May would be mature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, despite these production and capacity cuts, Tyson's CEO questioned whether they would result in the sought after price increase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 155 (stating that \"we're going to be up a little but probably not a significant amount, not as much as we might have once anticipated\"). Pilgrim's CEO also called for additional production cuts,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156, because \"there is still too much breast meat available to drive market pricing significantly higher.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the industry responded to these calls for additional cuts. On June 19, 2008, Peco's CEO said, \"the poultry industry is entering a second phase of production cutbacks .... We are hearing talk that this was not nearly enough, so liquidation is in round two.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161. And the next day, an Agri Stats non-public communication stated, \"Those who have announced cutbacks indicated they will continue until margins normalize. At this time we expect to see the declines continue until at least late 2009, and cuts could be deeper than now projected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 162. Indeed, seven defendants announced additional production cuts or facility closures\n   through the end of 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 163, 165-71, 176-77, 180. And in September 2008, an industry publication reported that \"\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   U.S. broiler integrators had announced plans to close small operations, consolidate complexes and further processing plants and to reduce output by 3 percent to 5 percent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173 (emphasis added).

The production cuts of 2007-09 had the effect of increasing Broiler prices \"through mid to late 2008, staying at or near all-time highs until late 2009.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 192.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Years 2010-2014\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By late 2010, the economy as a whole had begun to improve, and some producers began to increase production to meet that demand, resulting in falling prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 193. After the International Poultry Expo held January 24-26, 2011,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 196, Defendants again began to take action to restrict production. Seven defendants and two other producers cut production, closed facilities, or delayed planned construction of new facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 196, 198-201, 203-05, 210, 212-13, 215, 217-18, 220, 222-23, 231. These actions continued into 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 232, 238. By April 27, 2012, Pilgrim's CEO stated on an earnings call that \"the die is cast for 2012,\" and \"we're comfortable that the industry is going to remain constrained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229. Prices began to increase in September 2012, and continued to increase through 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 239, 243.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Summary of Plaintiffs' Theory Regarding Production &amp; Pricing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in a commodity market like the Broiler market, \"[n]ormal supply and demand would suggest that in the wake of massive supply cuts by [some producers], other Broiler producers would jump into the massive gap,\" and increase production to meet demand, yet, \"just the opposite occurred\" in 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151. Plaintiffs also argue that \"the commodity nature of Broilers does not allow one producer to successfully raise market prices in the absence of widespread reductions in supply relative to the then-current demand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146. So, Plaintiffs contend, public statements of intent to cut production, and the discipline of Defendants to resist filling the supply gap after production cuts by large producers, do \"not make sense absent an intention (or knowledge) ... that [competitors] would coordinate a reduction in supply across the Broiler industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146. One producer of a commodity cannot, absent coordination, simply cut production, fail to meet demand, and expect to maintain market share. Thus, Plaintiffs contend that the many public statements Defendants' executives made regarding production cuts during the relevant time period is an indication that an agreement among Defendants to cut production was already in place or in the works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition to these suspicious public communications, Plaintiffs contend they have plausibly alleged private communications among Defendants indicating a conspiracy to cut production with the intent to inflate prices. Plaintiffs' primary argument in that regard is that \"[t]here is no plausible, non-conspiratorial justification for Defendants to use Agri Stats to secretly share highly confidential and proprietary information about their pricing, capacity, production, and costs at the level of detail at which they do. In a competitive market, such proprietary, competitively sensitive information would be a closely guarded secret. Economic theory suggests that the routine exchange among competitors of such sensitive internal company information reduces the intensity of competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134. \"Moreover,\" Plaintiffs continue, \"the nature of Broiler breeder flocks is that they predict future Broiler supply, so by sharing such information in a way that permits company-by-company identification,\n   Defendants are in fact sharing future anticipated production information with one another, which clearly suggest high antitrust concern.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135C. Additionally, Plaintiffs cite Sanderson's CEO's statement on May 28, 2008-\"I know some companies have cut back and have not announced\"-as an indication that he had private communications with his competitors regarding their intention to cut production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Factors Enabling Defendants to Sustain Production Cuts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that a number of additional factors demonstrate that Defendants' production cuts from 2008-2014 were not merely independent reactions to economic conditions, but are indicative of a conspiracy. These factors include: (1) a shift away from fixed price to variable price contracts; (2) slaughter or export of breeder flocks; (3) use of inter-company sale agreements; and (4) an increase in exports. Plaintiffs allege these factors enabled Defendants to sustain their production cuts despite the economic incentives to increase supply of a commodity product like Broilers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, beginning in 2008, Defendants moved away from fixed price contracts to contracts that permitted prices to fluctuate with the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 348. According to Plaintiffs, fixed price contracts prevented Defendants from being able to realize market price increases resulting planned production cuts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 349. Starting in January 2008, around the same time Defendants began production cuts, defendants Koch Foods, Pilgrim's, Perdue, Sanderson, and Tyson, publicly announced an effort to use contracts that permitted variable pricing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 350-54. Pilgrim's CFO explained on an earnings call on January 29, 2008, that in the current \"situation\" in which there is a \"need to drive commodity prices up,\" having fewer fixed price contracts \"is going to give us the opportunity for more immediate benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 352. This shift was noted by an industry analyst in December 2013, who stated that \"with volume growth generally limited, companies are developing more sophisticated strategies to generate profits .... Contracts are now being negotiated all year long and employ a variety of pricing methodologies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 355.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, one of the primary forms of production cuts during the relevant time period was to slaughter or export breeder flocks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 189, 250. Historically, when Broiler producers wanted to cut production, they simply destroyed excess eggs or Broilers in order not to have them available on the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 191. Breeder flocks are not usually destroyed because such a strategy hampers a producer's ability to meet increased demand. Yet, during the time period at issue in this case, total breeder flock numbers went from a high of approximately 59 million in 2008, to a low of about 49 million in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 191, 242 (including the following chart).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At a conference in January 2012, an Agri Stats Vice-President noted the importance of reducing Broiler breeder flocks, because a failure to do so \"could blow apart any recover[y] in the short term by filing up incubators again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 225. He also noted that Agri Stats data showed that the industry was in fact slaughtering breeder flocks, demonstrating an intent to manage production carefully.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Another industry analyst also noted the significant decrease in breeder flocks, stating on May 6, 2014 that historically, \"it has been very easy to increase the chicken supply because .... [i]t only takes four to eight weeks to grow a chicken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 249. But in recent years, the analyst continued, producers \"cut production capacity throughout the supply chain when grain prices were very high,\" so \"they cannot materially increase supply\" for 18 months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' decisions to slaughter or export breeder flocks were unusual, and allowed the production cuts they implemented between 2008 and 2014 to have a longer lasting effect on the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Third, early in 2011, Tyson began to satisfy a portion of its customers' demand by buying and reselling Broilers or Broiler parts from its competitors-a strategy Tyson dubbed \"Buy vs. Grow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195. According to this strategy, Tyson bought up excess production from its competitors in order to avoid the price depression that would occur if those Broilers had been sold on the open market. This strategy had a two-fold effect on Broiler supply: (1) allowing Tyson to cut its own production without losing customers; and (2) creating a mechanism for Tyson to communicate production cut levels to its competitors,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , i.e., \"don't produce more Broilers than Tyson is willing to buy.\" Plaintiffs allege that Tyson engaged in this strategy even though it would have cost less to supply its customers with its own Broilers, because the strategy kept overall supply low and prices high.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Lastly, Defendants increased Broiler exports. In 2006, Broiler exports constituted only 14.8% of U.S. Broiler production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. This number increased to 16.5% by 2007, and was never lower than 18.5% through 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Increasing exports enabled Defendants to continue to sell Broilers without affecting the price in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. Plaintiffs also allege that this increase in exports was undertaken specifically to lift prices in the United States, because otherwise it would have been more profitable to sell the eggs and Broilers in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Georgia Dock Price Index 2014-2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to alleging that Defendants conspired to artificially inflate prices by suppressing production, Plaintiffs allege that some Defendants sought to directly inflate prices by tampering with one of the primary Broiler price indexes. Broiler prices are reported primarily by three entities: Urner Barry (a subscription commodity price reporting service); the Georgia Department of Agriculture (known as Georgia Dock); and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. Urner Barry and the USDA prices are doubly verified through telephonic and written surveys of virtually all Broiler producers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. Georgia Dock also collects its pricing data by communications with producers, but unlike the USDA and Urner Barry prices, Georgia Dock does not verify the prices collected from producers against invoices or purchaser reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98. When asked for an explanation of this lack of a verification process, Georgia Dock responded that it trusts the producers to provide truthful information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The sincerity of this response, however, is undermined by that fact that seven Defendants exercise direct control over the Georgia Dock price index through participation in the Georgia Dock Advisory Committee, the existence of which was kept secret until 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. Additionally, several Georgia Dock employees have expressed concern about Georgia Dock's methods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. In early 2016, the USDA initiated an investigation into Georgia Dock, and concluded that it could no longer accept Broiler producers' price reports at face value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After generally mirroring each other from 2007 through 2013, by the end of the 2014, the USDA and Urner Barry prices had begun a significant decline while the Georgia Dock stayed level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89 (and the following chart).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that this deviation is due to Defendants' manipulation of prices reported to Georgia Dock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110, 113. By allegedly reporting false inflated prices to Georgia Dock, Defendants benefited from the use of artificially inflated Georgia Dock prices in the spot market and prospective contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Plaintiffs and their Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs are divided into three putative classes based on their position in the supply and demand chain, and each class has filed its own complaint: (1) direct purchasers (e.g., wholesalers and retailers), R. 212; (2) commercial and institutional indirect purchasers who resell chicken (e.g., retailers and restaurants), R. 253; and (3) indirect purchasers who cook or eat the chicken (e.g., restaurants and individuals), R. 255. Obviously, there is some overlap of the classes, particularly of the two classes of indirect purchasers, and that is reflected in the bulk of allegations concerning the conspiracy, which are nearly identical across the three complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   All Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege a conspiracy. The first part of this opinion addresses that argument. Since federal law prohibits indirect purchasers from pursuing damages under the Sherman Act, the Indirect Plaintiffs also make claims under state law antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment laws. The second part of this opinion addresses Defendants' arguments against these claims. As mentioned, the Sherman Act claims survive, as does at least one state law claim in every jurisdiction included in the complaint, except for Wisconsin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Conspiracy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To begin, the Court provides the following brief summary preview of its reasoning regarding Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim, which is explained in greater detail below. First, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged parallel conduct. The Court rejects Defendants' contention that the alleged conduct is too varied in its timing and methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court also finds that the alleged factual circumstances plausibly demonstrate that the parallel conduct was a product of a conspiracy. The Court finds plausible Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants conduct was unusual in comparison to the industry's history of regular production increases, and rejects Defendants' argument that the conspiracy as alleged would not be in the interests of all conspirators. Nothing about Plaintiffs' allegations indicates that the increase in the market price was insufficient to cover the various potential losses of market shares Defendants highlight. The Court also finds that the alleged conspiracy strategy-to take actions to restrain production, and then allow production to increase again to reap the benefits of the resulting price increase-is not implausible despite the large number of producers in the industry and the lack of an enforcement mechanism allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Further, although Plaintiffs have not alleged details about the formation, operation, and communications constituting the conspiracy, the facts included in the complaint are sufficient to plausibly infer formation and communication. Defendants' criticize the lack of details, but when a conspiracy is secret such details will not be available without discovery, and thus cannot be required at the pleading stage. Defendants' public statements of intent to cut production are indicative of an agreement considering the commodity nature of Broilers. Moreover, the extent of information sharing through Agri Stats is unusual, and plausibly amounts to a method of communication. This is all in the context of regular opportunities to collude at trade association meetings, plant tours, and the large number of other note opportunities that company executives had to interact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, Defendants' business strategies during the relevant time period are indicative of a conspiracy. Defendants: engaged in intra-competitor sales to manage production numbers; increased exports to reduce product in the U.S. market; switched from fixed price to variable price contracts to take advantage of price increases; and decreased the number of breeder flocks by unprecedented numbers. All of these are strategies that make sense in the context of a price-fixing conspiracy, which is plausibly alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although Defendants raise plausible alternative innocent explanations for their conduct, it is improper at this stage of the proceedings to weigh alternatives and which is more plausible. To the extent an innocent alternative explanation can serve to show that a conspiracy claim is not plausible in and of itself, the Court does not view the allegations in that way. There is simply too much unusual market movement, unusual public statements, unusual information sharing through Agri Stats, and a coincidence of business strategies that make dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims at this point in the case inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For these reasons, as discussed in greater detail below, Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants argue Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege a conspiracy in order to state a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

Defendants then also argue (b) that no rational producer would subscribe to the agreement Plaintiffs allege, and (c) that the large number of producers in the industry makes conspiracy impractical and thus implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Production Statistics\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants contend that, \"[a]lthough the central premise of the claimed conspiracy is reduced output, production actually increased.\" R. 280 at 4. This argument fails to undermine Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim for a number of reasons. First, it is based on an incorrect characterization of Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs' theory of the case is not that production decreased in absolute numbers, but that there was a decrease relative to the historic annual rate of production increase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 212 \u00b6 335. Additionally, the Seventh Circuit has noted that this is not an uncommon characteristic of price fixing conspiracies involving production restrictions, which can still require the ability to manage excess capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    High Fructose Corn Syrup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411822\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/651/#p658\">\n    295 F.3d at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The defendants continued to add to their capacity during the period of the alleged conspiracy. This behavior does not disprove the existence of the conspiracy, as the defendants argue. Maintenance of excess capacity discourages new entry, which supracompetitive prices would otherwise attract, and also shores up a cartel by increasing the risk that its collapse will lead to a devastating price war ending in the bankruptcy of some or all of the former cartelists.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, Defendants' argument is based on the following data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, showing an increase in production, which were not included in the complaint:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   R. 280 at 6. Although Plaintiffs cite some data from the Department of Agriculture in their complaint, this is not license for the Court to consider all data from the Department of Agriculture as incorporated into the complaint on this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Regardless of whether the data is incorporated into the complaint, the parties argue over whether the Court can take judicial notice of this data. The Court can certainly take judicial notice of the fact that the Department of Agriculture has\n   <em>\n    stated\n   </em>\n   these production numbers. But the Court declines to take judicial notice of the ultimate truth of these production numbers. Statistics such as these (i.e., statistics about a nationwide industry) are inherently a product of various calculation and collection methods, which can be reasonably questioned. Both sides have already produced a number of statistical charts to the Court, each claiming their accuracy. Both sides should also have the opportunity to argue to the Court why these statistics may not be what they seem, which necessarily cannot take place at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, even taking judicial notice of the fact that the Department of Agriculture says that this is the history of Broiler production over the relevant time period, the production increases do not undermine Plaintiffs' claims, at least at the pleading stage. The graph notes a significant production decrease in 2008-09. It also shows a decrease in 2011-12. These are the two periods during which Plaintiffs allege agreed upon production cuts. And \"to the extent that capacity increases took place after Defendants were able to effectuate their intended price increases, no further action by the conspirators is required to effect the objectives of the conspiracy because each sale at the fixed price continues to benefit the conspirators.\"\n   <em>\n    Kleen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830092\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/775/1071/#p1077\">\n    775 F.Supp.2d at 1077, n. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Morton's Market, Inc. v.

Further, the graph shows that Broiler production was approximately 36,500 in 2008 and approximately 38,000 in 2014, for a total increase of 1,500, and an average annual increase of 0.5%. This is well below the alleged historic annual 3% increase, as can be seen from the same Department of Agriculture data going back to the year 2000, which Plaintiffs included in their brief:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   R. 343 at 31. Thus, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, the data from the Department of Agriculture can be interpreted as consistent with Plaintiffs' claims that Defendants conspired to slow the increase of Broiler production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Extent and Means of Production Cuts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition to arguing that industry-wide production did not decrease, Defendants argue that \"[i]t is implausible that a producer would agree to give up 8% of its sales while its rivals give up only 2%.\" R. 280 at 17 (also noting that Plaintiffs allege a range of percentage reductions of between 1.25% and 10%). Certainly, at some point the difference in production cut or market share reductions would be so great that agreement becomes implausible. For instance, Defendants cite an Eleventh Circuit decision affirming dismissal of conspiracy claims involving two defendants whose market shares increased 20% and 50% respectively, while two other defendants' market shares declined 25% and 19% respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096102\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/1287/#p1321\">\n    346 F.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1321 (11th Cir. 2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs do not allege anywhere near such divergent shifts in production or market share among Defendants in this case. Furthermore, Defendants make no argument as to why the production cut percentage spread alleged here makes agreement implausible. Certainly, companies with a larger market share have more room to cut. And if the resulting price increase is large enough, convincing smaller companies to cut production, even in small amounts, could still benefit the bottom line of the larger companies, despite a potentially greater loss of market share.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Foley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493977\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/598/1323/#p1333\">\n    598 F.2d 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1333-34 (4th Cir. 1979) (some defendants did not act to implement the commission-fixing agreement until months after it formed, while at least one defendant implemented the new commissions before the conspiracy formed; still other defendants only partially joined,\n   taking higher commissions when available but otherwise pursuing lower ones).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants also question why a \"company would agree to close a plant in exchange for a competitor merely reducing its egg sets,\" since, \"[w]hile egg sets can be adjusted, closing a plant may be irreversible,\" and creates business issues beyond production (i.e., labor, public relations, accounting, taxes). R. 280 at 17. But as noted above, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants conspired to reduce production absolutely, but instead to reduce the rate of production increase. Similar to Defendants' concern with the spread of alleged production cut percentages, it is plausible that it was beneficial to some producers to achieve production cuts by whatever means they could get agreement, in the hopes that the price increase would be substantial enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Similarly, while Defendants argue that only\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of them are alleged to have destroyed or exported Broiler flocks, this argument improperly focuses on the particular public announcements Plaintiffs identify in their complaint. These announcements can be sufficient to demonstrate a plausible agreement without each announcement embodying the entire agreement. Moreover, to flesh out their allegations on this point, Plaintiffs have cited industry reports to support their allegation that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Defendants destroyed Broiler flocks. It is not surprising that not all defendants announced these tactics, making them available to Plaintiffs to include in their complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Number of Producers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants also point to the fact that the \"industry includes about 35 producers, only 17 of which are alleged ... to be conspirators,\" as indicating that conspiracy is not plausible. R. 280 at 26. But 100% industry participation is not necessary to plausibly allege a conspiracy. Additionally, the 17 Defendants are alleged to control 88.8% of the market. It cannot be credibly disputed that 88.8% of the market acting in concert is sufficient to control it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants contend, however, that with as many as 18 competitors in the market not bound by the conspiracy, Plaintiffs' failure to allege that these competitors did not have the ability to expand their production to make up for Defendants' production cuts in the market, makes the conspiracy implausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. This argument, however, ignores the rest of Plaintiffs' factual allegations (both already discussed and discussed below) indicating the existence of a conspiracy. Considering Plaintiffs' allegations as a whole (as the Court must), it is reasonable to infer that the other 18 non-defendant producers did not have the ability to fulfill the demand Defendants were leaving on the table. There is nothing about Plaintiffs' allegations compelling the Court to infer otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants also argue that a conspiracy of 17 is implausible because it would be too unwieldy. In particular, Defendants criticize Plaintiffs for failing to allege an \"enforcement mechanism.\" R. 280 at 27-29. In support of this argument, Defendants cite a Third Circuit decision holding that, \"Game theory teaches us that a cartel cannot survive absent some enforcement mechanism because otherwise the incentives to cheat are too great.\"\n   <em>\n    Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517199\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/998/1224/#p1233\">\n    998 F.2d 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1233 (3d Cir. 1993) (citing Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 265-66 (3d ed. 1986)). But\n   <em>\n    Petruzzi's\n   </em>\n   was decided in the context of a summary judgment motion, and Defendants have cited no authority that an \"enforcement mechanism\" must be alleged in order to state a claim. The only case in this district the Court has found discussing the relevance of an enforcement mechanism was also in the context of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleen Products LLC v. International Paper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419037\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/811/#p842\">\n    276 F.Supp.3d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203310975\">\n    2017 WL 3310975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23 (N.D.Ill. Aug. 3, 2017). And even there, the court explained that the lack of evidence of an enforcement mechanism made \"the inference\n   <em>\n    tend\n   </em>\n   [ ] toward no agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203310975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Court did not hold that the lack of enforcement mechanism was dispositive of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Furthermore, the logic supporting the need for an enforcement mechanism assumes that all producers must hold the line on the conspiracy at all times. This makes sense in a case like\n   <em>\n    Petruzzi's\n   </em>\n   , which concerned a cartel that \"allocated customers\" in a particular industry.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517199\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/998/1224/#p1233\">\n    998 F.2d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The entire point of the conspiracy was the maintenance of individual monopolies for each defendant over their customer bases. Any deviation would destroy the point of the conspiracy, so logically the conspirators needed a mechanism to enforce continuity of the agreement. Here by contrast, Plaintiffs have alleged a conspiracy to cut production during certain limited periods of time in order to increase prices. It is plausible that the conspiracy would contemplate that after cutting production and successfully inflating prices, Defendants would be permitted to again increase production to take advantage of those price increases. No enforcement mechanism akin to that in\n   <em>\n    Petruzzi's\n   </em>\n   is necessarily required under Plaintiffs' theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plus Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In addition to questioning the underlying premise of the complaint, Defendants contend that the particular factual plus factors Plaintiffs identify to support the plausibility of their claims are lacking. All of the plus factors Plaintiffs say contribute to the plausibility of their claims-including (a) forms of communication, such as industry or trade association meetings, and public statements by executives, (b) Agri Stats, and (c) the shift to short-term contracts and purchases from competitors-must be viewed in light of the underlying premise of Plaintiffs' claims, i.e., that between 2008 and 2014, the Broiler market experienced unprecedented movement, and the Broiler producers took unprecedented action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830092\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/775/1071/#p1077\">\n    775 F.Supp.2d at 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"character and effect of a conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts, but only by looking at it as a whole\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Ore Co. v.

Plaintiffs allege that by 2007 there was a consensus in the Broiler industry that prices were too low because they were near or below the cost of production. That year, several of the larger producers unsuccessfully attempted to increase prices through unilateral production cuts. In January 2008, immediately after an industry convention, the large producers made public statements calling for industry-wide production cuts. \"Defendants' discussion of the need for capacity discipline within the industry as a whole is notable because it involves more than a mere announcement of [each individual] [d]efendant's own planned course of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Domestic Airline Travel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270945\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/46/#p69\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d at 62-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And sure enough, soon thereafter, a number of other producers publicly announced that they would cut production. In an industry where history has shown unilateral production cuts to be ineffective at moving prices, the announcement of production cuts soon after demands by other producers for such cuts is indicative of agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270945\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/46/#p69\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270945\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/46/#p69\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Defendants' statements concerning the focus on exercising capacity discipline ... were a deviation from past business practices,\" thus indicating collusion.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Further, in an industry in which unilateral production cuts expose a company to loss of market share, a publicly announced production cut makes it more likely that the producer has an agreement from other producers to either cut production as well, or at least to forebear from assuming the vacated market share.

This principle (to the extent it can be described as such) does not exclude the possibility that public statements\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   contribute to the plausibility of a conspiracy under the right circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    (i) Public Statements.\n   </strong>\n   The primary case Defendants cite to support their argument that public statements can never contribute to the plausibility of a conspiracy claim is to the contrary.

R. 280 at 30. But this argument merely notes the circumstances in which the statements were made. It is certainly possible for a statement to have multiple purposes or meanings directed at different audiences. For purposes of evaluating Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims, what is important to the Court's analysis is not so much the immediate context in which the statements were made, but the larger context of the market and industry actions. Although Defendants cite a court in this district finding that \"[i]t difficult to imagine how these generic [public] statements render the conspiracy allegation more plausible,\" that court nevertheless went on to deny a motion to dismiss based on the totality of the allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plasma-Derivative\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189962\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/764/991/#p1000\">\n    764 F.Supp.2d at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed, the Court considers the public statements at issue in this case with the same broad perspective and in the context of Plaintiffs' overall theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii) Opportunities to Collude.\n   </strong>\n   Similar to their criticism of Plaintiffs' reliance on public statements, Defendants argue that \"opportunities\" to collude at industry and trade association meetings do not make a conspiracy plausible. But just as a speaker can intend statements to convey different meanings to difference audiences, meetings can serve different purposes depending on a participant's interests. As the Seventh Circuit has held, such meetings can \"facilitate price fixing.\"\n   <em>\n    Text Messaging\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052985\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/622/#p627\">\n    630 F.3d at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The context within which those meetings take place is key to determining the significance of the occurrence\n   of those meetings to the plausibility of a conspiracy claim. Here, where Plaintiffs' have alleged suspicious timing of important industry conferences in January 2008 and 2011, followed by unusual producer actions and market movements, those meetings plausibly help to fill-out the picture of Defendants' alleged conspiratorial agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Agri Stats\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants also argue that the existence of Agri Stats does not plausibly suggest the existence of a conspiracy because \"Agri Stats was in business long before the alleged conspiracy period,\" and courts \"routinely reject efforts to depict long-standing practices as reflective of a more recent conspiracy.\" R. 280 at 33. This is true with respect to practices that constitute the mechanism of effectuating price fixes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9440129\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/288/1028/#p1033\">\n    288 F.3d 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1033-34 (7th Cir. 2002) (defendants alleged to have conspired to fix prices through charge back agreements that were in place prior to the alleged commencement of the conspiracy). But here Agri Stats is not the mechanism Defendants are alleged to have used to effectuate the price increases-that would be the means of their production cuts. Rather, Plaintiffs allege Defendants used Agri Stats as a means of communication and monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants question whether the role Agri Stats allegedly played in the conspiracy is plausible considering Plaintiffs do not allege that Agri Stats was a co-conspirator and that Agri Stats is a subsidiary of a publicly owned company, and its existence is no secret.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 280 at 34. Plaintiffs clearly allege, however, that the information provided by Agri Stats simply facilitated the conspiracy. It was a tool Defendants used to help implement their conspiracy. Agri Stats does not have to be a co-conspirator or a secret to play this alleged role, possibility unwittingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Short-Term Contracts &amp; Inter-Competitor Sales\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, two additional circumstances indicate that a collusive agreement existed. First, beginning in 2008, Defendants allegedly shifted to short-term contracts with variable pricing. This shift indicates that Defendants anticipated higher prices and wanted to have the flexibility to take advantage of that market. Second, Tyson began buying Broiler products from its competitors in order to satisfy its own customers, even though this practice allegedly cost more than producing and selling its own Broilers. This practice plausibly indicates that Tyson knew that the other producers from which it was buying would not simply consider Tyson's orders as additional demand on top of their current demand, and increase production to meet that increased demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 212 \u00b6 246 (Plaintiffs allege that \"Tyson's continued use of Buy vs. Grow ... allows Tyson and other Defendants to reduce production on a month-to-month basis and have opportunities to learn more information about one another's production and pricing.\"). Fieldale Farms also subscribed to this strategy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 342. It is plausible that Tyson and Fieldale only makes purchases from their competitors because Defendants had agreed to restrict their production accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendants argue that the shift in contract form and sales among competitors do not plausibly suggest a conspiracy because only a few of the defendants participated and there are plausible alternative explanations for these business strategies. With respect to the first argument, Plaintiffs do not allege that these strategies were necessary to effectuate the conspiracy. Rather, Plaintiffs argue that these strategies are the kind of strategies a producer might undertake if they knew an agreement to restrict production was in place. The fact\n   that businesses sometimes follow these strategies without the assurance of a price fixing conspiracy does not change the fact that these strategies are far less risky when taken in the context of such an agreement. Thus, these practices serve to bolster the plausibility of a conspiratorial agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As for alternative explanations for these strategies, the Court will address that argument with respect to Plaintiffs' claims more broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Alternative Explanations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants contend that\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   requires this Court to reject Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims if \"there are 'obvious alternative explanations' for why some individual Defendants would elect to lower output.\" R. 280 at 20 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 370 at 7 (\"a plaintiff must demonstrate that alleged parallel behavior would probably not result from ... independent responses to common stimuli\").

Defendants contend that to the extent Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged unusual production cuts, the cuts were a product of high feed costs and the Great Recession. It is logical that high costs combined with weak demand would lead at least some producers to cut production on the basis that such a shrunken profit margin was insufficient to support their past production levels. As Defendants point out, the Fifth Circuit drew this conclusion with respect to one of the defendants in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pilgrim's Pride Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052603,3697311\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/457/\">\n    728 F.3d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462-63 (5th Cir. 2013).

Any direct evidence of the agreement will only be uncovered through discovery. Allegations that each defendant participated in the parallel conduct, participated in the meetings that provided the opportunity to collude, participated in Agri Stats, and participated in variable contracts or exports, are sufficient to allege participation in the agreement. Furthermore, most of Defendants' arguments boil down to the contention that Plaintiffs' allegations are wrong: they did not agree; they did not cut production; they actually increased market share. But all of these are arguments that should be tested by discovery; and they are not arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to allege participation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Anti-Biotic Free\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Another one of Defendants, Fieldale Farms, argues that the claims against it should be dismissed because it only produces anti-biotic free chicken meat. Fieldale contends that anti-biotic free chicken meat \"has different growing costs, production methods, pricing, demand, and other market characteristics than conventional chicken.\" R. 281 at 1. For these reasons, Fieldale argues that its production of anti-biotic free chicken meat undermines Plaintiffs' theory of the case to the extent it is dependent on Broilers' commodity nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Court agrees that Plaintiffs' theory of the case is strongly dependent upon the allegation that the Broiler market functions as a commodity market. But whether or not the inclusion of anti-biotic free chicken meat undermines this commodity nature, or whether it functions as a separate and unrelated market, is a question of fact. Fieldale primarily cites the Focus Management Report on the poultry industry because Plaintiffs cite it in the complaint (although they don't attach it) to support their allegation of the commodity nature of the Broiler industry. The Focus Management Report groups anti-biotic free chicken meat with organic and free range chicken meat, which Plaintiffs excluded from their definition of \"Broilers.\" On this basis, Fieldale argues that Plaintiffs cannot reasonably include anti-biotic free chicken in their definition of Broilers. But this is a superficial argument. The Focus Management Report is a basis for Plaintiffs to plausibly allege that the Broiler market functions as a commodity market. It would also serve as a plausible basis for Fieldale to allege that anti-biotic chicken meat undermines that commodity nature. But by itself, without further factual development and explanation, the Court cannot, and at the pleading stage must not, decide who is right. Of course, Plaintiffs chose to carve out organic, free range, halal, and kosher chicken from their definition of \"Broilers.\" And Fieldale's argument that anti-biotic free chicken meat is analogous to these excluded categories has facial appeal based on a trip to the grocery\n   store. But that is not a basis for dismissing a claim that requires analysis of complex economic theories and data. The Court suspects that Fieldale's argument might have merit, but the pleading stage is not the place to make that call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Pilgrim's Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Pilgrim's was in bankruptcy proceedings until it was discharged on December 28, 2008. Pilgrim's argues that to the extent it was part of a conspiratorial price fixing agreement during its bankruptcy proceedings, any claim based on that conduct has been discharged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 295. Plaintiffs, however, argue that Pilgrim's reentered the conspiracy after its discharge, and that it can be jointly and severally liable for the entire conspiracy on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Pilgrim's argues that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that it reentered the conspiracy after its bankruptcy discharge. The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs allege that Pilgrims announced production cuts in February 2009, R. 212 \u00b6 184; announced the closure of three processing plants in February 2009,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187; attended various industry meetings and trade association meetings through the remainder of the relevant time period,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 207, 214; joined the shift to variable price contracts,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 208; closed a plant in July 2011,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 217; made statements indicative of knowledge of an agreement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229; and closed another plant in June 2012,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 232. For reasons explained generally in addressing Defendants' argument against Plaintiffs' conspiracy allegations, these allegations are sufficient to allege that Pilgrim's rejoined the conspiracy after its discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Pilgrim's also argues that even if it is found to have rejoined the conspiracy, the Bankruptcy Code prohibits it from being liable for damages incurred before its bankruptcy discharge date. The Seventh Circuit recently issued a holding diametrically opposed to Pilgrim's contention:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   We noted earlier that defendant RockTenn is in a different position from the other defendants, because it filed for bankruptcy and received a discharge on June 30, 2010, approximately four months before the end of the class period. The district court refused to dismiss RockTenn on that basis because it found evidence that RockTenn re-joined the conspiracy after the discharge. (For example, on the very evening of the day when the discharge order was entered, RockTenn's president sent an email stating \"I assume we are announcing tomorrow,\" after three other defendants announced a simultaneous price increase.) The court also found that RockTenn might be jointly and severally liable for actions undertaken by its co-conspirators before the discharge, based on its post-discharge participation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Havoco of Am., Ltd. v.

RockTenn is free to argue at trial that it did not re-join the conspiracy. There is no conflict with bankruptcy law, however, if it did so, because in that case its liability would be predicated on post-discharge conduct. To the extent that these nuances need to be brought to the jury's attention, we are confident that the district court can do so through proper instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Kleen Prod.

It is \"possible to imagine\" overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy taking place on or after September 2, 2012. Plaintiffs' allegations permit such an inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 212 \u00b6 218 (Sanderson's 2011 production cut remains in place beyond January 2012); \u00b6 255 (\"The early slaughter of breeder flocks in 2011 through mid-2012 meant that Defendants subsequently were unable to increase production for at least eighteen months ....\"); \u00b6 229 (Pilgrim's CEP reported that \"the die is cast for 2012\" and \"we're comfortable that the industry is going to remain constrained\"); \u00b6 231 (Tyson's announce production decrease in May 2012); \u00b6 234 (Pilgrim's laid off 190 employees); \u00b6 236 (Tyson's CEO states in August 2012 that the \"vast majority of our contracts ... allow for conversations about adjusting prices to move ... and we will continue to push for even more of these types of contracts\"); \u00b6 237 (Koch Foods CEO states \"the industry will be forced to get price increases of 10 to 15 percent\" for 2013); \u00b6 238 (Sanderson announces production cut on August 28, 2012); \u00b6 240 (Defendants' senior executives attend the\n   National Chicken Council annual meeting); \u00b6 243 (Pilgrim's CEO stated on May 3, 2013 that \"supply continues to be disciplined and constrained\"); \u00b6 246 (Tyson's CEO reported that through its \"buy versus grow strategy we continue to keep our supply short of demand.\").

It may be that Defendants will be able to prove that the 2008 conspiracy had ended by 2010, and that a new conspiracy began 2011. But it is also plausible that a conspiracy would contemplate allowing the conspirators to increase production at a certain point to take advantage of the inflated price the conspiracy achieved through production cuts. And Plaintiffs allege that the inflated prices continued from 2008 onward. The fact that Defendants are alleged to have taken unprecedented actions in order to cut production twice within a four year period, plausibly indicates that the conspiracy was continuing through 2012, and the momentary production increase was an agreed pause in the production cuts to take full advantage of higher prices. For these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims are not untimely on the face of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Discovery Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   To the extent Plaintiffs have insufficiently alleged a continuing violation, they have sufficiently alleged that the discovery rule saves the timeliness of their earliest claims. The discovery rule \"postpones the beginning of the limitations period from the date when the plaintiff is wronged to the date when he discovers he has been injured.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Copper Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939928\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/782/#p789\">\n    436 F.3d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789 (7th Cir. 2006). Under this rule, \"accrual occurs when the plaintiff discovers that he has been\n   <em>\n    injured\n   </em>\n   and who has\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939928\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/782/#p789\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).

It may be true that it was\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   for Plaintiffs to have discovered these statements on the dates they were made. The Court, however, is unwilling to hold that Plaintiffs should be charged with a level of diligence requiring them to follow Defendants' executives' public statements such that they were immediately aware of these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Further, even if some Plaintiffs can properly be held to such a level of diligence, there is a question of fact as to what conclusion Plaintiffs could draw from those statements alone.

In particular, Plaintiffs cite a \"widely circulated\" book titled\n   <em>\n    The Meat Racket\n   </em>\n   , published on February 18, 2014, in which the author suggested \"that conditions in the Broiler industry had become susceptible to collusion.\" R. 212 \u00b6 372. And on January 18, 2016, the Wall Street Journal published an article the \"raised the possibility of collusion by Defendants to artificially raise, fix, or maintain Broiler prices.\" R. 212 \u00b6 372. At some point between February 18, 2014 and January 18, 2016, Plaintiffs discovered the facts enabling them to bring these claims. It is not possible on these allegations for the Court to determine precisely when Plaintiffs' claim accrued under the discovery rule. To the extent such a determination is necessary, it must await further factual discovery. But in any case, since the entire time\n   period falls within the four-year statute of limitations for Plaintiffs' federal claims, it is unnecessary to identify the date when Plaintiffs should have discovered their injuries with any further specificity. Suffice to say that prior to February 18, 2014, the complaints do not contain factual information indicating that any plaintiff had or should have discovered a totality of evidence sufficient to have enabled them to state a claim in compliance with Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Georgia Dock\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that their allegations that some Defendants manipulated the Georgia Dock price index serve to demonstrate an additional means by which Defendants effectuated their conspiracy to fix prices in the Broiler market. Defendants argue that only seven of them are alleged to have participated in a conspiracy to manipulate the Georgia Dock price index, so Plaintiffs' Georgia Dock allegations cannot be a part of the same conspiracy as the conspiracy to cut production among all defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   It is unnecessary for the Court to address whether the Georgia Dock allegations constitute a separate conspiracy at this point in the proceedings. Regardless of whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a continuing price fixing conspiracy from the production cuts in 2008 and 2011 through the alleged Georgia Dock price fixing, they have at least plausibly alleged a separate conspiracy involving Georgia Dock price fixing among some of the defendants. The defendants alleged to have been involved do not meaningfully challenge this claim. Either way, Plaintiffs have stated a claim with respect to the Georgia Dock that will proceed to discovery. Whether Georgia Dock should be considered a separate conspiracy, or a continuation of the production cut conspiracy, can await summary judgment or a pretrial motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Arguments against the Indirect Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Having addressed Plaintiffs' conspiracy allegations necessary to state a claim for violation of the Sherman Act, the Court now turns to arguments Defendants make particular to the Indirect Plaintiffs. The Court addresses: (A) Article III standing; (B) antitrust standing, for both Indirect Plaintiffs' Sherman Act and state antitrust claims; (C) other issues with Plaintiffs' state antitrust claims; (D) Plaintiffs' state consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims; and (E) the statutes of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Defendants argue that the Indirect Plaintiffs do not have standing to assert claims under laws for states in which they do not allege any of the named plaintiffs purchased chicken. Standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the alleged conduct of the defendant, and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

The Court will address Defendants' arguments regarding the consumer protection laws in Arkansas and Rhode Island, as well as states for which Plaintiffs do not bring an antitrust claim: Florida, Hawaii, Montana, South Carolina, and Vermont. This analysis will include consideration of Defendants' argument that in three states (Florida, Missouri, South Carolina) that have not passed repealer statutes and thus follow\n   <em>\n    IllinoisBrick's\n   </em>\n   ban on indirect purchasers seeking damages, this principle also prevents indirect purchasers from seeking damages for antitrust injuries under those states' consumer protection statutes.

The Eighth Circuit (of which Arkansas is a part) has held that this catch-all must be interpreted in light of the enumerated conduct, such that it only serves to prohibit other instances of \"false representation, fraud, or the improper use of economic leverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Univ.Coops., Inc. v.

The parties cite cases both applying and declining to apply Rule 9(b) to the FDUTPA. The courts that decline to apply Rule 9(b) to the FDUTPA have not done so on the reasoning Plaintiffs propose.

On this authority, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' Missouri consumer protection act claim is not barred by\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

Plaintiffs, however, cite several cases permitting such claims to proceed to discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cast Iron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205166014\">\n    2015 WL 5166014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *32 ;\n   <em>\n    Los Gatos Mercantile, Inc. v.

By contrast, Defendants cite only one case dismissing such a claim, and that case failed to consider the authority to the contrary. The Court will follow the majority of courts on this issue, and allow the claim to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   South Carolina prohibits class actions under its consumer protection law. For this reason, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs should be prevented from bringing their South Carolina consumer protection claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 293 at 36-37. The Court rejects this argument for the reasons stated with respect to Illinois's antitrust statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Vermont\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The only argument Defendants make with respect to Plaintiffs' claim under Vermont's consumer protection statute is that is fails to satisfy Rule 9(b). But as with several other states' laws analyzed in this opinion, Defendants fail to cite any authority in support of their argument. The Court rejects it for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Statutes of Limitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   With respect to states that apply at least a four year statute of limitations to either their antitrust or consumer protection statutes, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that those claims are untimely for the same reasons stated with respect to Plaintiffs' federal claims. The same is true for states that apply a three-year statute of limitations in conjunction with the discovery rule. Based on this reasoning, Plaintiffs' pleadings are sufficient to plausibly allege the timeliness of all their state law antitrust claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Three states apply statutes of limitations of two years or less to their consumer\n   protection act statutes. Two of those states, Utah and Oregon, have antitrust statutes that will otherwise proceed to discovery. Thus, the Court will not address the statute of limitations with respect to those states' consumer protection statutes at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The statute of limitations for Montana's consumer protection statute is two years, and Montana follows the discovery rule. The Court's application of the discovery rule with respect to Plaintiffs' federal claims focused on February 18, 2014, the date a \"widely read\" book suggesting that the Broiler industry could be subject to collusion was published, and January 18, 2016, when a Wall Street Journal article discussed evidence of collusion in the Broiler industry. The statutory period for Montana consumer protection act ends squarely between these two dates. In other words, if the Court finds that Plaintiffs' claims accrued as early at February 18, 2014 when the book was published, Plaintiffs' Montana consumer protection act claim is untimely. But as discussed with respect to Plaintiffs' federal claims, Plaintiffs' complaint does not plead itself out of court with respect to the discovery rule. It is possible to imagine that Plaintiffs' claims accrued after September 2, 2014, such that they are timely. Defendants' motion to dismiss the Indirect Plaintiffs' claim under the Montana consumer protection statute is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motions to dismiss, R. 279; R. 292 are denied except that Plaintiffs' claims under the laws of Wisconsin are dismissed, such that Defendants' motion to dismiss the Indirect Plaintiffs' claim is granted in part. The Court has not addressed all of Defendants' arguments seeking dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims. But the Court's opinion explains that at least one claim in each jurisdiction will proceed to discovery, with the exception of Wisconsin. Any state law claim the Court has addressed and dismissed, is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   To the extent Plaintiffs believe they can cure the deficiencies the Court has described with respect to their claims under Wisconsin law, Plaintiffs may file a joint motion for leave to amend by December 20, 2017, supported by a brief of no more than five pages explaining how the amendments would cure Plaintiffs' allegations. The proposed amended paragraphs of the complaints (not the entire complaints) should also be attached as an exhibit. No defendant should file a responding brief unless the Court so orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   To the extent it is necessary in order to streamline a trial or assess damages for the Court to address the additional state law claims not addressed in this opinion, or to reconsider dismissal of state law claims under the laws of jurisdictions for which other claims are proceeding, the Court will address those issues when appropriate. For now, however, the parties know which jurisdictions remain in play and which are out. That is a sufficient basis to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    The motions were supported by a number of briefs, some filed by Defendants jointly, others individually.
