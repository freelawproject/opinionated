ECF No. 19. However, on February 20, 2015, Petitioner, by counsel, moved to withdraw his guilty plea. ECF No. 23.

On June 30, 2015, Petitioner appeared before the Court with his counsel, Mr. Bouchard, and indicated his desire to enter a plea of guilty to Counts One and Three of the criminal indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement with the United States (\"Government\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44. Notably, this plea agreement contains the following provision: \"Pursuant [to] Fed. R. Crim.

After the Court conducted proceedings in accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Court found that Petitioner's plea was knowing and voluntary; accepted Petitioner's plea of guilty to Counts One and Three of the indictment; and found Petitioner guilty of the offenses charged in those counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    D. SENTENCING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioner's sentencing hearing was set for November 2, 2015. ECF No. 47. Prior to sentencing, the probation officer prepared Petitioner's presentence investigation report (\"PSR\"), and classified Petitioner as both an Armed Career Criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), and a Career Offender under Chapter 4 of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because the Armed Career Criminal enhancement resulted in a higher offense level (34) than the Career Offender offense level (28), the probation officer applied the offense level of 34.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing USSG \u00a7 4B1.4 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The probation officer identified the following three predicate \"violent felonies\" as triggering the ACCA enhancement: (1) a 2004 robbery conviction in Virginia; (2) a 2006 third-degree robbery conviction in New York; and (3) a 2006 carjacking conviction in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The probation officer also determined that Petitioner's 2006 third-degree robbery conviction in New York and his 2006 carjacking conviction in Virginia qualified as predicate \"crimes of violence,\" which triggered the Career Offender enhancement under Chapter 4 of the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, the relevant documents in the probation officer's possession at the time of preparing the PSR appeared to indicate that Petitioner committed the 2006 New York robbery at age 18 and that he was sentenced to a jail term of nine months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    \u00b6 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

PSR, ECF No. 50, \u00b6 39. While eleven criminal history points normally results in a CHC of V, the ACCA enhancement requires the defendant to receive the highest CHC among USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.4(c)(1), (2), and (3), which was VI in Petitioner's case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 40-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the probation officer calculated a total offense level of 31, which reflected a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and a CHC of VI, resulting in an advisory Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 68-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 2, 2015, Petitioner appeared before the Court for sentencing. ECF No. 53. At the sentencing hearing, Petitioner, by counsel, objected to his classification as an Armed Career Criminal in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   \"). After hearing argument at the sentencing hearing, the Court overruled this objection, and the PSR was adopted without change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55 at 1. The Court ultimately imposed a sentence within the Guidelines-200 months in prison-which included 200 months on Count One and 120 months on Count Three, to be served concurrently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment, ECF No. 54, at 2.

In light of this ruling, the Court appointed the Office of the Federal Public Defender to represent Petitioner for purposes of his \u00a7 2255 motion; ordered such counsel to file an amended \u00a7 2255 motion; and set a briefing schedule. July 12, 2017 Order, ECF No. 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 8, 2017, Petitioner, by counsel, filed his Amended \u00a7 2255 Motion asking the Court to vacate his current sentence and impose a new prison term of time served based on the following three arguments: (1) Petitioner was wrongly classified as an Armed Career Criminal in light of\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   ; (2) Petitioner's prior New York robbery conviction\n   was incorrectly awarded criminal history points resulting in Petitioner's incorrect classification as a Career Offender; and (3) Petitioner's defense counsel rendered constitutionally defective assistance in connection with these errors during critical stages of his prosecution.

In such Order, the Court advised that it had received public records from the Clerk of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Kings, in Case No. 5292-2005,\n   <em>\n    People v. Clinton Austin\n   </em>\n   , which show that Petitioner committed his New York robbery conviction when he was 17 years old; Petitioner should not have received criminal history points for such offense under the Sentencing Guidelines; and, in turn, Petitioner should not have been classified as a Career Offender at the time of his sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 13, 2017, the Court conducted a status hearing on the instant motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67. At such hearing, the Government advised the Court that its position with respect to Petitioner's Amended \u00a7 2255 Motion had changed since filing its response brief.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, the Government conceded to the following assertions made in Petitioner's Amended \u00a7 2255 Motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1. In addition to being incorrectly classified as an Armed Career Criminal at the time of his sentencing, Petitioner was also incorrectly classified as a Career Offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   2.

Accordingly, Petitioner should be resentenced to time served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In light of these concessions, both counsel for Petitioner and counsel for the Government agreed during the status hearing that a resentencing hearing in this case would not be necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ECF No. 63 at 4-5. In\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit held that a Virginia robbery conviction does not qualify as a \"violent felony\" under the force clause of the ACCA and therefore cannot be a predicate \"violent felony\" in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which held that the ACCA's residual clause is void for vagueness.\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277532\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/677/\">\n    850 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   685 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

Because Petitioner's 2004 Virginia robbery conviction was used as one of the three predicate offenses in designating him as an Armed Career Criminal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 24, Petitioner argues that he was wrongly classified as an Armed Career Criminal at the time of his sentencing. Importantly, the Government agrees with Petitioner on this point and concedes that Petitioner should be resentenced without the ACCA designation. Resp., ECF No. 7, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court agrees. It is clear that Petitioner's prior conviction for Virginia robbery is not a violent felony under the ACCA after\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   and thus Petitioner did not have three qualifying predicate offenses to warrant classification as an Armed Career Criminal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the\n   Court\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   that Petitioner's ACCA designation was unlawful, constituted a fundamental defect in his sentence, and resulted in a miscarriage of justice, which should be remedied under \u00a7 2255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Petitioner's Classification as a Career Offender Was a Fundamental Defect that Amounted to a Miscarriage of Justice.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Petitioner also argues that he was wrongly classified as a Career Offender at the time of his sentencing, and that his counsel, Mr. Bouchard, was ineffective when he failed to (1) discover the error; (2) withdraw Petitioner's plea agreement, which was premised on such error; and (3) object to such error in the PSR at sentencing. ECF No. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As this Court explained in its November 2, 2017 Order, court documents definitively show that Petitioner's 2006 third-degree robbery conviction in New York was committed when Petitioner was still 17 years old and that such conviction should never have received criminal history points pursuant to Section 4A1.2(d) of the 2014 Guidelines Manual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 66. Pursuant to the career offender provision of the Guidelines, a prior conviction must receive criminal history points under Chapter 4 to qualify as a predicate offense. USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. Note 3(A). Therefore, the Court found that Petitioner's New York robbery conviction was not a qualifying \"crime of violence\" under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a), and Petitioner should not have been classified as a Career Offender at his sentencing. As noted above, the Government conceded to this fact at the November 13, 2017 status hearing. ECF No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   However, it is clear that the probation officer was unaware of the correct offense date for Petitioner's New York robbery conviction at the time she prepared the PSR. PSR \u00b6 33. Indeed, the documents in her possession at the time suggested that Petitioner committed the offense on July 20, 2005, when Petitioner was 18 years old. Furthermore, such information-though erroneous-was consistent with the understanding of both the Government and Petitioner's first defense counsel, Mr. Cejas, that the New York robbery conviction was an \"adult\" conviction and would qualify as a predicate offense for purposes of the Career Offender guideline. Indeed, this mutual understanding constituted the singular basis for Petitioner's withdrawal of his first and second pleas, and ultimately resulted in an entirely different plea offer from the Government, which was indisputably premised on Petitioner's classification as a Career Offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In light of these unique circumstances, the Court ultimately\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   that Petitioner's erroneous classification as a Career Offender was a fundamental defect in Petitioner's sentence that amounted to a miscarriage of justice under \u00a7 2255. While courts must be reluctant to find a misapplication of the Guidelines to be a fundamental defect where a petitioner's sentence was under the maximum provided by the law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180966\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/931/#p936\">\n    784 F.3d at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court finds that this case presents an exceptional circumstance for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, unlike the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   and the cases cited therein, Petitioner's Career Offender classification in this case was incorrect\n   <em>\n    at the time of Petitioner's sentencing\n   </em>\n   ; it was not later invalidated by case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180966\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/931/#p936\">\n    784 F.3d at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]here is no decision left standing in any circuit whereby a challenge to one's change in career offender status,\n   <em>\n    originally determined correctly under the advisory Guidelines\n   </em>\n   , is cognizable on collateral review.\") (emphasis added). Indeed, there was clear procedural error that occurred before and during Petitioner's sentencing that directly resulted in a significant sentencing enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, such error was highly prejudicial to Petitioner. Not only did Petitioner face a considerably higher advisory range at the time of sentencing, the Guidelines error infected nearly every critical stage of Petitioner's prosecution. The Government and defense counsel's mistaken understanding that Petitioner was a Career Offender defined the \"benefit of the bargain\" for both parties during plea negotiations. Given that both parties believed Petitioner's Guidelines range would be in excess of twenty years, Petitioner ultimately waived his right to contest his Career Offender status in exchange for pleading to Counts One and Three with statutory maximums of ten and twenty years, respectively, as opposed to Count Two, which carried a maximum term of life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Agreement, ECF No. 45, \u00b6 4. In sum, without this Guidelines error, the parties' bargain would have certainly been different, which is obvious from the record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, this case is exceptional because the Government concedes to the extraordinary prejudice and injustice suffered by Petitioner as a result of the Guidelines error, and agrees that he is entitled to resentencing. At the status hearing, the Government admitted that, if Petitioner were resentenced today, his advisory Guidelines range would be 24 to 30 months as set forth in Petitioner's Amended \u00a7 2255 Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 63 at 14. By contrast, if the Career Offender enhancement applied, Petitioner's Guidelines range would be extraordinarily higher: 151 to 188 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Given these unique circumstances, the Court\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   that Petitioner's erroneous classification as a Career Offender was an extraordinary misapplication of the Guidelines that warrants relief under \u00a7 2255.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Petitioner's Amended \u00a7 2255 Motion is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Furthermore, based on the agreement of the Government and Petitioner, which was stated on the record at the November 13, 2017 status conference, the Court\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   that the appropriate remedy for Petitioner's unlawful sentence is to correct Petitioner's sentence to reflect a prison term of time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
