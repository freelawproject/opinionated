This matter is presently before the Court on defendant's request for judicial notice, (Doc. 13) and motion to dismiss, (Doc. 12). Oral argument was held on November 14, 2017. For the reasons stated below, defendant's motion is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant manufactures and sells dietary supplements and sports nutrition products. (Doc. 9 at PageID 174). Plaintiff purchased and consumed the dietary supplement MusclePharm Glutamine (the Product) marketed and sold by defendant throughout the four years preceding the filing of his complaint. (Doc. 9 at PageID 176). The Product's label and online advertisements indicate that it enhances muscle growth and recovery, supports rebuilding and recovery from the toughest workouts, reduces catabolism and supports an anabolic environment, aids in muscle growth, causes faster recovery, and helps consumers rehydrate, rebuild, and recover faster and more efficiently. (Doc. 9 at PageID 175).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Glutamine\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a \"naturally occurring, nonessential, neutral amino acid.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 176). \"It is important as a constituent of proteins and as a means of nitrogen transport between tissues.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 177). Plaintiff alleges that many healthy people, including athletes and body builders, are under the impression that increased intake of glutamine has beneficial effects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He concedes that Glutamine naturally found within the body plays a role in muscle growth, recovery, and immunity support, but alleges that \"glutamine supplementation has been found to be completely ineffective at mimicking these physiological responses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In short, plaintiff alleges that \"the ingestion of defendant's Product does absolutely nothing for the recovery from exercise, recovery of muscle tissue, enhancement of muscle or ability to decrease muscle wasting.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 178).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff bases his claims regarding the ineffectiveness of glutamine supplements on nine scientific studies. The first study showed that \"glutamine failed to affect muscle protein kinetics of the test subjects.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 179, n. 2). In a second study, \"glutamine was continuously infused\" in \"healthy humans\" \"for 2.5 hours at a rate corresponding to .4 grams/kg\" and \"revealed that glutamine provision did [not] stimulate muscle protein synthesis.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 179, n. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a third study, researchers investigated the effect of glutamine supplementation\n   on the plasma and muscle tissue glutamine concentrations of exercise-trained rates immediately and three hours after a single exercise session until exhaustion. (Doc. 9 at PageID 180, n. 4). During the final three weeks of the six-week study, one group of rats received a daily dose of glutamine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). While \"[t]he plasma and muscle glutamine levels were higher than placebo during the post-exhaustive recovery period,\" the \"increase had no effect on the exercise swim test to exhaustion performance, suggesting that elevations in plasma and muscle glutamine levels have no benefit on muscle performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A fourth study investigated \"the effect of oral glutamine supplementation combined with resistance training in young adults.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 180, n. 5). Subjects received either a placebo or glutamine during six weeks of resistance training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Results showed that muscle strength and torque, fat free mass, and urinary 3-methyl histidine (a marker of muscle protein degradation) all significantly increased with training, but were not different between the groups,\" suggesting \"that L-glutamine supplementation during resistance training had no significant effect of muscle performance, body composition, or muscle protein degradation\" in healthy young adults. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A fifth study examined \"the effects of a combination of effervescent creatine, ribose, and glutamine on muscle strength, endurance, and body composition in resistance-trained men.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 180-81 n. 6). Subjects performed resistance training for eight weeks and received either a placebo or an experimental supplement containing creatine, glutamine, and ribose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).Both subject groups improved muscle strength, endurance, and fat-free mass. But the groups were not significantly different from one another, suggesting that the \"supplement, which included glutamine was no more effective than [a] placebo in improving skeletal muscle adaptation to resistance training.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A sixth study investigated the effects of creatine monohydrate and glutamine supplementation on body composition and performance measures. (Doc. 9 at PageID 181, n. 7.). Subjects engaged in an eight-week resistance training program and received either a placebo, creatine monohydrate (.3 grams/kg/day for one week and then .03 grams/kg/day for seven weeks), or the same dose of creatine in addition to 4 grams of glutamine per day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The creatine and the creatine + glutamine groups experienced body mass and fat-free mass increases at a greater rate than the placebo group as well as a greater improvement in the initial rate of muscle power production. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff claims that \"[t]hese results suggest that the creatine and creatine + glutamine groups were equally effective in producing skeletal adaption to resistance training and that glutamine apparently had no preferential effect in augmenting the results.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A seventh study examined if high-dose glutamine ingestion affected weightlifting performance. (Doc. 9 at PageID 181-82, n. 8). In \"a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, resistance-trained men performed weightlifting exercise one hour after ingesting placebo ... or glutamine (.3 g/kg).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Plaintiffs, \"[r]esults demonstrated no significant differences in weightlifting performance (maximal repetitions on the bench press and leg press exercises), indicating that the short-term ingestion of glutamine did not enhance weightlifting performance in resistance-trained men.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An eighth study investigated \"whether glutamine ingestion influenced acid-base balance and improved high-intensity exercise performance.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 182, n. 9). The \"[r]esults showed that blood pH, bicarbonate, and lactate, along with time to\n   fatigue, were not significant[ly] different between supplement conditions, indicating that the acute ingestion of L-Glutamine did not enhance either buffering potential or high-intensity exercise performance in trained males.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, in the ninth study, researchers examined \"whether oral glutamine, alone or in combination with hyperoxia, influenced oxidative metabolism and cycle time-trial performance in men.\" (Doc. 9 at PageID 182, n. 10). Subjects received either a placebo or a glutamine supplement one hour before completing a brief high-intensity time-trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The \"[r]esults indicated no significant difference in pulmonary oxygen uptake during the exercise test, thereby indicating no effect of glutamine ingestion either alone or in combination with hyperoxia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff claims that defendant's Product label and advertising are false and misleading, that he was in fact mislead by defendant's representations regarding the Product's efficacy, and that he would not have purchased the Product, or would not have paid as much for it, had he known the truth about the misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff seeks certification of two classes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    National Class\n   </strong>\n   : All persons in the United States who purchased the Product within the six years preceding the Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Michigan Subclass\n   </strong>\n   : All persons in the State of Michigan who purchased the Product within the six years preceding the Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges breach of express warranty (Count I), negligent misrepresentation (Count III), fraud by uniform written misrepresentation and omission / fraudulent inducement (Count IV), and Unjust Enrichment (Count V) on behalf of the National Class, or alternatively, the Michigan Subclass. He alleges breach of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness (Count II) on behalf of the Implied Warranty Multi-State Class and Michigan Subclass.

MusclePharm Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-CV-02848-CAB-RBB (S. D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2016). (Doc. 13-2). There, the First Amended Complaint failed to state a claim because it did not allege studies demonstrating that the Product representations were false. (Doc. 13-2 at PageID 268). The alleged misrepresentations were grouped in categories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). First, the plaintiff attempted to illustrate misrepresentations regarding the benefits of Creatine Nitrate. (Doc. 13-2 at PageID 269). The plaintiff claimed that it was not known whether the substance conferred any health benefits and relied on studies assessing the substance's safety, not its efficacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The cited studies regarding efficacy tested a different substance-Creatine Monohydrate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The court dismissed the plaintiff's claims because none the studies demonstrated falsity of statements regarding Creatine Nitrate's efficacy. (Doc. 13-2 at PageID 269-70). Second, the plaintiff challenged representations regarding \"a loading phase.\" (Doc. 13-2 at PageID 270-71). The plaintiff cited studies suggesting one of the product's ingredients did not offer the advertised benefit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The court dismissed this claim because the challenged products contained numerous ingredients and none of the studies tested these formulations. (Doc. 13-2 at PageID 271). Finally, the plaintiff alleged misrepresentations regarding the benefits of Arginine Nitrate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The plaintiff again relied on a study that assessed only one of the products' ingredients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The court dismissed the claims because that study did not support allegations that representations regarding the combination of ingredients in the products were false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   These cases are distinguishable because the Product at issue here does not rely on\n   a combination of active ingredients, but rather, only one; Glutamine. This case, therefore, is more similar to\n   <em>\n    Wagner v. Gen. Nutrition Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-10961,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203070772\">\n    2017 WL 3070772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. July 19, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff purchased a \"Pro Performance L-Glutamine Powder 5000 dietary supplement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's labeling of the products was misleading, he was in fact misled by representations regarding the products' efficacy, and he would not have purchased the products had he known they did not provide the advertised benefits because ingestion of the product \"does absolutely nothing for the recovery from exercise, recovery of muscle tissue or ability to decrease muscle wasting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, 3. The plaintiff supported his claims by citing the same nine scientific studies referenced in the Amended Complaint in the present case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court reviewed these studies and determined that they \"support the proposition that glutamine supplementation has no effect on muscle performance or strength, muscle growth, recovery, or performance during exercise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. \"Taking the allegations in the [complaint] as true,\" the court found that the plaintiff had \"adequately alleged that glutamine supplements do not improve recovery, muscle function, or muscle wasting\" and therefore \"adequately alleged that the Products' labels contain false information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court further rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff could not rely on the studies \"because they do not invoke the Products, their specific dosages, and their methods of ingestion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court reasoned that the plaintiff's \"allegations boil down to a claim that glutamine in supplement form does not have the benefits listed on the Products' labels\" and, as alleged, \"the studies support this claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Eckler\n   </em>\n   , noting that \"the studies at issue concern the only active ingredient in the Products (at least according to Plaintiff's allegations) and they implicate glutamine's efficacy with respect to the claims on the Products' labels.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the studies cited in the Amended Complaint support plaintiff's allegation that glutamine supplements do not have the benefits claimed on the Product's labels and advertisements. The studies assess the efficacy of glutamine. The Amended Complaint pleads that the Product contains glutamine. It does not indicate that the Product contains any additional active ingredients. It further pleads that glutamine does not improve the efficacy of muscle growth, recovery, rebuilding, or function. Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff, his allegations are sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   , here it contends that some of the studies support the Product's representations. Defendant argues that this distinction makes this case more similar to\n   <em>\n    In re GNC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n    789 F.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2015). In\n   <em>\n    GNC Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff relied on studies to argue misrepresentations, but the complaint did not allege a scientific consensus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n    at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the plaintiff conceded that although most experts thought that the challenged ingredients are ineffective, some reasonable experts disagreed and thought they could provide the relief the defendant promised.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court reasoned that the complaint alleged scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of these ingredients and therefore failed to allege that the challenged representations are literally false.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But, unlike\n   <em>\n    GNC Corp.\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's Amended Complaint does not concede that any scientists find glutamine effective. Moreover, defendant's argument that the studies support the product representations fails. Defendant cherry-picks sentences from the papers' introduction sections,\n   which summarize the findings of other studies or hypothesize conditions where supplemental glutamine\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   create the represented effects.(Doc. 12 at PageID 224). The conclusions, however, support plaintiff's argument. Plaintiff has, therefore, stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. It is not clear whether defendant asks the Court to weigh the merits of these scientific findings to determine which is most credible. The Court declines any such request as it is premature in a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205382218\">\n    2012 WL 5382218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 (assessing studies cited in a complaint when evaluating a motion to dismiss, not to weigh the merits of those studies, but rather to ensure that they support a plaintiff's claims such that there are facts from which to infer that a defendant is liable for false advertising.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court also rejects defendant's argument that plaintiff's claims fail because he did not plead his experience using the Product in more detail. Plaintiff does not need to more specifically allege how and when he consumed the Product or whether he experienced the advertised benefits. He alleged that he purchased and consumed the Product, (Doc. 9 at PageID 176), and either would not have done so or would not have paid as much for the Product if he knew defendant's representations were false. This monetary harm is sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20195769\">\n    2013 WL 195769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, defendant asserts that plaintiff's claims for breach of express and implied contract, Counts I and II, fail because plaintiff has not pleaded facts showing the Product's label and advertising were false.

The Amended Complaint specifically stated that the plaintiffs \"considered the [allegedly inflated] 'regular price' of the suits in making their purchasing decision and would not have engaged in the transaction but for the misrepresented 'regular price.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court ruled that, \"[i]n light of this litigation and plaintiffs' specific allegations, it simply cannot be said that these plaintiffs will in the future once again rely on the alleged misrepresentation in defendant's advertisements in their purchase of defendant's suits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Plaintiffs do not allege-or even argue-that they are likely to purchase defendant's suits again or that they are likely to suffer future harm as a result of defendant's advertising practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court stated that \"future injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs will not redress any injury allegedly suffered by plaintiffs in the past or that is likely to be suffered by plaintiffs in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court concluded \"that plaintiffs lack Article III standing to seek injunctive relief in this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Neuman v.

The court examined a variety of cases, noting that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   some courts-especially but not exclusively district courts in California-have concluded that consumers who purchase a product in reliance on false advertising have standing to seek to enjoin the false advertising even if they do not plan to purchase the product again. These courts generally reason that if such plaintiffs lacked standing, then state consumer protection law could frequently not be enforced with injunctions in federal court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court ultimately rejected this approach. It reasoned that \"[t]he result that a plaintiff who suffers no risk of future injury cannot obtain an injunction furthers the purpose of the Article III standing inquiry-to ensure that there is a live case or controversy between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rikos v.

Ohio Jan. 30, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In contrast, plaintiff urges the court to find that he has standing despite abandoning the Product upon discovery that it had been deceptively labeled and advertised.

Ill. 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Leiner\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   courts have split on whether a plaintiff who, having unveiled the defendant's deception, is unlikely to purchase (or affirmatively disavows the intent to purchase) the defendant's product in the future nevertheless maintains standing to pursue injunctive relief under state consumer protection statutes. The better view, however, and the one consistent with\n   <em>\n    Arreola\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v. Godinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893625\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/788/\">\n    546 F.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2008) ], is the one taken by courts that have declined to hold that plaintiffs lacked standing based on the\n   fact that they abandoned the product upon their discovery that it had been deceptively labeled or advertised. These courts acknowledged the public policy conundrum inherent in the contrary view: the injunctive provisions of consumer protection statutes ... could never be invoked to enjoin deceptive practices if the complaining consumer's standing dissipated the moment she discovered the alleged deception and could no longer be fooled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 672-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court is not bound by any of these cases. But, after evaluating each approach, the public policy concerns, and interests of additional consumers, both within and outside the proposed class, who are presently unaware of the alleged misrepresentation, the Court agrees with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Leiner\n   </em>\n   and concludes that plaintiff has Article III standing to seek injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    F.
