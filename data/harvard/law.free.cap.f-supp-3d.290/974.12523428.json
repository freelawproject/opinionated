Code \u00a7 190.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. (a)(1) ) was found true. (RT 8313.) The jury also found Petitioner used a dangerous and deadly weapon in the murder of Ms. Navarro (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012022\">\n    Cal.

The jurors began penalty phase deliberations at 3:05 p.m. on May 21, 1987 and adjourned at 4:30 p.m. (RT 8711.) The following afternoon, on May 22, 1987, the jury returned a verdict of death. (RT 8717-18.) On January\n   29, 1988, the trial court heard and denied Petitioner's Motion for New Trial and for Modification of the Verdict, heard and denied Petitioner's Request to Strike the Special Circumstance, and sentenced Petitioner to death. (RT 8787-8874.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 28, 1992, the California Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's conviction and death sentence on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

The California Supreme Court denied Petitioner's petition for rehearing on March 10, 1993. (Dkt. No. 148, Lodgment No. 8.) The United States Supreme Court denied Petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari on June 30, 1994.\n   <em>\n    Noguera v.

(Dkt. No. 148, Lodgment No. 4.) The California Supreme Court summarily denied the petition on September 29, 1993, with three justices noting their opinions that an order to show cause should issue.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noguera\n   </em>\n   , No. S029779. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment No. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Almost one year later, Petitioner initiated federal habeas corpus proceedings by filing a Request for Appointment of Counsel and Stay of Execution in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. (Dkt. Nos. 1-2.) The Court appointed Rober Bryan and Nicholas C. Arguimbau on January 27, 1995. (Dkt. No. 11.) Petitioner filed a 91-claim federal habeas petition on July 26, 1996, and, just four days later, Mr. Arguimbau filed an Urgent Motion to Withdraw as Counsel. (Dkt. Nos. 99, 101-104.) The Court granted Mr. Arguimbau's Motion on August 5, 1996. (Dkt. No. 106.) On July 7, 1997, Petitioner moved to stay and abey the federal proceedings pending exhaustion of 31 unexhausted claims in state court. (Dkt. No. 154.) After initially dismissing the petition for failure to exhaust state remedies on October 28, 1997, the Court granted in part petitioner's motion for reconsideration on December 23, 1997, but denied Petitioner's Motion to Hold Proceedings in Abeyance. (Dkt. No. 174.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 12, 1998, Petitioner filed an Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, excluding the 31 unexhausted claims. (Dkt. Nos. 175-76.) He filed his first exhaustion petition in the California Supreme Court on March 2, 1998, raising the unexhausted claims. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 4.) While the exhaustion petition was pending in state court, the parties proceeded to litigate the merits of the first amended federal petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent filed an Answer to the Amended Petition on September 9, 1998; and on February 9, 1999, Petitioner filed a Traverse to the State's Answer to the Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. (Dkt. Nos. 180, 187-88.) On February 23, 1999, Petitioner filed a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing, which the Court denied on April 14, 2000, after a December 10, 1999 hearing. (Dkt. Nos. 190, 211, 216.) In its denial order, the Court ruled that Petitioner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on Claims 2, 4, and 60 of the first amended petition because those claims were without merit. (Dkt. No. 216.) The Court determined that, as to the remaining claims, the record was sufficiently developed to decide those claims without evidentiary hearing. (Dkt. No. 216.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties filed supplemental briefs on the remaining claims in the first amended petition and, on August 31, 2001, the parties appeared for oral argument on the remaining claims. (Dkt. Nos. 225, 236, 227,\n   228, 245.) During oral argument, the Court noted that, on careful examination of the record and in view of changes in the law since the Court's October 28, 1997 Order, some of the claims in the first amended petition which the Court believed to be exhausted, might not be exhausted. The Court invited supplemental briefing, and the parties filed additional briefs on the question. (Dkt. Nos. 247, 248, 250.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, the California Supreme Court denied petitioner's exhaustion petition on October 17, 2001.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noguera\n   </em>\n   , No. S068360. (Dkt. No. 336 Lodgment 8.) Subsequently, on November 29, 2001, Petitioner filed a Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Petition. (Dkt. No. 249.) On April 9, 2003, the Court dismissed the first amended petition as a partially unexhausted, \"mixed\" petition and denied the motion to file the second amended petition because it included the same unexhausted claims as the first amended petition. (Dkt. No. 256; see also, Dkt. No. 262.) The Court also invited Petitioner to file a fully exhausted Third Amended Petition; and, on June 9, 2003, Petitioner simultaneously filed petitions in state and federal court. (Dkt. No. 258; Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 9.) On July 28, 2003, this Court granted Petitioner's Motion to Hold Proceedings in Abeyance Pending Determination by State Court of Petitioner's Exhaustion Petition. (Dkt. Nos. 258, 259, 262, 263.) While Petitioner's third state petition was pending, he filed a fourth state petition on August 29, 2005. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 13.) The third and fourth state habeas petitions were both denied on October 10, 2007.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noguera,\n   </em>\n   No. S116529;\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noguera\n   </em>\n   , No. S136826. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgments 12 &amp; 15.) Petitioner notified the Court of the denials in a letter dated October 20, 2007, and this Court vacated the stay on November 5, 2007. (Dkt. Nos. 272, 273.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 22, 2008, this Court again stayed the proceedings in this action due to Petitioner's then-pending request for substitution of federal habeas counsel and, on March 3, 2008, Robert R. Bryan filed a Request to Withdraw as Attorney for Petitioner. (Dkt. Nos. 284, 292.) The Court appointed the Federal Public Defender as advisory counsel on March 4, 2008, and on July 21, 2008, granted Bryan's request to withdraw. (Dkt. No. 286, 305.) The Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Central District of California was appointed as counsel for Petitioner on August 14, 2008. (Dkt. No. 307.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioner filed the operative Fourth Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on March 9, 2009. (Dkt. Nos. 317, 318.) Respondent filed an Answer on November 6, 2009, and Petitioner filed a Traverse on January 19, 2010. (Dkt. Nos. 330, 338.) The parties began litigating discovery issues in 2010. However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Cullen v. Pinholster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458282,5943445\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/170/\">\n    563 U.S. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458282,5943445\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/170/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458282,5943445\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/170/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), on April 4, 2011, this Court ordered Respondent to file a motion to dismiss, identifying on a claim by claim basis those claims Respondent contends are subject to summary dismissal without discovery or an evidentiary hearing. (Dkt. No. 351.) Respondent filed a Motion to Dismiss on February 6, 2012. (Dkt. No. 355.) Petitioner filed an Opposition to Respondent's Motion to Dismiss on June 20, 2012, and Respondent filed a reply on October 16, 2012. (Dkt. No. 361.) On November 2, 2012, Petitioner filed a Surreply, and Respondent filed a Reply Response to the Surreply on November 26, 2012. (Dkt. Nos. 366, 368.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 7, 2013, the case was reassigned from the calendar of Judge Stotler to the calendar of Judge Snyder for all further proceedings. (Dkt.

La Habra police found Jovita's body after being summoned by a \"911\" call from Mindy Jackson, Jovita's next-door neighbor. After securing the area, investigating officers went to the Jackson residence where they interviewed Dominique Navarro, Jovita's 16-year-old daughter. Dominique told them she had returned from a date with her then-18-year-old boyfriend around 2:00 that morning; after chatting briefly with her mother, who was reading in bed, and removing her makeup, Dominique had gone to bed and to sleep. She was awakened a few hours later, she said, by muffled noises coming from her mother's adjacent bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After a few minutes, Dominique heard her mother cry out, \"get out, mi hija (\"hija\" is Spanish for \"daughter\"), get out, mi hija.\" Frightened, and unsure what was afoot in the darkened house, Dominique told Mindy Jackson that she sat at the end of her bed for \"about 5 to 15 minutes,\" before running blindly down the hall and out the back door. As she ran, she heard a \"thumping\" sound coming from her mother's bedroom, followed by what sounded like the footsteps of someone close behind her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Reaching Mindy Jackson's house, Dominique banged on the door until Jackson answered. In tears and near hysteria, according to Jackson, Dominique said that someone was hurting her mother; she begged Jackson to return to the house with her. Jackson refused. Instead, she managed to telephone 911. Authorities logged in the emergency call at 4:43 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To the casual observer, the murder scene suggested that Jovita had been killed in the course of a combined rape and burglary. Her body was found lying across the bed, her feet touching the floor. Her nightgown had been pulled up around her neck, and a pair of blue women's underpants was wadded between her thighs. The contents of the bedroom were in disorder-bedding and blankets had been pulled from the bed and thrown haphazardly on the floor; a jewelry box, normally resting on a dresser, was found upended on the hall floor, its contents of costume jewelry scattered along the hallway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Jovita had been badly beaten, mainly on the face and head. She had suffered extensive facial injuries, including dental and eye damage from at least 18 blows to the face and head; her skull had multiple\n   <em>\n    depressed fractures\n   </em>\n   and her scalp had been loosened and torn by the force of the beating; her nose almost touched her left cheek and \"defensive wounds\" were evident on her arms and hands. On her left thigh, examiners found oval shaped wounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Blood was spattered on the walls, furniture, and ceiling of the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The pathologist who examined the body testified that the proximate cause of Jovita Navarro's death was not the beating but asphyxiation-induced by pressing a rounded object against her throat with such force that her larynx was crushed, choking off her airway. Extensive cyanosis, or blueing, of her lips and pinpoint hemorrhaging beneath her eyelids confirmed that Jovita had, in effect, been strangled. Had she not died from a lack of oxygen, the pathologist concluded, the severity of the beating would have resulted in her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the bedroom, La Habra police investigators found a \"tonfa,\" a martial arts weapon fashioned from red oak and resembling a police baton; it lay shattered in two pieces, testimony to the savagery of the beating. In a neighboring yard, police recovered a piece of wood shaped like a broom handle, with traces of blood on it. In another yard, they found a bloodstained tan leather glove; bloodstains were also found on a cinder block wall adjoining a nearby lot. The bloodstains on the tonfa, the wooden dowel, and the glove were the same type as Jovita's. An analysis of fibers removed from the brick wall and the glove were consistent with those found on the bedroom blanket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   La Habra and Orange County authorities began an extensive forensic investigation of the crime scene. As a result, investigators concluded that much of the evidence pointing to a burglary and rape/murder of Jovita had been faked. An autopsy failed to reveal the presence of sperm in Jovita's vagina. An analysis of vaginal swabs was consistent with a finding that the victim might have had intercourse several hours earlier the preceding evening, but there was no external evidence of sexual trauma consistent with a forcible rape. Tests of the blue underwear for semen or other stains indicative of forcible sex were negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although the bedroom appeared to have been rifled, nothing of value was missing, including a clear plastic change purse stuffed with small bills that the intruder could not have overlooked. The jewelry box had been knocked from its place and its contents scattered, but none of the jewelry had been taken. An analysis of the blood-spattering pattern on the bed linen suggested that it had been removed from the bed and arranged on the floor\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the murder, rather than during a struggle. Moreover, the spatter analysis indicated that Jovita had probably been murdered\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the contents of the bedroom had been upended. Finally, investigators could find no evidence that Jovita's killer had gained entry into the house by force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The on-scene criminalist, examining the body at 6:30 that morning, initially estimated the time of death at between three and six hours prior to his examination, or between 12:30 and 3:30 a.m. Although routine examinations for lividity and rigor mortis-two crude measures used to approximate time of death-confirmed that estimate, it was later revised upward, to 4:45 a.m., based on Dominique's statement to the police that she had heard her mother cry out around 4:30 that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After conducting an autopsy on the morning of April 24, the examining pathologist concluded on the basis of the quantity and state of the contents of her stomach that Jovita died sometime between 12:30 and 2:30 that morning. Another criminalist, who observed the body at the autopsy, testified that the 4:45 a.m. time of death stated in the certificate of death was based on Dominique's account of the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although that hour was not substantially out of line with the results of the lividity and rigor tests, had it not been for Dominique's statement the condition of the body suggested that death had occurred between three and seven hours earlier, or between 11:30 the preceding evening and 3:30 that morning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   An inquiry into Jovita's financial circumstances disclosed that she carried $13,000 in life insurance and at the time of her death had approximately $14,000 in accumulated retirement benefits from her job as an Orange County welfare clerk. The house, with a market value of around $90,000, had an existing mortgage balance of $7,000; Jovita carried mortgage insurance in the event of her death. Dominique was her sole heir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As their investigation deepened, police learned from interviews with Margaret Garcia, a coworker, and Mindy Jackson that relations between Jovita and Dominique's boyfriend, the Petitioner, were not always pleasant. Jovita had quarreled with both over Dominique's repeated violations of curfew hours, over her pregnancy and subsequent abortion, and over what Jovita regarded as a steep decline in Dominique's schoolwork and attendance beginning with the onset of her relationship with Petitioner. Garcia and Jackson both testified that Jovita was planning to sell the house and move to the beach, or to enlist Dominique in the Army, in an attempt to separate her from Petitioner. According to Garcia, Jovita had considered hiring a \"hit man\" to kill Petitioner. About two weeks before her death, Garcia said, Jovita told her that she had awakened in the middle of the night to find the front door open and all the outside lights off. Jovita found Dominique wandering the house; Dominique told her that she had opened the front door, but could not explain why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   About two or three weeks before Jovita's murder, Jackson had witnessed her screaming into the telephone and had seen Dominique in the bathroom crying. Jovita had slammed down the handset and said that she \"hated\" Petitioner and didn't want to hear his name again. \"If he [Petitioner] is going to use his karate on me, he has another thing coming,\" Jackson reported Jovita as saying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Through interviews with Dominique and Petitioner, authorities learned that on the night of Jovita's death the two had gone to a party in West Covina about 7:00. They left around 11:30 that evening, they told police, and went for a hamburger with a friend; after dropping their friend off, they parked for an hour or two, returning to Jovita's house between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. Dominique let herself in, locked the front door, opened a sliding glass door at the rear of the house in order to let the family dogs out, and turned off the outside lights. After chatting briefly with her mother, she went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Petitioner told police that after leaving Dominique's house, he went home. Because he had missed the 1:30 curfew set by his mother, he had to knock on the front door to get in. His grandmother, who was watching television with his mother, let him in. After talking with them and being lectured by his mother about being late, he went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   La Habra police also interviewed Peter LaCombe, a diesel mechanic employed by the county who had been dating Jovita for about two weeks before her death. LaCombe had spent the evening of April 23 with Jovita at her house. The two ate a substantial dinner around 7:30 and then danced and watched television. Around\n   11:00 that evening, LaCombe testified, he left for home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   From interviews with the adjoining neighbor, Mindy Jackson, police learned that Jackson and her husband had entertained a friend, Tom Brooks, on the night of the murder. All three had heard loud noises coming from the Navarro house around 11:00 p.m. Brooks testified that he had gone outside to investigate but had noticed nothing remarkable; the house was dark and the sliding glass door at the rear was closed. Later that night, they heard what Brooks described as \"really radical noises\" next door. The three had gone outside about 1:45 a.m. They heard Jovita's two dogs barking and growling; there were no lights either outside or inside the Navarro house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Despite discrepancies in the accounts given by Dominique and Petitioner and others interviewed, and suspicions presented by the forensic analyses, police made no arrests in the case until late in the year. In December, the police inspector assigned to the investigation, Sergeant Keltner, received a tip from Steve Arce, an acquaintance of Petitioner, that Ricky\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Abram might have information relevant to the homicide investigation. Keltner interviewed Abram on December 14, 1983, at the Ione Juvenile Detention Facility near Sacramento, where Abram was an inmate. He tape-recorded most of their conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In substance, Abram testified at trial that he decided to disclose his knowledge of the murder scheme after Keltner told him of his possible criminal liability for Jovita's murder. Abram told the jury that in March 1983, a few weeks after he first met Petitioner, the two had driven in Petitioner's car to pick up Dominique at her house. On the way over, Petitioner told Abram that he intended to kill Dominique's mother. He asked for Abram's help in borrowing a shotgun for that purpose. After picking up Dominique, the three drove to Bob's Big Boy, a nearby restaurant. There, according to Abram, they discussed in detail Petitioner's plan to murder Jovita.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The murder, Abram testified, would be staged to look as if Jovita had been killed by a burglar in the middle of the night. Dominique's role would be to let the two men into the house; Abram would fake the burglary and take any items of value; Petitioner would kill Jovita with a shotgun blast. Petitioner and Dominique would then have intercourse, Abram said, after which Dominique, feigning a rape, would run hysterically next door to report the break-in and murder/rape. For his part in the crime, Petitioner promised Abram $5,000 from the $25,000 obtained from \"the mother's insurance.\" In addition to his share of the insurance, Abram told the jury, Petitioner promised he could live in Jovita's house with Petitioner and Dominique, since \"the house would be passed on to the daughter after the mom's death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After leaving the restaurant and returning Dominique to her house, Petitioner dropped Abram off. In early April, Abram was arrested for auto theft, convicted and imprisoned. He testified that he did not see Petitioner or Dominique again until the trial, regarded the murder scheme as a \"joke,\" and did not learn of Jovita's death until Keltner told him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Police interviews with others provided additional evidence of Petitioner's involvement in the murder. Steve Arce told the jury of a fight he had with Petitioner around the Easter preceding Jovita's death. Petitioner had used his feet to\n   quickly knock Arce to the ground. Arce had also seen tonfas in Petitioner's car and had seen Petitioner spinning a tonfa in his hand. He had seen Petitioner wearing tan leather motorcycle gloves on occasion, and had seen him with Ricky Abram. He also related an incident about a month before Jovita's death in which Petitioner kicked two individuals in a street encounter, knocking one of them to the ground in \"thirty seconds maybe,\" using martial arts techniques. A couple of weeks before the murder, Arce had heard Petitioner complain about Jovita's interference in his relationship with Dominique; Petitioner had said that he wanted \"to kill that bitch,\" referring to Jovita.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the months following Jovita's death, investigators learned, Dominique spoke frequently with Petitioner by telephone from an uncle's house, where she was now living. Once, the uncle testified, he overheard Dominique complain after completing a call from Petitioner that she did not want to call the family attorney again; she was upset, her uncle said. The attorney, Dominique's cousin, confirmed that Dominique made a growing number of telephone calls to him in the months following Jovita's death; her questions centered on the disposition of the family home and details concerning the amount of Jovita's insurance, the sums due creditors, and any surplus in the estate; Dominique was \"very emphatic,\" he testified, that she did not want the house to be sold. That June, the attorney attended a meeting with Petitioner, his mother, Dominique, and another lawyer at which the possibility of Dominique's legal emancipation was discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In December 1983, authorities arrested Dominique and Petitioner. Charged with one count of conspiracy to commit murder and one count of first degree murder, Dominique was tried as a juvenile, convicted and sentenced to the custody of the Youth Authority; her conviction was affirmed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The defense case.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Petitioner testified in his defense. His relations with Jovita were \"fair,\" he said; sometimes they got along well, sometimes not. He had lived at the Navarro residence for a few months in 1982 with Jovita's consent. The three regularly had dinner out about once a month. Petitioner denied any involvement in Jovita's death. He had talked to Ricky Abram once about selling him an automobile engine; they had gone to Bob's Big Boy with Dominique. While they had lunch, Dominique had complained that her mother had restricted her for coming home late. He never saw Abram again. Petitioner had studied martial arts as a young teenager, but had not earned a black belt and had no training in the use of a tonfa; nor had he ever owned one. He had been badly stabbed in the thigh in a fight in June of 1982, still walked with a limp and had difficulty stretching one of his legs. He had never had any knowledge of Jovita's life insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On the night of Jovita's murder, Petitioner testified, he had gone with Dominique to a party in West Covina. After a hamburger with a friend, the two had parked for awhile. He dropped Dominique off at her house around 2:00 that morning, went home and, after talking with his mother and grandmother, went to bed. About 3:30 a.m., he heard a knock on his window. It was Margaret Noone, a friend; he let her in and she stayed in bed with him for about an hour before leaving by the window. Around 6:00 a.m., Dominique had telephoned; she was very upset; Petitioner dressed and left immediately for her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Petitioner's sister supported his testimony regarding the injury to his leg and the fact that he had never received training in or owned a tonfa. His grandmother confirmed\n   that Petitioner had arrived home around 2:00 on the morning of Jovita's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Petitioner's mother testified that he returned home at exactly 2:00 on the morning of April 24, 1983-she had been watching a program on Spanish television and remembered the time. She spoke to Petitioner briefly as to why he was late. Later that night, Petitioner's mother heard the sound of voices in her son's room. Through the door, she asked Petitioner who was there; he told her to go to sleep and later refused to tell her the identity of his visitor. Asked about the meeting with Dominique's attorney in June of 1983, at which Dominique's legal emancipation was discussed, Mrs. Noguera testified that she had earlier accompanied Dominique to the Social Security office in an effort to help her receive some benefits-she had been without any income in the five months since her mother's death. A previous attorney had done nothing, and Dominique needed help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Margaret Noone testified that around 3:00 a.m. on April 24, 1983, she had climbed into the window of Petitioner's bedroom and stayed for about one and one-half hours. She left when she heard someone knocking on the bedroom door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Two of Petitioner's friends testified to prior conversations with Ricky Abram and Steve Arce. Wilbur Boring told the jury that in December of 1983, after he had implicated Petitioner in Jovita's murder, Abram had told him that \"he [Petitioner] got what he deserved; he put me in jail so I put him in jail.\" Patrick Reese testified that Arce had told him that he cooperated with the police in exchange for immediate release on a felony charge; Arce had observed a pair of nunchuku sticks in Petitioner's possession, not tonfas, and had told Reese that he (Arce) should not have told the police some of the things he told them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Rebuttal.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The prosecution recalled Margaret Noone to the stand. She stated that, in testifying on behalf of Petitioner, she had \"lied ... [about] basically almost everything\" because she \"was getting threats if I didn't say something like that [i.e., her alibi testimony] something would happen to me or my family because [Petitioner] has such powerful friends, even though he's in jail.\" She had seen nunchuku sticks in Petitioner's car, and he liked to \"mess around with them.\" Noone told the jury that she had been granted immunity from prosecution by the People.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition, the trial court took judicial notice that Dominique had been called as a witness by the prosecution, had refused to testify, and been adjudged in contempt of court. A deputy marshal testified that shortly after Dominique was held in contempt, he heard Petitioner say to another inmate that Dominique \"did a good job and tell her I love her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Penalty Phase Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The prosecution's case.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   John Antenucci testified that in August 1983, he placed a newspaper advertisement to sell a used Volkswagen. Accompanied by a friend, Petitioner responded to the advertisement and expressed an interest in buying the automobile. The three went for a test drive, during which Petitioner stopped the car and told Antenucci to get out because his friend \"has a gun.\" Petitioner's friend displayed a handgun and threatened to shoot Antenucci, who managed to grab the car keys and escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The defense case.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Petitioner called 15 witnesses, including a former employer, his high school girlfriend, and several friends of his family. Several witnesses testified that Petitioner's family was very close until his parents\n   were divorced in 1980. His mother testified that Petitioner, who had hunted, fished, and gone on motorcycle trips with his father, appeared to take the divorce hard; he became quieter, more serious, less playful. She asked the jury to spare her son's life. Petitioner's sister and grandmother also asked the jury not to impose the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Several witnesses testified to Petitioner's participation in the California Blue Jacket Cadette Corps, a youth organization modeled on the Navy. Junior high school authorities testified to his participation in such sports as basketball, track, softball, and football; elementary school employees testified that Petitioner's parents had been involved actively in his schooling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In\n   the 1992 petition, Petitioner presented the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   - Petitioner's mother, Sarita Salinas, retained Pereyda in 1979 to represent her in the divorce action she brought against Petitioner's father, Guillermo Noguera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   - Pereyda represented Salinas in very acrimonious proceedings, through which he became privy to confidential information regarding the turmoil that pervaded the Noguera household and the emotional problems of both of Petitioner's parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   - During their attorney-client relationship, Salinas told Pereyda that her husband was violent, had threatened her with bodily harm and death on many occasions, and had audio tapes detailing sexual acts involving animals. She also confided her concerns that Guillermo's actions were having a negative effect on her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   - Salinas subsequently retained Pereyda to represent Petitioner in his capital trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   - Pereyda was unable to present evidence of Petitioner's home life because to do so would have violated his on-going duty of loyalty to Salinas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In support of Claim III, Petitioner submitted a Declaration of A. Lorenzo Pereyda (Exhibit I), in which Mr. Pereyda stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   - His law practice included criminal law and general civil litigation, including family law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   - He had never before tried a death penalty case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   - He has known the Noguera family for many years and has Petitioner since he was twelve or thirteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   - He was retained to represent Petitioner's mother in connection with her bitter and acrimonious divorce from Petitioner's father. The litigation began in 1979 and ended in 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   - Ms. Salinas told Mr. Pereyda that Guillermo was violent and had a bad temper and that she had concerns that his actions were negatively impacting her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   - At the time he was retained to represent Petitioner, Mr. Pereyda \"was not totally familiar with capital litigation, particularly penalty phase strategy and tactics.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   - Mr. Pereyda never explained to Petitioner that he had a legal conflict due to his prior representation of Salinas; and he never obtained a waiver of that conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   - The vast majority of Pereyda's trial preparation in Petitioner's case was spent on guilt-phase issues. Pereyda did no mental health investigation in connection with the guilt phase and did not explore Petitioner's social history to determine how family dynamics may have impacted his culpability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   - Pereyda's strategy for the penalty phase was to focus on the positive aspects of Petitioner's life, and present him in a favorable light. Pereyda did not investigate the case to determine whether Petitioner's troubled background could have contributed to the crime, or mitigated punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   - Pereyda was a potential witness during the penalty phase as he could have testified regarding mitigating information he learned about the family during the divorce proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Third State Habeas Petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Petitioner again raised the conflict of interest issue in his 2003 state habeas petition in which he presented additional facts in support of the claim, including Declarations from his father (Exhibit D), his sister (Exhibit G), his mother (Exhibit AA), and his wife (Exhibit GG). Petitioner alleged that not only was his mother a former client of Mr. Pereyda, to whom he owed an ongoing ethical and legal duty of confidentiality and loyalty, she was also paying Petitioner's legal fees and influencing his\n   representation. In particular, Petitioner alleged:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   - In retaining Pereyda, Ms. Salinas still considered him to be her attorney, obligated first to her. (Exhibit AA.) Moreover, she was outspoken regarding her control over Petitioner's defense and Mr. Pereyda's role as protector for her family. (Exhibit GG.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   - Mr. Pereyda had an on-going ethical and legal duty to Ms. Salinas and a fundamental obligation not to reveal information disclosed in confidence during the divorce proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   - Ms. Salinas retained Mr. Pereyda to represent Petitioner on the condition that he not bring out any of the family's problems, but exclusively present the false defense that Petitioner was not the killer. (Exhibit G, Exhibit AA.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   - Ms. Salinas advised Mr. Pereyda that he was not to use any of the information he learned about the family during the divorce proceedings in Petitioner's defense case. (Exhibit AA.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   - Mr. Pereyda could not pursue viable mental health defenses and did not have Petitioner examined by a mental health expert because Ms. Salinas prohibited Mr. Pereyda from using information he \"knew about [Petitioner] and the family ... in [Petitioner's] defense.\" (Exhibit AA.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   - Mr. Pereyda could not question Ms. Salinas regarding her behavior which contributed to Petitioner's mental health problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   - Mr. Pereyda could not present evidence of the violence and abuse perpetrated by Ms. Salinas and other members of the family. (Exhibit D, Exhibit G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   - Although Petitioner told his mother that he thought he was crazy, and asked her for help, she told him there would be no mental health examinations, and that he was not crazy. She told him, \"just listen to my attorney, who would get him out.\" (Exhibit AA.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   - Salinas told Petitioner it did not matter that his defense team knew that he killed Jovita, \"[her] attorney was going with the innocence defense.\" (Exhibit AA.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   - Petitioner's father did not trust Mr. Pereyda because he was Salinas' divorce attorney. (Exhibit D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   - Neither Mr. Pereyda nor Mr. Campos attended a special circumstance/penalty conference on the case at which the case could have settled at a penalty less than death. According to Petitioner, \"he was not consulted but rather instructed by his mother and his attorneys to refuse any type of settlement.... By accepting a plea bargain, his mother stated that everyone would say he committed the homicide and people would look at her as a bad mother.\" (Exhibit GG at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   - Mr. Pereyda never disclosed his conflict of interest to Petitioner and there was no waiver. (Exhibit I.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In light of the conflict, Petitioner argued, Mr. Pereyda failed to provide petitioner with constitutionally adequate representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     California Supreme Court's Post Card Denial Was Premised on an \"Unreasonable Determination of the Facts\" Within the Meaning of \u00a7 2254(d)(2)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   To demonstrate that the state court erred under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), \"the petitioner must establish that the state court's decision rested on a finding of fact that is 'objectively unreasonable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hibbler v.

At all times during the proceedings against them, the defendants had been represented by a lawyer for their employer (the owner of the \"adult\" theater and bookstore that purveyed the obscenity), and the employer paid the attorney's fees and had promised to pay the fines. However, when the employer declined to make installment payments on the fines, and because their attorney \"ha[d] acted as the agent of the employer and ha[d] been paid by the employer, [the Court found that] the risk of conflict of interest ...

Mr. Pereyda had an on-going ethical and legal duty to Petitioner's mother, and a fundamental obligation not to reveal information disclosed in confidence during the divorce proceedings. Ms. Salinas retained Mr. Pereyda to represent Petitioner with the understanding that she would control the defense and that Mr. Pereyda would not bring out any of the family's problems, but would exclusively present the false defense that Petitioner was not the killer. (Exhibit G, Exhibit AA.) Clearly, Mr. Pereyda could not simultaneously act in the best interest of both clients. In his declaration, Mr. Pereyda admits that he represented Petitioner's mother in her divorce from Petitioner's father; that he never explained to Petitioner that he had a legal conflict due to his prior representation of Petitioner's mother; and that he never obtained a waiver of that conflict. The Court finds that Petitioner has established that Mr. Pereyda did, in fact, have an unwaived conflict of interest in representing Petitioner. The ultimate question, then, is whether the conflict adversely impacted Mr. Pereyda's performance as Petitioner's capital defense attorney. This Court finds that the answer to that question is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   First, Petitioner was adversely affected by Mr. Pereyda's failure to attend a pre-trial special circumstance/penalty conference at which the case could have settled at a penalty less than death. There is no explanation for such a failure, except that facilitating a plea for Petitioner was contrary to his mother's expressed personal interests. Petitioner \"was not consulted but rather instructed by his mother and his attorneys to refuse any type of settlement\n   .... By accepting a plea bargain, his mother stated that everyone would say he committed the homicide and people would look at her as a bad mother.\" (Exhibit GG at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly, Petitioner was negatively impacted by Mr. Pereyda's approach to his guilt-phase defense. Despite overwhelming evidence of Petitioner's participation in the murder, and Mr. Pereyda's personal knowledge of Petitioner's family and mental health problems, Mr. Pereyda failed to investigate and present evidence which could have undermined the prosecution's theory of the case as death eligible. Counsel failed to investigate and discover evidence that Dominique constantly complained to Petitioner about how terrible her mother was to her, and begged him to protect her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel failed to investigate and present evidence that, in the fall of 1982 Dominique had become pregnant with Petitioner's child; Petitioner and Dominique were excited and had shared the news with Petitioner's family; Jovita had subsequently forced Dominique to have an abortion; and the chain of events sent Petitioner into despair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel failed to investigate and present evidence that Petitioner may have suffered from brain-damage and mental illness that may have influenced his decision-making,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was also under the influence of steroids and other substances when he committed the homicide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, despite damaging witness statements from Ricky Abram, Steve Arce, Margaret Garcia, and Mindy Jackson, Mr. Pereyda instead presented a doomed innocence defense accompanied by a coerced alibi witness. While such an approach would normally inspire confusion and curiosity, under the circumstances of Petitioner's representation counsel's rationale is evident. As Ms. Salinas told Petitioner, it did not matter that his defense team knew that he killed Jovita, \"[her] attorney was going with the innocence defense.\" (Exhibit AA.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Furthermore, Petitioner was adversely affected by Mr. Pereyda's failure to adequately investigate and present a thorough mitigation case. At Ms. Salinas's direction, Mr. Pereyda focused his penalty phase presentation on the positive aspects of Petitioner's life. Mr. Pereyda thereby obscured extensive available mitigating evidence, detailing the reality of Petitioner's struggles and challenges, in favor of presenting Ms. Salinas in the most positive light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Having considered the arguments and evidence presented in connection with Claim 1 of Petitioner's federal habeas petition, the Court concludes that Petitioner is entitled to habeas corpus relief on his conflict of interest claim. As the Supreme\n   Court has noted, \"inherent dangers that arise when a criminal defendant is represented by a lawyer hired and paid by a third party\" including: the risk \"that the lawyer will prevent his client from ... taking ... actions contrary to the [third party's] interest\" and the risk that the lawyer will defer to the third-party's goals while sacrificing the defendant's best interests.\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184550\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/261/#p271\">\n    450 U.S. at 268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184550\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/261/#p271\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He contends that Ms. Soto carried on a romantic relationship with Petitioner and smuggled mind-altering drugs to him at the Orange County Jail before and during trial, to the detriment of his defense. Petitioner suggests that his use of the drugs \"had a debilitating effect upon his mental state and competence\" during critical proceedings and the romantic entanglement \"negatively affected [Ms. Soto's] relationship with key defense witnesses.\" (Dkt. No. 361 at 51, Docket No. 317 at 53.) He argues that counsel were responsible for Ms. Soto's actions which undermined his defense. Simultaneously, Petitioner argues that Ms. Soto's conduct created a conflict of interest that adversely affected Petitioner's representation within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Sullivan.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt.

Holding the California Supreme Court's finding of no conflict was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, the Court of Appeals noted, \"[t]he Supreme Court has never held that the\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   exception applies to conflicts stemming from intimate relations with clients.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618163\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/431/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618163\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/431/1158/\">\n    at 1184-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

While Petitioner proffers the declaration of Petitioner's wife, Francesca Mozqueda, in support of his contention that counsel knew of Ms. Soto's drug smuggling, her declaration does not support this supposition. In the declaration Ms. Mozqueda generally states that she \"told Mr. Campos\n   <em>\n    what Irma was doing\n   </em>\n   ... and how damaging it was to Bill's defense ... [and] Mr. Campos simply said, 'okay.' \" (Exhibit GG at 8.) Ms. Mozqueda's statement is vague and, if anything, refers to threats Ms. Soto allegedly made to get Ms. Mozqueda to stop seeing Petitioner. \"Because Irma was creating a lot of problems for me with my parents (embarrassing my mother with her best friend, telling her family about Bill's case and telling Bill lies about me),\n   <em>\n    I finally told Mr. Campos what Irma was doing.\n   </em>\n   \" (Exhibit GG at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   There is no evidence to support the suggestion that counsel were made aware of\n   illegal drug smuggling activities on the part of their employee and simply responded \"okay.\" In fact, it is highly dubious that any attorney, upon being informed of their employee's illegal conduct, would turn a blind eye. With respect to \"non-lawyer assistants,\" an attorney has an ethical responsibility to \"make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.\" ABA Rule 5.3(b). Moreover, \"a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of such person that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if: (1) the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct ratifies the conduct involved; or (2) the lawyer .... knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.\" ABA Rule 5.3(c). Ms. Mozqueda's conclusory declaration is insufficient evidence to support Petitioner's allegation that his trial counsel were aware of Ms. Soto's drug smuggling, and did nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Moreover, Petitioner fails to allege how his decision to ingest illicit drugs violated his constitutional rights or \"seriously affected his mental health\" so as to implicate questions of competency. Whether or not Ms. Soto smuggled drugs, according to Ms. Mozqueda's declaration, Petitioner sought and obtained illicit drugs from numerous sources and \"often called [her] from jail while he was drunk and/or on drugs.\" (Exhibit GG at 4, 6-7 (\"Bill took drugs before and during the trial. There were two occasions in which two of Bill's friends were caught trying to smuggle drugs into the jail. One involved a girl who mailed marijuana and another a boy. Bill's mother told me she had split open the soles of Bill's shoes and inserted drugs inside. She then had one of Bill's friends take clothing and the shoes to the jail for court the following day.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Petitioner has failed to establish that the California Supreme Court's resolution of Claim 3 contradicted or unreasonably applied clearly established federal law, or made an unreasonable determination of the facts.

Dominique's role was to let the two men in the house and, after the murder, to run hysterically to neighbors, reporting the break-in, rape, and murder. Abram testified that Petitioner promised him $5,000 (from the $25,000 sum Petitioner and Dominique expected to get from Jovita's insurance) and the opportunity to live in Jovita's house with Petitioner and Dominique because \"the house would be passed on to the daughter after the mom's death.\" In early April, Abram was arrested for auto theft, convicted and imprisoned. He was in custody at the time Jovita was murdered, and did not learn of her death until Detective Keltner interviewed him on December 14, 1983, at the Ione Juvenile Detention Facility. (RT 4930-80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The evidence presented at trial corroborated Abram's statements and testimony about the robbery/murder plan he discussed with Petitioner and Dominique at Big Boy. After the killing, Dominique ran to neighbors, acting hysterically and claiming an intruder had entered. (RT 5437, 5445.) Moreover, there was evidence Dominique was very interested in the financial benefits to her resulting from her mother's death. (RT 6162, 6164.) There was no evidence introduced at trial that supported a motive for Abram to lie or wrongly implicate Petitioner. Moreover, there was no evidence that Abram's statement to police was provided to him by detectives. At time of his interview, Abram's California Youth Authority supervisor, Jeff Harada, was present. (RT 5108, 5110-11.) Harada testified that Detective Keltner did not provide details of the crime before he began recording Abram's statement. (RT 5124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   While perhaps Petitioner's trial counsel could have presented additional evidence impeaching Abram, this Court does not find that the California Supreme Court was unreasonable in determining that this cumulative evidence would not have changed the jury's verdict. Evidence that Mr. Abram suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder and was treated for mental health problems while in the California Youth Authority would not have resulted in a different verdict in this case. The California Supreme Court's finding of no constitutional error was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under section 2254(d)(1), nor an unreasonable determination of the facts under section 2254(d)(2). Claim 11 is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    9.\n    <em>\n     CLAIM 12: Trial Counsel Failed to Present Evidence that Prosecution Expert Witness Norman Sperber Perjured Himself\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   In Claim 12, Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation in failing to present evidence that one of the prosecution's bite-mark experts, Dr. Norman Sperber, perjured himself when he testified that he was the chief forensic dentist for the FBI. (Dkt. No. 317 at 132, citing RT 6206.) Petitioner contends that, because there were dueling experts on the bite mark issue, and \"the credibility of the experts testifying on the issue was a key factual determination for the jury,\" impeachment of Dr. Sperber would have undermined the prosecution's case, providing the jury reasonable doubt regarding the origin of Jovita's leg injury, and altering the verdict in Petitioner's trial. (Dkt. No. 317 at 133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Petitioner first raised this claim in state court as Claim 7 of his initial state habeas petition. (Dkt. No. 148, Lodgment 4 at 84-87.) On September 29, 1993, the California Supreme Court summarily denied the claim on the merits. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 3.) Petitioner raised the claim again as Claim 6 of his June 2003, exhaustion petition in the California Supreme Court. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 9 at 90-93.) The California Supreme Court summarily denied the claim on the merits and, alternatively, denied the claim as untimely and successive. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Respondent contends that Petitioner has failed to establish that the California Supreme Court's resolution of the claim contradicted or unreasonably applied controlling United State Supreme Court authority, or made any unreasonable determination of the facts, so as to get out from under the relitigation bar contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Respondent suggests that it is not clear that Dr. Sperber provided false testimony and, in fact, \"his testimony in context suggests otherwise\" because his work with the FBI \"was but part of a long curriculum vitae\" that demonstrated he \"was a consultant to a number of organizations.\" (Dkt. No. 330 at 42.) Respondent argues that \"[e]vidence he was a consultant to the FBI, rather than a regular employee, would not have contradicted his trial testimony,....would not have impeached him ... [and] would have had no effect on the trial.\" (Dkt. No. 330 at 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   An examination of the trial record reveals that Dr. Sperber testified in Petitioner's trial on March 19, 1987. (RT 6186.) After discussing Dr. Sperber's occupation as \"a dentist in general practice,\" the prosecutor asked Dr. Sperber about his specialty in forensic odontology. (RT 6202.) Dr. Sperber explained his area of expertise to the jury, and the prosecutor followed up by asking Dr. Sperber if he was \"associated at all with any coroner's facilities.\" (RT 6205.) In response, Dr. Sperber indicated that he was the chief forensic dentist for San Diego and Imperial Counties, for the missing persons system for the California\n   Department of Justice, and for the United States Department of Justice, in particular, the FBI. (RT 6205-06.) With reference to the FBI, Dr. Sperber described his involvement in creating a national system for identifying people who are either alive or dead. (RT 6206.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   While Petitioner contends the evidence demonstrates that prosecution's expert provided false testimony, this Court cannot agree. In context, it is clear that Dr. Sperber did not claim to be an \"employee\" of the FBI. Rather, and in fact, he told the jury that he had a general dentistry practice and was associated various law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, for which he created computer systems designed to help identify individuals through dental data. The testimony related to his work with the FBI was part of a list of roles he played in various state and federal law enforcement agencies. While Dr. Sperber did state that he was \"chief forensic dentist\" for the FBI, there is no reason to believe that this testimony misled the jury to think that Dr. Sperber was an FBI employee, rather than a consultant, nor is there reason to believe that this was the jury's understanding. As such, the California Supreme Court was not unreasonable in finding that Petitioner's trial attorney did not provide deficient representation in failing to present evidence that Dr. Sperber \"perjured himself.\" Moreover, Petitioner failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice from counsel's alleged failure. As Respondent points out, evidence Dr. Sperber was a consultant to the FBI would not have contradicted or impeached him and would not have resulted in a different verdict in this case. The California Supreme Court's finding of no constitutional error was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under section 2254(d)(1), nor an unreasonable determination of the facts under section 2254(d)(2).

(Dkt. No. 317 at 136, citing RT 4410.) Officer Serles testified that he was the first officer to respond to the crime scene on April 24, 1983. (RT 4394-95.) He waited for backup, and once Sergeant Keltner arrived, they entered the residence together. (RT 4395-96.) In relevant part, Officer Serles testified that he saw signs of struggle in Jovita Navarro's bedroom, but not in any other rooms in the house, including Dominique's bedroom. (RT4410-11.) Petitioner's claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to make a foundation objection to Officer Serles's testimony is conclusory. The California Supreme Court's conclusion that Petitioner did not demonstrate that trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the outcome of Petitioner's trial would not have been effected by a foundation objection, was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .

When \u00a7 2254(d) applies, \"the question is not whether counsel's actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied\n   <em>\n    Strickland's\n   </em>\n   deferential standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    562 U.S. at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the extent of Jovita's injuries was highly relevant to the prosecution's case, it was not likely that an objection to the autopsy photos would have been sustained. The failure to object to admissible evidence is not deficient performance. In addition, the evidence against Petitioner was overwhelming such that even had the photos not been introduced, Petitioner was not likely to have received a different result. Accordingly, Petitioner has not demonstrated that the California Supreme Court's ruling, finding that he failed to make a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object to the introduction of the autopsy photos, was contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .

The on-scene criminalist, who initially examined Jovita's body provided an initial time of death estimate at between three and six hours prior to his examination, or between 12:30a.m. and 3:30a.m. However, based upon Dominique's statement to police regarding the timeline of the evening, and her neighbor Mindy Jackson's 4:43 a.m. 911 call to authorities, the criminalist revised his time of death estimate to 4:45 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Under the defense team's theory of the case, Jovita was attacked at around 4:30 a.m, when an intruder entered her home. Dominique heard the commotion in her mother's room, heard her mother scream out to her to \"get out,\" and fled to Mindy Jackson's house. The prosecution's theory of the case relied upon an alternate timeline, in which Petitioner killed Jovita at approximately 2:00 a.m., after he and Dominique returned from a date. After the killing, the pair staged the crime scene to look as though Jovita was murdered in the course of a rape and burglary, Petitioner returned to his home, and Dominique initiated the charade with her neighbor and police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   On direct examination, the prosecution's expert pathologist, Dr. Fukumoto, testified that, based upon the contents of Jovita's stomach, he believed she died within four-hours of her last meal; thus, if she last ate\n   between eight and ten o'clock at night, he estimated her time of death, at the latest, at two o'clock in the morning. (RT 4710-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   On cross-examination, Petitioner's trial counsel focused much of his questioning on the pathologist's opinion on time of death. Counsel asked Dr. Fukumoto if he, in attempting to estimate Jovita's time of death, \"ha[d] some conversations with someone?\" The pathologist replied, \"yes,\" and explained that he had conversations with the coroner-investigator who went out to the scene, Mr. King. (RT 4716.) Together, based upon the information they had, Dr. Fukumoto and Mr. King estimated Jovita's time of death at approximately 4:45 a.m. (RT 4717.) Subsequently, Dr. Fukumoto testified consistently with that estimate at the preliminary hearing in Petitioner's case, and repeated that testimony at a subsequent proceeding in this matter. (RT 4718.) Dr. Fukumoto admitted that he did not have any way of knowing when Jovita ate for the last time, and affirmed that the 4:45a.m. time of death was fixed after the autopsy. (RT 4721-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Petitioner suggests that trial counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation in failing to make a hearsay objection when Dr. Fukumoto provided testimony on redirect regarding statements made by Dominique Navarro, and deputy coroner King, about the victim's time of death. (Dkt. No. 317 at 136.) In relevant part, the colloquy to which Petitioner objects went as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   Q: And isn't it true, Dr. Fukumoto, that Deputy Coroner King received information from the La Habra Police Department that Dominique Navarro heard her mother scream at 4:30 in the morning, words to the effect, \"Mia, Mia get out of the house\"?\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   Q: Now, Dr. Fukumoto, in estimating the time of death, isn't it true that if you have an eyewitness that actually sees the homicide or hears the homicide, that is better evidence than, let's say, rigor mortis, lividity, or food that is in the stomach?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   A: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   Q: And isn't it true that Deputy Coroner King, at least in the report that you have read, estimated the time of death based on the statement of the daughter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-258\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   (RT 4730-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   A review of the record demonstrates that this testimony was solicited on redirect examination, immediately after Petitioner's trial attorney closed his cross-examination by asking Dr. Fukumoto about the time of death listed on the death certificate and autopsy report. (RT 4729.) The hearsay was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., the victim's time of death.

As Respondent points out, Noguera used the fact that he had been stabbed as part of his defense and, as such, counsel's failure to object to Ms. Garcia's testimony was consistent with his defense strategy.

According to the insurance policies, Dominique Navarro was beneficiary. (RT 4915-16.) Petitioner argues that trial counsel should have made an unspecified constitutional objection and a California Evidence Code \u00a7 352 objection to this testimony. Petitioner fails to indicate what constitutional objection should have been made, or why Evidence Code 352 was implicated. As such, Petitioner's claim is conclusory.

Petitioner asserts that trial counsel \"unreasonably and inexplicably failed to seek a limiting instruction\" with respect to this testimony. (Dkt. No. 317 at 137.) Petitioner fails to identify the basis for any objection, or what type of limiting instruction should have been given. As such, Petitioner's claim is conclusory.

The conversation took a different turn, and Officer Keltner \"got the tape recorder out\" after \"Ricky stated ... that he might as well tell [Officer Keltner] the truth. And the truth was that he was involved in the planning of this homicide.\" (RT 5182.) Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation in failing to move to strike this \"inadmissible testimony.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 137.) Petitioner fails to demonstrate how he suffered any prejudice from Officer Keltner's statement and, specifically, what benefit he would have obtained from objecting. The tape recording, on which Mr. Abram recounted the details of his meeting with Petitioner and Dominique at the Big Boy restaurant, had already been played on the record. (RT 5122.)

(RT 5187-88.) With respect to other people from whom impressions were collected, the prosecutor asked Officer Keltner for the rationale behind the collection. (RT 5188.) Citing just a single page of the record, Petitioner argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to \"numerous inadmissible hearsay statements ... as to why the teeth impressions were taken of certain individuals.\" (Dkt.

Ms. Jackson testified that Jovita did not like them dating \"because the two got in trouble together.\" (RT 5392-93.) She went on to say that\n   Dominique had been skipping school, that Jovita planned to move to make the relationship more difficult to maintain, and that Dominique had a curfew. (RT 5393-96.) Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation in failing to request a limiting instruction with regard to Jovita's statements \"that Petitioner was a bad influence on ... Dominique ...\" (Dkt. No. 3177 at 138.) However, the Court did instruct the jury during Ms. Jackson's testimony that, \"with regards to the statements by the alleged victim in the case, Jovita Navarro, to this [Ms. Jackson], [the jury was] to consider those statements only for the state of mind of the victim and for no other reason.\" (RT 5395-96.)

He testified that he had seen the martial arts weapon depicted in People's Exhibits 51A in Petitioner's car. (RT 5752-53.) Mr. Arce also testified that a couple of weeks before Jovita's death, he heard Petitioner say that \"Dominique's mom didn't want [Dominique] to go out with him and he wanted to kill [Jovita].\" (RT 5754.) Over a defense objection under Evidence Code 352, the Court permitted the prosecution to question Mr. Arce regarding two prior incidents when Petitioner used martial arts. (RT 5758-61.) The trial court found the prejudicial impact of the testimony to be outweighed by its probative value. (RT 5756-57.) On cross-examination, Petitioner's trial attorney questioned Mr. Arce about why, sometime after July 6, 1983, he called the La Habra Police for assistance. (RT 5815-16.) In reply, Mr. Arce testified that \"some guys came to [his] house threatening [him], telling [him that he] better not testify.\" (RT 5816.) Subsequently, on redirect, the prosecution asked some follow-up questions about the incident. The court overruled a defense relevancy objection and allowed Mr. Arce to provide additional details about why he called the police. He testified that \"guys came up to [his] door and they said if [he] didn't want to end up like Dominique's mom, ... [he] wouldn't testify.\" (RT 5820.) They mentioned Petitioner's name, and Mr. Arce subsequently told police about the incident. (RT 5820.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to raise unspecified \"federal constitutional or hearsay objections, or objections under Evidence Code \u00a7 352\" to Mr. Arce's testimony about the threats. (Dkt. No. 317 at 138.) However, as Respondent notes, evidence of threats made to a witness is admissible where it aids the jury in assessing the witness's credibility. Under state law, evidence a witness was threatened and is afraid to testify is relevant to the credibility of that witness and is therefore admissible. Evid.Code, \u00a7 780 ;\n   <em>\n    People v.

As such, counsel's performance was not deficient. Moreover, in light of strength of the evidence against Petitioner at trial, Petitioner fails to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel's failure to object.

(RT 6523.) On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Investigator Moore regarding statements Mr. Arce made about a fight he had with Petitioner in which Petitioner used martial arts. (RT 6534-35.) Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to make a hearsay objection to this line of cross-examination. (Dkt. 317 at 138.) As discussed just above, because Mr. Arce himself testified regarding the fight, trial counsel could quite reasonably have chosen not to object to Investigator Moore's testimony regarding the same facts. Moreover, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel's failure to object.

(RT 6549.) On cross-examination the prosecutor asked Ms. Perez if she remembered the phone number for the Noguera family's residence on the date of the murder. (RT 6575.) Ms. Perez stated she thought it was 918-6240, but she \"couldn't tell ... for sure.\" (RT 6575.) The prosecutor subsequently questioned Ms. Perez regarding People's Exhibit 106, the phone records of Antonio Contreras, which indicated \"several calls\" to the 918-6240 number. (RT 6576.) He asked Ms. Perez if the records refreshed her recollection as to whose phone number that was, and she said \"that was ours.\" (RT 6576.) Petitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to the improper use of the phone company records to refresh Ms. Perez's recollection \"when her recollection did not need to be refreshed.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 138.) Petitioner's claim is entirely without merit. Ms. Perez stated that she was not sure about the phone number. After the prosecutor showed her the record, she recalled the number definitively. Petitioner has failed to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice.

(RT 6648-49.) After Ms. Noguera affirmed that Dominique had called to talk about \"her situation,\" defense counsel asked \"what exactly did she tell you?\" (RT 6649.) The prosecution made a hearsay objection, to which defense counsel responded that the statement was offered as a \"statement of a co-conspirator.\" (RT 6649.) However, because the statement was not offered\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   a party to the conspiracy, the objection was sustained. (RT 6649-50.) Petitioner argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance\n   in failing to explain that Dominique's statements were not being offered for their truth. (Dkt. No. 317 at 138.) Trial counsel's arguments, at sidebar, that Dominique's statements fell under an exception to the hearsay rule and were being offered \"by way of rebuttal\" to the prosecution's contention that \"Dominique was continuing to pursue her attorney, drawing the inference she wanted to get the money, get the house,\" belie Petitioner's contention that Dominique's statements were not being offered for their truth. (RT 6649-50.) Petitioner fails to explain what counsel expected to elicit, and what purpose, other than truth, Dominique's statements would have served.

[\u00b6] [a]nd they went on to say he only spent eight and a half years of a 14-years sentence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   That is not going to be Billy's fate. If you give him life, that means that Billy will spend the rest of his life in prison ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   (RT 8671.) Counsel went on to describe all of the things that Petitioner would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be able to do in prison, and all of the things in life he would miss out on-things he enjoyed, and things to which he had looked forward. (RT 8671-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Petitioner contends that counsel's reference to the infamous Singleton case in Orange County inflamed and horrified the jury, encouraging them to vote of the death penalty, and prejudicing Petitioner. (Dkt. No. 317 at 144-45.) However, read in context, it is clear, as Respondent argues, that \"[t]he point of counsel's argument was to impress upon the jury that a life sentence would in fact be terribly punishing to [P]etitioner, and that, unlike Singleton, [P]etitioner would never get out.... \" (Dkt. 330 at 53.) Given the context of the case, and the public notoriety of the Singleton case during the litigation of Petitioner's capital trial, counsel's strategy was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Petitioner also argues that counsel argued \"that Petitioner would be better off dead than with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 144-45.) Counsel did not make such an argument. Rather, counsel made an effort to describe for the jury the harsh reality of a sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole. (RT 8671-74.) At no time did counsel suggest that Petitioner would be better off dead than in prison. He did, however, explain to the jury that Petitioner was not Lawrence Singleton; he would \"spend the rest of his life in prison.\" (RT 8671.) He would never again celebrate holidays or see his family at home. (RT 8672.) He would never again play the guitar or accordion. (RT 8672.) He would not have the opportunity to watch his children grow up, or spend time with them. (RT 8673.) Trial counsel explained that a life without\n   parole prison sentence for Petitioner meant \"spending the rest of his life in a cell\" with only \"fear in what the next day brings\" as a companion. (RT 8673.) Clearly, counsel's strategy was to stress for the jury that life without possibility of parole was a severe sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   The California Supreme Court's finding of no constitutional error was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under section 2254(d)(1), nor an unreasonable determination of the facts under section 2254(d)(2).

Petitioner did not present any evidence showing that issues involving his competence should have been known to the trial court such that a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   inquiry should have been made, nor did he provide reason to believe that he was in fact incompetent at trial. (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 4 at 147-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   In support of the claims, Petitioner submitted declarations from three former inmates in the Orange County Jail (Exhibits DD (Willie Wisely), EE (Rodney Beeler), and FF (John Galen Davenport) ), his mother (Exhibit AA), his wife (Exhibit GG), a psychiatrist (Exhibit B (Fred Rosenthal) ), and a psychologist (Exhibit Y (Anne Evans) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     California Supreme Court's Adjudication of Petitioner's Claim Was Neither an \"Unreasonable Application of Clearly Established Federal Law\" Nor an \"Unreasonable Determination of the Facts\" Within the Meaning of \u00a7 2254(d)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   The Court finds that the California Supreme Court's summary denials of Claims 10 and 11 of the 1998 exhaustion petition were neither an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts, within the meaning of \u00a7 2254(d), such that Petitioner is entitled to de novo review in federal habeas corpus proceedings. Petitioner points to no evidence that should have raised a bona fide doubt about his mental competence. His habeas filing with the state courts pled conclusory allegations, e.g., \"[h]e was unable to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings due to mental disorders ...\"; \"[he] was unable to assist counsel ...\"; \"during relevant court proceedings, Petitioner was irrational and out-of-contact with reality\"; \"he suffered at relevant times from a debilitating mental illness ...\"; and his mental illness \"was substantially compounded and aggravated at relevant times by the ingestion of drugs.\" (Dkt. No. 336, Lodgment 4 at 148.) Petitioner supported his state habeas claim with declarations from family members and jail inmates who offered observations about Petitioner's behavior and drug use in the Orange County Jail, and declarations from a forensic psychiatrist and a forensic psychologist who offered their opinions,18 years post-trial, that they had doubts about Mr. Noguera's competency to stand trial, largely due to his drug use. Petitioner did not attach a transcript or other evidence of record that would have prompted further inquiry into his mental competence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   In fact, as Respondent points out, Petitioner's claims are belied by the trial record, which includes approximately 167 pages of Noguera's testimony in which he comes across as rational and aware of many details. (RT 7618-7785.) Moreover, though cited by Petitioner in support of his claim of incompetence, Francesca Mozqueda's declaration actually portrays Petitioner as a man with a thorough understanding of his situation and the proceedings against him, and a man with sufficient ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\n   <em>\n    Godinez v.

Ms. Mozqueda noted that Petitioner \"would cry and express how desperate and helpless he felt\"; he discussed psychological defenses with his attorneys and wanted to be psychologically evaluated. (Exh. GG at 5.) In addition, the record indicates Petitioner was sufficiently aware of his situation that he attempted to intimidate witnesses to testify on his behalf. At trial, after testifying on Petitioner's behalf, Margaret Noone was recalled by the prosecution on rebuttal and testified\n   that she lied on direct because she was afraid of, and was threatened by, Petitioner.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The prosecutor sought to empanel jurors who would be willing and able to impose the death penalty upon the defendant in the case before them-a defendant with whom they might identify, or for whom they might have sympathy. As such, the district attorney's questions focused on whether the jurors could vote for death. With regard to Juror Celine Reilly, the prosecutor asked, \"if you find him guilty of first degree murder, ... and we get to the penalty phase. And you weigh the aggravation versus the mitigation, and you feel that death is the appropriate penalty, do you have it in you to be a participant in a decision with 11 other people that in all actuality would result in the death of another human being?\" (RT 2972-73.) This was proper voir dire, as were similar questions asked of Juror Janice Berens (RT 2258), Juror Ruth Stasiak (RT 3781), and alternate Carol Newton (RT 3680-81).

Petitioner suggests that the voir dire questions, and particularly the prosecutor's penalty phase closing argument \"led the jury to believe that Petitioner's individual characteristics need not be considered because the crime was, in the prosecutor's view, so horrible that nothing could mitigate it.\" (Dkt.

With respect to the prosecutor's penalty phase closing argument, the excerpts Petitioner cites in support of his claim reveal nothing improper. (Dkt. No. 317 at 170 n.11.) Petitioner was convicted of first-degree special circumstances murder, and the prosecutor argued that the evidence in aggravation warranted a death sentence. This was proper argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   In Mr. Pereyda's closing argument, he was free to dispute the prosecutor's claims, to discuss the evidence presented in mitigation, to argue a different interpretation of the weighing process, to clarify any concerns about the jury's perception of its sentencing discretion, and to draw the jury's attention to the penalty phase instructions. As discussed below, defense counsel properly directed the jury's attention to the penalty phase instructions, quoted CALJIC 8.84.2, explicitly informed the jury that they could return a life verdict even if they found that the aggravating evidence outweighed the mitigating evidence, and detailed the mitigating factors he thought the jury should consider. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that \"[s]tatements made by the attorneys during trial are not evidence\" (CT 1379; RT 8678) and gave the modified version of CALJIC 8.84.1, submitted by the defense (CT 1245-46), advising the jury that \"[i]n determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant, you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case ...\" including factor (k). (RT 8696-99; CT 1407-08.) The Court also gave the defense's special instructions, focusing on mitigation (RT at 8696-99; CT at 1409, 1247), and sympathy. (RT 8704; CT 1253, 1416.) The jurors were also instructed that they must \"determine the facts of the case from the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source.\" (CT 1593.) The Court must \"generally presume that jurors follow their instructions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   <em>\n    Penry v.

As such, the Court determined that the prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct.

No. 317 at 247.) Specifically, Petitioner takes issue with the prosecutor's statement that, \"There are lots and lots of murders which are prosecuted in this courthouse in which this type of penalty is not sought. There's a reason for that.\" (RT 8631.)

Petitioner suggests the statement violated section 3-58(b) of the ABA Standards of Criminal Justice, which provides that \"[i]t is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the truth and falsity of any testimony or evidence or the guilt of the defendant.\" (ABA Standards of Criminal Justice 3-58(b), 2d ed. 1980). Petitioner also argues that the prosecutor's discussion of a hypothetical set of facts \"compounded his intentional and egregious misconduct by measuring Petitioner's culpability against a heat of passion killing\" because voluntary manslaughter is not a capital offense and \"the culpability of the accused is much less than any special circumstance murder.\" (Dkt.

He properly directed the jury's attention to the fact that, \"[t]he Court will give you instructions ... in the light of how we go through this weighing process in reference to the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances.\" (RT at 8661.)

Mr. Pereyda went on to explicitly tell the jurors that they could return a life verdict even if they found that the aggravating evidence outweighed the mitigating evidence, to detail the mitigating factors he thought the jury should consider, and to again direct the jury's attention to the instructions they would be given. (RT at 8663-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Following closing statements, the Court instructed the jury that \"[s]tatements made by the attorneys during trial are not evidence\" (CT 1379; RT 8678) and gave the modified version of CALJIC 8.84.1, submitted by the defense (CT 1245-46), advising the jury that \"[i]n determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant, you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case ...\" including factor (k),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-381\">\n   any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though its not a legal excuse for the crime [and any sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant's character or record that the defendant offers] as a basis for sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is on trial....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   (RT 8696-99; CT 1407-08.)

This precedent does not support Petitioner's contention that a prosecutor's closing argument could similarly offend the Constitution by failing to circumscribe the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. This is the role of the statute and, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   with respect to Claims 62-66, California's death penalty statute has long been held to be in constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   The prosecutor did not, as Petitioner suggests, argue that Petitioner's crime \"could not be mitigated\" nor did he mislead the jury about the nature and scope of its sentencing discretion. Rather, it is well within the prosecutor's purview to make the kinds of argument Petitioner takes issue with here. For example, when the district attorney discussed the \"circumstances of the crime\" aggravating factor, he argued that \"strangulation\" was a \"very personal thing,\" as compared to other types of killings. The prosecutor referenced hypothetical crimes to emphasize the\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   nature of Petitioner's offense, and to demonstrate the time and effort it would have taken to extinguish Jovita Navarro's life. (RT 8647-48.) He used the comparison to argue in favor of the weight he thought the aggravator should be given. These arguments did not \"mislead the jury about the weighing process,\" \"create a presumption in favor of death,\" or \"encourage the jury to make an arbitrary and capricious sentencing decision.\" Petitioner was convicted of first-degree special circumstances murder, and the prosecutor argued that the evidence in aggravation warranted a death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   The defense was free to dispute the prosecutor's claims, to present evidence in\n   mitigation, to argue a different interpretation of the weighing process, to clarify any concerns about the jury's perception of its sentencing discretion, and to draw the jury's attention to the penalty phase instructions. As discussed above, Petitioner's counsel properly directed the jury's attention to the penalty phase instructions, quoted CALJIC 8.84.2, explicitly informed the jury that they could return a life verdict even if they found that the aggravating evidence outweighed the mitigating evidence, and detailed the mitigating factors he thought the jury should consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that \"[s]tatements made by the attorneys during trial are not evidence\" (CT 1379; RT 8678) and gave the modified version of CALJIC 8.84.1, submitted by the defense (CT 1245-46), advising the jury that \"[i]n determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant, you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case ...\" including factor (k). (RT 8696-99; CT 1407-08.) The Court also gave the defense's special instructions, focusing on mitigation (RT at 8696-99; CT at 1409, 1247), and sympathy. (RT 8704; CT 1253, 1416.) The jurors were also instructed that they must \"determine the facts of the case from the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source.\" (CT 1593.)

Petitioner suggests that the prosecutor led jurors \"to believe that their basic moral values and their perceptions of Petitioner were distinct from the penalty process.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 272.) In his penalty phase closing argument, after discussing Petitioner's family members' testimony, the prosecutor argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-401\">\n   ... [T]he question you have to ask yourself is does the defendant deserve that sympathy for his family members?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-402\">\n   Because ladies and gentlemen, no matter what your verdict is, because whether you say he's going [to] die or you say he's going to live the rest of his life in San Quentin, they are here because of what he did.

As such, Petitioner contends that the prosecutor\n   <em>\n    \"prevented\"\n   </em>\n   the jury from feeling sympathy, from considering all relevant mitigating evidence, and from properly weighing aggravation and\n   mitigation pursuant to California law so as to make Petitioner's sentence a denial of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   Petitioner initially raised this claim on direct appeal. (Dkt. No. 148, Lodgment 1 at 157-64.) The California Supreme Court found that Petitioner had waived the claim by failing to object to the prosecutor's argument, and such failure did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel because \"[t]he prosecutor neither vouched personally for the death penalty as an appropriate sentence [citation] nor argued on the basis of facts not in evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

There is absolutely no support in the record for Petitioner's contention that the prosecution argued, or that the jury considered, \"nonstatutory aggravating factors.\" The California Supreme Court's rejection of Petitioner's claim was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law nor an unreasonable determination of the facts under \u00a7 2254(d).

On the evening before the murder, Petitioner and Dominique went to a party together, went out for a hamburger and \"went parking before Petitioner took [Dominique] home about 1:30 am.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 23, citing CT Supp. I at 54-56.) By all accounts, Dominique was home at 4:30 a.m., when Jovita was attacked, and she ran to a neighbor's house for help. (RT at 5175, 5183, 5438, 5583; CT Supp. I at 63.) Contrary to Petitioner's suggestion that \"Dominique's testimony appeared to be neither material nor pertinent,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   there was substantial reason for the prosecution to call her as a witness at trial as the state's theory at trial was that Dominique and Petitioner conspired in the murder of her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   On February 4, 1987, during a pre-trial hearing regarding motions scheduling, the district attorney advised the trial court that he intended to file a motion regarding the use of Dominique Navarro's statements to police and prosecutors, and her application for life insurance benefits following the murder of her mother. (RT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   4276.) The prosecutor sought to introduce this evidence in support of his theory that \"there were three objectives [of the conspiracy]: to kill the victim, to cover it up, and to collect the money from the insurance.\" (RT 4340.) At the time of the hearing, Ms. Navarro's juvenile first-degree murder conviction was final, and she had already spoken to an investigator from the district attorney's office. (RT 4277.) The district attorney stated that he planned to call her to testify at an\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   motion hearing, but she advised the investigator that she was going to refuse to testify. (RT 4277.) The prosecutor advised the judge that it was his \"desire to call her in our case in chief\" and \"specifically to impeach her [with her prior statements] if she does not... let me back it up.\" (RT 4277.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   On February 9, 1987, Dominique took the stand a pretrial hearing in Petitioner's case, while represented by counsel. (RT 4295-96.) Her attorney advised the court that \"[s]he did not want to be involved. She did not want to be sworn, did not want to have anything to do with the case ...\" (RT 4296.) She also said that she understood \"the consequences of taking the posture,\" but \"did not wish to participate as a witness.\" (RT 4296.) After Dominique refused to respond to the administration of the oath, the trial court held her in contempt and ordered her held in the Orange County Jail until either the conclusion of the trial or she notified authorities of her intention to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (RT 4299-300.) In her absence, the trial court denied the People's motion to introduce at trial her December 20, 1983, statement to police, determining that the statement was involuntary. (RT at 4338.) The court did, however, grant the People's motion to introduce Dominique's statement to Mindy Jackson, her statements to police on April 24, 1983, and her applications for insurance benefits in June and September of 1983. The court found that \"the statements offered or proffered ultimately were made in preparation of the objective of conspiracy; therefore, the statements [were] admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.\" (RT 4341.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   During the defense case, Petitioner took the stand and testified that he had no involvement in Jovita Navarro's murder. (RT 7618-90.) Immediately upon conclusion of his testimony, out of the presence of the jury, the prosecution noted its intention to ask Petitioner on cross-examination if he had made certain statements before and after Dominique's February 9, 1983, refusal to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (RT 7690-91.) If he denied making the statements, the prosecutor intended to subpoena two deputy marshals to testify regarding the statements, which were relevant to the prosecution's contention that Petitioner dissuaded Dominique from testifying. (RT 7691-96.) The trial court overruled the defense objection to the introduction of the evidence. (RT 7696.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   On cross-examination, the district attorney asked Petitioner about Dominique's appearance in court on the morning of\n   February 9, 1987. (RT 7698-99.) Petitioner testified that before the hearing he was housed downstairs. (RT 7700.) He recalled that he asked the marshal if it was okay if he saw Dominique, and was told that \"if [he] wanted a visit, [he would] have to have a custody visit.\" (RT 7700-01.) Petitioner denied referring to Dominique as his \"wife.\" (RT 7701.) Petitioner testified that Dominique was escorted into court, took the witness stand, and did nothing; she stood mute. (RT 7699.) She was held in contempt, and taken out of the courtroom. (RT 7702.) Petitioner denied asking anyone to \"tell Dominique she did a real good job in testifying.\" (RT 7703.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   In rebuttal, the prosecution called Deputy Cindy Lucille Cossairt who testified that she was assigned to be Mr. Noguera's runner on February 9, 1983, to take him up to the courtroom. (RT 7839.) Sometime between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m., before Dominique testified, Petitioner asked Deputy Cossairt who was in charge of the basement holding facility because he wanted to be able to talk to \"his wife\" who \"had just come down to testify in his case.\" (RT 7838-39.) Deputy Cossairt testified that Dominique Navarro was the only female in the holding area who was scheduled to testify; she was present when Dominique was given the oath. (RT 7840, 7844.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   Subsequently, Deputy William A. Elliott testified that he was working in the holding area at approximately noon on February 9, 1983, when he heard Petitioner talking to another inmate, \"Mr. Clark.\" (RT 7848-49.) \"[Mr. Noguera] relayed to Mr. Clark ... to tell Dominique that, 'she did a good job and tell her that I love her.' \" (RT 7849.) That day, Deputy Elliott contacted Jeff Arnold from the Orange County District Attorney's Office. (RT 7850-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-465\">\n   Given the fact that Dominique did not have a privilege at the time she refused to testify, in combination with the deputy marshals' testimony, it was not unreasonable for the prosecutor to infer that Petitioner had influenced her decision. There is no evidence to support Petitioner's contentions that \"\n   <em>\n    the prosecutor knew\n   </em>\n   \" (1) \"that Dominique Navarro's refusal to testify was due to her concern that it would negatively affect her safety in the Women's Jail at the time\"; or (2) \"that, had Dominique Navarro been transferred to another facility, she would have been willing to testify.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 295.) The prosecutor's argument did not constitute misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   Moreover, unless the prosecutor's alleged misconduct had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict, a grant of relief is unwarranted.\n   <em>\n    Brecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6235767\" index=\"709\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/619/#p637\">\n    507 U.S. at 637-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6235767\" index=\"710\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/619/#p637\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205694\" index=\"711\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/168/#p181\">\n    477 U.S. at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205694\" index=\"712\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/168/#p181\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   factors-i.e., the weight of the evidence, the prominence of the comment in the context of the entire trial, whether the prosecution misstated the evidence, whether the judge instructed the jury to disregard the comment, whether the comment was invited by defense counsel in its summation and whether defense counsel had an adequate opportunity to rebut the comment-require courts to place improper argument in the context of the entire trial to evaluate whether its damaging effect was mitigated or aggravated. What\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   requires reviewing courts to consider appears to be equivalent\n   to evaluating whether there was a \"reasonable probability\" of a different result. As such, a key factor in the prejudice analysis is the strength of the evidence against the accused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   Assuming without finding that the prosecutor's inference here was somehow erroneous, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice therefrom. During his guilt phase closing argument, the prosecutor admitted to the jury that his case relied upon circumstantial evidence. (RT 8237.) He discussed each of the pieces of the puzzle that was his case-(1) the bogus rape; (2) the bogus burglary; (3) the lack of forced entry; (4) Petitioner's knowledge of martial arts; (5) the testimony of the two deputy marshals, suggesting that Petitioner had influenced Dominique's February 9, 1983, refusal to testify; (6) forensic evidence; (7) Margaret Noone's perjury; (8) Dominique's unusual behavior on the night of the murder; (9) the meeting at Bob's Big Boy with Ricky Abram; (10) the motive; and (11) Dominique's statements to La Habra Police. (RT 8237-40.) The prosecutor repeatedly advised the jurors that they could accept or reject any of the pieces-\"if we don't prove it to you ... you can just throw it away and you consider the rest of the evidence and see if we proven [sic] to you beyond a reasonable doubt.....\" (RT 8238, 8239.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   In light of the evidence presented at the guilt phase, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the California Supreme Court's decision, denying his claim that prosecutor's argument affected the fairness of his trial, was unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205694\" index=\"716\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/168/#p181\">\n    477 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   181 n. 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205694\" index=\"717\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/168/#p181\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-500\">\n   Petitioner takes issue with the following comment the trial court made while explaining sequestered voir dire:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-501\">\n   The Court will ask various questions concerning your feelings on capital punishment, your sexual prerogatives-never mind. [\u00b6] As we get into this case, those of you that stay with us, you'll see that I have a peculiar sense of humor-doesn't always work, as this last little joke didn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   (Dkt. No. 317 at 178, quoting RT 1460.) Clearly an attempt at humor, nothing about the comment suggests bias that would entitle Petitioner to habeas corpus relief. Similarly, the judge's comment made before beginning hardship voir dire, referencing \"malingerers and whiners,\" did not reveal bias or undermine the seriousness of the proceedings. (Dkt. No. 317 at 178, quoting RT at 1465.) Rather, the court was making light of the process by which jurors seek to be removed from proceedings for hardship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   Petitioner also quotes a statement the trial judge made when preparing the jury for sequestered voir dire-\"I didn't set up this kind of a coo-coo system, ladies and gentlemen. It's required under the State of California law and under the law of the United States.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 178, quoting RT at 1461.) As Respondent notes in its answer to the petition, Petitioner neglects\n   to place the judge's quote in context. Beyond the cited language, he continued, explaining that the reason for the sequestered voir dire was a good one, \"though it is time consuming.\" The court told the jury,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-504\">\n   It may be that an individual is so anti capital punishment or so pro capital punishment, that they voice that with such a degree that it infects or impacts the other jurors and perhaps contaminates-perhaps not a good word-affects the jurors' minds to the degree that you don't have a full cross section of the community that is voting their own opinion in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-505\">\n   (Dkt. No. 330 at 73, quoting RT 1461.) Examined in context, the judge's comments did not demonstrate bias or disrespect for the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-506\">\n   Petitioner similarly extracts out of context, remarks the trial court made while examining the venire en masse for hardship. During the voir dire, prospective juror Norman B stated \"I'm against the death penalty.\" (RT 1470.) Because the court was only considering hardship at the time, the judge replied, \"I don't want to hear that now. After I talk to you, you may be for the death penalty.... [T]hose are the kinds of things that I want to talk to everybody privately about.\" (RT 1470.) In citing only the second sentence of the judge's reply, Petitioner removes the rationale behind the court's comment. The judge later elaborated upon his point when addressing the entire jury panel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-507\">\n   For those of you that are for the death penalty, after I talk to you, you may switch over to being against the death penalty. My point is that no one is sure until you've thought about it in depth; and then there is a difference between how you think you feel and how you really feel when it becomes your responsibility to do something. We'll keep you for awhile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-508\">\n   (RT 1470.) Again, the judge's remarks do not demonstrate bias or disrespect for the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-509\">\n   Finally, Petitioner takes issue with three comments the trial judge made during sequestered voir dire of three prospective jurors who did not end up sitting on Petitioner's jury, and one remark he made after a prospective juror left the room and outside the presence of any other jurors. This Court finds nothing in any of the comments that rendered the proceedings unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   The California Supreme Court's finding of no constitutional error was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under section 2254(d).

He also argues that the state court erred in finding that the information contained in the hearsay statements was introduced to the jury through other sources and failed to address the prosecution's use of the hearsay evidence during closing argument.

Addressing such a claim in 1990, the United States Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Boyde v.

In the present matter, Petitioner turns the factor (k) argument on its head, suggesting that, by permitting the jury to consider evidence received at any pont during the trial, CALJIC 8.84.1 abandons the jury to the wind, encouraging jurors to use \"unfettered discretion to decide whether Petitioner should live or die.\" (Dkt. No. 317 at 320.) In so arguing, Petitioner ignores the entirety of the penalty phase instructions, and the history of judicial approval of CALJIC 8.84.1.
