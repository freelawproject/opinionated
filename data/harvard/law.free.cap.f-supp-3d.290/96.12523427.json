In 2008, she attained the rank of GL-11 Lieutenant. In March 2011, she was reassigned to the position of Escort Lieutenant. Ortiz alleges that from March 2011 through October 2014, she was subjected to \"continuous and pervasive discriminatory treatment\" because of her race, and gender (Plaintiff is Hispanic)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Grondolsky, Russell, and Bollinger supervised the Plaintiff for the relevant period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   More specifically, Ortiz claims that numerous times during her employment with the BOP, Caucasian male lieutenants suffered lessened consequences for disobeying Bollinger's orders, while she was more severely disciplined for similar infractions. For example, a Caucasian male lieutenant improperly opened a cell door without ensuring an inmate was handcuffed, but was not disciplined for his behavior. However, when the Plaintiff opened a cell door while an inmate was not handcuffed, she was investigated and suspended for two days. On other occasions, Caucasian male lieutenants were either not investigated or not severely punished for serious infractions, including misplacing $4,000.00 of escort equipment and leaving a weapon unattended at a local hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 22, 2011, Ortiz was working in an office with multiple Caucasian corrections officers. As another Hispanic corrections officer entered the room, one of the Caucasian corrections officers told him \"your sister is here,\" in apparent reference to the Plaintiff's Hispanic heritage. Four\n   or five of the Plaintiff's subordinates heard the comment and laughed. On June 7, 2011, a department head/lieutenant meeting was held in which employees voiced their workplace concerns. Lieutenant Roberts and Lieutenant Allred, both Caucasian males, spoke for ten and fifteen minutes respectively and were not cut off even when they spoke harshly about the department. Bollinger cut the Plaintiff off from speaking after just one minute. On August 1, 2011, Ortiz noticed a sheet of paper on the window in the Control Center which stated, in big bold letters, \"Attention! Please do not feed the Orangutans!\" with a picture of an orangutan. The Plaintiff was \"humiliated\" by the sign, as this is traditionally a racist reference and she was \"certain\" that the sign was directed at herself and other persons of color. Plaintiff notified a Senior Officer, Bollinger, Special Investigative Services, and the Regional Director of the BOP that she was offended by the sign and asked that it be removed immediately. She received no response. Similar signs, including pictures of \"Bubba Gump Shrimp\" and a Rastafarian man with dreadlocks, remained hanging in the control room despite the Plaintiff telling multiple supervisors she found the signs offensive\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After an email from the corrections officers' union president on May 25, 2012, that instructed all corrections officers and union staff \"not to heed any orders issued\" by the Plaintiff, she again formally complained to all individually named Defendants about being subjected to \"racial disrespect\" and a \"hostile working environment.\" Plaintiff received no follow-up on her complaints, and no investigation ever occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 22, 2013, Officer John Hansen (\"Hansen\") physically assaulted Ortiz while they were in a seclusion unit by intentionally hip-checking her into the wall. Ortiz's version of the events was corroborated by another officer. Ortiz submitted a memo to Bollinger that Hansen assaulted and battered her, but received no response and had to work with Hansen the next day. On February 27, 2013, an inmate was given a rotten bag of cereal. Per Bollinger's instructions, Plaintiff exchanged the rotten bag for a new one and was given a six day suspension for doing so. Bollinger did not support mitigating the suspension despite the fact the Plaintiff replaced the cereal on his orders. Plaintiff was not able to appeal her suspension or present her position to either Grondolsky or Human Resources. Ortiz alleges that all these events, as well as others described in the Complaint, demonstrate discrimination on the basis of race and/or gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Claims Against Defendants in Their Individual Capacities\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint names Grondolsky, Russell, and Bollinger in their individual capacities.

Ortiz is Hispanic and female, both protected classes under Title VII. She was qualified for her position, having worked for the BOP since 1987 and promoted to lieutenant in 2008. The Complaint alleges a number of adverse employment actions, the most recent being a six-day suspension. The fourth element presents a more difficult question. As noted, because establishing a prima facie disparate treatment case is not meant to be \"rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\" \"the precise requirements of a prima facie case can vary depending on the context.\"\n   <em>\n    Swierkiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108377\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/506/#p512\">\n    534 U.S. at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108377\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/506/#p512\">\n    122 S.Ct. 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While Plaintiff cannot state a valid disparate treatment claim based on neutral events she perceives to be discriminatory, the Complaint alleges numerous instances of adverse employment actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542944\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/132/#p138\">\n    840 F.2d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"plaintiffs cannot be merely conclusory regarding the characterization of the defendant's motives; a subjective characterization of those motives will not suffice\"). Ortiz was subject to multiple suspensions for relatively minor infractions, including a six-day suspension for essentially obeying her superior's orders. Ortiz alleges that white male colleagues or committed similar infractions received less harsh discipline or were not disciplined at all. Other incidents, which I will discuss in the context of Plaintiff's hostile environment claims, support her contention that the incidents were not \"facially neutral\" as alleged by the Defendants, but were motivated by Ortiz's race or gender. These allegations are sufficient to state plausible claims for gender and race discrimination based on disparate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to Ortiz's hostile work environment claims, I will focus on the second and third elements of the test. In determining whether she was subjected to unwelcome harassment based upon her gender or race, the Court considers \"all the attendant circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance. Although [t]he workplace is not a cocoon, and those who labor in it are expected to have reasonably thick skins, the 'accumulated effect' of repeated verbal attacks and physical intimidation in the workplace may reasonably be found to constitute ... harassment within the meaning of Title VII. The harassing conduct need not be overtly sexual in nature. [W]here a plaintiff endures harassing conduct, although not explicitly sexual in nature, which undermines her ability to succeed at her job, those acts should be considered along with overtly sexually abusive conduct in assessing a hostile work environment claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Rosario\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682370\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/241/#p246\">\n    607 F.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation mark, internal citations and citations to quoted cases omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ortiz's co-workers displayed signs Plaintiff found to be racially and sexually insensitive, including the aforementioned Orangutan sign, pictures of \"Bubba Gump Shrimp,\" and a picture of a Rastafarian man.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   She was barred from speaking longer than a minute at a department meeting where others spoke for ten to fifteen minutes. Additionally, white officers called Ortiz the \"sister\" of another Hispanic employee, an email instructed employees to disregard orders issued by her, and she was assaulted by a white, male officer. Importantly, for purposes of the third element, Ortiz made frequent complaints to her supervisors about what she believed to be discriminatory and harassing practices towards her over the three-year period and received either a limited response or no response at all. The fact that no one at the BOP responded substantively to the Plaintiff's complaints over that period suggests the Defendants at best did not consider her concerns serious; at worst, her complaints were deliberately ignored. Accordingly, viewing the allegations in the Complaint as a whole, the pleaded facts at least state a plausible claim that Ortiz was subject to a hostile work environment because of her race or gender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Keeping in mind that the burden for establishing a prima facie case is \"not onerous,\" Defendants' motion to dismiss as to Counts II and III is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Whether Plaintiff Has Stated a Claim for Retaliation in Violation of Title VII\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Title VII also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who have engaged in specific protected activities, including opposing \"any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII].\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).

Ortiz clearly had a good faith belief that the Defendants' actions were discriminatory and thus violated the law. Defendants also do not seriously contest that Ortiz suffered an adverse employment action in the form of a six-day suspension, a serious enough punishment to materially alter her position at the BOP. Thus, the first two elements of a prima facie retaliation case are satisfied. However, Defendants contend the Complaint fails to allege facts plausibly suggesting a causal connection between the adverse employment actions and Ortiz's complaints. I find, however, that at this stage of the proceedings, the Complaint establishes causation between the adverse employment action and the protected activity based on the temporal proximity between Ortiz's February 22, 2013 complaint and her February 27, 2013 suspension. Her complaint came in the form of a memorandum to Bollinger regarding the physical altercation between the Plaintiff and Hansen. Only five days later, Ortiz was suspended for following Bollinger's orders to replace an inmate's bag of cereal.

Frankly I doubt that the Court need consider any incidents beyond the display of these highly offensive signs to find that Ortiz has stated\n    <em>\n     plausible\n    </em>\n    hostile work environment claims. That the signs were inexplicably not removed when Ortiz complained to higher-ups and other incidents alleged by Ortiz and discussed above lend further support to her claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Admittedly, the allegations regarding her gender based hostile environment claim are sparse, but we are at the pleading state and as noted previously, the First Circuit has stated that the harassing conduct need not be explicitly sexual in nature.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Court concludes for the purposes of this Memorandum and Order that the Plaintiff's Complaint states plausible claims for which relief could be granted. The Court obviously takes no position and does not by any of its rulings intend to make any inferences regarding whether the Plaintiff's claims would be tenable at either the summary judgment or trial stages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
