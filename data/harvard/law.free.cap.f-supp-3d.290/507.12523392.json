For the reasons set forth below, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Steves &amp; Sons, Inc. (\"Steves\") alleged that JELD-WEN, Inc. (\"JELD-WEN\") violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act when it acquired CraftMaster Manufacturing, Inc. (\"CMI\") in 2012. Compl. (ECF No. 5) (Under Seal) \u00b6\u00b6 175-78. To prevail on that claim, Steves must show that \"the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   JELD-WEN asserts that it will argue that the CMI acquisition could not have substantially lessened competition because CMI's \"weakened competitive condition\" at the time of the acquisition made it \"unlikely to be able to compete as effectively as a seller of doorskins, whether or not it remained in business.\" Def. Opp. (ECF No. 654) (Under Seal) at 2.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In particular, JELD-WEN will show through fact witnesses, including Bob Merrill [ (\"Merrill\") ], the CEO of CMI at the time of the Acquisition, as well as JELD-WEN's experts, that CMI was in severe financial distress when its owners decided to sell the assets. CMI's financial distress was a direct result of the catastrophic housing market crash in 2007. CMI had lost money every year since 2008 and that had been kept afloat by a $36 million loan from the two families who owned it. In 2010, CMI suffered a net loss of $8.9 million. In 2011, it lost $11.9 million. As of March 30, 2012, CMI owed an additional $16.7 million under third party loan agreements that were set to expire in October of that year, with no commitments from any of its lenders to refinance those borrowings. As a result, CMI's own independent auditors reported that these debts, combined with the fact that \"business has been negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in the U.S. homebuilding industry ... raise substantial doubt about [CMI]'s ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted). Steves moves to exclude at trial: (1) any evidence or argument that CMI \"would have exited the market\" had it not been acquired by JELD-WEN; and (2) any evidence or argument that CMI \"would not have continued to be an effective competitor\" absent any merger.

Similarly, it argues that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   JELD-WEN's economist, [Edward] Snyder [ (\"Snyder\") ], put the question squarely at issue, critiquing Professor [Carl] Shapiro [ (\"Shapiro\") ] for failing to give this important evidence proper economic consideration. E. Snyder Rep. at \u00b6\u00b6 117-121 ... (explaining how the substantial evidence of CMI's weakness rebuts Professor Shapiro's analysis of anticompetitive effects) .... In short, Professor Shapiro was fully aware of the evidence and the competitive implications of CMI's weakened financial state and inability to compete that was developed during fact discovery in this case; he simply chose not to address it other than to say it did not satisfy the failing firm defense....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   It was the choice of Steves and its expert, not JELD-WEN, to have Dr. Shapiro ignore the merits of CMI's inability to effectively compete. He (and Steves) must live with his failure to address the issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Def. Response to Pl. Suppl. Brief (ECF No. 887) at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the arguments progressed on the issue, JELD-WEN took the view that Snyder's evidence is really only to show that Shapiro's analysis is flawed because\n   he did not factor in CMI's financial difficulties when he assumed that, absent the merger, the market would continue in the way it was in 2012. So, as things now stand, that is the predicate for JELD-WEN's use of CMI's weakened financial condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Assessing a Section 7 claim involves a three-step burden-shifting framework, an understanding of which provides helpful context for the admissibility of this evidence. First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case that a merger is anticompetitive.\n   <em>\n    Saint Alphonsus Med. Ctr.-Nampa Inc. v. St. Luke's Health Sys., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052352\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/775/#p783\">\n    778 F.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (9th Cir. 2015). To do so, the plaintiff \"must (1) propose the proper relevant market and (2) show that the effect of the merger in that market is likely to be anticompetitive,\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Penn State Hershey Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172843\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/327/#p337\">\n    838 F.3d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337-38 (3d Cir. 2016), which typically involves statistical analysis of market concentration and market share before and after the merger,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Anthem, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276807\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/345/#p349\">\n    855 F.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Second, if the plaintiff shows a prima facie case, the defendant must rebut the presumption-either by \"provid[ing] sufficient evidence that the prima facie case inaccurately predicts the relevant transaction's probable effect on future competition,\" or by \"sufficiently discredit[ing] the evidence underlying the initial presumption\" (the market share evidence offered by the plaintiff).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276807\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/345/#p349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted). Third, if that rebuttal is successful, \"the burden of production shifts back to the [plaintiff] and merges with the [plaintiff's] ultimate burden of persuasion.\"\n   <em>\n    Saint Alphonsus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052352\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/775/#p783\">\n    778 F.3d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Two similar defenses available to rebut the prima facie case are relevant to the arguments made here. The first, the \"failing company\" defense, applies where \"the\n   <em>\n    resources\n   </em>\n   of [a] company\n   <em>\n    [a]re so depleted\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    prospect of rehabilitation so remote\n   </em>\n   \" that its acquisition could not substantially lessen competition under Section 7.\n   <em>\n    Citizen Publ'g Co. v.

Moreover, Steves argues, JELD-WEN cannot show that CMI: (1) faced a \"grave probability\" of business failure; (2) ever contemplated the possibility of reorganization under Chapter 11; or (3) could not have merged with any other company besides JELD-WEN. Similarly, Steves claims that the evidence does not show that CMI had no alternatives other than being acquired by JELD-WEN or that CMI's market share would have decreased enough to undermine Steves' market share calculations without the acquisition, both prerequisites for a weakened competitor defense. Consequently, because JELD-WEN has neither alleged, nor could establish, a failing firm or weakened competitor defense, evidence of CMI's financial condition should be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, JELD-WEN concedes that it has not alleged a failing firm defense, and it acknowledges that it lacks the evidence to establish that position. However, in its brief, JELD-WEN asserts that evidence of CMI's inability to compete effectively in the doorskin market beyond 2012-consisting primarily of testimony by Merrill and JELD-WEN's experts-is relevant for two different reasons. First, it says, such evidence will undermine the assumption made by Shapiro, Steves' expert on antitrust liability, that CMI would have remained an effective competitor in the absence of any acquisition, such that Steves will be unable to establish its prima facie case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, JELD-WEN argues that, even if Steves could establish its prima facie case, CMI's circumstances are analogous to those of the weakened company in\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   , so JELD-WEN can present rebuttal evidence that would allow the jury to find that CMI would not have remained an effective competitor after 2012. Although JELD-WEN states these arguments as two separate grounds for relevance, it does not explain how they are distinct. Indeed, both arguments rely on the same core assertion: that the market share statistics that Steves will use to establish its prima facie case are unreliable because they overstate CMI's future ability to compete given its weak financial condition. In other words, JELD-WEN is relying on the weakened competitor theory to show the relevance of this evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen.

Those cases imply that such evidence is admissible where it is relevant to a defendant's theory that the statistical evidence underlying the plaintiff's prima\n   facie case gives an inaccurate account of the acquired firm's future market share. Here, JELD-WEN's liability expert, Snyder, claimed that Shapiro's market share statistics were flawed because they did not account for CMI's financial weakness at the time of the merger in 2012. Consequently, evidence of CMI's weak financial state could conceptually be probative of an argument that JELD-WEN may make in rebuttal to Steves' prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But, the record does not take JELD-WEN beyond the conceptual. Instead, the manner in which JELD-WEN proposes to use Snyder's testimony is actually a backdoor into the weakened competitor defense, the components of which JELD-WEN simply has not satisfied.

Iowa 2009) (evidence that was inadmissible to show patent invalidity could not be introduced for purpose of rebutting defendant's arguments about prior art because of potential for confusing jury). Similarly, JELD-WEN seems to want the jury to decide the anticompetitive effects question based primarily on the evidence of CMI's financial condition, even though JELD-WEN is aware that it likely cannot establish-indeed, has not even pled-a failing firm or weakened company defense. Here the risk of jury confusion is high. This is a complex case, and evidence of marginal relevance cannot be used if it tends to confuse the jury. As a result, the risk of jury confusion from evidence about defenses not even pled, or minimally argued, substantially outweighs any marginal relevance the evidence would have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, PLAINTIFF STEVES AND SONS, INC.'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OR ARGUMENT THAT CMI WOULD HAVE EXITED THE DOORSKIN MARKET HAD IT NOT BEEN ACQUIRED BY JELD-WEN (ECF No. 499) will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Not all courts agree that this is \"an actual requirement of the failing company defense.\"\n    <em>\n     Sutter Health Sys.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136063\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/130/1109/#p1133\">\n     130 F.Supp.2d at 1135\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The evidence here seems to be that the owners of CMI did not want to reorganize because, in bankruptcy, the loans that they made to the company would not be recoupable. The record does not show that bankruptcy was not available.
