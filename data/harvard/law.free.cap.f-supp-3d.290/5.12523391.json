Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), the Court substitutes his successor as defendant.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   AMY BERMAN JACKSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") oversees multiple federal programs established by Congress to promote certain agricultural commodities. These programs are funded by \"checkoffs\"-mandatory assessments that producers and importers pay on the sale or import of the commodity. The assessments are used to pay for a range of activities, including research and marketing of the commodities, and they subsidize well-known advertising campaigns, such as \"Got Milk?,\" \"Beef: It's What's for Dinner,\" and \"The Incredible, Edible Egg.\" This case involves the pork checkoff program and the trademarks associated with the slogan \"Pork The Other White Meat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The National Pork Board (\"Board\" or \"NPB\") is a fifteen-member board appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture that is responsible for developing and administering the pork checkoff program. Plaintiffs in this case challenge the Secretary's decision to approve the Board's purchase of the trademarks associated with \"The Other White Meat\" campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Beginning in 2001 until it purchased the trademarks in 2006, the Board gained access to the trademarks through a licensing agreement with the National Pork Producers Council (\"NPPC\"), the private industry trade association that developed the trademarks. The fee for the exclusive license to\n   use the trademarks was one dollar per year, until 2004 when it increased to $818,000 per year. In 2006, with the Secretary's approval, the Board entered into an agreement to purchase the trademarks from NPPC for approximately $34.6 million (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), which it agreed to finance over twenty years at an interest rate of 6.75%, for a total cost of $60 million including interest. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Board agreed to pay NPPC $3 million annually for twenty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204801\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 4801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Pork Act\" or \"the Act\"), which established the pork checkoff program, the Secretary is required to approve the Board's annual budget each year. Through that process, the Secretary has approved the $3 million payment every year since the Board purchased the trademarks. In 2016, the agency undertook a review of the annual payments under the Purchase Agreement and reapproved the annual payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the Secretary's approval of the initial purchase of the trademarks and the subsequent approval of the annual payments under the Purchase Agreement on the grounds that they resulted in the use of pork checkoff dollars to influence legislation, which is prohibited by the Pork Act, and on the basis that the Secretary's actions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pending before the Court are plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, motion for summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and intervenor-defendant NPPC's motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   all of which are fully briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon review of the parties' submissions, the administrative record in this case, and the applicable law, the Court will grant in part and deny in part plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and grant in part and deny in part defendant's and intervenor-defendant's motions for summary judgment. The Court agrees with defendants that plaintiffs' challenge to the approval of the 2006 Purchase Agreement itself was untimely, and that their claims concerning the approval of any annual payments made in the past are moot. But the Court concludes that decision to continue to approve the annual payments based on the review of the Purchase Agreement that was undertaken in 2016 was arbitrary and capricious and unmoored from the facts and circumstances before the agency, so it will rule in favor of the plaintiffs on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Secretary approved spending $3 million per year for the purchase of the trademarks for another ten years based on an expert's determination of their replacement cost, that is, what it would cost to develop and market an entirely new promotional campaign today. But neither the\n   agency nor the expert adequately explains why this calculation sheds any light on what the 2016 review was supposed to ascertain: the current value of the set of four trademarks to the agency. The fundamental problem is that the three trademarks that include The Other White Meat slogan have been declared to be obsolete, and they have been retired from active use. So their value is minimal, or at best, undetermined. And the record contains no effort to ascertain the value of the fourth mark-the \"Pork and Design\" logo that consists of the word \"pork\" written across a blue triangular \"pork loin silhouette\"-at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Secretary's 2016 decision also fails to explain why it makes sense to predicate future payments on the cost of replacing The Other White Meat when the cost of replacing The Other White Meat has already been incurred. Moreover, while the agency states that the expert endeavored to calculate the value of the marks based upon the cost of developing a new trademark with the same level of effectiveness as the old trademarks, \"as measured by aided awareness studies of the percentage of people who are aware of the trademark,\" there is no data in the record underlying the expert's selection of 40% awareness as the target measure. The expert simply cut the high level of awareness garnered by The Other White Meat slogan in its heyday in half and calculated what it would cost to buy something else that effective now. But without any analysis of how much The Other White Meat still resonates in the consumer consciousness today, or, more important, whether the blue triangular logo has gained any traction in the market at all, this approach to quantifying \"current value\" is completely arbitrary and cannot pass muster under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

That review will include a valuation of TOWM and consideration of relevant materials that Plaintiffs have offered to submit by February 15, 2016 .... Plaintiffs will, by January 18, 2016, dismiss with prejudice the portion of their request for relief seeking retrospective relief, namely, their request for an order requiring Defendant \"to recover [ ] already distributed funds from NPPC,\" ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Stipulation at 1-2. Thereafter, plaintiffs dismissed their request for retrospective relief, Notice of Dismissal at 1, and the agency conducted its review. 2016 Review, AR 1-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues that these events rendered the challenges to all past payment approvals moot. Def.'s Mem. at 29. The Court agrees. Pursuant to the Stipulation, the agency undertook a fresh review of the Purchase Agreement, \"consistent with [defendant's] own independent judgment and authority,\" and the 2016 review included a new valuation of the trademarks as well as\n   consideration of materials submitted by the plaintiffs and the intervenor. Stipulation at 1. The parties agreed that regardless of its outcome, the 2016 Review would \"produce an administrative record that would facilitate the Court's ultimate resolution of any remaining issues in dispute.\" Stipulation at 2. As defendant points out in his memorandum, by \"reconsider[ing] and determin[ing] anew USDA policy with regard to continued payments\" under the Purchase Agreement, Def.'s Mem. at 29, the agency created a new administrative record which formed the basis for its 2016 decision to approve the annual payment and it intended to rely on that record going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Also pursuant to the Stipulation, plaintiffs withdrew their request \"to recover [ ] already distributed funds from NPPC.\" Stipulation at 2. The withdrawal narrowed the relief requested in Count I to a declaration that the approvals based on the 2006 record were unlawful and an injunction against future payments under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In light of these developments, the Court holds that the portion of Count I that was not untimely is moot. The issue of whether any annual approvals based solely on the 2006 record were arbitrary and capricious is moot because no\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   payments will be made based on the admittedly thin administrative record that was before the agency at that time; the approval of any further payments under the agreement will be based on the record of the 2016 Review alone. And since plaintiffs have withdrawn all claims for disgorgement of amounts that have already been paid, a declaration by the Court that the past approvals were arbitrary or contrary to law would be purely advisory and have no legal effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the same reasons, plaintiffs' challenges in Counts II and III to payments made after the Board abandoned The Other White Meat campaign are also moot with respect to any payments that preceded the 2016 Review. No\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   payment approvals will be based on the record existing in 2011 and 2012, and the issues of whether the agency should have terminated the agreement after it approved Board expenditures for a new advertising slogan presents a live controversy only as to future payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This does not end the matter, however, since the parties and the Court agree that there are some live controversies for the Court to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court Deems the First Amended Complaint to Challenge Future Payment Approvals based on the 2016 Review.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties' summary judgment briefs addressed not only the validity of the 2006 contract and the payment approvals through 2015, but also the decision made in 2016 to continue to pay for the trademarks in the future. Since the amended complaint filed in 2012 did not (and could not) challenge the 2016 Review, the Court asked the parties at the September 17, 2017 hearing whether they believed it was necessary to amend the complaint again to add allegations concerning the validity of ongoing annual payments based on the 2016 Review, or whether, in their view, the existing complaint encompassed this claim\n   that the parties had already briefed.

SRR valued the trademarks as of January 1, 2016 at $113 million to $132 million, while CONSOR valued them as of July 1, 2006 at $2.5 million to $17.6 million. 2016 Review, AR 4. The agency received a valuation from Cupitor of $175 million, along with two other valuations pre-dating the Board's purchase of the trademarks. Because the agency did not rely on these other valuations in making its decision, and it addressed only the SRR and CONSOR valuations in any detail,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 5, 8-9, the Court will address only the SRR and CONSOR valuations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   SRR used a cost approach to value the trademarks, citing \"problems with valuing the trademarks using an income or market approach and the availability of reliable data for use in the cost approach.\" AR 4. According to the 2016 decision, the expert aimed to determine the cost of replacing The Other White Meat trademarks by calculating \"the cost for an organization to develop a new trademark with the same level of effectiveness as measured by aided awareness studies of the percentage of people who are aware of the trademark.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 4. The agency explained the resulting valuation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"THE OTHER WHITE MEAT\" had an aided awareness of 82%, one of the most recognizable trademarks in the United States. SRR took into account the discontinued use of three trademarks in NPB's primary marketing campaign by modeling the replacement cost to achieve only 35% and 45% aided awareness. In calculating the replacement cost, SRR calculated the cost of four indications of value: expected costs of launching a new brand, slogan, or marketing campaign by a generic large company, NPB's cost to develop the \"Pork: Be Inspired\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   campaign, NPB's cost in the development and promotion of the Pork trademarks, and cost of other checkoff program marketing campaigns. SRR then weighed these four indications to calculate its final valuation range for the Pork trademarks at $113 million to $132 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   AR 4-5. The agency found this valuation helpful because it used \"four separate indications\" of the trademarks' value and weighed \"each indicia of value according to its usefulness to produce a single blended estimate.\" AR 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agency also examined CONSOR's critiques of SRR's valuation, and found them \"to be unpersuasive.\" AR 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The agency also considered CONSOR's competing valuation, which utilized a relief from royalty approach. AR 5. It found the valuation to be problematic for three reasons: (1) because CONSOR used the Board's revenues instead of the pork industry's revenues as the base against which to calculate the trademarks' potential royalty revenue; (2) because the valuation was calculated for 2006, not 2016; and (3) because the agency did not think the trademarks CONSOR used to calculate the royalty rate were comparable to the trademarks at issue here. AR 8 (stating that that the royalty rate derived from licensing agreements of American Animal Hospital Association, King Features Syndicate, Agway, Inc., Inc., and AT &amp; T would be considered speculative).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The agency considered plaintiffs' arguments against continuing the annual payments, including plaintiffs' assertions: that there should be no future payments in light of the Board's transition to a different ad campaign; the Board could obtain access to the trademarks at a lower price; and the original 2006 agreement was not negotiated at arms-length. AR 9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   After reviewing the valuations and the comments on them, the agency found SRR's valuation to be the \"most accurate and reliable of the valuations reviewed by AMS, and ... the best basis for deciding whether to approve continuing payments under the Contract at this time.\" AR 4. It also found that the Board's current uses of the trademarks-the fact that The Other White Meat slogan appears on the Board's website and in nutritional materials, and the fact that the \"pork\" and blue triangular design logo have been incorporated into the Be Inspired campaign-comport with the Act's purpose of promoting the pork industry.

Based on the agency's 2016 Review memorandum and the administrative record, the Court holds that defendant's decision to continue payments lacks the necessary rational connection between facts found and the choice to continue approving payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendant made two key findings in its 2016 decision: 1) that the continued use of the trademarks as currently utilized promotes the pork industry in furtherance of the Pork Act; and 2) that the value of the Pork trademarks as calculated by SRR is \"much greater than the cost of NPB's remaining payments under the Contract.\" AR 12. The record supports the conclusion that the Board still makes some use of The Other White Meat trademarks to promote the industry, even if only as a \"heritage brand.\" AR 218. Therefore, the Court agrees with defendant that the limited use that is being made is consistent with the statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   But the decision to approve future payments for the set of four trademarks based on SRR's valuation does not bear up under review for several reasons. First, the agency states that it undertook to ascertain \"the\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   value of the Pork trademarks.\" AR 3 (emphasis added). But the valuation it adopted to justify future payments is based on the cost of replacing a campaign that is no longer in use and that the agency has already paid to replace. So it is not clear how that calculation sheds light on the value of the three obsolete Other White Meat trademarks to the agency\n   <em>\n    today,\n   </em>\n   and it is not clear why the agency would predicate future payments based on replacement costs that have already been incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Second, the agency explains in its decision document that when its expert utilized this \"cost approach,\" it made an effort to calculate \"the cost for an organization to develop a new trademark with the same level of effectiveness as measured by aided awareness studies of the percentage of people who are aware of the trademark.\" AR 4. But the expert's analysis did not do that either. SRR based its calculation on what appears to be an arbitrary target level of consumer awareness-approximately 40%-that was arrived at without the benefit of any current research or statistical analysis. AR 5. The desired level of consumer awareness was derived simply by cutting the historic level of effectiveness attained by The Other White Meat slogan in half. AR 5. But the record contains no evidence of the effectiveness-and\n   certainly no evidence of the level of effectiveness \"as measured by aided awareness studies\"-of the only one of the four trademarks that the Board intends to use on an active basis: the Pork and Design logo consisting of the word \"pork\" on the so-called \"pork loin silhouette\"-a flat, blue triangular background. AR 3. Since the valuation failed to establish a logical connection between the price to be paid and the actual value of the trademarks to the agency today, it does not survive APA review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As noted at the start of this opinion, the 2006 Purchase Agreement involved the acquisition of four trademarks: \"PORK and Design,\" Reg. # 1418703; \"THE OTHER WHITE MEAT,\" Reg. # 1486548; \"THE OTHER WHITE MEAT and Design,\" Reg. # 3126072, and \"THE OTHER WHITE MEAT,\" Reg. # 3129186.

The record indicates there are no plans to return The Other White Meat trademarks to the active roster, AR 448-49; see also AR 225; at this point, the Board simply intends to continue its own limited use of The Other White Meat trademarks, to permit state associations use them for free, and to prevent others from infringing on them. AR 3, 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   It is true that the agency's expert made some effort to account for the diminished use of the complete set of trademarks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 225 (explaining that trademarks experience \"functional obsolescence\" as their ability to perform the function for which they were designed declines, causing their economic value to decline). But it is the incomplete and conclusory way the expert went about this that makes the resulting opinion unreliable. SRR took note of the high level of consumer awareness that The Other White Meat campaign had achieved (82.3% aided awareness in 2015), AR 265, and it stated that it expected this aided awareness to decrease to \"as low as approximately 1%.\" AR 219. Given those two points at either end of the spectrum, it selected the middle of the range between 1% and 80% as the foundation for its valuation. AR 226-27. To calculate the current value of the trademarks based on their replacement cost today, SRR estimated the cost of a \"replacement marketing campaign that would garner approximately 40% aided awareness.\" AR 226;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2016 Decision, AR 5 (\"SRR took into account the discontinued use of three trademarks in [the Board's] primary marketing campaign by modeling the replacement cost to achieve only 35% and 45% aided awareness.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The problem is that the expert's decision to split the difference between 82% and 1% was not based on any research or factual analysis, and the choice to land on either 35% or 45% was entirely arbitrary. In the absence of any explanation for the assumption that the marks had only experienced a 50% decline in value to date, and that it would take a mark with approximately 40% of aided awareness to replace them, the Court finds that the agency's endorsement of the expert's approach lacks a foundation in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   More important, the 82% figure that the agency's expert cut in half was a measure of the effectiveness of The Other White Meat campaign, including its slogan, but the only trademark the Board intends to use in any meaningful way in the future is the plain blue triangular shape that says \"pork\"-without any reference to the slogan. Thus, the Court has a concern that using 82% as a starting point unnecessarily inflated the outcome. The record contains no aided awareness studies of the percentage of consumers who are aware of the design standing alone; indeed, there is no evidence that any portion of the population recognizes the blue shape, even with the generic word \"pork\" italicized on it, in connection with the Board's promotional activities at all. And therefore, there is no basis in the record to support the conclusion that a valuation based on modeling the cost of replacing a campaign with a sizeable 40% level of awareness is an appropriate way to calculate the current value of the trademarks to the Board today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In other words, the agency purports to be basing its decision on the cost of creating a trademark with similar value-\"with the same level of effectiveness as measured by aided awareness studies,\" AR 4-but there was no effort made to ascertain whether the primary mark being used and paid for has\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   effectiveness or value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Moreover, while the Court is bound to defer to the experts' opinion that a cost approach is a generally accepted methodology for determining value, it finds the approach to be quite disconnected from the stated goal of the exercise in this particular case: to generate \"an independent valuation of the current value of the Pork trademarks.\" AR 3. SRR concluded that it took The Other White Meat brand seven to nine years to reach the level of 40% aided awareness, so it calculated the cost of developing a new campaign and promoting it for a period of seven years, and for nine. AR 226-27; AR 249-63 (calculating costs from 2016 to 2022 and from 2016 to 2024). \"Development costs\" include the costs of designing and producing marketing materials for television, print, internet, and direct marketing efforts, and \"promotional costs\" cover what the Board would have to spend to run those materials on those various media over the time period in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 249-51. The development and promotional costs utilized in SRR's calculation came from four sources: third parties, the Board's ongoing \"Be Inspired\" campaign, the prior Other White Meat campaign, and other checkoff programs. AR 224, 227-28. SRR weighted these costs, AR 229, and came up with two replacement cost estimates: $113 million to develop and promote a new campaign achieving 35% aided awareness for seven years, and $132 million to develop and promote a new campaign achieving 45% aided awareness for nine years. AR 232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   CONSOR and plaintiffs criticize a number of the decisions and assumptions that SRR made in its valuation. AR 156-85; Pls.' Opp. at 36-45 (arguing that using an investment value rather than a fair market value was improper, that consumer awareness is a poor indicator of value, that SRR incorrectly applied the royalty rate to the revenue of the entire pork industry in its relief from royalty test, and that the conclusion that the trademarks can generate revenues from future sale or licensing fees is speculative). But the Court has a more overarching concern, which is that the valuation is not based on the trademarks' current use as reflected in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   While replacement cost may be a legitimate approximation of the value of trademarks in use, and it made sense for the Board to look to replacement cost in 2006 when ascertaining the price it would pay NPCC for the marks it wanted to continue to use, replacement cost does not make sense as the measure of the value of intellectual property that has been shelved and that the Board has already paid to replace. The record does not explain why the cost to create a new campaign that\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be in use is a fair approximation of the value of retired marks that are not being used today. Nor does it explain why it makes sense to approve the ongoing expenditure of check-off funds based on the amount it would cost to replace the trademarks when the agency has already paid to replace those very trademarks. In effect, the Board is incurring the expense of replacing the trademarks for a second time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   When one couples the fact that the three distinctive and valuable trademarks that were purchased in 2006 are no longer in use, with the fact that the Board has already invested millions in developing and supporting a new campaign that incorporates only the fourth trademark-a logo with undetermined value, it is not logical\n   to assume that the current value of the three \"heritage\" trademarks plus the logo is the same as the cost of developing an entirely new campaign from scratch, even if SRR's experts accurately predicted what such an effort would involve. The expert does not explain why the methodology is valid under these circumstances, and 2016 decision does not grapple with these obvious deficiencies, and therefore, it ignores relevant evidence before the agency about the Board's current and expected use of the trademarks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El Rio Santa Cruz Neighborhood Health Ctr. v.
