ECF No. 7. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is one of many involving assistant managers employed by the Jimmy John's restaurant chain that are currently pending across the country. Jimmy John's is a sandwich shop brand with over 2,000 stores. Mot. \u00b6 3. Beginning in 2014, several Jimmy John's Assistant Store Managers (\"ASMs\") filed a number of lawsuits against various Jimmy John's entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. The defendants in those cases include the corporate Jimmy John's entities responsible for entering into franchise agreements, as well as the franchisees that own and operate stores where the plaintiffs worked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The cases were eventually consolidated into a nationwide collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Jimmy John's Overtime Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:14-CV-5509 (N.D. Ill. filed July 18, 2014). The plaintiffs in the consolidated action allege that the Jimmy John's corporate entities were their joint employer and that the plaintiffs were misclassified as exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirements. Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. The plaintiffs seek unpaid wages based on that alleged misclassification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff in this action, Eric Hart, is an opt-in plaintiff in the Illinois collective action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 28, 2017, he filed this separate collective action lawsuit against Defendant Donostia LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. Defendant is a New Mexico corporation that owns and operates various Jimmy John's franchises, including the one that employed Plaintiff as an ASM. Mot. \u00b6 6. In his Collective Action Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he and other ASMs employed by Defendant's franchises were improperly classified as exempt from overtime wages under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. Unlike the Northern District of Illinois litigation, the Jimmy John's corporate entities are not defendants in this case, and Defendant Donostia is not a party to the Illinois litigation. In this case, Plaintiff aims to hold Defendant liable as a direct employer rather than as a joint employer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To that end, Plaintiff seeks to recover unpaid wages for himself and other ASMs employed in Defendant's franchises.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant filed the instant Motion on June 15, 2017. ECF No. 7. In the Motion, Defendant argues that the first-to-file rule applies to this case such that dismissal or transfer to the Northern District of Illinois is required.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot. Plaintiff filed a Response to Defendant's Motion (\"Response\") on June 28, 2015, and Defendant filed a Reply to Plaintiff's Response (\"Reply\") on July 5, 2017. Resp., ECF No. 8; Reply, ECF No. 9. After the instant Motion became ripe to rule on, however, the parties filed a Joint Report of Parties Planning Meeting in which they asked that this case be stayed pursuant to an anti-suit injunction entered by the court in the\n   Northern District of Illinois. Report, ECF No. 11. The injunction enjoined plaintiffs in that case from filing separate suits elsewhere around the country or continuing to pursue suits that were already filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the Court stayed this lawsuit per the parties' request and administratively closed the case. Order, ECF No. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 14, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the anti-suit injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jimmy John's Overtime Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265944\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/756/#p771\">\n    877 F.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 771 (7th Cir. 2017).

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Taken together, the parties' filings essentially raise two issues: (1) whether this case substantially overlaps with the pending litigation in the Northern District of Illinois (\"the NDIL litigation\") such that the first-to-file rule is applicable; and (2) whether there are compelling circumstances that counsel against application of the rule. The Court addresses each of these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Substantial overlap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant argues that this case substantially overlaps with the NDIL litigation because the issues and parties involved are largely the same. Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 25-30. Concerning the parties, Defendant observes that the proposed class in this case is encompassed by the putative plaintiff class in the NDIL litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-29. Defendant further asserts that \"[t]he fact that plaintiffs' counsel did not name the exact same defendants in each action is of no moment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. As to the issues involved, Defendant argues that both cases center on \"whether unpaid overtime is owed to ASMs at Jimmy John's brand sandwich stores.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. According to Defendant, \"[t]he only distinction here is that Plaintiff must make a joint employer showing in [the NDIL litigation] to hold Jimmy John's liable, while in this case [Defendant] was his direct employer.\" Reply \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite the superficial appeal of Defendant's arguments, the Court remains unpersuaded that the two cases substantially overlap. Factors relevant to substantial overlap include whether \"the core issue\" in each case is the same and whether \"much of the proof adduced ... would likely be identical.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mexico Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3864263\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/671/#p678\">\n    665 F.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678 (5th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted) (alterations in original). Courts also consider the extent to which the cases involve the same parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Save Power\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285181\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/947/#p950\">\n    121 F.3d at 950-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Where the overlap between two suits is less than complete, the judgment is made case by case, based on such factors as the extent of overlap, the likelihood of conflict, the comparative advantage and the interest of each forum in resolving the dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Sweet Little Mexico Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3864263\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/671/#p678\">\n    665 F.3d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, the Court finds that the issues involved in each case are distinguishable. The core issue in this case is whether Defendant is liable for FLSA violations as Plaintiff's direct employer. By comparison, the core issue in the NDIL litigation is whether the Jimmy John's franchisor entities are liable for FLSA violations as Plaintiff's joint employer. As such, the allegations in this case primarily focus on acts taken by Defendant rather than acts taken by the franchisor entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BNSF Ry. Co. v. OOCL (USA), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6952830\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/667/703/#p709\">\n    667 F.Supp.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 709 (N.D. Tex. 2009) (concluding that two cases did not substantially overlap where the cases arose from the same events but involved allegations against different parties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Similarly, while the merits in each turn on whether Plaintiff was misclassified as exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA, the cases differ because the outcome of one is not necessarily dispositive of the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sweet Little Mexico Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3864263\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/671/#p678\">\n    665 F.3d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the core issue in two cases distinguishable where resolution of the second \"was not dependent on\" the outcome in the first). Under the FLSA, a person must qualify as an employer to be liable for FLSA violations.\n   <em>\n    Donovan v. Grim Hotel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"644166\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/966/#p971\">\n    747 F.2d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 971 (5th Cir. 1984). Additionally, an employee can have more than one employer, and each employer is \"individually and jointly\" liable for any FLSA violations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20791.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 791.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, even if Plaintiff prevails in the NDIL litigation, he can also recover from Defendant if Defendant's liability is established.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20791.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, should the franchisor entities not qualify as an employer under the joint-employer doctrine, Plaintiff could nevertheless prevail against Defendant as his direct employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20791.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, in addition to the difference between the issues presented in both cases, the parties involved in each case are different. Although the proposed class of plaintiffs in this case is a subset of the putative class in the NDIL litigation, Defendant has no involvement in the NDIL litigation. Therefore, this case is unlike other FLSA cases involving overlapping classes that are transferred pursuant to the first-to-file rule. In those cases, different plaintiffs seek to hold the same defendant liable for the same alleged violations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Granado v. Quality Energy Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. SA-15-CV-1061-XR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20705228\">\n    2016 WL 705228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D.

May 19, 2006) (same). Application of the rule in that context is sound because it is inefficient for two courts to determine one defendant's liability to the same class of plaintiffs based on the same conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kerotest Mfg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641386\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/180/#p183\">\n    342 U.S. at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641386\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/180/#p183\">\n    72 S.Ct. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Why, under the circumstances, should there be two litigations where one will suffice?\"). Here, on the other hand, the cases at issue involve the liability of separate defendants. While the Court is mindful that the Fifth Circuit made clear in\n   <em>\n    Save Power\n   </em>\n   that the first-to-file rule may still be applicable even where different defendants are involved in each action, the circumstances in that case were quite different than the circumstances here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Save Power\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285181\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/947/#p950\">\n    121 F.3d at 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There, both cases centered on the same issue and were filed in the same division, but the defendant in the second-filed action was not a party in the first-filed action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285181\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/947/#p950\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285181\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/947/#p950\">\n    at 948-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In concluding that the defendant's absence from the first-filed action did not \"undermine the appropriateness of transfer,\" the Fifth Circuit cited an earlier decision suggesting that the rule is still applicable \"where complete relief was nevertheless available in one forum and the missing parties probably could be made parties to the action in that forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285181\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/947/#p950\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 951 (citing\n   <em>\n    W.

When the Supreme Court first articulated the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kerotest Manufacturing Co. v.

The private interest factors are: (1) the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses; (3) the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858830\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/304/#p315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The public interest factors are: (1) the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; (2) the local interest in having localized interests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance of unnecessary problems of conflict of laws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858830\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/304/#p315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Applying these factors to the instant case, the Court finds that convenience favors this forum over the Northern District of Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Concerning the private interest factors, none weigh in favor of transfer. Even assuming the Court ultimately certifies Plaintiff's collective action, the parties involved in this case will include only the ASMs who worked in Defendant's stores, which are located in Texas and New Mexico. Mot. \u00b6 6. Consequently, all the events giving rise to this suit occurred in Texas and New Mexico. As a result, access to sources of proof is more straightforward here, and the cost of attendance will be less.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bascom v. Maxim Integrated Prod., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3634970\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/534/700/#p704\">\n    534 F.Supp.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (W.D.

Although Defendant's principle place of business is located in Las Cruces, its distance from the courthouse is less than fifty miles and well within the geographic range of compulsory process provided by Rule 45 for out-of-state third-party witnesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3634970\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/534/700/#p704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In any case, because the relevant events occurred in Texas and New Mexico, it is virtually certain that the range of compulsory process in the Northern District of Illinois is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v.

Tex. 2013) (concluding that the availability of compulsory process did not weigh in favor of transfer where it was inevitable that witnesses would have to travel more than 100 miles). Finally, regarding practical problems, courts usually consider concerns relating to judicial economy and overlap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adaptix, Inc. v.

Although court congestion is considered the \"most speculative\" factor,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3905576\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/937/867/#p876\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , statistics from the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts suggest that civil cases progress more quickly in the Western District of Texas then in the Northern District of Illinois.\n   <em>\n    See Federal Court Management Statistics\n   </em>\n   , Administrative Office of U.S. Courts (Dec. 2017), http://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/analysis-reports/federal-court-management-statistics. Moreover, because this case involves events that occurred in Texas, there are localized interests at stake that should be decided in this forum. While there are non-local interests involved as well in that Defendant is from New Mexico and members of the proposed class may reside there, those interests do not necessarily defeat\n   this forum's interest in adjudicating the case. At any rate, there is no apparent connection to the Northern District of Illinois.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858830\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/304/#p315\">\n    545 F.3d at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the local interest was greater where the relevant events occurred and witnesses were located).
