(Docket No. 52). On January 22, 2018, Defendants Medolac Laboratories a Public Benefit Corporation fka Neolac, Inc. dba Medolac (\"Medolac\"), Elena Taggart Medo (\"Medo\"), and Adrienne Weir (\"Weir\") (collectively, the \"Medo Defendants\") filed an Opposition. (Docket No. 62). On January 29, 2018, James River filed a Reply. (Docket No. 69). The Court has considered the papers filed on the Motion, and held a hearing on\n   <strong>\n    February 12, 2018\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The claims in the underlying\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action all arise out of the same conduct alleged to constitute a breach of contract, and therefore they are excluded from coverage under the Policy by the Breach of Contract Exclusion. The claims also all arise out of conduct excluded by the Business Conduct Exclusion. James River is entitled to reimbursement of defense costs and fees incurred from October 25, 2016, onward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   James River commenced this action arising out of an insurance coverage dispute on October 4, 2016.

(\"Prolacta\"), a competitor of Medolac, filed an action against Medolac's owner, Elana Medo, in Orange County Superior Court, titled\n   <em>\n    Prolacta Bioscience, Inc. v. Elena Taggart Medo, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 30-2015-00767116-CU-NP-CJC (the \"\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action\"). (Response to Statement of Genuine Issues of Fact (\"RSGIF\") No. 1 (Docket No. 73) ). Elena Medo is the CEO of the Delaware corporation, Medolac Laboratories a Public Benefit Corporation, formerly known as Neolac, which did business as Medolac. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 64). In that action, Prolacta filed First, Second, Third, and Fourth Amended Complaints, with the Fourth Amended Complaint filed on November 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nos. 2-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 8, 2015, Medo tendered her defense to the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action to James River. Her tender included the Complaint and First Amended Complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action, as well as a copy of a cease-and-desist letter dated December 19, 2014 and a Termination and Release Agreement dated February 26, 2009. (RSGIF Nos. 6-7). At the time of the tender, the First Amended Complaint was the operative Complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action. It alleged seven causes of action: (1) Conversion; (2) Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; (3) Unfair Competition ( Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ); (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Breach of Contract-Nondisclosure Agreement; (6) Breach of Contract-Termination Agreement; and (7) Violation of Uniform Trade Secrets Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nos. 8-9). The Fourth Amended Complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action, which is the operative complaint as of the date of this Motion, alleges nine claims for relief, adding claims for Civil Conspiracy and Vicarious Liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nos. 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Fourth Amended Complaint, as in the First Amended Complaint, Prolacta alleges that it is a research-driven private company dedicated to advancing the science of human milk for critically ill premature infants. (RSGIF No. 14). It further alleges Medo was one of its founding members, with access to confidential and proprietary information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 15). Prolacta alleges that on February 16, 2006, Medo signed on a Non-Disclosure Agreement by which Medo agreed not to solicit Prolacta employees to leave the company for twelve months following Medo's separation from Prolacta and not to divulge confidential information owned by Prolacta. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nos. 16-18). Prolacta also alleges that Medo signed a Termination Agreement effective February 26, 2009, by which she agreed not to use confidential information or disparage Prolacta. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nos. 19, 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prolacta further alleges in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action that after leaving Prolacta, Medo started a new company that competes with Prolacta. In promoting her new business, Medo is alleged to have \"disparaged\" Prolacta to Prolacta employees and customers by \"expressing that [Prolacta] products are inferior to [Medo's] products, that [Prolacta] was unethical, poorly managed, did not promote women, and would fail because it was ran by greed and because it did not follow her advice.\" (RSGIF Nos. 23-24. 27-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prolacta alleges that in December 2014, it discovered that Medo was \"utilizing proprietary and confidential [Prolacta] data\", and \"was disparaging [Prolacta] to its customers and potential customers in an attempt to solicit customers and/or [Prolacta] employees.\" (RSGIF Nos. 25-26). Prolacta alleged that it demanded Medo to stop, but that she refused to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 29-30). Prolacta alleges this conduct to be in breach of the Termination Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nos. 33-34, 45-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     James River Insurance Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   James River issued Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy No. 00063565-0 to Neolac dba Medolac, effective August 23, 2014 to August 23, 2015, with Personal and Advertising Injury Liability limits of $1,000,000 (the \"Policy\"). The Policy was received and accepted at Medolac's offices in Lake Oswego, Oregon. (RSGIF Nos. 47, 65, 67). The Policy was amended to add Medolac Laboratories, with a retroactive date of December 23, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With respect to Coverage B under the Policy, James River promised as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking damages for 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance does not apply....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (RGS No. 49). The Policy defines \"Personal and advertising injury\" in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   injury, including consequential 'bodily injury', arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   d.

'Personal and advertising injury' arising out of a breach of contract, except an implied contract to use another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement'.\" (RSGIF No. 51). The Policy also contains the following Business Conduct Exclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   This insurance does not apply to any claim or 'suit' arising out of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b) any actual or alleged infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, right of publicity, slogan, trade dress, trade secret or other intellectual property rights; whether or not in your 'advertisement';\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (c) any actual or alleged false advertising, false designation of origin, product disparagement, trade libel, or other claims arising out of unfair competition, whether or not in your 'advertisement'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiff in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action has never alleged facts asserting claims for bodily injury or property damage that would potentially be covered under Coverage A of the Policy, and the Medo Defendants do not contend that James River has or ever had a duty to defend the Medo Defendants under Coverage A. (RSGIF Nos. 53-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Defense of the\n     <em>\n      Prolacta\n     </em>\n     Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On August 31, 2015, James River agreed to provide Medo with a defense to the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action subject to a written reservation of rights. (RSGIF No. 55). The written reservation of rights stated that James River was reserving the right to \"deny coverage for all or part of the claims\" against Medo, and withdraw from the defense upon notice affording Medo a reasonable opportunity to protect her interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 97). On October 25, 2016, James River issued a Supplemental Reservation of Rights in which it sought to reserve the right to defend Medo in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action while simultaneously seeking declaratory relief, including reimbursement of defense fees and costs going forward from the date of the Complaint in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 56). At the time that James River filed this action on October 4,\n   2016, James River's appointed attorney had been representing Medo in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action for about a year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No. 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On February 27, 2017 and May 8, 2017, James River issued additional Supplemental Reservations of Rights in which it agreed to provide a defense to Medolac and Weir on the same basis as it was providing a defense to Medo. (RSGIF No. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Medo has been defended in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action by a lawyer appointed by James River since September 2015. (RSGIF No. 81). In answering Prolacta's complaints, Medo has consistently denied liability for breach of contract, and has asserted an affirmative defense that Prolacta first breached the Termination Agreement, which discharged Medo's duty to perform.

James River also moves for partial summary judgment on its Second Claim for Relief, under which it seeks a judicial declaration that James River has a right to reimbursement of the attorneys' fees and costs it has expended in defense of the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action from October 4, 2016 onward, the amount of which would be determined at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   James River argues that coverage is unavailable under the Policy's Breach of Contract Exclusion and Business Conduct Exclusion. (Mot. at 9-20). In Opposition,\n   the Medo Defendants argue that neither exclusion forecloses coverage. (Opp. at 4-23). The Medo Defendants also argue that the Motion violates the Court's Stay Order (Docket No. 43), issued on June 15, 2017, because the Motion relies on evidence other than the underlying complaints and insurance policy documents. (Opp. at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Stay Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court addresses the Medo Defendants' argument that that James River's Motion violates the Stay Order, and that the Court should therefore deny the Motion or exclude from consideration all of the evidence on which James River improperly relies. (Opp. at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the Stay Order, the Court noted that the determination of whether an insurance company has a duty defend turns on the facts known by the insurer at the commencement of that suit and tender of its defense by the insured, not the ultimate result of the underlying lawsuit, and so discovery would be unnecessary in this action. (Stay Order at 7). Accordingly, pursuant to its inherent power to control its docket and in the interest of increased efficiency, the Court entered a \"stay of discovery in this action pending any motion for summary judgment that either party shall bring.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court further noted that \"[i]f James River believes it can secure a favorable result as a matter of law, based on a comparison of the operative Second Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   and the language of the Policy, the Court will consider those arguments in a properly noticed motion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As James River argues, the Stay Order simply stayed discovery. (Reply at 3). The Court did not intend to limit the parties' reliance on evidence of \"those facts known by the insurer at the commencement of that suit and tender of its defense by the insured.\" Documents that were submitted with Medo's tender of defense, such as the Termination Agreement, are obviously relevant to those facts. James River's reservation of rights letters are also relevant to the determination of James River's Second Claim for Relief, and the Medo Defendants themselves rely on them in Opposition. (Opp. at 24-25). The parties do not appear to otherwise dispute the authenticity or admissibility of this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court rejects the Medo Defendants' argument that James River has violated the Stay Order, and proceeds to consider the Motion on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Choice of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In their Opposition, the Medo Defendants argue that, under California choice-of-law rules, Oregon substantive law applies to interpretation of the Policy because Oregon is where the insured risk was located when the Policy issued, and Oregon is where the Policy was made. (Opp. at 4-5). In its Reply, James River argues that, by invoking California law in support of their Motion to Stay, the Medo Defendants have waived the choice-of-law issue, and that, in any case, California law applies. (Reply at 4). Ultimately, both parties claim that they should prevail under either California or Oregon law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 2; Reply at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court observes that, although it previously applied federal law to the procedural question of whether a stay was warranted, it observed in the course of that application that California law controlled the resolution of substantive issues. (Stay Order at 3). However, because the question of which state's substantive law to apply was not squarely before the Court at that time, the Court will consider the question now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"To determine the applicable substantive law, a federal court sitting in diversity applies the choice-of-law rules of the forum.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Narayan v.

Cal. June 4, 2012). The district court concluded that California law applied to the insurance declaratory relief action in which, as here, the insurer mounted a defense on behalf of an out-of-state insured. Although the policy at issue was issued and signed in Florida to a Florida company, and identified Florida as the location from which the products at issue in the underlying action were shipped, the district\n   court nonetheless concluded that \"[n]one of these facts are relevant, however, because '[a] defense obligation ... \"entails the rendering of a service, viz., the mounting and funding of a defense\".' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Frontier Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699424\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/153/1436/\">\n    153 Cal.

The district court held that it could be inferred from the nature of the policy, the endorsement, and the surrounding circumstances that the insurer would \"perform its contractual duty to defend ... in California.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, the Medo Defendants point to the fact that the Policy identifies the location of the insured as \"Lake Oswego, OR,\" where the insured's office, laboratory, and processing facility are located. (Opp. at 6). Because the \"insured risk\" was identified as located in Oregon, the Medo Defendants argue that, under\n   <em>\n    Frontier Oil\n   </em>\n   , Oregon law must apply. Moreover, to the extent no \"place of performance\" is indicated by the Policy, the Medo Defendants argue that the Policy was \"made\" in Oregon because that is where the Medo Defendants received and accepted the Policy. Therefore, under section 1646, Oregon law must apply. (Opp. at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For its part, James River points to the Termination Agreement Medo signed, which contains a choice of law and forum selection provisions requiring the Agreement to be governed by California law, and for any action with respect to the Agreement to be brought in a court located in Orange County, California. (Reply at 6). Medo entered the Termination Agreement prior to the inception of the James River Policy, and she provided the Agreement to James River when she tendered her defense to the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action. Before James River agreed to assume her defense, Medo's own attorney had already filed an answer in Orange County Superior Court. Accordingly, James River argues that Medo and James River would have anticipated any lawsuit arising out of the Termination Agreement to be litigated in California. (Reply at 6-7). Under\n   <em>\n    Frontier Oil\n   </em>\n   , James River argues, the \"surrounding circumstances\" indicate Medo's knowledge and intent for James River to defend her in California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At the hearing, the Medo Defendants pointed to factual distinctions between\n   <em>\n    Frontier Oil\n   </em>\n   , in which the California Court of Appeal determined that California law applied, and the circumstances here. Namely, in\n   <em>\n    Frontier Oil\n   </em>\n   , the insured was a California company with operations in California. The Medo Defendants also distinguished\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund\n   </em>\n   , which involved not only a Florida-based insured, but an additional insured located in California. In contrast, the Medo Defendants argued, Medolac has no operations in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Medo Defendants also posed a hypothetical example at the hearing. They suggested that an insured might rent a car upon arriving at an airport, and that the car rental agreement might include a choice of law provision. Would that mean that the insured expected to be sued and defended by the insurer wherever that choice of law provision indicated? The crucial distinction between that hypothetical and the circumstances of this case is that Medo entered the Termination Agreement\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   she obtained the Policy. Moreover, no evidence has been presented that the Medo Defendants do routinely enter into contracts with forum selection or choice of law provisions. The evidence demonstrates that, at the time Medo entered the Policy, she knew any defense James River might mount for her in regard to the Termination Agreement would take place in California only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court concludes that, although the Policy does not expressly specify a place of performance, the surrounding circumstances indicate that the parties expected\n   and intended that James River would perform its duty to defend in California. Accordingly, California law should apply to interpret the Policy. This conclusion is troubling, because, if taken to its logical extreme, it indicates that a policy might be interpreted according to different bodies of law depending on where each defense pursuant to the policy was performed. That was the point behind the rental-car hypothetical. Again, the not-entirely-satisfactory answer is that, on the very specific facts of this action, the parties\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   anticipate a California defense-and not as a hypothetical possibility, but as a concrete reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court further notes, as do both parties, that the results of this Motion would likely be the same under either California or Oregon law, despite any potential differences in the substantive law, discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Duty to Defend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The parties appear to agree that, if the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action is covered by the Policy at all, it is covered pursuant to Coverage B, \"Personal and Advertising Injury\", under the definition of \"Personal and advertising injury\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Mot. at 9-10; Opp. at 16; Stipulated MSJ Ex. 1-035 (Docket No. 56-1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   However, James River argues that it has no duty to defend the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action under Coverage B because Medo's alleged breach of the Termination Agreement precludes coverage under the Breach of Contract Exclusion, and the Business Conduct Exclusion precludes coverage for Medo's alleged conduct.

Indeed, because no discovery has been conducted in this action, the only \"extrinsic\" evidence relied upon here is the Termination Agreement and the Reservation of Rights letters. Prolacta expressly pleads breach of the Termination Agreement in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action, and the Reservation of Rights letters are only relevant to the reimbursement question, not the interpretation of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Medo Defendants argue that Weir and Medolac were not parties to the Termination Agreement, and therefore the Breach of Contract Exclusion cannot foreclose coverage for them. (Opp. at 16-17). Indeed, it is undisputed that Medolac and Weir were not signatories to the Termination Agreement, and they were not added as defendants in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action until the Third Amended Complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action.

The Third and Fourth Amended Complaints in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action allege that Medo, Weir, and Medolac are all sued as \"agents or employees\" of one another. The allegations against Weir and Medolac \"arise out of\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   the exact same allegations of disparagement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Medo Defendants also argue that the Breach of Contract Exclusion cannot foreclose coverage because Medo could be held liable in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action for her disparagement of Prolacta without being liable for breach of contract. (Opp. at 17). In the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action, one of the grounds for Medo's denial of breach of contract claims is that Prolacta breached the Termination Agreement first by bringing the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action in violation of the Agreement's broad release of claims, thus discharging Medo of any duty to perform the Agreement under both California and Oregon law.

The question is whether the alleged conduct \"arises out of\" the conduct underlying the breach of contract claim, as described above. \"The issues here are what facts [James River] knew at the time appellants tendered the defense of the [\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action], both from the allegations on the face of the third party complaint, and from extrinsic information available to it at the time; and whether these known facts created a potential for coverage under the terms of the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunderson v.

The conduct underlying all of the claims, including Weir and Medolac's alleged conduct, therefore has its \"origin in\", \"grows out of\", or \"has connection with\" the conduct underlying the alleged breach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Cas.

Business Conduct Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Alternatively, James River argues that Prolacta's allegations that Medo's disparaging statements harmed Prolacta, which are the allegations that could trigger Coverage B, describe conduct excluded from coverage under the Business Conduct Exclusion, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   This insurance does not apply to any claim or 'suit' arising out of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (b) any actual or alleged infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, right of publicity, slogan, trade dress, trade secret or other intellectual property rights; whether or not in your 'advertisement';\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (c) any actual or alleged false advertising, false designation of origin, product disparagement, trade libel, or other claims arising out of unfair competition, whether or not in your 'advertisement'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (Mot. at 14-15).

(Reply at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   James River thus argues, to the extent Prolacta's claims \"arise out of\" Medo's misappropriation of trade secrets (which is also alleged to be in breach of her Termination Agreement and Non-Disclosure Agreement), they are precluded from coverage by Subsection (b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hon.

The Medo Defendants point to no cases indicating a different rule under Oregon law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Medo Defendants argue that the doctrines of waiver and estoppel preclude summary judgment on James River's claim\n   for reimbursement. (Opp. at 24). They claim that the original Reservations of Rights letter, dated August 31, 2015, failed to reserve the right to seek reimbursement. Rather, by that letter, James River agreed to defend Medo, and merely reserved the right to \"deny coverage for all or part of the claims against Ms. Medo, and to withdraw from the defense of Ms. Medo if it is determined that the policies do not provide coverage for the claims alleged in the above-referenced lawsuit.\" (Declaration of Elena Medo \u00b6 19, Ex. 4 (Docket No. 64-4) ). Moreover, the Medo Defendants argue that Medo relied on the representations in that initial Reservations of Rights letter by accepting the services of the attorney chosen by James River. (Opp. at 25; Declaration of Elena Medo \u00b6\u00b6 18-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As James River points out, it does not seek reimbursement of defense fees and costs incurred from the date of the initial Reservation of Rights to the filing of this action. It only seeks reimbursement for defense fees and costs incurred from the date this action was filed onward. (Reply at 25). The Medo Defendants admit that James River's second, or supplemental, Reservation of Rights letter, dated October 25, 2016, explicitly stated that James River was reserving a right to seek reimbursement of the attorneys' fees and costs. (Declaration of Elena Medo \u00b6 22). Indeed, the letter states, \"While James River will continue to pay for your defense to the Prolacta Action, if the Court confirms that James River is correct, James River will seek reimbursement of the attorney's fees and costs it expends from this point forward.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 5 (Docket No. 64-5) ). When Weir and Medolac were added to the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action as defendants, James River sent additional Supplemental Reservations of Rights regarding its defense of them, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Accordingly, even if James River did waive the right to seek, or is estopped from seeking, reimbursement of fees from August 31, 2015 to the date of the letter,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , October 25, 2016, those fees are not at issue here. As of October 25, 2016, Medo was on notice that James River had filed a lawsuit and would seek reimbursement of the fees if the Court determined no coverage was available for the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action. Indeed, Medo admits that as of her receipt of that supplemental reservation of rights letter, she acted \"more proactively\" in the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   litigation by requesting copies of bills and communications from her James River-appointed attorney. (Declaration of Elena Medo \u00b6 25). If Medo did rely to her detriment on the representations in the original Reservations of Rights letter, she only can claim any such detrimental reliance until receipt of the October 25, 2016 letter. The evidence demonstrates that James River clearly reserved its right to seek reimbursement as of the date of the Supplemental Reservation of Rights letter, but not the date it filed this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   At the hearing, the Medo Defendants argued that there are disputed facts regarding waiver and estoppel such that whether James River has reserved its right to reimbursement cannot be decided on this Motion. However, the assertion of waiver and estoppel is not the same as presenting evidence of the defenses. In the insurance context, the California Supreme Court has held, \"The burden ... is on the party claiming a waiver of a right to prove it by clear and convincing evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1960673\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/11/1/#p19\">\n    11 Cal. 4th 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20370\">\n    44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=900%20P.2d%20619\">\n    900 P.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (finding no waiver where insured presented no evidence that insurer's letter indicated an intention to relinquish a right). As for estoppel, \"proof of estoppel requires a showing of detrimental reliance by the injured party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20370\">\n    44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=900%20P.2d%20619\">\n    900 P.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no estoppel\n   where insured did not show how they relied to their detriment on insurer's letter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The undisputed evidence shows that James River assumed the defense of the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   action on August 31, 2015, subject to a reservation of the right to \"deny coverage for all or part of the claims\" against Medo, and withdraw from the defense. The evidence further shows that on October 25, 2016, James River sent a Supplemental Reservation of Rights letter under which it explicitly reserved the right to seek reimbursement of the attorneys' fees and costs if a court determined there had never been a duty to defend. The evidence also shows that, upon receipt of the October 25, 2016 letter, Medo acted \"more proactively\" after learning that James River \"might claim reimbursement.\" No evidence of any detrimental reliance from the period of October 25, 2016 onwards is presented. No evidence of an intention to relinquish a right is presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In sum, no facts are presented indicating a factual dispute regarding whether James River waived its right to reimbursement of defense fees incurred from October 25, 2016 onward, or whether James River is estopped from seeking such reimbursement. Moreover, the Medo Defendants have pointed to no discovery that might uncover such facts pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). It is hardly surprising that there is no reference to Rule 56(d), considering the circumstances here. The only detrimental reliance the Medo Defendants suggest is, essentially, that Medo would have hired some other attorney if she did not rely on James River's initial Reservation of Rights letter. However, no specific facts are presented in this regard; in particular, the Medo Defendants have not proven-indeed, have not asserted-that the carrier-selected lawyers have been particularly expensive. There no doubt will be some expense and disruption in hiring new lawyers, but that is inherent in allowing a reservation of rights at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Accordingly, because the Court concludes that James River had no duty to defend the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action, it likewise concludes that it is entitled to reimbursement of fees and costs incurred in defense of the\n   <em>\n    Prolacta\n   </em>\n   Action from\n   <strong>\n    October 25, 2016\n   </strong>\n   onward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to James River's claim for reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Per the Court's Order Vacating and Modifying Scheduling Order, issued on November 13, 2017, within five days of the filing of this Order, the parties shall file a Joint Report listing new dates for expert disclosures, rebuttal expert disclosures, and so on. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   It is the Court's understanding that, while the Motion is for partial summary judgment, the only remaining factual issue is the amount of reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
