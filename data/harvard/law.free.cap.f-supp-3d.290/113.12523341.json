WOODLOCK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff Exergen's initiative in bringing this patent infringement litigation has proven counterproductive. The case occasioned my decision to hold the asserted claims 51 and 54 of the '938 patent invalid.\n   <em>\n    Exergen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brooklands, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065068\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/125/307/\">\n    125 F.Supp.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2015). Exergen, nevertheless, undertook to continue the litigation by seeking a determination that it did not commit inequitable conduct with respect to obtaining the invalid patent claims in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before reaching the issue of inequitable conduct, I consider it prudent to address the question whether the prior determination of invalidity should foreclose further litigation. After consideration of the parties' submissions on that question and analysis of answers found in Federal Circuit case law, I have determined that the question of inequitable conduct is not categorically moot in this case. As a consequence, it seems the better part of discretion to address the question of inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Turning to the merits of the issue of inequitable conduct, I conclude that plaintiff Exergen is entitled to summary judgment. That determination now marks the conclusion of this case in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Procedural Posture\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 4, 2012, Exergen Corporation initiated this patent infringement action against Brooklands for alleged infringement of claims 51 and 54 of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C787%2C938\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,787,938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ('938 patent). Brooklands asserted affirmative defenses under:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unpatentable subject matter), \u00a7 102 (anticipation), and \u00a7 103 (obviousness). Brooklands also asserted a counterclaim against Exergen seeking declaratory judgment that the '938 patent is unenforceable because of inequitable conduct. Brooklands moved for summary judgment on its affirmative defenses and on August 28, 2015, I granted Brooklands summary judgment under \u00a7 101 finding that the asserted claims 51 and 54 of the '938 patent involved unpatentable subject matter.\n   <em>\n    Exergen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065068\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/125/307/\">\n    125 F.Supp.3d at 312-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the core substantive question in the case-patent infringement-was effectively\n   resolved by the finding of invalidity, Exergen pressed on in opposition to Brooklands' inequitable conduct counterclaim by filing the motion for summary judgment now before me. After I raised the question of mootness, Exergen reversed course and argued that the case should be terminated without reaching the question of inequitable conduct. Brooklands, for its part, continued to maintain it was entitled to resolution of the inequitable conduct question on the merits. In order to put the issues in context, an elaboration of the factual and procedural development of this patent litigation is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Francisco Pompei is the founder and CEO of Exergen and has patented numerous products, in addition to being the named inventor of the '938 patent. I begin by discussing Exergen's related patents, of which the '938 patent was a continuation, and then examine the facts surrounding prosecution of the '938 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Dr. Pompei was the named inventor on both of these patents. Both patents describe a \"heat balance method\" in the context of an ear thermometer device. Both also include broader claims, such as Claim 7 of the '813 patent :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A radiation detector comprising: a thermopile mounted to view a\n   <em>\n    target of biological surface\n   </em>\n   tissue; a temperature sensor for sensing ambient temperature; an electronic circuit coupled to the thermopile and temperature sensor and responsive to the voltage across the thermopile and the temperature sensed by the sensor to provide an indication of an\n   <em>\n    internal temperature within the biological tissue\n   </em>\n   adjusted for the ambient temperature to which the surface tissue is exposed; and a display for providing an indication of the internal temperature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Claim 36 of the '238 patent is similarly broad:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A temperature detector comprising: a radiation sensor mounted\n   <em>\n    to view a target\n   </em>\n   ; a temperature sensor for sensing ambient temperature; an electronic circuit coupled to the radiation sensor and temperature sensor and responsive to a signal from the radiation sensor and the temperature sensed by the temperature sensor to provide an indication of an\n   <em>\n    internal temperature of the target\n   </em>\n   adjusted for the ambient temperature to which the target is exposed; and an output for providing an indication of the internal temperature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    2. '435 Patent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 2, 2000, Dr. Pompei was issued U.S. Patent 6,056,435 ('435 patent). The '435 patent, and the related family of patents, claimed a device for detecting internal body temperature in the armpit area. This patent does not assert temperature measurements in the forehead or temporal artery; it recites some claims that extend more broadly. For example, claim 16 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A body temperature detector comprising: a radiation sensor which views a\n   <em>\n    target surface area\n   </em>\n   of a body; and electronics which compute an internal temperature of the body as a function of an ambient temperature and a sensed surface temperature, wherein the ambient\n   temperature within the function is an assumed ambient temperature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    3. Prior Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Exergen previously brought suit against forehead thermometer manufacturers in\n   <em>\n    Exergen Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-cv-11306-RCL (D. Mass). There, Exergen asserted that defendants' thermometers infringed the broad claims of the '813 patent, the '435 patent (within the '813 patent family), the '238 patent, the '205 patent (within the '813 patent family), and '685 patent (predecessor to the '938 patent ). In\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart\n   </em>\n   , Judge Lindsay conducted a hearing on claim construction of claim 7 of the '813 patent and construed the terms \"biological surface tissue\" to mean \"a living layer of external human tissue having a temperature that can be measured,\" and \"internal temperature\" to mean \"temperature of the region existing beneath the surface of the biological tissue targeted for measurement.\"\n   <em>\n    Exergen Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-cv-11306-RCL at 5-10 (D. Mass filed Jul. 14, 2004). At the conclusion of the\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart\n   </em>\n   jury trial, the jury found that Exergen had proved the defendants infringed the '813, '205, and '685 patents which the jury considered valid. The Federal Circuit, however, overturned the jury's determinations that the '813 and '685 patents were infringed and that the '205 patent was not invalid.\n   <em>\n    Exergen Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035540\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1312/#p1331\">\n    575 F.3d 1312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1331 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Exergen Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kids-Med, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125540\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/237/\">\n    189 F.Supp.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

In\n   <em>\n    Kids-Med\n   </em>\n   , I construed the term \"target surface area\" as used in the '435 patent to differ from the term \"target of biological surface area\" used in the '813 patent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125540\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125540\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/237/\">\n    at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both patents describe how to obtain body temperature measurements on unprotected body sites, such as the forehead. Attorney James Smith prosecuted the '938 patent. Attorney Smith is an experienced patent practitioner who was admitted to the U.S. Patent Bar in the 1970s and has spent his career performing patent prosecution work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In prosecuting the '685 patent, Exergen submitted an Information Disclosure Statement, which disclosed the '813, '238 patents. In its January 8, 2008 submission that led to the '938 patent, Exergen disclosed in its Information Disclosure Statement a lengthy list of patents, including the '813, '238, '435, and '685 patents. During the '938 patent prosecution, Attorney Smith argued that the '813 patent does not \"teach[ ] or suggest[ ] measuring temperature of a region of the forehead,\" and that \"obtaining measurements of a region of skin of the forehead is not an obvious extension\" of the '813 patent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Exergen's argument hinges on this narrow reading; it argues that Brooklands' counterclaim for declaratory judgment of unenforceability of the '938 patent is moot because asserted claims 51 and 54 of the patent were deemed invalid through a motion for summary judgment proceeding, in which the terminated claims were not fully litigated and there was no meaningful progress toward trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Consequently, I turn now to focus more closely on cases involving patents that were held invalid-as asserted claims 51 and 54 of the '938 patent were here-prior to the court's consideration of inequitable conduct.

When, in sequencing the development of a case raising invalidity, a claim of inequitable conduct does not loom large in the critical path, resolving that claim can reasonably be deferred while other grounds of invalidity are explored and resolved. If that exploration leads to a resolution of invalidity, further resources of the parties and the court need not be expended in order to pursue an inchoate attorney fees claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

R. Civ. P. 16, a trial court should be alert to sequencing the development of the case to serve the essential purposes of the Rules of Civil Procedure as expressed in Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 : the securing of a \"just, speedy and\n   inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\" The extended and redundant consideration of multiple grounds for invalidity of a patent can produce delayed and costly determination of a patent case when the case has become moot before such alternate grounds are developed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In this case, I was not sufficiently alert to the problem of delay and expense created when the parties heedlessly marched on to explore alternate grounds for invalidity after invalidity had been established. A more effective case management would have brought this case to final judgment without further proceedings after invalidity had been established. Having failed to recognize the need for aggressive management, I have concluded that I should now, in deference to the parties' initial choice to proceed to address inequitable conduct, resolve that issue even though treating it as moot might be a more appropriate exercise of my equitable discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In the '938 prosecution, Exergen disclosed to the PTO numerous litigation documents concerning the\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kids-Med\n   </em>\n   cases in a supplemental disclosure statement to the PTO. Additionally, both parties agree that the '813 patent was explicitly discussed with the Examiner, and the examiner stated that temperature measurements of \"a region of skin of the forehead\" are not an obvious extension of the '813 patent. The examiner also distinguished the '813 patent from the '938 patent by stating that the \"tympanic membrane is a protected area and as such is less impacted by variations of temperature\"; by contrast, he observed that \"the forehead has variable blood flow and is an exposed, unprotected, and temperature dependent region.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Exergen's primary argument for summary judgment of no inequitable conduct is that \"characterizing the scope of these patents was simply attorney argument that cannot constitute inequitable conduct.\" There are several cases that support the proposition that a \"patent examiner [is] capable of independently evaluating the material before him,\" so, \"the representations as to how to interpret that material cannot be the basis for a finding of inequitable conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Beckman Instruments Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LKB Produkter\n   </em>\n   , AB, No. R-85-3133,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%20125109\">\n    1987 WL 125109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.

Brooklands argues that there is still a genuine question of material fact concerning intent, but it has failed to adduce any evidence that could make deceptive intent the single most reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Exergen argues, and Brooklands fails to rebut with any evidence, that Dr. Pompei and Attorney Smith believed the prior art to be immaterial or already adequately disclosed. A discussion of items that Brooklands claims that Exergen should have disclosed puts the argument in focus. Beginning with patents that disclose measuring surface temperatures:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%204%2C566%2C808\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 4,566,808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   discloses heat loss and temperature differences for buildings, plumbing, machinery, as well as animals and humans to detect inflammation or lack of circulation; 5,017,019 discloses a radiation detector that provides differential temperature readings for animals and humans, and describes scanning the leg of a horse to detect injury; RE 35,554 discloses a radiation detector that detects temperature across a surface with a temperature display and discusses infrared inspection of electrical equipment; 4,626,686 discloses a \"variable field of view heat scanner\"; and 4,797,840 discloses an infrared thermometer for medical use and use on the human body. Exergen argues that there is no evidence that Dr. Pompei or Attorney Smith considered these any more relevant than other provided disclosures, which included\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%204%2C636%2C091%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 4,636,091,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   a patent that describes a device used to measure the surface temperature anywhere on the skin surface of a patient. Under the circumstances, there is no evidence that the single most reasonable inference to be drawn here is the intent to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Next, Exergen discusses the ear thermometer patents that were not disclosed, including:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C047%2C205%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,047,205,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which discloses a method of detecting the temperature of biological tissue; 5,325,863, which describes a radiation detector for body temperature; 5,469,855, which discloses a continuous temperature measurement device; and 4,602,642, which discloses an apparatus for measuring body temperature utilizing infrared emissions by taking measurements across a surface. In addition, there are two other patents that Brooklands claims Exergen should have submitted in the '635 patent prosecution:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%204%2C317%2C998%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 4,317,998,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which discloses a scanning radiation detecting apparatus; and 4,784,149, which is an infrared thermometer designed to measure the temperature of tissue of a body cavity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Exergen argues that no intent can be established because other patents-such as the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%204%2C428%2C382%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 4,428,382,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which discusses measuring skin temperature by scanning \"across a predetermined part of the body\"-that address \"scanning across a surface\" were before the PTO during the '685 prosecution. Additionally, Exergen points to U.S. Patent 5,050,612, a disclosed reference, which Exergen admitted teaches body temperature at the forehead, but was able to distinguish this patent during the '685 prosecution because \"it does not teach the computation of body temperature value as a variable weighting or calibration function of ambient temperature and sensed surface temperature.\" Brooklands offers no additional evidence of intent,\n   other than the failure to disclose the prior art references.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude there is a genuine issue whether deceptive intent is the single most reasonable inference that can be made regarding the omitted prior art references.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Brooklands also claims inequitable conduct for failure to disclose the Physician's Reference Handbook during the '685 prosecution, which discloses the use of heat-sensitive liquid crystal strips affixed to the forehead to measure body temperature and the use of infrared thermometers to detect body temperatures across a surface. Exergen argues that the Physician's Reference Handbook merely describes previously disclosed inventions, including the '091 patent, which was disclosed in the '685 prosecution and the '813 patent which discloses temperature measurements in the inner ear. Here again, Brooklands has failed to offer clear and convincing evidence of deceptive intent, and there are other inferences that can be drawn from the evidence, such as a good faith belief that this information was not material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exergen Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kaz USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4017778\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/120/1/#p7\">\n    120 F.Supp.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that there was no deceptive intent in Exergen's failure to disclose the Physician's Reference Handbook].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Lastly, Brooklands argues specific intent to deceive by not disclosing the Marybeth Pompei letters. In these letters there is a consideration of an \"arterial thermometer\" to measure body temperature at the ear, but that approach had not yet been fully developed. As Exergen argues, it is not even clear that this is prior art, but even if it is, Brooklands makes no showing of deceptive intent in Exergen's failure to submit this material during the '685 patent prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Overall, there are multiple inferences that can be drawn from each of the withheld pieces of information. Brooklands does not present evidence to make deceptive intent the single most likely inference. Indeed, deceptive intent seems the least likely of inferences. Even taking all inferences in Brooklands' favor, I find no basis not to grant Exergen's motion for summary judgment as to this branch of the inequitable conduct claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Mischaracterizing the State of the Art During the '685 Patent Prosecution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The last argument that Brooklands makes is that Exergen mischaracterized the state of the art during the '685 patent prosecution. Brooklands bases its argument on the fact that Exergen's marketing materials state that \"[t]he temporal artery area has a long history of temperature measurement, dating back to the early centuries before Christ,\" which Brooklands views as confirming the existence of prior art with the same claims as the '685 patent that Dr. Pompei and Attorney Smith represented as not being found in prior art. Brooklands claims that if the examiner had known of the statements on Exergen's marketing materials, the '685 patent would not have been issued. Exergen, however, responds that its brochure, which was disclosed during the '685 patent prosecution, corresponds exactly to the text from Exergen's website marketing materials which the examiner was able to consider while evaluating whether to issue the patent. Moreover, as Exergen argues, the identified statement does not disclose actual forehead temperature measurement, rather it merely discusses the historical practice of touching the forehead to feel for warmth to gauge the status of a person's health. In sum, there was no mischaracterization of prior art in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
