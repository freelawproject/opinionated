(Docket Nos. 1 \u00b6 9, 20 \u00b6 9). These facts establish that he is currently deterred from patronizing the Facility because of Defendants' failure to comply with the ADA. Plaintiff also alleges that he will not be able to return until these barriers are removed, and that to date, Defendants have failed to do so. (Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12).

In his complaint, Plaintiff has restated the definition of \"readily achievable\" and one of the factors the Court considers in a conclusory fashion. Namely, that Defendants can remove these barriers without difficulty or expense because they have the financial resources to do so. Furthermore, Plaintiff has not offered any facts that show Defendants' have the overall financial resources to remove these barriers, or of the difficulty or expense of doing so. He has also failed to proffer any facts to support that, if removal is not readily achievable, then alternative methods are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court must take the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schatz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n    669 F.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Plaintiff's well-pleaded facts allege that Caribbean Cinemas, one of the defendants, caused Plaintiff's injuries. It is generally known in Puerto Rico that Caribbean Cinemas is a chain that operates multiple establishments in the region. This fact susceptible to judicial notice suggests it is plausible that Defendants have the financial resources to remove the barriers. Thus, the well-plead allegations in the complaint as a whole \"raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\" of Defendants' financial resources and whether removing the barriers is readily achievable.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
