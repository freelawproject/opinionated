For the reasons stated herein and at oral argument, the Motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and this case will be\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\"Dunkin Brands\") (Doc. 1-1)(Doc. 1-1). The case arises out of a lease agreement between the Plaintiff and Barista, a potential franchisee of a \"Dunkin' Donuts\" franchise, which prompted the Plaintiff to construct part of its shopping center to the particular specifications required of a Dunkin' Donuts store. In October of 2014, after construction had begun, but before construction was completed, \"Barista ... informed McAdam Properties that Barista ... would not be taking possession of the premises and that Dunkin' Donuts would take assignment of the lease agreement.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 3, \u00b6 8). The Plaintiff claims it was injured when, in May of 2015, after it completed construction, \"Dunkin' Donuts informed McAdam Properties that it would not take assignment of the lease unless it could obtain a franchisee to become a substitute for Barista.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 4, \u00b6 11). The Complaint sets out a claim for fraud (Count One) against all Defendants, and a claim for suppression (Count Two) against only Dunkin' Donuts and Dunkin's Brands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Removal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants allege that on November 21, 2017, complete diversity of citizenship pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   was created when the state court dismissed Barista on the Plaintiff's motion.

Apr. 30, 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Noyes\n   </em>\n   involved a claim by James Noyes against Universal Underwriter's Insurance Company (\"Universal\") for the alleged bad faith failure to settle an underlying tort case within policy limits. In the underlying tort case, Tampa Auto Service (\"Tampa Auto\"), where Noyes worked as a service manager, repaired a flat tire on a vehicle owned by Roy Chattelle. Three months after the repair, Chattelle's wife was severely injured when the tire lost its tread, causing an accident. Chattelle sued Tampa Auto, but did not sue Noyes. David LoNigro, the insurer's in-house counsel, was assigned to the case. Seven months after getting the case, LoNigro sent Chattelle a policy limits settlement offer of $1.3 million, which was rejected. Afterwards, Universal transferred the case to outside counsel. On November 4, 2009, the state court entered an order substituting another attorney for LoNigro. On January 24, 2011, Chattelle amended his complaint to add Noyes as a defendant. After trial, the Chattelles won a judgment of $7 million against Tampa Auto and $6 million against Noyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On September 27, 2012, Noyes sued Universal and LoNigro in Florida state court for bad faith failure to settle. The\n   opinion then sets out the following procedural history:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Universal initially removed the case to federal court on the basis that Noyes fraudulently joined LoNigro to destroy diversity since LoNigro is a citizen of Florida. Universal alleged that Noyes could not state a legal malpractice claim against LoNigro because Noyes was not a party in the underlying claim until after LoNigro was removed as counsel from the case. Noyes filed a motion to remand on the basis that the notice of removal was untimely. The district court remanded the case based on the removal being late by one day, but did not address the issue of fraudulent joinder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   In the state court, LoNigro filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that Noyes failed to state a cause of action against him for legal malpractice. Noyes argued that LoNigro represented Noyes regarding the Chattelles' \"claims,\" and not the underlying lawsuit specifically. The theory is that the \"claims\" were not limited to the causes of action brought in the underlying case but included the potential claims against the employees of Tampa Auto, including Noyes. The state court entered an order dismissing the count against LoNigro without prejudice, and allowed Noyes to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint alleged that an attorney-client privilege existed between Noyes and LoNigro and in the alternative that LoNigro was a third party beneficiary to the attorney client relationship between Tampa Auto and LoNigro.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   LoNigro then filed a second motion to dismiss along with a motion for sanctions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2057.105\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The state court granted LoNigro's motion to dismiss the amended complaint, without prejudice and with leave to amend the complaint within twenty days. Noyes and LoNigro entered into a settlement agreement whereby Noyes would stipulate to LoNigro's dismissal with prejudice in exchange for LoNigro dropping his claim for attorney's fees. The state court entered the stipulated order dismissing LoNigro with prejudice on November 6, 2013. Universal then filed the Notice of Removal on December 6, 2013, which is the subject of this Motion to Remand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Noyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137274\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/1356/\">\n    3 F.Supp.3d at 1359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Universal argued that the act of fraudulently joining LoNigro in order to destroy diversity amounted to bad faith. \"As proof of the fraudulent joinder, Universal point[ed] to the two state court dismissals of the claims against LoNigro which support that Noyes could not have possibly stated a cause of action against LoNigro for legal malpractice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137274\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/1356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137274\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/1356/\">\n    at 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The district court first determined, after significant analysis, that Universal had met its burden of establishing that LoNigro was fraudulently joined for the purpose of destroying diversity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137274\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/1356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137274\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/1356/\">\n    at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Furthermore, the facts seem to suggest both that there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a valid claim against Barista, and that it was vigorously prosecuted-the Plaintiff survived summary judgment on its claims against Barista after the Defendants made the same arguments they are making now. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 16 at 5). That alone makes this case factually distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Noyes.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also notes that the case against Barista was not settled as a \"walk away\" as stated by the Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1 at 8). As part of the settlement, Barista agreed to allow the Plaintiff to keep the $69,000 in first month's rent-the very thing Barista had sued for. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 16 at 4).

In addition, both Plaintiff's Complaint and First Amended Complaint lump all of the Defendants together for pleading purposes, and the First Amended Complaint contains a premises liability claim in Count IV which one would reasonably assume is directed at Cedar Crest since the injury allegedly occurred in its facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203613771\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The state court granted summary judgment against the Plaintiff on his claims against Johnson Diversity, Inc., which would have made the only remaining claims those against Ecolab, Inc. However, the court noted that because of the inclusion of Cedar Crest in the caption of the amended complaint, and the presence of the premises liability claim, \"it was far from clear at that point if Cedar Crest was or was not still a party to this case and if there were proper grounds for removal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203613771\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court held that Cedar Crest and Beacon were fraudulently joined parties and wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The bottom line is that this case would have been removable from its commencement but for the presence of two fraudulently joined parties,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Cedar Crest and Beacon, who are immune from suit in Superior Court due to workers' compensation exclusivity. By continuing to identify Cedar Crest, after its dismissal in Superior Court, as an active Defendant in his First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff falsely led Ecolab to believe that this was not a diversity case because Cedar Crest is a Rhode Island corporation operating a nursing home in Rhode Island. It is unclear whether this is a case of procedural gamesmanship to prevent removal or if Plaintiff has received an unintended benefit from sloppy pleading. Either way, this Court concludes that it would be inequitable to deprive Ecolab of its right to remove this case on diversity grounds on these unique facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Arrighi v.

Instead, the plaintiff waited for Corporate Green to file a Motion for Summary Judgment which he did not oppose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Considering this conduct as a whole, the only reasonable conclusion is that the plaintiff knew he lacked a factual basis for the claim against Corporate Green, but maintained this defendant in the case to get beyond the one year time limit for removal. When it became apparent that the plaintiff could no longer keep Corporate Green as a party, the plaintiff immediately named another nondiverse defendant based on an unsupported officer/employee liability claim to prevent a second removal. Plaintiff's unexplained actions and delay establish that the actual motive was not to assert viable claims against potentially liable defendants, but rather to keep a Louisiana citizen as a defendant and thereby keep the case in state court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Outside the fraudulent joinder context, other cases applying the\n   <em>\n    Tedford\n   </em>\n   exception also require some sort of misconduct by the plaintiffs to manipulate jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Rauch v.

In this case, Defendants removed to federal court claiming fraudulent joinder twice within the one-year limit, and both times\n   the federal court remanded, holding that there was some possibility that the non-diverse party could be liable in the action. Now, more than one year after the commencement of the action, Plaintiff dismissed the non-diverse party and Defendants finally have the evidence that proves Plaintiff intended to make this dismissal all along.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The actions of Plaintiff constitute a shameless and egregious manipulation of this court's jurisdiction. Further, the legislative history of the statute reveals that the specific purpose of the statute is to disallow removal after significant action in state court....

Pa. May 29, 2014) (Rufe, J.) (finding in dicta that defendant's argument that plaintiff lacked a valid claim against defendant was insufficient alone to establish bad faith).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Based on Congress's use of the phrase \"bad faith,\" and the history of the exception prior to its enactment as part of section 1446, and in particular the application of the exception when \"manipulation\" had occurred, the Court concludes that statutory bad faith requires some sort of\n   <em>\n    intentional misconduct\n   </em>\n   by the plaintiff, not just fraudulent joinder. All of the common law equitable tolling cases cited above have that in common.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    A.S. ex rel.

Sylacauga Autoplex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"914367\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/973/1358/#p1367\">\n    973 F.Supp. 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367 (N.D.Ala. 1997) (Propst, J.) (\"[T]he plaintiff's claims are in bad faith if, by [his] actions, [he] attempted to disguise the existence of the removability of the case until the one-year limitation had run.\"). The Defendants have made no showing of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court notes that the purpose behind the one-year limitation is to prevent the disruptive removal of cases after substantial progress in the state court had been made. However, if fraudulent joinder alone made a case removable at any time, even\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   one year from the date the case was filed, the purpose of the limitation would be defeated. A calculating defendant could, itself, \"manipulate\" jurisdiction by waiting to see how the case progressed in state court before ultimately removing it based on fraudulent joinder. Indeed, in the instant case, discovery has already been completed in the state court, and summary judgment motions have been filed, and, at least as to Barista, ruled upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In their briefs, the Defendants argued that they could not have known that the Plaintiff had no claim against Barista until discovery had occurred and the above deposition testimony had been taken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, that alone does not demand the conclusion that the one-year period should be\n   extended. Indeed, that is a regular occurrence in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   At oral argument the Defendants differed form their briefs and argued that it was clear\n   <em>\n    from the date the Complaint was filed\n   </em>\n   that there was no claim against Barista due to the Alabama statute of frauds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   If that is so, then the case should have been removed within 30 days after service of the Complaint upon these Defendants.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). It is unclear exactly when the removing Defendants were served, but it was certainly before June 27, 2016, the day they filed their answer. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, under this argument the latest that they could have removed based upon fraudulent joinder would have been July 27, 2016. This case was not removed until December 13, 2017. (Doc. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
