Having reviewed the filings, the relevant law, and the factual record, the Court hereby issues the following Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff John Stephen Thorne (\"Plaintiff\") seeks a declaratory judgment establishing the number, class, and present dollar value of shares of stock he allegedly owns in Union Pacific Corporation (\"UPC\") or Union Pacific Railroad Company (\"UPRR\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Am. Compl., Dkt. 12, at 13). Plaintiff also seeks a declaration of the Court regarding the cumulative dollar amounts of the dividends and interest earned on his shares, if any. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's argument is predicated on his ownership of a stock certificate (the \"Certificate\") issued by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company (\"SPRC\") in 1859. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). The Certificate, which bears the number 1656, issued to Mary Key 300 shares of $100 each. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Dkt. 12-1). SPRC subsequently underwent several sales, takeovers, and reorganizations. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 19-31; Stip. Facts, Dkt. 56, \u00b6\u00b6 19-49, 70-75). Plaintiff maintains that the 300 shares of SPRC stock at issue in this case survived each of those events. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 19-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, at some time between 1874 and 1893, Ms. Key or her son \"gifted, sold, or otherwise properly conveyed\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Certificate to Lansing Stephen (\"L.S.\") Thorne, who was hired by Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Company (\"T &amp; PRC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a brakeman and eventually became vice president and general manager of the company.

Thorne). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-46). He further alleges that the shares have \"evolved and grown into a valuable portion of equity\" in UPRR or its holding company UPC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

PLAINTIFF'S PARTIAL MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed three partial motions for summary judgment: one regarding Defendant's affirmative defenses, (Dkt. 81); one regarding the effect of an 1868 document pertaining to an event referred to herein as the \"Hall Sale,\" (Dkt. 84); and one regarding the import of text found on the back of the Certificate, (Dkt. 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's first partial motion for summary judgment seeks to limit Defendants' affirmative defenses to his claims. (First Partial Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 81). Specifically, Plaintiff asks the Court to restrict Defendants' arguments against the validity of Plaintiff's stock to a single argument regarding an 1868 sale of SPRC assets to a group of creditors led by R. B. Hall (the\n   \"Hall Sale\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2; Am. Compl., Dkt. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27). Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to this relief because Defendants' \"sole stated reason for rejecting Plaintiff's tender of [the Certificate] and request for transfer of Defendant[s'] stock certificates in Plaintiff's name has been their position that [the Hall Sale] destroyed the initial shareholder's equity interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). In so arguing, Plaintiff avers that Defendants' refusal to recognize the Certificate \"constitutes an ongoing conversion\" outside the scope of any permissible qualified refusal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Several intermediate Texas courts have found that the refusal to recognize rights in corporate stock or issue new stock certificates based on such rights constitutes conversion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank v. South Beaumont Land &amp; Imp. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"608584\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex-civ-app/60/315/\">\n    60 Tex. Civ.

Civ. App. 1910, writ ref'd) (holding that a company's failure to recognize a stock certificate constituted conversion). A defense to conversion exists, however, when the person in possession of the demanded property engages in a \"qualified refusal\"-that is, when they refuse to surrender the property for a reasonable length of time while there is a reasonable doubt about the claimant's right to possession.\n   <em>\n    Stein v. Mauricio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9927475\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/580/82/#p83\">\n    580 S.W.2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (Tex. Civ. App.-San Antonio 1979, no writ). To successfully rely on qualified refusal, the person in possession of the demanded property must disclose all reasons for the refusal to the alleged owner of the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9927475\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/580/82/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing 18 Am. Jur. 2d Conversion \u00a7 44 (1965) ; 89 C.J.S. Trover &amp; Conversion \u00a7 59 (1955) ) (\"For a person in possession to rely on a qualified refusal, it is essential that the qualification be disclosed to the owner. The refusal must be stated distinctly, and all reasons for the refusal that are not mentioned at the time of refusal are waived and cannot be later raised.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants \"asserted only the 1868 Hall Sale as the basis for their qualified refusal,\" thereby waiving \"all other purported reasons for such refusal.\" (First Partial Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 81, at 7). Defendants make three arguments in response: first, that the affirmative defense of qualified refusal applies only to a claim for conversion, a claim Plaintiff has not brought; second, that qualified refusal is inapplicable here because Defendants contend they do not possess any of Plaintiff's property; and third, that there is a material fact dispute with respect to whether the Defendants' sole basis for rejecting Plaintiff's tender of the Certificate was that the Hall Sale destroyed the initial shareholder's equity interest. (Resp. First Partial Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 91, at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because summary judgment is appropriate only when \"the movant shows there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), the Court will consider Defendants' third argument first. Defendants maintain that a dispute exists with respect to whether their sole basis for rejecting Plaintiff's tender of the Certificate and request for the equivalent amount in current stock is that the Hall Sale destroyed the initial shareholder's equity interest in the Certificate. Plaintiff's only evidence is (1) an August 3, 2011 email from UPC in-house counsel Timothy Dunning\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Plaintiff's former attorney, Ronald Bair, (Dunning-Bair Email, Dkt. 81-1, at 2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; a portion of Plaintiff's own deposition testimony regarding\n   that communication, (Thorne Dep., Dkt. 81-2, at 5)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and \"similar responses [by Defendants] to other inquiries over the past 150 years,\" (Dkt. 81-3). (First Partial Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 81, at 2, 5). However, in the very email cited by Plaintiff, Mr. Dunning references not just the Hall Sale but also (1) other sales in 1860 and 1861, and (2) the 1872 acquisition of SPRC by TPRC. (Dunning-Bair Email, Dkt. 81-1, at 2). Additionally, an email between Plaintiff and Mr. Bair regarding a telephone conversation the latter had with Mr. Dunning notes that Mr. Dunning mentioned not only the Hall Sale but also a stock ledger from 1871 and the 1872 acquisition of SPRC by TPRC. (Bair-Plaintiff Email, Dkt. 86-40, at 2-3). These facts indicate, at the very least, that Defendants may have provided other bases for their refusal. Therefore, with respect to this issue, Plaintiff has failed to show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. As a result, he is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiff's first partial motion for summary judgment, (Dkt. 81), is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the reasons stated below,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Parts IV-V, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's second and third partial motions for summary judgment, (Dkts. 84, 85), are moot. The Court therefore proceeds to an analysis of Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims because (1) Plaintiff cannot prove he is the true and rightful owner of the stock interest the Certificate once represented; (2) Plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations; (3) Plaintiff's claims are barred by laches; (4) the stock in question was extinguished at least 147 years ago, if not before, by various corporate transactions, and (5) Plaintiff has no evidence to establish the declaratory judgments requested. (Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 86, at 1-7). Given the historical nature of Plaintiff's claims, the Court deems it prudent to begin its analysis with Defendant's second and third arguments: the statute of limitations and laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    A. Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties in this matter dispute whether the statute of limitations has run. Both agree that the statute of limitations for a stockholder to assert his rights to recover stock and back dividends is generally four years, with claims accruing once a demand is made by the alleged stockholder and the corporation refuses the demand.\n   <em>\n    Cavitt v. Amsler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8258302\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/242/246/#p248\">\n    242 S.W. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (Tex. Civ. App. Austin 1922, writ dism'd w.o.j.) ;\n   <em>\n    Yeaman v. Galveston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2253248\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/106/389/\">\n    106 Tex. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8280279\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/167/710/#p722\">\n    167 S.W. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722-23 (Tex. 1914) ; (Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 86, at 20; Pl.'s Resp., Dkt. 94, at 12). But Defendants assert the Court should interpret that rule in light of other courts' more recent adoption of an \"inquiry notice\" standard. (Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 86, at 20). Courts using\n   \"inquiry notice\" evaluate whether a demand by an alleged stockholder is barred by the applicable statute of limitations by considering when the alleged stockholder knew or should have known that her rights were being denied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Whitney v. Guys, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325616\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1074/\">\n    826 F.3d 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Egner v. Talbot's, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6995250\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/272/\">\n    214 P.3d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alaska 2009). Defendants, however, have not identified any Texas courts-or courts within the Fifth Circuit-that have adopted this standard. Because this Court's jurisdiction over the instant case is grounded in diversity, the Court finds it would be inappropriate to apply the inquiry notice framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The four-year statute of limitations accrues once a demand is made by the alleged stockholder and the corporation refuses the demand. Here, Plaintiff sent Defendants a demand letter on June 30, 2011, (Dkt. 94-24); Defendants responded on August 3, 2011, (Dkt. 94-25). Because Plaintiff filed this suit on June 29, 2015, he maintains that his action is within the four-year statute of limitations and thereby not barred. (Pl.'s Resp., Dkt. 94, at 18). But at a hearing held on the instant motions, Defendants argued that Plaintiff called Union Pacific in 2005 or 2007\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to inquire about the value of his certificate. (Dkt. 109). According to Defendants, that call qualifies as a \"demand\" for purposes of the statute of limitations analysis, and Plaintiff's claims are time-barred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court is sympathetic to Defendants' argument.
