Piersol, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs brought this action against Shantel Krebs, in her official capacity as Secretary of State of South Dakota, and Marty Jackley, in his official capacity as Attorney General of South Dakota, alleging two violations of constitution law with regard to South Dakota's ballot access laws. Both parties, represented by counsel, presented evidence and argument at trial on February 6-7, 2018. Because the State Chair of the Libertarian Party has changed since the beginning of this litigation, Plaintiffs moved to substitute Aaron Aylward, the current chair of the party, for Ken Santema, the past chair. The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion. The Court took the constitutional issues under advisement at the conclusion of trial on and, for the following reasons, now finds SDCL \u00a7\u00a7 12-5-1, 12-6-1, 12-6-4, and 12-5-21 unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 15, 2015, Plaintiffs first brought this suit against Defendants, seeking a declaratory judgment that the deadlines in SDCL 12-5-1 violate their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by imposing unreasonable restrictions on new political parties seeking to participate in South Dakota elections. Doc. 1, 19. Defendants moved for summary judgment on March 3, 2016, arguing that South Dakota's ballot access laws place reasonable and nondiscriminatory restrictions on political parties. Doc. 25. The Court denied Defendants' motion, reasoning that South Dakota's ballot access laws impose a severe burden on third parties and their candidates and found that Defendants had not identified a compelling reason for the disparate treatment of candidates running for political office in South Dakota. Doc. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants again moved for summary judgment on July 15, 2016, arguing that discovery gave support to their motion. Doc. 44. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on July 23, 2016, and for a permanent injunction on July 25, 2016. Doc. 54, 60. The Court denied Plaintiffs' motion for permanent injunction and subsequently denied Plaintiff's motion to reconsider that order. Doc. 68, 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs moved to file a second amended complaint on September 12, 2016, arguing that Defendants' answer to Plaintiffs' first amended complaint raised a new interpretation of SDCL 12-5-21. Doc. 77-78. The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion to amend and Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on December 13, 2016, raising an additional constitutional challenged to SDCL 12-5-21 as a violation of the equal protection clause. Doc. 84-85. Because the Parties sought to conduct additional discovery, the Court denied without prejudice the pending cross motions for summary judgment on December 20, 2016. Doc. 87. Plaintiffs and Defendants subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment on both claims raised in the second amended complaint on July 27, 2017 and July 31, 2017, respectively. Doc. 97, 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In denying both motions, the Court found that questions remained as to whether South Dakota had a compelling state interest in having certain candidates participate in a primary election while others can be selected by convention, and whether South Dakota's ballot access laws were narrowly tailored to further that\n   state interest. Doc. 115 at 21-22. Additionally, because the equal protection claim necessarily required resolution of Plaintiffs' first claim, the Court could not conclude as a matter of law that South Dakota's disparate nominating process was a violation of Plaintiffs' equal protection rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Finding \"reason to believe that the better course would be to proceed to a full trial,\" the Court denied the cross motions for summary judgment and a trial was held on February 6-7, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (citing\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

In order for a new political party to participate in South Dakota's primary election, that party must file a written declaration validly signed by at least 2.5% of South Dakota voters \"as shown by the total vote cast for Governor at the last preceding gubernatorial election\" with the Secretary of State's office by the last Tuesday of March preceding the primary election. SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1. For the year 2018, that number is equivalent to 6,936 signatures, all of which must be filed by March 27, 2018. Any registered voter may sign the written declaration, not just a member of that party, but any signatures from more than one year prior to the declaration's filing date are invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Then, for that party to put a candidate on the ballot under the party name, that candidate must receive additional signatures from the members of that party-specifically, state-wide and federal candidates must collect 250 signatures of registered party members, while county and legislative candidates require five signatures of registered party voters in that county or district. SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1.4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to retain political party status and be eligible to participate in a primary election again the following year, the party must have a \"candidate for any statewide office at the last preceding general election receive[ ] at least two and one-half percent of the total votes cast for that statewide office.\" SDCL \u00a7 12-1-3(10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the party fails to have a candidate receive such support, the party loses political party status and must regain it through the 2.5% petition process again in the next election year to participate in that year's primary election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Not all candidates for office in South Dakota must be nominated through a primary election to appear on the general election ballot, however. State law provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The state convention shall nominate candidates for lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, state auditor, state treasurer, commissioner of school and public lands, and public utilities commissioner and in the years when a President of the United States is to be elected, presidential electors and national\n   committeeman and national committeewoman of the party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   SDCL \u00a7 12-5-21. To hold a convention, a new party that does not have candidates that must participate in primaries must file a written declaration validly signed by at least 2.5% of South Dakota voters \"as shown by the total vote cast for Governor at the last preceding gubernatorial election\" with the Secretary of State's office by July 1st before the general election. SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The party must also give 30 days notice of the time and place of its party convention. SDCL \u00a7 12-5-17. Finally, nominations must be certified and received in the Secretary of State's office by the second Tuesday in August. SDCL \u00a7 12-5-22. Plaintiffs' expert could identify no other state with an election law that sets a different filing deadline to run for attorney general or lieutenant governor than that for governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs include two political parties, the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and four of their current or former members. Ken Santema was originally part of the litigation as a South Dakota resident, registered voter, and Chair of the Libertarian Party of South Dakota when this suit was filed. Doc. 36, 85 at 2. At trial, Plaintiffs' counsel moved to replace Ken Santema with Aaron Aylward, who is also a South Dakota resident and registered voter, is the current Chair of the Libertarian Party of South Dakota, and is currently collecting signatures for candidacy as a state legislator on the Libertarian Party ticket. Bob Newland is a South Dakota resident, registered voter, and a member of the Libertarian Party of South Dakota who was heavily active in campaigning in the past, both as a member of the party and as a candidate on the party's ticket on a number of occasions. Lori Stacy is a South Dakota resident, registered voter, and Chair of the Constitution Party of South Dakota. Doc. 37, 85 at 3. Joy Howe is a South Dakota resident, registered voter, and was the Secretary of the Constitution Party of South Dakota when this lawsuit was filed. Ms. Howe also formerly served as Chair of the Constitution Party of South Dakota, though she is no longer a registered member. Mr. Aylward, Mr. Newland, and Ms. Howe all testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2016, South Dakota's primary election was held on June 7. The Libertarian Party was unable to obtain political party status by the March 29, 2016 deadline, filling only 4,399 valid signatures. However, the Libertarian Party had continued to mail in signatures to the Secretary of State's office and had submitted a sufficient amount of signatures to regain political party status on June 17, 2016. The Constitution Party, on the other hand, successfully met the March 29, 2016 deadline with 7,655 valid signatures. Nevertheless, the Constitution Party did not hold a primary election and submitted their candidates for Presidential candidate Darrell L. Castle, Vice Presidential candidate Scott N. Bradley, US Senate candidate Kurt Evans, and State House,\n   District 23 candidate Wayne Schmidt via convention nomination certification. The nominations for Castle and Bradley were accepted, but those for Evans and Schmidt were not, as US Senate and state legislator are not included in the list of offices that can be nominated at state party conventions pursuant to SDCL \u00a7 12-5-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs argued and this Court previously concluded its June 9, 2016 order denying Defendants' motion for summary judgment, as well as reiterated in its December 19, 2017 order denying cross-motions for summary judgment, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   the 6,936 signature requirement coupled with the late March deadline was \"particularly troublesome\" for third parties because it is expensive, difficult to gather signatures during the winter months in a sparsely populated state, and people often support third party candidates after the two major political parties have chosen their candidates during the June primary election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Doc. 115 at 18. Although both the Libertarian party and Constitution Party have qualified as new political parties by the March deadline in previous election years, the Court previously found that Plaintiffs had provided evidence that meeting such requirements is expensive and very difficult. This evidence was corroborated at trial. Plaintiffs further showed that they do not have an interest in primary ballot access for its candidates as they often find it difficult to find even one candidate for a position due to their small party registration in the state of South Dakota. Plaintiffs' expert testified that, in non-presidential election years, South Dakota has the second earliest filing deadline amongst the states. In presidential election years, South Dakota's deadline ranks as the eighth earliest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 6-7, 2018, the Court held trial on the remaining issues: 1) whether the ballot access law is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

They further argue that defendants are interpreting and enforcing SDCL \u00a7\u00a7 12-5-1, 12-6-1, 12-6-4, and 12-5-21, individually or in combination, \"in a manner that results in invidious discrimination against candidates seeking an office not listed in SDCL \u00a7 12-5-21\" as a violation of equal protection rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049868\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/687/#p702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Article III standing requires a plaintiff to demonstrate an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged conduct and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

In\n   <em>\n    McLain v.

Ultimately, the court in\n   <em>\n    McLain\n   </em>\n   concluded that plaintiff had standing to challenge ballot access laws because he suffered an injury as a voter that was fairly traceable to North Dakota's ballot access laws and his injury would be redressed if those laws were declared unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Similarly, the Plaintiffs in this case have standing to challenge \u00a7 12-5-1 because the law affects their abilities as South Dakota voters to support the candidates they choose. When each was asked to testify as to why they joined their respective parties, the individuals stated that upon learning about the principles of those parties, they found they were far more aligned with their own principles than the Republican and Democratic parties were. Each used their own time and money to further their parties' cause by driving many miles in repeated attempts to get their parties' candidates on the ballot. With exception to the young and optimistic Mr. Aylward, the other individual Plaintiffs testified to their experiences and their current involvement with clear exhaustion. Despite continuing to align with the principles of their respective parties, Mr. Newland and Ms. Howe expressed no intentions of running a campaign again because of the difficulty of doing so. The severe burden these ballot access laws place on third parties serves to restrict the candidates from these third parties that can put themselves on the ballot, further restricting the voters' ability to vote for the candidate of their choice-a candidate who aligns with their principles. A declaratory judgment that SCDL \u00a7 12-5-1's requirements are unconstitutional would allow plaintiffs to place their candidates on the November 2018 general election ballot and vote for the candidates of their choice without having to overcome the burdens imposed by SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1's requirements, thus redressing Plaintiffs' injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The South Dakota Legislature has made various amendments to its ballot access laws during the course of this litigation\n   and there are more legislative bills currently before the Legislature that could render this litigation moot. H.B. 1286, which was drafted primarily by the Defendant Secretary of State's office, for example, changes the 2.5% requirement to 1% and does away with a primary requirement for minor party candidates. However,\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   is the necessarily operative word. There is no way of knowing whether this legislation will pass and in what final form. Thus, the Court can only consider the law as it stands today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Claim One: the Right to Associate and the Right to Vote\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs' first claim asserts that the deadline set forth in SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1 for new political parties to submit signed petitions seeking to participate in South Dakota elections violates Plaintiffs' right to vote and their right to associate.

What makes the system in\n   <em>\n    Jaeger\n   </em>\n   so glaringly different from the one at hand, however, is that once a party obtained those 7,000 signatures, it did not have to regain those signatures in future years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049868\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/687/#p702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049868\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/687/#p702\">\n    at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The necessity of the lesser of 1% or 300 primary vote requirement then became evident when considering the fact that the 7,000 signature requirement on which the party and its candidates relied as their showing of support was a one-time occurrence, and said nothing about the particular candidate on the ballot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049868\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/687/#p702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, the challenged statute was \"the only protection the state ha[d] from frivolous party candidates and ballot overcrowding in subsequent elections.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049868\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/687/#p702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast, South Dakota continuously requires a political party to establish support for itself as a party, shown either by support in the general election or through the 6,936 signature requirement, as well as for its party candidates, through their own signature requirement. Plaintiffs' expert\n   also established that South Dakota has never had more than five parties on a ballot. Further, the court in\n   <em>\n    Jaeger\n   </em>\n   could not find evidence that the challenged statute itself was the reason candidates had been absent from the general election since 1976.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049868\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/687/#p702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, however, if not for SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1, the Constitution Party would have had party candidates on the 2016 general election ballot running for both the U.S. Senate and for the state legislature, instead of just for president and vice president.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In 1984, as a result of the settlement and dismissal of litigation in this Court, South Dakota established a deadline for the first Tuesday in April for new parties to gather petitions for party status.\n   <em>\n    See Libertarian Party v. Kundert\n   </em>\n   , 3:83-cv-03071 (Ms. Kundert was the Secretary of State at the time). In 2007, that deadline was changed to the fourth Tuesday in March, the deadline that still exists. There is no legislative history or other evidence presented as to why the change was made. No compelling interest was shown as to why the March deadline was necessary when April had apparently worked from 1984 to 2007. But Defendants did not, even after trial, explain the state's interest in requiring new political parties to hold a primary election to select its gubernatorial and other candidates, especially in light of the fact that it does not require those parties to hold a primary election for president, attorney general, or for other statewide elected officials. In other words, what is the state's interest in ensuring new party candidates have shown a sufficient amount of support before being placed on the ballot satisfied by nomination at the party's convention for certain candidates, but not for others? Examining South Dakota's interests in treating some statewide candidates differently in the nomination process, Defendants state that \"South Dakota, as a policy, has determined that those who create and affect the laws should be chosen in a more populous manner,\" which is the primary election process, while those who implement the laws can be chosen by party convention. Thus, defendants attempt to distinguish the two types of candidates by \"the amount and type of power they hold.\" This interest put forth by Defendants, in theory, makes sense for the two major political parties. In our two-party dominant system, the Republican and Democratic parties often have more than one candidate for each political office and thus need to run in a primary election where the registered voters of each party must choose their candidate. This is a more populous manner of selection. But Defendants have not explained why this rationale should apply to new political parties. The purpose of a primary election is to choose which candidates will represent a particular political party in the general election. But new political parties rarely require a primary because they seldom have more than one candidate running for the same position. \"The fact is there are obvious differences in kind between the needs and potentials of a political party with historically established broad support, on the one hand, and a new or small political organization on the other....Sometimes the grossest discrimination can lie in treating things that are different as though they were exactly the same.\"\n   <em>\n    Jewess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027224\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/431/\">\n    403 U.S. at 441-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027224\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/431/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the Court concludes the Defendants have failed to establish that the substantial burden created by SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1, when examined in the context of the entire ballot access scheme, is no more restrictive than necessary to serve a compelling state interest, the Court finds SDCL \u00a7 12-5-1 unconstitutional as applied to the Libertarian and Constitution parties of the state of South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Claim Two: Equal Protection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To determine whether a statute violates the Equal Protection Clause, the Court considers \"the facts and circumstances behind the law, the interests which the State claims to be protecting, and the interests of those who are disadvantaged by the classification.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309544\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/23/\">\n    393 U.S. at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309544\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/23/\">\n    89 S.Ct. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In analyzing the Plaintiffs' equal protection challenge, then, the interests and burdens at issue are the same as those that were balanced in their First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges discussed above.

Because Defendants cannot establish a distinction between new party candidates for governor, state legislature, and other positions from new party candidates for secretary of state, attorney general, and lieutenant governor, Defendants cannot and have not met their burden of showing a compelling reason as to why new party candidates for the former positions must undergo such a burdensome ballot access regime while candidates for the latter category do not. Therefore, South Dakota's ballot access laws result in discrimination against new party candidates seeking an office not listed in SDCL \u00a7 12-5-21.
