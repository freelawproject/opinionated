Plaintiff Path to Riches purports to bring direct and derivative claims on behalf of MMT, an Israeli company in which it holds a majority share, against Defendants CardioLync and its owners. Defendants now move to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   Without deciding either jurisdictional issue, I find that Israel is an adequate alternative forum for this dispute, and that the deference owed to Plaintiff's choice of forum is outweighed by the substantial private and public interests in holding this proceeding in Israel. Specifically, all of the parties and essential non-party witnesses are either Israeli residents or have significant ties to Israel; two of the three companies are based there; and Israeli law likely governs most of Plaintiff's claims. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted on FNC grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from Plaintiff Path to Riches, LLC's (PTR's) allegation that Defendants Gamliel Kagan (Gam) and Jacob Levy (Dr. Levy), through their company, Defendant CardioLync, misappropriated proprietary information belonging to M.M.T. Diagnostics (2014), Ltd., by inducing MMT's CEO to breach his contractual and fiduciary duties. Because I ultimately decide this motion on FNC grounds, the location of and relationship among the parties and witnesses are of primary importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PTR is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware and based in New York state. It is wholly owned by Dr. and Ms. Minkowitz, non-parties whose primary residence is in New York. The Minkowitzes have a second home in Israel, where they visit each year for extended periods and where their children attend school. Their neighbor in Israel is Jeremy Kagan, an Israeli who is not a party but around whom this dispute centers. Jeremy's brother is Defendant Gam, who also resides in Israel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, Jeremy and Dr. Minkowitz entered into a telemedicine business venture, which the pair would eventually incorporate under the laws of Israel as MMT. (MMT is named as both a plaintiff and a nominal defendant in this action.) MMT initially focused on pathology, but according to PTR, hoped to expand into other fields, including cardiology. Jeremy owns 40 percent of MMT, and PTR (the Minkowitzes' company) owns the remaining 60 percent. Although MMT's incorporation documents provide for a five-member board of directors-three to be appointed by Dr. Minkowitz and two by Jeremy-Jeremy is the sole board member. Schreiber Decl. \u00b6 22, ECF No. 14. In 2014, Jeremy also became the CEO of MMT via an employment agreement created under the laws of Israel. He remained in that post through 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although MMT is based in Israel, PTR alleges that Jeremy and Dr. Minkowitz agreed in August 2015 to hire two people to work on MMT's product in New York. Jeremy allegedly refused to cooperate with these employees or speak with them by phone, and \"never traveled to the United States to visit\" them. Compl. \u00b6 44. PTR alleges that in November 2015, \"as a result of Gam's funding,\" a cease and desist letter was served upon Dr. Minkowitz and the New York employees claiming they\n   were misappropriating MMT's confidential information. Then, on January 26, 2016, Jeremy filed a lawsuit individually and on behalf of MMT in New York state court alleging that Dr. Minkowitz had formed a new company and was misappropriating MMT's intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this lawsuit, PTR alleges the opposite. On the same day that Jeremy sued Dr. Minkowitz, Gam and Dr. Levy (a cardiologist who is Jeremy's brother-in-law), incorporated CardioLync in Delaware-Gam and Dr. Levy are its shareholders and directors. CardioLync is a cardiology telemedicine company based in Israel, and PTR alleges that it targets the same market as MMT. PTR claims that Gam and Dr. Levy, through CardioLync, misappropriated MMT's proprietary information by inducing Jeremy to breach his fiduciary duties and employment agreement with MMT. PTR brings one federal and nine state claims \"directly and derivatively\" on behalf of MMT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, lack of personal jurisdiction over Gam and Dr. Levy, and on the basis of FNC, arguing that Israel is the more appropriate forum. Central to Defendants' subject matter jurisdiction argument is their claim that PTR lacks standing because it has not complied with Israeli requirements for bringing a shareholder's derivative action on behalf of MMT. The parties have provided dueling affidavits as to what Israeli law requires and whether PTR should be exempted from Israel's pre-suit demand requirement. Schreiber Decl. ECF No. 14; Stein Decl. ECF No. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although Defendants raise multiple grounds for dismissal, this case calls for resolution of only one:\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   (FNC).

Without any discernable facts suggesting that PTR has suffered harm that is different or apart from the harm it alleges MMT has suffered-or guidance from PTR suggesting that Israeli corporation law provides a different basis for direct claims-I conclude that PTR brings only derivative claims. As such, the real party in interest is MMT, a foreign corporation entitled to lesser deference. However, because I ultimately conclude that the balance of conveniences tips decidedly toward FNC dismissal even if the action includes a valid direct claim, and PTR is thus a real party in interest, the question is non-dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Having identified the factors that cut against full deference to PTR's forum choice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   I now review whether PTR has made a showing of convenience (either for itself or on behalf of MMT) to counter them.

This is not enough. Although PTR is a creature of Delaware law, its connection to the forum ends there. PTR has not alleged that it has buildings, business, contracts, or any other connection in Delaware. For PTR's owners, who live in New York and have a second home in Israel, Delaware is admittedly closer than Israel, but is not their home forum. PTR has pointed to no aspect of the case that relates to Delaware, other than the\n   mere act of CardioLync's incorporation-no evidence, no parties, no contracts, and no controlling law. As I discuss in more detail below, nearly all of the relevant parties (including MMT, a real party in interest), non-party witnesses, and evidence are located in Israel, an ocean away. Moreover, MMT was created by Israeli law, and Jeremy's employment agreement was executed there.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming PTR is a party in interest, its organization under Delaware law-PTR's sole tether to this forum-does not represent a \"bona fide connection\" to Delaware sufficient to restore full deference to its forum choice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kisano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731611\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/869/\">\n    737 F.3d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (agreeing that plaintiffs did not make a \"strong showing of convenience\" where \"the agency relationship was formed in Israel, all negotiations for the [ ] deal took place in Israel, and most of the conduct for the claims at issue took place in Israel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I must weigh all of these considerations to identify the appropriate deference to PTR's forum choice.

Because I find no basis for Plaintiff's allegation that diversity jurisdiction exists, federal question is the only possible grounds for subject-matter jurisdiction, and therefore I apply federal FNC rules. No party argues for the application of Delaware FNC rules.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Defs.'

However, since the FNC analysis generally is a balancing test, and the specific question of deference to plaintiff's forum is a \"sliding scale\" of convenience, MMT's Israeli connections (its incorporation and principal place of business) would be relevant even if I were to consider MMT as a real party in interest to Defendants, rather than to PTR.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kisano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731611\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/869/\">\n     737 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    875 (citing with approval the \"sliding scale\" convenience analysis set forth in\n    <em>\n     Iragorri v.
