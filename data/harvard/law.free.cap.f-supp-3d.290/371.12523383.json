Last year, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office successfully initiated the process that led to his conviction being vacated because the Office no longer had faith in the evidence that presumably led to the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Thomas has sued the City of Philadelphia, two former police detectives, and one former police officer. He alleges that they ignored exculpatory evidence, manufactured incriminating evidence, and coerced confessions from his alleged co-conspirators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants have filed two partial motions to dismiss that center on questions of qualified immunity. The Court (1) grants the detectives' partial motion to dismiss to the extent the motion is based on qualified immunity grounds, (2) grants the City's motion to dismiss a portion of the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, but (3) denies Officer Gist's motion to dismiss, which was based on non-qualified immunity grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The factual background is intricate and best understood by beginning narrowly and then taking a progressively wider view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, the Court restates the story of the murder that prosecutors told at Mr. Thomas's trial, followed by a summary of the evidence that investigators marshalled to tell their story-a rumor, a phony getaway car, and three coerced confessions. A wider lens reveals evidence that the investigators ignored-evidence that, if taken seriously at the time, very likely would have kept Mr. Thomas from ever being charged. Reference is also made to similar conduct in other criminal investigations by the Philadelphia Police Department during the early 1990s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, the Court summarizes the recent history of this case, namely, Mr.\n   Thomas's exoneration in light of recanted witness statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Murder and Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the morning of November 13, 1990, Domingo Martinez was murdered after making a large cash withdrawal from a North Philadelphia bank. As the 78-year-old was driving from the bank to his payday-lending business, he was side-swiped by another car. At least one man emerged from the car, shot Mr. Martinez, pulled him from his car, and left him to die in the street. The killer drove away in Mr. Martinez's car, followed by the assailing car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The case was investigated by Philadelphia police detectives Martin Devlin and Paul Worrell, with assistance from Officer James Gist. Four years later, two pairs of brothers were convicted for the murder: Shaurn Thomas, Mustafa Thomas, John Stallworth, and William Stallworth. Shaurn Thomas was 16 years old at the time of the murder of Mr. Martinez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial in 1994, both Stallworth brothers testified that the four conspirators planned the murder while living in the Abbotsford Homes housing project. They testified that six men in two separate cars coordinated the attack on Mr. Martinez. Prosecutors showed the jury Polaroid pictures of a stripped blue Chevrolet in the Abbotsford courtyard, which the Stallworth brothers identified as one of the cars used in the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Evidence Used to Convict Mr. Thomas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Three pieces of evidence pointed to Mr. Shaurn Thomas's guilt at trial: a rumor that he had participated in the murder, evidence of the blue car that detectives said he drove, and the centerpiece of the detectives' case-coerced confessions from two of his alleged co-conspirators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Rumor at Abbotsford Homes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While patrolling the Abbotsford Homes housing project, Officer Gist heard a rumor that eventually became the story told at trial. An informant told him that \"the Thompson [sic] brothers set [the Martinez murder] up and the Stallworths killed the guy.\" Officer Gist knew that the Thomas brothers and the Stallworth brothers had all been Abbotsford residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Blue Car\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The rumor did not specify the color of the car used in the murder, but Officer Gist knew that Shaurn Thomas drove a blue car. He relayed the rumor to Detectives Devlin and Worrell, along with his knowledge that Mr. Thomas drove a blue car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even though Mr. Thomas drove a blue Mercury-which had broken down months before the murder-the investigators developed a story in which the murderers used a different blue car. They confiscated a blue Chevrolet Caprice, whose owner and origins were unknown. Initially, the detectives told the prosecutor that the blue Caprice was the murder vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the trial in 1994, however, a forensics specialist compared evidence from the confiscated Caprice to evidence collected at the crime scene and concluded that the Caprice was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the murder car. Given this newfound doubt, the prosecutor asked the detectives if they had any other evidence linking a blue car to the Thomas and Stallworth brothers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   They did. Officer Gist had taken Polaroid photos of a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   blue car-a stripped blue Chevrolet sitting in the Abbotsford courtyard. The detectives showed the prosecutor the Polaroid photos. The photos were shown to the jury and the Stallworth brothers testified that the\n   stripped blue Chevrolet was the car used in the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. The Stallworths' Coerced Confessions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The testimony of John and William Stallworth was the lynchpin of the prosecution's case. But, it later turned out, their confessions were coerced by the detectives to fit the prosecution's plot line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Detectives Devlin and Worrell first arrested John Stallworth on October 27, 1992, nearly two years after the murder. During the interrogation, they physically abused him and threatened him with the death penalty, leading him to provide a false confession. He confessed that six men committed the murder: John and William Stallworth, Shaurn and Mustafa Thomas, Steven D. \"Nasir\" Johnson, and Louis Gay. John Stallworth told detectives that Mr. Gay had watched Mr. Martinez withdraw money at the bank. He also told them that the six attackers were divided into two cars, a leading blue car and a trailing gray car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But, as it happens, there was a problem with the confession that the detectives had John Stallworth sign: Louis Gay was in prison on the day of the murder. So, on July 6, 1993, under the aegis of the detectives, John Stallworth changed his story to replace Louis Gay with an \"unknown man\" who had watched Mr. Martinez in the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Still, an eyewitness was needed to place Shaurn Thomas at the scene of the murder. In John Stallworth's confession, he and Shaurn Thomas were in different cars. So, in early 1994, the detectives oversaw William Stallworth's signing of a confession that matched his brother's. In this iteration, William testified that he and Shaurn Thomas were together in the trailing gray car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Exculpatory Evidence Ignored by Detectives Devlin and Worrell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Detectives Devlin and Worrell ignored six categories of evidence in pursuit of the \"six-man, two-car\" story implicating Mr. Thomas. In brief, the detectives ignored: (1) Mr. Thomas's alibi, (2) eyewitness accounts, (3) paint traces on Mr. Martinez's car, (4) fingerprints on Mr. Martinez's car, (5) another group of suspects arrested shortly after the murder, and (6) the potential motive of the victim's own daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Shaurn Thomas's Alibi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the time that Mr. Martinez was murdered, Shaurn Thomas was being interviewed by a juvenile probation officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Martinez was murdered at roughly 9:45 a.m. on November 13, 1990. The night before, 16-year-old Shaurn Thomas had been arrested for attempted theft of a bicycle in Center City. He spent the night in a juvenile holding cell. The next morning, his mother picked him up and took him to the Philadelphia Youth Study Center, where he was interviewed by a juvenile probation officer. He was not released from the Youth Study Center until the afternoon of November 13-hours after the Martinez murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Detectives Worrell and Devlin knew that Shaurn Thomas was arrested the day before the murder and would have been at the Youth Study Center at the time of the murder. According to the complaint here, they failed to investigate this alibi because it did not fit with the story to be told at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Eyewitnesses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   All four eyewitnesses controvert the story given by the detectives to the prosecutor. All witnesses saw either a Chevrolet Nova or a Buick Skylark. None saw a blue\n   Mercury, the car driven by Shaurn Thomas early in 1990. And none saw a blue Chevrolet, the car the detectives told the prosecutor was used in the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The eyewitness accounts did not fit with the detectives' story in four ways: number of attackers, number of cars, car color, and car type.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-44\"><strong>Witness</strong> <strong>Witness's Position</strong> <strong>Number</strong> <strong>Number of Cars</strong> <strong>Car</strong> <strong>Car Type</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Color</strong> <strong>Assailants</strong> <strong>Allen</strong> Two cars behind the Three One Red and Either a Chevy Nova <strong>King</strong> attackers white car or Buick Skylark <strong>Roy</strong> Two cars behind the Three One Red and <strong>Howard</strong> attackers (Allen white car King's passenger) <strong>Carmen</strong> Pedestrian several Three One Gray Chevy Nova <strong>Garcia</strong> hundred feet from scene <strong>Ronald</strong> Directly behind Three Only one car: only <strong>Smith</strong> attackers' car one car was between witness's car and Martinez's car. <em>Story at</em> - <em>Six</em> <em>Two</em> <em>One blue,</em> <em>Blue Chevrolet</em> <em>Trial</em> <em>one gray</em> <em>Caprice or blue</em> <em>Mercury</em></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Paint Traces\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The day of the murder, another officer processed Mr. Martinez's car for evidence. Mr. Martinez's car had been side-swiped by the attackers' car, so the officer expected to find paint residue on Mr. Martinez's car. The officer found white paint on the car's fender and wheel well. He found no blue paint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Fingerprints\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The same officer who processed the victim's car for traces of paint also searched for fingerprints. Given the report that one of the attackers dragged Mr. Martinez from the car after shooting him, the officer expected to find fingerprints on the driver's side door. None of the prints he found matched any of the Stallworth or Thomas brothers' prints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E. Other Suspects Stopped in Similar Car\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Three days after murder, police officers stopped a gray Chevrolet Nova (that is, a car that fit some eyewitness descriptions) only six blocks from the murder. The car was carrying three men, and a gun was found in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Detectives Worrell and Devlin interrogated the three men, all of whom admitted that they had known Mr. Martinez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   One of the three passengers blamed the murder on another passenger's cousin. He stated that the cousin, who often used the car, was in a bar the day after the murder, flush with cash, bragging that he had \"robbed this old Puerto Rican guy\" after the victim had made a cash withdrawal at a bank. The cousin described the robbery in the same manner that the Martinez robbery-murder happened: side-swiping the victim's car, jumping out of the assailing car, and robbing the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Detectives Devlin and Worrell did nothing with this information. They did not share it with the prosecutor or with Shaurn Thomas's defense team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     F. Possible Motive of Victim's Daughter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Martinez's adult daughter, Sara Negron, managed the payday-lending business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Shortly before the murder, the two had had a falling out in which Mr. Martinez threatened to disinherit Ms. Negron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the time of the murder, Ms. Negron was married but was having an affair with another man, someone who allegedly ran an illegal gambling business. A short time before the murder, Ms. Negron and Mr. Martinez had a fight over the affair; Mr. Martinez said that if Ms. Negron divorced her husband for her gambler boyfriend, then he would sell his business in order to disinherit her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Starting some 12 days before the murder, Ms. Negron had embezzled money from her father's business. On the day of the murder, Ms. Negron knew that her father would be securing cash at the bank. After the murder, Ms. Negron did indeed 1) inherit the business, 2) divorce her husband, and 3) sell the business to her boyfriend for $1.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Based on tips that the murder was an \"inside job,\" Detective Devlin interviewed Ms. Negron and learned all of this information. Nonetheless, the police continued to build a case against Shaurn Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Police Department Custom of Abuse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To bolster his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City, Mr. Thomas's complaint recounts nine similar incidents of police misconduct in Philadelphia from 1988 to 1994. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 188-207. Mr. Thomas alleges that the City's failure to train and discipline detectives contributed to coercive interrogations, fabricated evidence, and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations. Of the nine individual cases, seven involved coerced confessions (Anthony Wright, Carlos Hernandez/Ed Williams, Jackie Combs, Willie Veasy, Percy St. George, Donald Ray Adams, and Walter Ogrod); four involved fabricated evidence (Wright, St. George, Jimmy Dennis, and Andrew Swainson); and one involved a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation (Dennis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition to the nine individual cases, Mr. Thomas references a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   in 1977 and 1978 and several consent decrees involving the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Recent History: Shaurn Thomas's Exoneration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In 2011, William Stallworth-the only witness to affirmatively place Mr. Thomas at the murder-recanted his confession. He explained that he had been intimidated by the detectives who threatened him and his brother with the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Also in 2011, the Innocence Project discovered the forensics report on the blue Chevy Caprice. This report, which refuted the detectives' theory that the Caprice had been the car used in connection with the murder, was never disclosed to Mr. Thomas's defense team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In 2017, William Stallworth met with prosecutors from the District Attorney's Office and reiterated that he had made up his confession to avoid the death penalty. The prosecutors investigated Mr. Thomas's conviction and concluded that Mr. Thomas was at the Youth Study Center at the time of the murder. In addition, the District Attorney's Office learned-for the first time-about the three men in the Chevy Nova whom Detectives Worrell and Devlin stopped just days after the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Mr. Thomas's conviction was vacated in May of 2017, and the District Attorney's Office announced that it would not retry him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mr. Thomas sued the City, Detectives Devlin and Worrell, and Officer Gist. His complaint, which includes a demand for punitive damages, contains six counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   1. Malicious prosecution under \u00a7 1983 in violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The parties have briefed this count as\n   <strong>\n    two\n   </strong>\n   separate claims:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   a.

Malicious prosecution under Pennsylvania law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There are two pending motions to dismiss: one from Officer Gist and one from Detectives Worrell and Devlin and the City.

He poses three reasons why he cannot be liable for malicious prosecution. None has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    First\n   </strong>\n   , he argues that he provided the photos to the\n   <em>\n    detectives\n   </em>\n   , not directly to the\n   <em>\n    prosecutor\n   </em>\n   , and therefore he is absolved of liability. This is a distinction without a difference. Certainly, in most malicious prosecution cases against police officers, the officers provide misleading information to the prosecutor directly. The Court realizes that Officer Gist was plainly not driving this investigation alone or in a leadership role. But the question is simply whether he \"influenced or participated in the decision to institute criminal proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Halsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066643\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/273/#p296\">\n    750 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   297 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sykes v.

At a minimum, Officer Gist's Polaroids allegedly \"influenced\" the decision to bring charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    Second\n   </strong>\n   , Officer Gist argues that the prosecutors decided to bring charges without seeing the Polaroid photos. This statement, while chronologically correct, ignores the two ways in which the photos were used. First, John Stallworth identified the blue Chevrolet in the photos while making his false confession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 162. Second, during trial, new forensic evidence caused the prosecutor to question the evidence against Mr. Thomas, and only then did the detectives produce the Polaroid photos. In other words, the complaint supports an inference that the photos were used to shore up a weakening case and, thus, dissuade a wavering prosecutor from dropping the charges, hence, moving ahead with the prosecution. Because a prosecution continues until a conviction is final, Officer Gist's photos allegedly \"influenced\" the decision to prosecute, that is, to maintain the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    Third\n   </strong>\n   , Officer Gist argues that he did not know how the photos would be used. All he did was take some photos of a blue Chevrolet in the Abbotsford courtyard. He contends that he could not have known that the photos would be used to build a sham case against an innocent man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   This argument is better suited for a later phase of the litigation. At this stage, however, the complaint supports an inference that Officer Gist was in on the detectives' scheme to frame Mr. Thomas. After all, why else would Officer Gist take photos of a car that did not fit any witness descriptions, and bother to pass those photos on to the detectives? Such suspicious conduct supports an inference that Officer Gist knew he was acting, or perhaps intending or hoping, to incriminate Mr. Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Officer Gist advances two arguments why this claim should nevertheless be dismissed. Neither has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    First\n   </strong>\n   , Officer Gist argues that Mr. Thomas was charged before the prosecutors saw his Polaroids.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 162 (\"Defendants Devlin and Worrell did not disclose to prosecutor Randolph Williams that they had two Polaroid photographs of a blue Chevrolet that John Stallworth had allegedly identified as the car used in the Martinez murder while making version 2 of his false confession.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As an initial matter, Officer Gist relies on the wrong rule.

John Stallworth identified the car in the photos while making his false confession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 162. And during trial, new forensic evidence caused the prosecutor to question the evidence against Mr. Thomas. Only then did the detectives produce the Polaroid photos. In other words, the complaint supports an inference that the photos were used to shore up a weakening case and dissuade a wavering prosecutor from dropping the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    Second\n   </strong>\n   , Officer Gist argues that he did not provide the Polaroids to Detectives Worrell and Devlin in bad faith.
