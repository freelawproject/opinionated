For the reasons set forth below, both motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At 2:40 a.m. on August 30, 2012, Officer Jonathan Seal of the Tempe, Arizona, Police Department pulled Defendant over, suspecting drunk driving, after seeing Defendant's vehicle first drift within its lane and then cross the double line marking the oncoming traffic lane. (ECF No. 193-2 at 11; ECF No. 193-1 at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Seal asked Defendant to move to a safer location, which he did, after which the traffic stop effectively began at approximately 2:44 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Officer Seal approached the vehicle, he noticed the odor of alcohol coming from inside, and thought Defendant's eyes looked \"bloodshot and watery.\" (ECF No. 193-2 at 12.) When asked where he was going, Defendant answered that he was both coming from and also going to Chandler, Arizona-an answer which did not make sense to Officer Seal. Defendant then indicated that he was headed to Chandler after picking up mail from his post office box in Tempe. (ECF No. 193-4 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While speaking with Defendant, Officer Seal saw a plastic bag containing approximately 50 credit cards on the vehicle's back seat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Officer Seal asked about the bag, Defendant first did\n   not respond. When Officer Seal asked if he could see the bag, Defendant reached into the back seat as if to comply, but instead moved the bag containing credit cards onto the floor, while handing Officer Seal an empty bag which was located nearby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Observing these actions did not alleviate Officer Seal's suspicions about the credit cards. (ECF No. 193-4 at 3.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Seal then asked Defendant to exit the vehicle, and Defendant complied. (ECF No. 193-2 at 13.) While Defendant was speaking with Officer Seal, a K-9 unit arrived, including Officer Jason Papke and a trained drug-sniffing dog, Neo. (ECF No. 193-2 at 13.) According to Officer Seal's report, Defendant was detained at the time Officer Papke arrived, at approximately 2:47 a.m. (ECF No. 193-2 at 13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At approximately 2:50 a.m., Officer Seal began recording the traffic stop on an audio recorder. (ECF No. 193-3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At approximately 2:54 a.m., following a few minutes in which Defendant asked whether he was being detained, and why, Officer Papke asked if they could search the vehicle, and Defendant declined. (Tr. at 7-8.) At approximately 2:55 a.m., Defendant offered to take a sobriety test. (Tr. at 8.) Officer Seal conducted a field sobriety test-in particular, a horizontal gaze nystagmus or \"HGN\" test-beginning at approximately 2:56 a.m., or approximately 12 minutes after the traffic stop had begun. This took slightly less than 2 minutes to complete. (Tr. at 9-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Seal was satisfied that Defendant was not intoxicated, but still wanted to inquire about the credit cards. Therefore, approximately 15 minutes after initiating the stop, Officer Seal told Defendant that he was not under arrest but was \"just being detained ... until we can complete our investigation,\" and that \"because you are not free to leave,\" he informed Defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. (Tr. at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Seal then questioned Defendant regarding the credit cards, asking \"what's the deal with those credit cards\" and similar follow-up questions. (Tr. at 13.) Defendant responded by insisting he was not drunk or on drugs and had committed no crime, and generally questioning why he was being detained, but Defendant did not answer Officer Seal's questions regarding the credit cards. (Tr. at 13-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While Officer Seal was questioning Defendant about the credit cards, Officer Papke and Neo initiated a sniff of the exterior of the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 15.) Approximately 2 minutes after Officer Seal began questioning Defendant about the credit cards, Neo alerted, leading Officer Papke to open the vehicle's door and begin searching inside of the car. (Tr. at 15.) At this point, Officer Seal was still questioning Defendant about the credit cards. (Tr. at 13-16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The search inside the vehicle-which turned out to belong to Defendant's girlfriend, co-defendant Heather Carr-discovered a useable quantity of marijuana,\n   as well as an open container of what appeared to be an alcoholic beverage. This container was found sitting on the passenger side floorboard in such a position that the officers believed it could not have been in that position while the vehicle was in motion without spilling, making them suspect Defendant had placed it there subsequent to the traffic stop, as if to hide it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant was arrested and the vehicle was towed and impounded. The items inside it were inventoried and the bag of credit cards was seized and placed into evidence by the Tempe Police Department, along with a laptop computer found in the vehicle. (ECF No. 193-4 at 1.) In connection with its own investigation of Defendant and the crimes alleged in this case, DOE was notified of this evidence on December 6, 2012 (ECF No. 193-5), and in February 2013 sought and obtained a warrant to search the laptop (ECF No. 181-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant now seeks to suppress \"any and all evidence seized from the Defendant on or about August 30, 2012,\" arguing the seizure of evidence following the traffic stop was illegal and that the fact a warrant was later issued to search the laptop \"does nothing to remove the taint that emanated from the original seizure.\" (ECF No. 181 at 1, 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Before that questioning was complete, the drug dog had alerted, providing the officers a permissible basis to search the vehicle for illegal drugs, which they then found. Defendant argues that \"the alleged probable cause for the theft investigation\" and \"[t]he significance of [the] bag of credit cards\" are in dispute. (ECF No. 196 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Defendant\n   does not advance any factual argument or legal authority to contest the Government's showing that Officer Seal had an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, based on the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) Officer Seal's observation of a bag in plain view containing a large number of credit cards; (2) Defendant's refusal to answer any questions about them, (3) Defendant's attempt to hide the cards from Officer Seal by switching the credit cards for an empty bag, while Officer Seal looked on. The Court agrees with the Government that these circumstances created an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in the totality of the circumstances, thus permitting a reasonable period of additional detention (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , seizure) to question Defendant about the credit cards.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The relevant Fourth Amendment analysis is therefore not whether the dog sniff itself was impermissible, only whether the seizure of Defendant-that is, the additional period of detention during which the dog sniff was conducted-was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Officer Seal had a reasonable basis to detain to ask about the credit cards, and because the dog sniff itself was conducted while that questioning was occurring, the dog sniff did not constitute a Fourth Amendment violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Traffic Stop Was Not Unreasonably Prolonged by the Dog Sniff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, the record does not reflect that the traffic stop was unreasonably prolonged by the dog sniff. The animating Fourth Amendment concern in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and related cases is whether the stop was unreasonably prolonged: \"The critical question is not whether the\n   dog sniff occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket ... but whether conducting the sniff 'prolongs'-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , adds time to-'the stop.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to Defendant's argument, the record does not show that the investigation and checks related to the traffic stop were completed (much less abandoned) as soon as Officer Seal saw the credit cards. Rather, although he observed the credit cards early on in the traffic stop, Officer Seal then asked Defendant to exit his vehicle and completed the incidents of the traffic stop, including the HGN sobriety test, before turning to investigation of the credit cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Then,\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   Officer Seal was speaking with Defendant, the K-9 unit arrived, roughly 3 minutes after the 2:44 a.m. traffic stop commenced. The dog sniff was initiated shortly thereafter, no later than\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the time Officer Seal was questioning Defendant about the credit cards, and the dog alerted\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   Officer Seal's questioning about the credit cards continued. (Tr. at 13-16.) This record reflects two things. First, the time by which Defendant's detention was arguable prolonged after completion of the HGN test and before Neo alerted was no more than approximately 3 minutes, notably less than the 7 to 8 minute delay in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   . Second, and more importantly, this added time was the result of Officer Seal's questioning regarding the credit cards; it was not the result of the dog sniff which was conducted simultaneously. Thus the dog sniff did not unreasonably prolong the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This record does not suggest that officers may purposefully drag out the time they take to complete ordinary traffic checks in order to create opportunities for unrelated investigations absent objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. That is exactly the result which\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and related cases prohibit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1614, 1616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because addressing the [traffic] infraction is the purpose of the stop it may last\n   <em>\n    no longer than is necessary to effectuate that purpose\n   </em>\n   ,\" and \"[i]f an officer can complete traffic-based inquiries\n   <em>\n    expeditiously\n   </em>\n   , then that is the amount of 'time reasonably required to complete the stop's mission.' \" (internal quotation marks omitted; certain alterations incorporated; emphasis added)). But that is not what occurred here, where the officer had an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity unrelated to the traffic infraction, and where the additional detention was reasonable. Moreover, having reviewed the record as a whole, including the audio recording, the Court cannot say that Officer Seal's brief questioning regarding the credit cards was pretextual or dilatory. In this circumstance, the Court sees no Fourth Amendment violation calling for suppression of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Seizure Following Evidence Inventory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Other than generically arguing that the subsequent impoundment, inventory, and search of the laptop and credit cards was tainted by the alleged illegality of the original traffic stop, Defendant makes no Fourth Amendment argument regarding this sequence of events. Nor does he challenge the eventual search of the laptop pursuant to warrant, except to make a generic \"taint\" argument. (ECF No. 181 \u00b6 22.)

On that basis, Defendant argues that under the \"severability doctrine,\" the Court should hold the warrant invalid as to the mobile phones and suppress their use as evidence in this case.

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) The investigation had traced the originating IP addresses for these fraudulent applications to several residences, including\n   Defendant's.

Further, Special Agent Ellis averred that the search of Defendant's residence \"should include the search of any computer-based storage media,\" and that based on her experience, knowledge and training, \"suspects in similar investigations possess storage safes, computers, facsimile machines, cell phones, and pagers which they use as part of their method of operation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Furthermore, the affidavit incorporated by reference two attachments detailing the places and items to be searched. These (specifically, \"Attachment B\") explicitly and repeatedly called for search or seizure of \"cell phone[s],\" \"wireless communication devices such as ... mobile telephones,\" and \"[a]ny ... electronic ... device capable of storing data, such as ... cellular telephones.\" (ECF No. 194-1 at 4-7, \u00b6\u00b6 16.a, 17, 19.c.) This attachment was approved and included in the search warrant issued by the magistrate judge, as quoted above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) In sum, the affidavit (including Exhibit B) enumerated almost\n   <em>\n    ad nauseum\n   </em>\n   the many kinds of electronic devices and storage media that would likely contain evidence of criminal activity and would be subject to search and seizure. Mobile or cellular telephones were explicitly mentioned at least four times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Given this record, the Court has little trouble affirming the magistrate judge's conclusion that probable cause existed to seize the mobile phones. The affidavit made clear the investigators' well-founded suspicion that the suspects were using a wide variety of computer and electronic devices to submit allegedly fraudulent documents and to communicate with one another, and as a corollary, that records of their transactions and communications would likely be found stored on similarly variety of electronic devices.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gholston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4327587\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/993/704/#p719\">\n    993 F.Supp.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719-20 (E.D.

Applying the \"fluid concept\" of probable cause, and considering the complexity and reach of the criminal scheme described in the affidavit, the Court finds the warrant and supporting affidavit adequately provided probable cause to seize mobile phones and described them with sufficient specificity, along with a laundry list of other digital devices likely to contain evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p232\">\n    462 U.S. at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p232\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825768\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1104/#p1127\">\n    654 F.3d at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant's concession that the warrant was adequate as to everything else seized in his home is effectively fatal to his argument that \"the cellphones\" should be suppressed, or that the magistrate judge should have excluded mobile phones (and only mobile phones) from the warrant request, while approving it in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    , the officer suspected a drug crime and conducted a dog sniff \"[a]pproximately two and a half minutes\" after the traffic investigation was complete and the defendant had refused a consensual search.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290122\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/1224/#p1229\">\n     795 F.3d at 1229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Tenth Circuit found it a \"close question\" whether the officer had an articulable reasonable suspicion for further investigation, based on \"(1) Moore's nervousness, (2) Moore's acknowledgment [of] a prior criminal history, and (3) Moore's name being recently added to the vehicle's registration.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1229.
