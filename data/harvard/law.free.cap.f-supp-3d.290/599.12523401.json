(\"Teva USA\") [ECF #21]; and (2) a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim [ECF #25], filed by Defendant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (\"Teva Israel\").

The patents-in-suit relate to compositions, methods, and regimens for the treatment of rosacea, using ivermectin, an anti-parasitic medication used to treat infections caused by roundworms, threadworms, and other parasites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The patents-in-suit are listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the \"Orange Book\") as covering Soolantra\u00ae (ivermectin ) Cream 1% (\"Soolantra\u00ae\"), a topical prescription drug that contains ivermectin for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. Plaintiff Galderma Laboratories, L.P. is the owner and exclusive beneficial holder of the rights to market Soolantra\u00ae under the FDA approval of New Drug Application (\"NDA\") No. 206255, approved December 19, 2014. When a party files an NDA, the FDA requires the applicant to submit certain information regarding any patent that claims the drug, or a method of using the drug, that is the subject of the NDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.53\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The ANDA process permits a generic drug manufacturer to bypass the costly clinical trials and lengthy delays associated with the NDA process. As part of the ANDA process, the applicant must make a patent certification with respect to each patent that claims the listed drug or a use of such drug for which the applicant is seeking approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.94\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(12)(i)(A).

Under Section 271(e)(2)(A) of the Hatch-Waxman Act, however, the submission of an ANDA application with a paragraph IV certification constitutes an artificial act of infringement, which can form the basis of a claim for injunctive relief to prevent the approval, sale, or use of the generic drug until after the NDA holder's patent expires.\n   <em>\n    Caraco Pharm.

Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief that Defendants have and will infringe the patents-in-suit by filing the ANDA and by making or selling their accused generic creams. Plaintiffs also seek an order that the effective date of any FDA approval of the ANDA shall not be earlier than the expiration of the patents-in-suit, and other injunctive relief. Defendants generally contend the claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale, or importation of their accused generic ivermectin creams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Teva USA has filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(3) [ECF #21], arguing venue is not proper in this district under the patent venue statute, because Teva USA (1) is incorporated in Delaware, (2) has not committed any acts of infringement in the Northern District of Texas,\n   and (3) does not maintain a regular and established place of business in this district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Teva Israel has filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the ground that Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), which is the live pleading in this action, fails to plead sufficient facts to state a plausible case that Teva Israel is responsible for the alleged infringement, because the only alleged act of infringement is the submission of the ANDA, and Teva Israel had no role in submitting the ANDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With respect to Teva USA's Rule 12(b)(3) motion, the Federal Circuit issued a precedential opinion on the patent venue statute,\n   <em>\n    In re Cray, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed.

Because the\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   holding clarifies the venue analysis, which is particularly fact-specific, the Court allowed Plaintiffs to conduct limited venue-related discovery. Both parties filed additional evidence on the venue issue, and the Court held oral argument on Defendants' motions on November 6, 2017.

The Fifth Circuit has not ruled on which party bears the burden on a Rule 12(b)(3) motion.

The Delaware court concluded that the defendant's submission of the ANDA, the future acts the defendant intended to take upon ANDA approval, plus steps already taken by the applicant indicating its intent to market the ANDA product in the district, were sufficient to show that the defendant \"has committed\" acts of infringement in the district.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203980155\">\n    2017 WL 3980155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs urge the Court to adopt the Delaware court's reasoning and find that an act of infringement has occurred in the Northern District of Texas because Teva USA filed an ANDA and intends to market a generic version of Soolantra\u00ae in this district. Plaintiffs' argument closely follows the framework of the Delaware court's decision, pointing out the forward-looking nature of ANDA litigation and drawing heavily from the Federal Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Acorda\n   </em>\n   decision on specific personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While the Delaware court's opinion is very thorough, there are several issues with the decision that counsel this Court away from adopting the holding that an act of infringement occurs in any district where the ANDA filer intends to market the ANDA product after it receives FDA approval. \"First, and most prominently,\" as the opinion itself concedes, is that the plain language of the patent venue statute provides that venue is proper \"where the defendant\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     has committed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   acts of infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203980155\">\n    2017 WL 3980155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (emphasis added). In the Hatch-Waxman Act context, because the generic drug is not yet being marketed, the only act of infringement that actually has occurred is the filing of the ANDA. The Delaware court discerned an irreconcilable conflict between what the court characterized as the backward-looking nature\n   of the patent venue statute and the forward-looking nature of Hatch-Waxman Act litigation. To give the Hatch-Waxman Act full effect, the Delaware court determined that the acts of infringement an ANDA filer has committed must include all of the acts that would constitute ordinary patent infringement if, upon FDA approval, the generic drug product is launched into the market. This rationale is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, which does not identify any artificial act of infringement other than the ANDA submission. The Federal Circuit recently struck down a patent venue test crafted by a district court because the test was \"not sufficiently tethered\" to the statutory language.\n   <em>\n    In re Cray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Circuit's conclusion echoes the Supreme Court's instruction that Section 1400(b)\"is [not] to be given a 'liberal' construction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schnell v. Peter Eckrich &amp; Sons, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165070\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/260/#p264\">\n    365 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165070\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/260/#p264\">\n    81 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165070\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/260/#p264\">\n    5 L.Ed.2d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1961). In the sense of the\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   analysis, the Delaware court's approach to venue in ANDA cases is a liberal interpretation of the venue statute and, thus, inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs insist that their interpretation is not only consistent with the statute, it is required to give effect to the second part of Section 271(e)(2), which requires that the submission of an ANDA will be an act of infringement if the purpose of the submission is to obtain approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of a patented drug before the expiration of the patent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). This Court disagrees. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides that the submission of an ANDA constitutes an act of infringement for purposes of bringing a lawsuit. The statute itself recognizes the forward-looking nature of the litigation and identifies the ANDA submission as an artificial act of infringement on which a lawsuit can be based. The commencement of a lawsuit effectuates the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Act; it is not necessary to recognize additional speculative acts of infringement to give the statute effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   decision borrowed heavily from\n   <em>\n    Acorda\n   </em>\n   , but\n   <em>\n    Acorda\n   </em>\n   is a personal jurisdiction decision, not a venue decision.\n   <em>\n    In re Cray\n   </em>\n   , the most recent pronouncement from the Federal Circuit on the application of the patent venue statute, warns courts to \"be careful not to conflate showings that may be sufficient for other purposes, e.g., personal jurisdiction or the general venue statute, with the necessary showing to establish proper venue in patent cases.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cray, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This language provides a clear admonition to courts to avoid importing personal jurisdiction standards into a venue analysis. This Court declines to find that an act of infringement occurs wherever an ANDA filer intends to market the accused product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In determining proper venue in a Hatch-Waxman Act case, it is appropriate to look to the forum where the ANDA submission itself was prepared and submitted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs. v.

Aug. 13, 2009) (\"location of the preparation and submission of the ANDA\" is \"the location of the injury\" for venue purposes in Hatch-Waxman Act cases). Preparation of the ANDA submission\n   involves the compilation of information from multiple sources and completion of various FDA-required forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Forms and Submission Requirements,\n   <em>\n    https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm120955.htm\n   </em>\n   (updated Oct. 19, 2017). Among the information that must be included in the ANDA submission is: scientific data regarding the quality, safety, and efficacy of the proposed generic drug and the FDA-approved drug listed in the Orange Book, as well as data supporting the bioequivalence of the generic drug to the approved drug; patent information for the approved drug; information regarding the applicant's manufacturing facilities; and information pertaining to the proposed labeling and packaging for the generic drug.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202843288\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Submission of the actual ANDA is accomplished electronically.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202843288\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The FDA no longer accepts paper ANDA submissions.

The Supreme Court has recognized that this \"safe harbor\" includes preclinical research studies performed in connection with the development of a generic drug pertaining to the drug's safety and efficacy, the results of which would be relevant to, and possibly included with, an ANDA submission for the approval of a generic drug.\n   <em>\n    Merck KGaA v.

In this case, the Court is not relying on research or activities other than the preparation and actual submission of the ANDA itself. Here, there is no evidence-much less an allegation-that Teva USA prepared or submitted ANDA No. 210019 in or from the Northern District of Texas. The Court thus determines that venue is not proper in this district because no act of infringement occurred here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Teva USA committed an act of infringement in this District when it submitted the ANDA which included a paragraph IV challenge to Plaintiffs' patents, because Plaintiffs are residents of the Northern District. But Plaintiffs cite no authority for their assertion that the location of the patent holder is relevant to the patent venue analysis, and the patent venue statute does not provide for venue based on the plaintiff's residence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (providing that patent infringement case may be brought in the judicial district where (1) the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   resides, or (2) where the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business). Rather, the statute makes the submission of an ANDA an act of infringement. In this case, there is no dispute that the ANDA submission occurred outside this district. The Court therefore determines that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden to establish that an act of infringement occurred in this district. For this reason, the Court GRANTS Teva USA's Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Regular and Established Place of Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As an additional or alternative basis for granting the motion to dismiss for improper venue, the Court considers whether Teva USA has a regular and established\n   place of business in the Northern District, as required by the second prong of Section 1400(b) in order for venue to be proper in this district. As the Federal Circuit recently clarified, Section 1400(b)'s \"regular and established place of business\" clause imposes three requirements: \"(1) there must be a physical place in the district; (2) it must be a regular and established place of business; and (3) it must be the place of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"If any statutory requirement is not satisfied, venue is improper under \u00a7 1400(b).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With respect to the first requirement, \"[t]he statute requires a 'place,'\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , '[a] building or part of a building set apart for any purpose' or 'quarters of any kind' from which business is conducted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, Plaintiffs have not shown that TSM and Teva USA do not maintain formal corporate separateness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At the November 6 hearing, for the first time, Plaintiffs suggested the Court could impute the presence of TSM's employees to Teva USA under an alter ego theory or an agency theory. However, Plaintiffs did not plead either of these theories, and the Court declines to consider whether either type of relationship may exist in this case in the absence of any specific allegations of alter ego or agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [redacted] Plaintiffs argue that it is a disputed fact question as to whether Teva USA actually employs sales representatives in the United States. In support of their argument, Plaintiffs point to declarations from [redacted] and a recent job posting stating that Teva USA is recruiting sales representatives in the Northern District of Texas. Plaintiffs further contend Teva USA has judicially admitted in\n   two different lawsuits filed in the Northern District of Illinois that it employs sales representatives in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court determines proper venue from the facts as they existed at time the Plaintiffs' Original Complaint was filed.\n   <em>\n    Nutrition Physiology Corp. v.

Tex. 2000). Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertions, the evidence does not raise a fact question as to whether Teva USA employed any sales representatives in the Northern District of Texas in April 2017, when this lawsuit was filed. [redacted], and evidence about a different entity's employment practices does not raise a fact issue as to whether Teva USA employs sales representatives in the Northern District of Texas in 2017. [redacted] knowledge of Teva USA's employment practices ends in December 2013 and is too temporally attenuated to raise a fact issue as to Teva USA's current practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In a similar way, Teva USA's alleged judicial admissions also do not raise a fact question as to whether Teva USA employed any sales representatives in the Northern District of Texas in April 2017. In\n   <em>\n    Keen v. Teva USA\n   </em>\n   , 1:16-cv-09964, N.D. Ill., the plaintiff, Janice Keen, sued TSM and Teva USA for employment discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ans., Pl. Supp. App. at 255-61. In the answer filed in\n   <em>\n    Keen\n   </em>\n   , TSM and Teva USA admitted the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant, TEVA Sales and Marketing, Inc., ... during\n   <em>\n    2015-2016\n   </em>\n   issued Plaintiff, Janice Keen, IRS W-2 forms stating her employer was Defendant, Teva Sales and Marketing, Inc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   During\n   <em>\n    2013 and 2014\n   </em>\n   , at the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR), Defendant TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., ... claimed it was Plaintiff's employer notwithstanding no W-2 confirmation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   During the entire time Plaintiff was employed by Defendant TEVA, Plaintiff worked in the Chicago Metropolitan area as a Territory Sales Specialist and later an Executive Sales Specialist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11461963\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/87/648/#p652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4, 8 (emphasis added). Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, the Keen answer supports Teva USA's assertion that the sales representatives engaged in marketing Teva-branded drugs are currently employed by TSM. In\n   <em>\n    Stavropoulos v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 1:17-cv-04588, N.D. Ill., the plaintiff, Tara Stavropoulos, sued Teva USA for pregnancy discrimination. In its answer, Teva USA admitted that it employed Stavropoulos as a sales representative in the Rockford, Illinois sales territory from May 2010 through April 11, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 275, \u00b6\u00b68, 10-11. Although Stravopoulos's employment is closer in time to the relevant date for determining venue in this case, it is still too far removed to raise a fact issue as to whether Teva USA employed any sales representatives in the Northern District of Texas in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also rely on job postings from June and July 2017 that purportedly advertise for sales representative positions with Teva USA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. App. at 159-163. Although the banner at the top of the job listing includes Teva USA's logo, the postings themselves do not specify that the successful candidate would be employed by Teva USA. In fact, the first posting advertising for a respiratory sales specialist in Dallas, Texas, states that the job opportunity is with \"Teva Respiratory, LLC, a member of the Teva Pharmaceuticals family.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 159. The other job postings are silent as to the specific entity that is recruiting candidates. The Court concludes that this evidence does not raise a fact issue as to whether Teva USA employs\n   sales representatives anywhere in the United States, let alone the Northern District of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Having reviewed all the evidence, the Court finds that only two of the employees identified by Defendants as living and working in the district actually work for Teva USA: [redacted] There is no evidence that either of these two employees keep any inventory at their homes or distribute Teva-branded drugs directly to Defendants' customers. There is also no evidence that Teva USA conditioned [redacted] employment on their continued residence in the district. To the contrary, [redacted]. Nothing in the record indicates that Teva USA owned, leased, or rented any portion of [redacted] homes; nor is there any evidence that Teva USA played a part in these employees' selection of their homes in the Northern District of Texas. Teva USA did not hold out these employees' homes as the company's places of business, and no home addresses or personal phone numbers of the employees were listed in any directory or listing for Teva USA. The Court thus determines that neither [redacted] presence in the district warrants a finding that Teva USA has a regular and established place of business in this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regents of the University of Minnesota v.

Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a district court in Delaware denied a Rule 12(b)(6) motion finding that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to raise related corporate entities' active involvement in the preparation of an ANDA above the speculative level. However, the allegations deemed sufficient in\n   <em>\n    Cephalon\n   </em>\n   were more specific than Plaintiffs' allegations in this case. For example, the\n   <em>\n    Cephalon\n   </em>\n   complaint alleged that the related entities each took part in Generic Division operations and further alleged that each related entity contributed employees to the various teams responsible for preparing the ANDA, and employees of each related entity prepared and executed ANDA-related documents. There are no similar allegations in the FAC as to Teva Israel's involvement in preparing the ANDA. To the contrary, the FAC specifically alleges that Teva USA filed ANDA No. 210019, and Teva USA sent the Paragraph IV Certification. First Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Cephalon\n   </em>\n   further alleged that each related entity will be involved in the marketing and distribution of the accused generic drug if the ANDA is approved. Plaintiffs here make a similar allegation, but the allegation is a collective allegation against all the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   There are no specific facts alleged that Teva Israel will be involved in marketing the Accused Product. The\n   <em>\n    Cephalon\n   </em>\n   complaint survived dismissal because it contained more than the bare-bones assertions made in the FAC that Teva Israel, together with Teva USA, was involved in the submission of the ANDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Additionally, the court in\n   <em>\n    Cephalon\n   </em>\n   found that all the allegations together were sufficient to withstand dismissal. The case does not stand for the proposition that an allegation that a parent company will be involved in post-approval marketing and distribution, with no other facts, is sufficient to plausibly state that the parent company was actively involved in the submission of an ANDA by a subsidiary of the parent company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Two decisions from the Eastern District of Texas denied Rule 12(b)(6) motions on thinner allegations. First, in\n   <em>\n    Warner Chilcott Company, LLC v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20603309\">\n    2017 WL 603309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Tex. Jan. 19, 2017), the court determined that the plaintiffs adequately stated a claim that each related Defendant entity submitted the ANDA at issue based on allegations that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [T]he Mylan entities \"prepared ANDA No. 207826,\" that Mylan, Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, and Mylan Laboratories are \"agents of each other\" or \"work in active concert either directly or through one or more of their wholly owned subsidiaries\" to develop, manufacture, and sell generic drug products through the United States, and that Mylan Laboratories \"manufactured the Generic Product relied upon in ANDA No. 207826....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Warner Chilcott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20603309\">\n    2017 WL 603309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The court did not indicate that the complaint included any specific factual allegations beyond what was set forth in the opinion. The\n   <em>\n    Warner Chilcott\n   </em>\n   decision demands far less than was required in\n   <em>\n    Cephalon\n   </em>\n   , and likely less than the federal pleading standards require.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The other Eastern District of Texas case Plaintiffs point to is\n   <em>\n    Allergan, Inc. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201572193\">\n    2016 WL 1572193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Tex. Apr. 19, 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Allergan\n   </em>\n   , the defendants argued that the complaint failed to state a claim against the corporate parent entity because the parent did not prepare and submit the ANDA. However, the complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [Subsidiary] and [parent] are agents of each other and/or work in active concert with respect to the development, regulatory approval, marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, including the drug at issue in this case ... [and parent] markets and sells the drugs manufactured by [subsidiary]. [I]f the ANDA is approved [parent] will become the generic product's marketer, seller, and distributor in the United States, and that [parent] would benefit from the ANDA's approval.... [Parent] has worked in concert with [subsidiary] with respect to the regulatory approval of the drugs at issue in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Eastern District court found the allegations sufficient to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Despite the holdings of the two Eastern District of Texas decisions that generic, factually unsubstantiated allegations are sufficient to state a claim, the Court comes to a different conclusion here. Plaintiffs' allegations do not distinguish Teva Israel's conduct from Teva USA's conduct; nor are the allegations supported by any specific factual assertions that make the allegation more than a bare-bones conclusion. Additionally, it appears that Plaintiffs may simply have copied what they perceive to be \"magic words\" regarding active involvement from other decisions without demonstrating how those allegations can support a claim against Teva Israel in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiffs also assert that their allegations are sufficient to state a claim for inducement against Teva Israel because Plaintiffs have alleged that the Defendants, collectively, will be engaged in post-approval marketing and distribution of a generic version of Soolantra\u00ae. Regardless of the particular theory asserted, Plaintiffs' allegations against Teva Israel fail because they are not specific to Teva Israel. Rather, the FAC lumps together all of the Defendants. To survive dismissal, Plaintiffs must specifically allege facts that would support an inference that Teva Israel will be engaged in post-approval marketing and distribution of a generic version of Soolantra\u00ae. Plaintiffs indicate that they could allege additional facts about Teva Israel's ownership of the ANDAs and the revenues generated by those ANDAs, which may support the necessary inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs request leave to file an amended complaint setting forth more specific allegations, if the Court grants the Rule 12(b)(6) motion. This is a reasonable request, and the Court thus exercises its discretion to give Plaintiffs one last opportunity to cure the deficiencies identified herein. If all the parties do not consent to transfer this case to Delaware, Plaintiffs may file an amended complaint against Teva Israel only\n   <strong>\n    on or before December 15, 2017\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Also pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' opposed motion [ECF #47] for leave to file a First Supplemental Complaint and serve Supplemental Infringement Contentions, which seeks to add a related patent,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C782%2C425\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,782,425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"'425 Patent\") that did not exist when Plaintiffs filed their Original Complaint and FAC. The claims of the '425 Patent allegedly cover generic versions of Soolantra\u00ae, and the Supplemental Complaint alleges infringement of the '425 Patent based on the same accused product. Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' Motion on the ground that the Motion is futile, because their Motions to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint should be granted. The Court defers to the Delaware court consideration of Plaintiffs' request to file a supplemental complaint to assert the '425 Patent against Teva USA. If all the parties do not consent to transfer this case to Delaware, Plaintiffs may include allegations against Teva Israel pertaining to the '425 Patent in their amended complaint to be filed\n   <strong>\n    on or before December 15, 2017\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court determines that venue is not proper in this district as to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) because Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. did not commit any act of infringement in this district, nor does Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. have a regular and established place of business in this district. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.'s Rule 12(b)(3) Motion to Dismiss [ECF #21]. The parties, including Teva Israel, are directed to confer and advise the Court by\n   <strong>\n    no later than November 30, 2017\n   </strong>\n   , whether they consent to transfer the entire case to Delaware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Court further determines that the allegations in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint are not sufficient to state a claim that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. was actively involved in Teva USA's submission of the ANDA at issue. Therefore, the Court also GRANTS Defendant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim [ECF #25]. Plaintiffs' claims against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. are DISMISSED without prejudice. If all the parties do not consent to transfer this case to\n   Delaware, Plaintiffs may file an amended complaint against Teva Israel only\n   <strong>\n    on or before December 15, 2017\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, the Court GRANTS in part Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a First Supplemental Complaint and to serve Supplemental Infringement Contentions [ECF #47]. If all the parties do not consent to transfer this case to Delaware, Plaintiffs may include allegations against Teva Israel pertaining to the '425 Patent in their amended complaint to be filed on or before December 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Originally, the Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss was a joint motion by Teva USA and Actavis Laboratories UT, Inc. (\"Actavis\"). Plaintiffs dismissed their claims against Actavis on November 2, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Notice of Dismissal [ECF #52]. Accordingly, the Court considers the motion with respect to Teva USA only.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
