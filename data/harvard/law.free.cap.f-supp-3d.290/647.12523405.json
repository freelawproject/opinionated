While Conley's \u00a7 2255 Motion makes neither an argument of cause and actual prejudice, nor an assertion of actual innocence, his Objections to the Magistrate's Recommended Disposition does raise the question of innocence. [R. 163 at 9.] Given the unique posture of the case, the procedural default doctrine raises interesting concerns. However, the Court, like the Magistrate Judge, declines to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   opine on the procedural default issue and, instead, addresses the merits of Mr. Conley's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Conley first objects to Judge Wier's determination that\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   neither applies to the merits of Conley's case nor renders Conley's conviction void. [R. 163 at 3.] At the heart of Conley's \u00a7 2255 Motion, and his subsequent Objections to the Magistrate's Recommended Disposition, is the definition of \"official acts\" as that term relates to honest services fraud statutes. Although \"official acts\" has a statutory definition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   Court clarified that definition as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [A]n \"official act\" is a decision or action on a \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy.\" The \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy\" must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee. It must also be something specific and focused that is \"pending\" or \"may by law be brought\" before a public official. To qualify as an \"official act,\" the public official must make a decision or take an action on that \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy,\" or agree to do so. That decision or action may include using his official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an\n   \"official act,\" or to advise another official, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an \"official act\" by another official. Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so)-without more-does not fit that definition of \"official act.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2371-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, there are two requirements for an official act: (1) \"the Government must identify a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy that may at any time be pending or may by law be brought before a public official;\" and (2) \"the Government must prove that the public official made a decision or took an action 'on' that question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, or agreed to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2368 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). The\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   Court went to great lengths to provide substantive meaning to the statutory language.

Regarding the second requirement, the Court determined that \u00a7 201(a)(3) requires \"that the public official must make a decision or take an action\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   that question or matter, or agree to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).

He initially argues that the Government failed to identify a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy that may at anytime be pending or may by law be brought before any public official. [R. 163 at 4.] Conley asserts that \"modifying a bid is not a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy,\" and that \"there was no question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy pending before Conley.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Next, Conley argues he never \"made a decision or took an action\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   one of the questions, matters, causes, suits, proceedings, or controversies.\" [R. 163 at 6.] His theory is that \"non-sanctioned, or illegal conduct cannot be an official act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Conley contends the Government failed to meet\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   's first prong because it never identified a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy that may at anytime be pending or may by law be brought before any public official. [R. 163 at 4.] At the time the offense was committed, Conley was the Morgan County Judge Executive, and, as such, also a member of the Morgan County Fiscal Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [R. 163 at 5]; KRS \u00a7 67.040. One responsibility of the Fiscal Court is to oversee the solicitation of bids and the awarding of contracts for certain public construction projects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [R.159 at 9-10]; KRS \u00a7 178.140. The gist of Conley's argument is that his bid-rigging conduct does not qualify as a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy because that conduct occurred prior to the bids being submitted to the Fiscal Court for awarding of the contracts. [R. 163 at 4.] Although Conley acknowledges that \"[t]he only question that was arguably pending in front of any public official or body was the question of what company would be awarded contracts ...,\" he argues such a question was pending not before him but before the Morgan County Fiscal Court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In satisfaction of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   's first prong, the United States identified a focused and concrete question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy that is similar in nature to an administrative determination or hearing. The Government identified as questions, matters, causes, suits, proceedings, or controversies \"the bidding on the public project,\" \"[t]he bidding process for bridge construction contracts,\" and \"[t]he selection of the winning bidder for bridge projects.\" [R. 159 at 9-10.] Additionally, Conley's indictment and plea agreement also outline certain questions, matters, causes, suits, proceedings, or controversies. The indictment identified \"the formal process for hiring construction contractors\" for Morgan County projects and described the bidding process used to award such contracts. [R. 1.] The plea agreement described the bidding process used by Morgan County in awarding certain bridge construction contracts in 2013. [R. 124 at 2.] Conley, in his plea agreement, admitted to rigging certain bids and submitting the rigged bids under false pretenses to the Morgan County Fiscal Court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The process by which certain public construction contracts were awarded in Morgan County in 2013 constituted a \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy\" that may at any time be pending or may by law be brought before a public official. The bidding process and the awarding of the contract was at a time pending before, and by law brought before, the Morgan County Judge Executive and the Morgan County Fiscal Court, which had the final approval authority to award such contracts. Thus, the Government satisfied the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Conley next focuses on the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   test arguing he never made a decision or took an action\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy. [R. 163 at 6.] He contends that \"non-sanctioned, or illegal conduct cannot be an official act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] His dispute concentrates heavily on his fraudulent activity of altering a contractor's bid, and asserts that such fraudulent conduct, \"by virtue of its fraudulence, cannot ever be performed in an official capacity.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] For support, Conley looks to\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   's finding that certain acts, \"absent an ulterior motive, [are] perfectly acceptable function[s] of Government.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Conley also asserts he neither \"used his official position to exert pressure on\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   official to perform an 'official act,' \" nor \"provide[d] advice or information forming a decisional basis for other officials to award construction projects.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Conley's admitted conduct satisfies the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   test as he clearly made a decision or took an action\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   the \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy.\" Conley's focus on the rigging of bids as an official act is misplaced. Instead, the official act here is the bidding process and awarding of certain public construction contracts by the Fiscal Court, to whom Conley submitted information that formed the basis for the Fiscal Court's decisions. These activities are generally acceptable governmental functions; however, Conley's ulterior motive of receiving kickbacks from certain contractors who were awarded contracts removes the activity from the category of generally acceptable acts. To be certain, Governor McDonnell and at least one other district court have acknowledged that the awarding of a governmental contract satisfies the pre- and post-\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   definitions of an official act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2365 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   noted, it is enough\n   that \"a public official uses his official position to provide advice to another official, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an 'official act' by another official....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conley admitted to selecting and submitting bids to the Morgan County Fiscal Court in order to have certain contracts awarded to PBTHNOJJ Construction, from whom Conley received monetary kickbacks. [R. 124 at 2.] Conley provided the Fiscal Court with the information it needed in order to award those construction contracts. [R. 124 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As Judge Executive, Conley was charged with selecting the lowest bidder for construction contracts and presenting those selections to the Fiscal Court for approval and contract award. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 159 at 10; R. 124 at 2; R. 1 at 1-2.] For certain projects, Conley \"selected PBTHNOJJ Construction as the lowest bidder and later presented his selection for approval by the Morgan County Fiscal Court.\" [R. 159 at ----10.] On at least one of those projects, Conley rigged PBTHNOJJ's bid to make it appear to be the lowest submitted bid. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Because Conley knew he would receive monetary kickbacks if PBTHNOJJ Construction was awarded the contracts, he provided the information to the Fiscal Court knowing or intending that such advice would form the basis for the Fiscal Court's official act of awarding the contracts to PBTHNOJJ Construction. [R. 124 at 2.] Conley avers that the Fiscal Court was \"not required to always select the bids proposed.\" [R. 163 at 7];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   KRS 178.140. While the Fiscal Court was free to reject all bids, if it opted to award a contract, it was obligated to award the contract to the lowest bidder meeting certain other statutory requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS 178.140(2) (\"The contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder, who shall furnish satisfactory security in an amount equal to the amount of the contract in question, to be approved by the county judge/executive of the county.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Even if\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   applies to the merits of Conley's case, habeas relief is not warranted under this objection because the two-prong\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   test regarding official acts has been met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the Government identified the process by which certain public construction contracts were awarded in Morgan County as a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy that may at any time be pending or may by law be brought before a public official, to wit, the Morgan County Judge Executive and/or the Morgan County Fiscal Court. Second, Conley, as Morgan County Judge Executive, used his official position to provide advice and information, albeit under false pretenses, to the Morgan County Fiscal Court knowing or intending that such advice would form the basis for the Morgan County Fiscal Court's decision to award certain contracts to PBTHNOJJ Construction, from whom Conley received monetary kickbacks. For these reasons, the Court denies \u00a7 2255 relief on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his second objection, Mr. Conley urges the Court to vacate his\n   conviction because his guilty plea was not entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. [R. 163 at 8.] The basis of this objection is that his understanding of the law regarding honest services mail fraud was not in line with\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   's subsequent clarification of \"official acts,\" which, when applied to Conley's conduct, exonerates him of honest services mail fraud. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Conley argues that because the term \"official act\" has a specific definition as to an element of honest services mail fraud, and because his understanding of that term was different than the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   definition, his plea was involuntary and unintelligent.

[R.163 at 8.] During Conley's Rule 11 plea colloquy, the Government articulated the elements of honest services mail fraud as they existed at the time. [R. 136 at 26-27.] When the Court inquired of Mr. Conley whether he thought the Government could prove those elements at a trial, Conley answered in the affirmative. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.] The Court then directed Conley's attention to the more detailed facts outlined in the negotiated plea agreement [R. 124 at 2-3], and asked whether those facts were true. [R. 136 at 27.] After consulting with his attorney, Conley again answered in the affirmative. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] While it is true that during the Rule 11 colloquy, Conley himself did not articulate with great clarity his conduct in relation to the elements of the charged offense, the Court was satisfied that Conley was \"competent and capable of entering an informed plea.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The facts to which Conley admitted, as articulated on the record and outlined in his plea agreement, continue to satisfy the elements of honest services mail fraud, even post-\n   <em>\n    McDonnell.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   clarification does not take Conley's conduct out of the reach of the honest services mail fraud statute.

[R. 159 at 28-30.] Conley acknowledges that McDonnell's case was proceeding through trial at the time Conley entered his plea, and that Conley's\n   pretrial counsel was \"not expected to be a fortune-teller.\" [R. 163 at 10.] However, Conley claims his attorney should have had \"knowledge of significant cases that [were] pending,\" and \"[a]t a minimum ... should have advised him that this area of the law was unsettled.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Governor McDonnell had not yet been sentenced when Conley pled guilty and the undersigned sentenced Conley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Conley could not have relied on\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   in any proceeding leading up to his sentencing. Because\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   had not been decided at the time Conley was sentenced, Conley's objection requires that his pretrial counsel predict not only the outcome of McDonnell's criminal trial, but also the result of any and all subsequent appellate proceedings. Following this Circuit's precedent, the effectiveness of Conley's pretrial counsel will not be adjudged for failing to predict or anticipate a subsequent development in the law. Thus, Conley fails to show his trial counsel was deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Conley attempts to establish prejudice and show a potential different outcome by relying on\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

[R. 163 at 11.] In support of this argument, Conley states, \"[n]ow that\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   has limited the scope of actions which constitute 'official acts,' Conley no longer qualifies\" for the four-level official acts enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As noted by Judge Wier, Conley neither specifies which Guideline allows for an official acts enhancement, nor establishes where in the record such an enhancement was applied to his sentencing guideline calculation. [R. 159 at 30, n.20.] The Court has reviewed Conley's Presentence Investigation Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   [R. 134]. Conley correctly states his total offense level was calculated to be 27; however, he incorrectly claims a four-level official acts enhancement was part of that calculation. [R. 163 at 11.] The only four-level enhancement applied to his guideline calculation is under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1(b)(3) because the offense involved an elected public official. While it is true, based on the\n   <em>\n    Background Commentary\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 2C1.1, a criminal defendant may receive a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2C1.1(b)(3) where a payment is made \"for the purpose of influencing an official act by certain officials,\" that is not the reason for the enhancement in Conley's case. Conley, as Morgan County Judge Executive, was an elected public official. As such, Conley received the four-level enhancement under the plain language of \u00a7 2C1.1(b)(3) because his offense involved an elected public official. The Court therefore denies \u00a7 2255 relief on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In conclusion, after reviewing\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the entire record, as well as the relevant case law and statutory authority, the Court agrees with Judge Wier's analysis of Conley's claims. The Court also denies a certificate of appealability pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) as to each issue asserted.

DE # 153-1, at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[I]llegal conduct cannot be an official act[.]\"). The Court rejects this remarkable theory out of hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   First, it ignores a large swath of Conley's admitted conduct: not only did he rig bids, but he then, in his capacity as a member of (and\n   <strong>\n    the\n   </strong>\n   executive of) the Fiscal Court, presented the bids, without divulging he had rigged them, to the Fiscal Court \"for approval.\" DE # 124, at \u00b6\u00b6 3(b)-(c). Thus, even ignoring Conley's fraudulent bid altering, presenting bids for Fiscal\n   Court approval unquestionably counts among Conley's official duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   More fundamentally, the argument suffers at root from using the wrong frame of reference. The question is not (in Conley's specious formulation) whether committing fraud or other illegality itself falls within a public official's official duties. No official has fraud as a job function. The question-which Conley fails to perceive-is whether \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   decision or action\" of the official-fraudulent or not-is \"on\" a \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\" that may be pending or lawfully brought before any official in his \"official capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (emphasis added).
