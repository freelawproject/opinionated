Walker, United States District Judge\n  The Florida Department of Corrections (\"FDC\") is charged with the care of over 98,000 inmates. At least 7,000 of those inmates-and perhaps as many as 20,000-are infected with the Hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\"). The issue in this case is whether FDC is screening, evaluating, and treating HCV-infected inmates in a manner that comports with constitutional requirements.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  After holding a five-day hearing (including testimony from expert witnesses, FDC officials, and FDC inmates), this Court finds that FDC has not treated HCV-infected inmates as required by the Constitution. Moreover, although FDC has tried to moot this case by promising to change its practices going forward, this Court finds that a preliminary injunction is necessary to ensure that inmates with HCV receive medical care in a timely manner consistent with constitutional requirements. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is\n  <strong>\n   GRANTED\n  </strong>\n  .\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Hepatitis\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C and the Progression of Liver Disease\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   HCV \"is a viral infection, which is spread by exposure to blood or blood products.\" Pls.' Ex. 28, at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The most common way of contracting HCV is through intravenous drug use, but a person can also get infected through tattooing or blood transfusions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The principal consequence of [HCV] infection is infection of the liver, which causes inflammation that in turn may result in scarring of the liver (fibrosis).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unlike a scar on your skin, scarring of the liver can have severe consequences. \"Liver scarring can significantly impair liver function and damage its crucial role in filtering toxins from the blood, as well as making proteins involved in liver clotting and fighting infections.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, liver scarring places patients \"at risk of liver failure or liver cancer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Liver failure carries with it a host of serious symptoms, including bleeding from any site, fluid accumulation in the legs or abdomen, life-threatening infections, and failure of other organs such as the kidneys.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Liver cancer is essentially untreatable, and \"has a very dismal prognosis.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The amount of liver scarring a patient has is usually measured on the METAVIR scale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. On this scale, a person can be classified F0 (no fibrosis), F1 (mild fibrosis), F2 (moderate fibrosis), F3 (severe\n   fibrosis), or F4 (cirrhosis ). ECF No. 138, at 166.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rate at which patients progress along this scale differs among the population. Defendant's Exhibit 1 includes a useful flowchart demonstrating this difference in progression:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Def.'s Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As can be seen in the flowchart, about 20-50% of people infected with HCV spontaneously clear the virus within six months of infection. ECF No. 138, at 58. The remaining 50-80% who don't clear the virus are referred to as having chronic HCV.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Among those with chronic HCV, about 30% of patients maintain a stable chronic infection, 40% suffer from slow fibrosis progression, and 30% suffer from rapid fibrosis progression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patients with a stable chronic infection usually only reach F1 (mild fibrosis) as long as they maintain other healthy habits such as abstaining from alcohol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. Patients with a slow fibrosis progression may take upwards of 20 years to reach F4 (cirrhosis ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, patients with a rapid fibrosis progression may reach cirrhosis within as short a timeframe as one year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The extent of liver scarring a patient has does not necessarily correlate with the symptoms they are suffering. For instance, \"[s]omebody can be completely asymptomatic and present with cirrhosis.\" ECF No. 138, at 51. Nor do \"symptoms have anything to do with what the risk is of liver failure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Once a person reaches F4 (cirrhosis ), they are further classified based on whether they are suffering from HCV-related symptoms/complications. A patient with cirrhosis and no related complications is referred to as having compensated cirrhosis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. On the other hand, a patient with cirrhosis that is accompanied with complications is referred to as having decompensated cirrhosis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The distinction between these two groups is important because their survival rates are markedly different. Whereas the five-year survival rate for someone with compensated cirrhosis is 91%, the five-year survival rate for someone with decompensated cirrhosis is only 50%. Pls.' Ex. 28, at 6-7. Once a person has decompensated cirrhosis \"their liver has truly failed.\" ECF No. 138, at 99. At that point, \"the only true curative treatment is a liver transplant.\" Pls.' Ex. 28, at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Treatment of Hepatitis C\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Historically, HCV has been \"difficult to treat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. One old method of treatment involved the drugs Interferon and Ribavirin. ECF No. 138, at 62-63. That treatment required weekly injections and could take as long as twelve months to complete.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pls.' Ex. 28, at 9. The side effects were \"terrible.\" ECF No. 138, at 62. Taking the treatment was akin to \"having the flu for a year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"People's hair fell out, they had rashes, they had chest pain, they felt suicidal, [and] some committed suicide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. Despite these side effects, doctors still prescribed the treatment when patients had a high level of liver scarring because \"the likelihood of getting to cure, which was still only about 30 percent, was better than those terrible side effects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But in late 2013 a new class of drugs known as direct-acting antivirals (\"DAAs\") were released to market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These DAAs proved to be \"a revolution in medicine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Treatment with DAAs consists of taking a pill once or twice a day.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 28, at 10. The treatment period with DAAs is only about twelve-weeks long. ECF No. 138, at 64. Moreover, DAAs have \"very few\" side effects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Most importantly, about 95% of patients who take DAAs are cured of HCV.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Unfortunately, this revolution in medicine came with a price. DAAs \"are very expensive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74. In September of 2016, a single course of treatment with DAAs cost approximately $50,000 to $75,000. ECF No. 151, at 34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though prices have been going down as new DAAs are released, a single course of treatment may still cost $37,000 today.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Despite the high cost of DAAs, the present-day standard of care is to treat chronic-HCV patients with DAAs as long as there are no contraindications or exceptional circumstances. It is inappropriate to only treat those with advanced levels of fibrosis. ECF No. 138, at 66-67, 73;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. The HCV Guidance-a resource developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AALSD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)-recommends giving DAAs to any patient with chronic HCV (absent certain contraindications).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

ECF No. 138, at 136-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   FDC has known about the Plaintiffs' conditions for years. Mr. Hoffer likely had cirrhosis as early as 2012 and likely developed decompensated cirrhosis\"around the midpoint of 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136. Mr. Hoffer needs to be referred for a liver transplant evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138.

Doctors realized that Mr. McPherson had cirrhosis during a gallbladder surgery in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. McPherson should have been treated as soon as doctors realized he had cirrhosis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Molina likely had cirrhosis as early as 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 141. Although an ultrasound in April of 2016 showed that his liver was normal, doctors failed to account for his enlarged spleen, which is indicative of cirrhosis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   All three Plaintiffs have been complaining about their lack of treatment for years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

On May 11, 2017, Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit against the Secretary of FDC. ECF No. 1. After months of litigating, FDC has finally begun to treat Plaintiffs with DAAs. ECF No. 138, at 136-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Even though Plaintiffs are receiving the treatment they want, this case is not yet over. In addition to seeking relief for themselves, Plaintiffs also moved to certify a class of \"all current and future prisoners in FDC custody who have been diagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV).\" ECF No. 10, at 2. This Court has already granted Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. ECF No. 152. Accordingly, this case may proceed with Plaintiffs seeking relief for the class.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.

ECF No. 151, at 5. In 2013, those contractors were Corizon and Wexford.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20Fed.%20Appx.%20816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under FDC's contracts with Corizon and Wexford, there were two ways that doctors could obtain drugs. Most drugs were listed on an FDC-approved list, referred to as the formulary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Those drugs were readily available to doctors and were paid for directly by FDC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Drugs not listed on the formulary had to be specially requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Maier. Specially requested drugs were paid for by Corizon or Wexford.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When DAAs came out in late 2013, they were not included on the formulary. ECF No. 151, at 6-7. Nevertheless, Dr. Scott Kennedy (who worked for Corizon at the time) decided to assemble twelve inmates (the \"Kennedy 12\") with the goal of treating them with DAAs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Maier. By the end of 2014, the Kennedy 12 had been assembled and thoroughly evaluated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the Kennedy 12 were never given any DAAs because the necessary\n   funds were not available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This was so despite the fact that all twelve inmates showed signs of advanced liver damage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As the years went on, FDC officials recognized that inmates were dying from HCV because they were not being treated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (discussing conversations with Dr. Long Do). Similarly, Mr. Reimers, the FDC administrator responsible for overseeing the contractors, recognized that inmates with HCV were not being treated and found the lack of treatment to be unacceptable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 151, at 10, 40-43. Again, the reason why inmates weren't being treated was because of a lack of funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By mid-2016, FDC had updated its HCV-treatment policy to acknowledge that prescribing DAAs was the standard of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 8, at 6-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But again, the funding was not available to treat anyone. In 2015, Mr. Reimers prepared a legislative budget request of $6.5 million to obtain DAAs for the 2016-17 fiscal year, but the request never made it out of FDC (i.e., someone in FDC denied it).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 151, at 44-45. In 2016, Mr. Reimers prepared a $29 million request for the 2017-18 fiscal year, but that too never made it out of FDC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Eventually, Corizon and Wexford's contracts with FDC ended, and FDC began a new contract with Centurion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. But the change in contractor did not come with a change in behavior; inmates with HCV were still not being treated. Indeed, to date only thirteen inmates have been treated with DAAs (three of those being the named Plaintiffs in this case).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 47-48;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

The first is FDC's HCV-treatment policy. The second is a letter sent by Mr. Reimers (FDC's current Director of Health Services) to Centurion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    FDC's Treatment Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   FDC's treatment policy for HCV is enshrined in an ever-evolving document titled \"HSB 15.03.09 Supplement # 3.\" There are four different versions of the policy in the record, the earliest dating back to September 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 7; Def.'s Ex. 8; Def.'s Ex. 9; Def.'s Ex. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The most recent version of FDC's policy was created in October 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Ex. 10. Broadly speaking, it specifies how and when doctors should screen, evaluate, and treat inmates with HCV.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716177\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/488/#p495\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, as to screening the policy notes that \"[t]he preferred screening test for HCV infection is an immunoassay\" and that \"[s]creening will be offered to all patients, regardless of risk factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. As to treatment, the policy sets out eligibility criteria and groups patients into four priority levels based on the severity of their conditions and other considerations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8. Generally speaking, patients with the most severe conditions are grouped in \"Priority Level 1-Highest Priority for Treatment,\" and patients with the least severe conditions are grouped into \"Priority Level 4-Routine for Treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, FDC was operating under an older version of the policy. Plaintiffs identified several shortcomings with the policy at the time, but a number of those shortcomings have been resolved.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11, at 21-23,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 10. Nevertheless, the policy still has shortcomings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Indeed, Defendant's own expert, Dr. Dewsnup, admitted that the policy needs\n   to be fixed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. That admission is significant because Dr. Dewsnup is in charge of drafting FDC's policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That is, after this litigation ensued, FDC hired Dr. Dewsnup not only to serve as an expert witness for purposes of the hearing before this Court, but also for purposes of guiding and advising FDC's policies and practices for treating HCV.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, this Court finds that Defendant needs to update FDC's policy in light of the shortcomings identified by Dr. Dewsnup at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Reimers's Letter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Mr. Reimers sent a letter on behalf of FDC to the CEO of Centurion (FDC's current medical contractor). Def.'s Ex. 20. The stated purpose of the letter \"is to follow-up on a discussion\" between Dr. Whalen (FDC's Chief Clinical Advisor) and Dr. Cherry (Centurion's medical director for FDC).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During that discussion, Dr. Whalen allegedly asked Dr. Cherry \"to identify Priority 1 Level patients, and\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   Priority 2 patients, for HCV treatment in accordance with HSB 15.0.3.09 Supplement 3.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Mr. Reimers's letter memorializes FDC's intent that those inmates, \"once identified as appropriate for treatment, receive DAA medications during Fiscal Year 2017/2018.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter then continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Going forward, we are requesting that you ensure that all patients diagnosed with HCV have been identified and properly prioritized in accordance with HSB 15.03.09 Supplement 3.

Supplement 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Ostensibly, the letter seem to be an attempt to moot this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was drafted less than a week before this Court's hearing, and soon after it was written Defendant moved for a case management conference to discuss the fact that Plaintiffs had received the relief they wanted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 128. Whatever FDC's intended effect may have been, the letter does not moot this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Indeed, FDC's own expert, Dr. Dewsnup, testified that FDC should be treating many more inmates than what was promised in Mr. Reimers's letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. Dr. Dewsnup also testified that FDC should be treating inmates at a faster rate than what was promised in Mr. Reimers's letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In fact, even if FDC's promises\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   good enough, Dr. Dewsnup testified that FDC currently lacks the system capacity to be able to accomplish what it has promised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Dr. Dewsnup testified that FDC needs more practitioners to screen, evaluate, and treat inmates in a timely fashion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This Court agrees with Dr. Dewsnup's conclusions. Since the Kennedy 12 were first assembled in 2014, up to and including\n   of this very litigation, FDC has been extremely slow to respond to the serious issue of treating HCV-infected inmates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if FDC were excused for Corizon and Wexford's failures,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   when Centurion came on board in mid-2016 Dr. Dewsnup specifically told Dr. Cherry to develop a list of patients with HCV-inmates and to stage them appropriately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. Over a year has passed, and the completion of the list and staging process has barely begun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This Court has no doubt that without a court-ordered injunction, FDC is unlikely to treat inmates in a constitutionally appropriate manner. In fact, Defendant's own expert, Dr. Dewsnup, testified that an injunction is necessary for FDC to respond to this problem with the requisite alacrity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. This Court finds Dr. Dewsnup's testimony to be credible, and accordingly finds that FDC must comply with the treatment directions and timelines Dr. Dewsnup identified at the hearing with some clarifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"The final requirement for a deliberate indifference claim is that a defendant have a causal connection to the constitutional harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Goebert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047335\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/1312/#p1326\">\n    510 F.3d at 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Most of the witnesses who testified before this Court, and even Defendant's own expert, all but admitted that Defendant has been deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs' (and the class's) serious medical needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, FDC's promises and plan for the future are simply not good enough. Relying heavily on the testimony of Defendant's expert, Dr. Dewsnup, this Court finds that an injunction is necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs and the class receive timely and appropriate medical care in a manner that complies with the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Accordingly, with limited exceptions, this Court is ordering Defendant to ensure that FDC complies with its own expert's recommendations. Specifically, FDC must update its HCV-treatment policy (HSB 15.03.09 Supplement # 3) in line with the shortcomings noted by Dr. Dewsnup during the hearing before this Court so that there is a clear plan for doctors and practitioners to follow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, FDC must formulate a plan to implement its policy by screening, evaluating, and treating inmates in line with the directions and timelines identified by Dr. Dewsnup during the hearing before this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent FDC does not have the system capacity to meet these requirements, it must increase its capacity and outline a timetable for doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As to system capacity, Dr. Dewsnup testified that FDC will likely only be able to evaluate inmates at a rate of 100 per month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Test. of Dr. Dewsnup. To the extent Dr. Dewsnup finds this rate acceptable, this Court disagrees. Dr. Dewsnup testified that, as long as otherwise eligible, inmates with decompensated cirrhosis should be treated immediately, inmates with cirrhosis should be treated within three to six months, and inmates with F2 and F3 fibrosis scores should be treated within a year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123951\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/325/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Dr. Dewsnup testified that the balance of the infected inmates, with F1 and F0 fibrosis scores, should continue to be monitored, including restaging labs every six months. This Court agrees with those timelines, and\n   FDC needs to increase its system capacity to be able to satisfy them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This Court recognizes that these directions are broad. To be clear, this was done at Defendant's request. During closing arguments before this Court, Defendant stated that she wishes to prepare a plan in light of this Court's directions. Accordingly, at this stage this Court is only providing overarching guidance of how it believes FDC should address HCV treatment going forward. This guidance is consistent with the opinions expressed by Dr. Dewsnup during his testimony before this Court. Defendant shall be permitted to provide a more specific plan, and this Court will consider Defendant's plan before entering a preliminary injunction. In so ruling, this Court notes that Defendant must move with \"alacrity.\" This Court will not tolerate further foot dragging. If Defendant needs further direction from this Court with respect to what the proposed plan must contain then Defendant shall contact this Court no later than Monday, November 20, 2017, to schedule a telephonic hearing to be held no later than November 22, 2017. It was been represented to this Court at hearing that Defendant is already in the process of formulating and implementing such a plan. Stated otherwise, Defendant has already had time to refine its plan and marshal resources to address this problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   1.
