INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of a claim that Defendant, Minersville Area School District,\n   prohibited Plaintiff, an eight-year-old girl attending Minersville Elementary School, from using the girl's bathroom while at school or at school sponsored events. The dispute centers on the allegations that Defendant had a policy dictating that children must use the bathroom corresponding to the sex listed on the student's birth certificate and Plaintiff-who uses a female name, dresses in clothing traditionally associated with females, and presents herself to the world as a female-was assigned the sex of male at birth. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint asserts that the school district's policy of prohibiting her from using the girl's bathroom has violated her rights under both Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Fourteenth Amendment. (Doc. 10). Presently before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 11). For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleges the following facts which, for the purposes of resolving Defendant's Motion, the Court takes as true:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, A.H., is an eight-year-old girl currently enrolled in the second grade at Minersville Elementary School. (Doc. 10 at \u00b6 2). Plaintiff is transgender, \"meaning that she was assigned the sex of male at birth but she has a female gender identity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). While in kindergarten, Plaintiff was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a condition recognized in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders which, according to the Amended Complaint, \"refers to clinically significant distress that can result when a person's gender identity differs from the person's sex assigned at birth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Under the care of a pediatric psychologist, Plaintiff and her family have been exploring ways for Plaintiff to express her gender identity at home, in school, and in the community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiff enrolled in kindergarten at the Minersville Elementary School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). Minersville Elementary School is part of the Minersville Area School District, a public school district in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, that is the recipient of federal financial assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 103). Since beginning kindergarten in 2014, Plaintiff has continuously presented herself both in and out of school as a female. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-23). Plaintiff uses a female name, dresses in clothing traditionally associated with females, is addressed using female pronouns, and is known to her classmates as a female student. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the start of the 2014 school year, Plaintiff's mother, Tracey Handling, requested that the school allow Plaintiff to use the girl's bathroom but was told by the district superintendent, Carl McBreen, that the school could not make such an allowance because of the privacy rights of the other students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 24-25). The school, however, did allow Plaintiff the option of using a unisex bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). Because the kindergarten classroom has a single use bathroom for use by all the students, bathroom usage was not a significant problem for Plaintiff during the 2014-2015 school year except for one incident in May of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 33). While on a field trip, school staff made Plaintiff wait while all the other students used the bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). After the male students were finished, a teacher cleared the boy's bathroom of students and then made Plaintiff use it by herself while her classmates waited. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35). The incident upset Plaintiff and resulted in some of her classmates asking her why\n   she, as a girl, was using the boy's bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Plaintiff's mother questioned the school's principal, James Yacobacci, about the incident, he informed Ms. Handling that it was school policy that a child must use the bathroom that corresponds with the sex listed on the child's birth certificate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 42). During the conversation, Principal Yacobacci stated that it was his \"job to protect all of the students from [Plaintiff].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43). Despite requesting a copy of the school's bathroom policy from Superintendent McBreen and Principal Yacobacci, Plaintiff's mother was never shown a policy that would prohibit Plaintiff from using the girl's bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before the 2015-2016 school year began, Plaintiff's mother once again requested that the school allow Plaintiff to use the girl's bathroom while at school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51). The school, through Superintendent McBreen, denied Plaintiff's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52). Superintendent McBreen expressed that he did not believe there would be much acceptance from other parents if Plaintiff was allowed to use the girl's bathroom and added that \"Minersville isn't ready for this.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 56). Soon thereafter, while giving a school tour to Ms. Handling, Principal Yacobacci repeatedly referred to Plaintiff using male pronouns despite being corrected by Plaintiff's mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Once Plaintiff began grade school, there was no single use bathroom in her classroom, and Plaintiff began using the unisex bathroom in the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 68-69). In February of 2016, staff from the Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center provided training to the Minersville Area School District on the topic of transgender students and the requirements of Title IX with respect to bathroom use policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-66). In March of 2016, Principal Yacobacci told Ms. Handling that for Plaintiff to be allowed to use the girl's bathroom while on a school field trip, Ms. Handling would have to accompany Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 27, 2016, soon after the Department of Justice and the Department of Education issued a guidance document on how schools should accommodate transgender students with respect to bathrooms, Plaintiff's mother was told by Superintendent McBreen that Plaintiff would now be allowed to use the girl's bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82-83). Plaintiff began using the girl's bathroom during the last week of the 2015-2016 school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85). The school, however, has not created any policy on bathroom access for transgender students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84, 86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Further, while the Court recognizes that the Amended Complaint seems to indicate that Plaintiff now has access to the girl's bathroom at school and thus may not have alleged any continuing violation of Title IX, that does not undercut the fact that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that a violation of Title IX occurred at some point in time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To the extent that Defendant is arguing that the lack of formal guidance and the school's attempts to accommodate Plaintiff show that Defendant did\n   not, as a matter of law, have discriminatory intent, this argument fails on two fronts. First, in a private cause of action brought pursuant to Title IX, \"both injunctive relief and damages are available.\"\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch.

Specifically, Plaintiff has alleged that Principal Yacobacci stated that it was his \"job to protect all of the students from [Plaintiff]\" and that Superintendent McBreen, referring to Plaintiff's use of the girl's bathroom, stated that \"Minersville isn't ready for this.\" (Doc. 10 at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 56).
