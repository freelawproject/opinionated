CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Tennessee Department of Revenue is attempting to collect a default judgment it obtained against a third party from Xcaliber International, Ltd., LLC (\"Xcaliber\"). Xcaliber does not believe it owes the Department of Revenue for the default judgment, and the parties are currently litigating this matter in an administrative hearing with the Department of Revenue and in the Davidson County, Tennessee, Chancery Court. Unsatisfied with the way discovery is progressing in the state proceedings, Xcaliber filed this action against David Gerregano and Herbert Slatery in their official capacities (hereinafter, the \"State\"). Before the Court is the State's Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. No. 12.) For the following reasons, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. ALLEGATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1998, Tennessee, among other states, settled a lawsuit with certain large tobacco product manufacturers that claimed the manufacturers hid evidence and misrepresented the effects of smoking. (Doc. No. 1 at 4.) As part of the settlement agreement, those large tobacco product manufacturers must pay Tennessee in perpetuity (the \"Settling Manufacturers\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) In return, Tennessee passed an escrow statute, creating escrow accounts for tobacco product manufacturers who were not parties to the lawsuit (\"Non-Participating Manufacturers\") to pay into. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 47-31-103(a)(2)(A). The escrow statute requires the Non-Participating Manufacturers to pay into an escrow account an amount substantially similar to the amount that the Settling Manufacturers have to pay under the settlement agreement. (Doc. No. 1 at 5); TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 47-31-103(a)(2)(A). This money is used to offset the increased costs for the Settling Manufacturers and can to be used to pay settlements for future lawsuits. (Doc. No. 1 at 5); TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 47-31-103(a)(2)(D). The Non-Participating Manufacturers receive the benefit of interest and appreciation from their deposited funds, and those funds get refunded after twenty-five years if the funds are not used to pay a settlement. (Doc. No. 1 at 5); TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 47-31-103(a)(2)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Both the Settling and Non-Participating Manufacturers must certify annually that they are in compliance with the escrow statute or the settlement agreement. TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 67-4-2602(a). The Commissioner\n   of the Department of Revenue creates a directory \"listing all tobacco product manufacturers that have provided current and accurate certifications conforming to the requirements of subsection (a) and all brand families that are listed in such certifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (b). If a tobacco product manufacturer is not included in the directory, it cannot sell cigarettes in Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commissioner cannot include in the directory a non-participating manufacturer nor brand family if the brand family, \"whether or not listed by such non-participating manufacturer, has not fully paid into a qualified escrow fund governed by a qualified escrow agreement that has been approved by the attorney general and reporter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (b)(2)(A). It also cannot include the non-participating manufacturer or brand family if there is an outstanding final judgment that \"has not been fully satisfied for such brand family or such manufacturer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (b)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   If the Commissioner removes a brand family or tobacco product manufacturer from the directory, the Commissioner must give fifteen days notice to the manufacturer and post public notice in the directory. TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 67-4-2606(a). That decision is subject to review as provided in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 67-1-105 and the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 67-1-105(a), the aggrieved party may request a hearing before the Commissioner within ten days of the removal from the directory. The Commissioner or a hearing officer shall allow the aggrieved party to present evidence at a hearing and issue findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (b)-(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The aggrieved party may then seek judicial review in the Davidson County Chancery Court. TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 4-5-322(b)(1)(A). Either party may ask to present additional evidence, and the court may grant that request if the party presents good reasons for failure to present that evidence before the agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (e). If neither party presents additional evidence, the Chancery Court confines its review to the record created before the agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (g). The court may reverse or modify the decision of the agency if, among other reasons, the agency's decision violates the constitution or a statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (h). The reviewing court shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law on its decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    1. The\n    <em>\n     Sudamax\n    </em>\n    Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2003, Sudamax manufactured the \"Berkley\" brand of cigarettes. (Doc. No. 1 at 6.) Sudamax used a different company, Samurai Industria e Comercio de Cigarros, Ltda. (\"Samurai\"), to import the cigarettes to the United States and sell the cigarettes in Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A third company, Tantus, marketed the \"Berkley\" cigarettes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Tantus deposited money into a Tennessee escrow account in 2003, pursuant to an agreement with Sudamax, but no further escrow payments were made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The State sued Sudamax and Samurai in state court for the escrow payments through 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. No. 1-3.) Also named in the lawsuit is Centurian Industria e Comercio de Cigarros, Ltda. (\"Centurian\"), which certified itself as the manufacturer of the \"Kingsley\" brand of cigarettes, although Sudamax actually manufactured them. (Doc. No. 1 at 6; Doc. No. 1-3.) Tantus was not named in the lawsuit. (Doc. No. 1 at 6; Doc. No. 1-3.) Through this lawsuit, the State obtained a default judgment of $1,864,549.20 in unpaid escrow, $5,593,649.60 in penalties, and $48,581.76 in attorney's fees. (Doc. No. 1 at 6-7; Doc. No. 1-6.) Sudamax was also prohibited from selling cigarettes in Tennessee for a period of two years. (Doc. No. 1 at 7; Doc. No. 1-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Eventually, Tantus began manufacturing the \"Berkley\" cigarettes in addition to selling \"24/7\" cigarettes in Tennessee. (Doc. No. 1 at 12.) The State did not pursue Tantus for payment of the default judgment it obtained against Sudamax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2013, certain actors at Tantus committed unrelated criminal misconduct and Tantus stopped selling cigarettes in Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    2. Xcaliber Purchases \"Berkley\" and \"Berley\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In July 2016, Xcaliber purchased from Tantus the right to produce several brands of cigarettes, including \"Berkley\" and \"Berley.\" (Doc. No. 1 at 12-13.) That month, the State asked Xcaliber if it intended to satisfy Tennessee's judgments against Sudamax, to which Xcaliber responded that it was not required to do so. (Doc. No. 1 at 13.) Xcaliber has not sold any \"Berkley\" or \"Berley\" cigarettes in Tennessee, although it sells \"Echo\" and \"Edgefield\" brands in the state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 5, 2016, Xcaliber received a letter from the Department of Revenue notifying that Xcaliber would not be able to sell cigarettes in Tennessee effective December 16. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) On December 19, Xcaliber filed a \"Petition for Contested Case Hearing and Stay of Department Action with the DOR.\" (Doc. No. 1 at 15; Doc. No. 1-33.) Tennessee law allows a tobacco manufacturer who is removed from the directory by the Department of Revenue to ask for review, under the procedures in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 67-1-105, pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. TENN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 67-4-2606(a). The Commissioner can assign a hearing officer to decide the contested action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 67-1-105(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Xcaliber agreed to deposit $1,864,549.20 in a trust fund of its counsel pending resolution of the Department of Revenue action in exchange for being allowed to continue selling cigarettes in the state pending final resolution of the Department of Revenue action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the State did not answer discovery requests to the satisfaction of Xcaliber and the hearing officer denied Xcaliber's Motion to Compel (Doc. No. 1-39), Xcaliber took an interlocutory appeal to the Davidson County, Tennessee, Chancery Court and filed this action. The Chancery Court has since declined jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal and Xcaliber appealed that order to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, which is pending. (Doc. No. 42.) Meanwhile, the Department of Revenue action is stayed pending the resolution of the state court appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.

(Doc. No. 13.) Because the Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over this\n   matter, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   , the Court will only address that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Generally, federal courts \"should entertain and resolve on the merits an action within the scope of a jurisdictional grant, and should not 'refus[e] to decide a case in deference to the States.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sprint Commc'ns v.

First, contrary to Xcaliber's argument, the administrative action was commenced by the State, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 67-4-2606(a), in its December 1 letter informing Xcaliber that it would be removed from the State's directory and giving Xcaliber fifteen days to appeal the decision. (Doc. No. 1-32.) That letter establishes that the Department of Revenue has initiated a proceeding to sanction the Xcaliber. An investigation was involved, as shown in the State's July 19, 2016 letter asking Xcaliber multiple questions (Doc. No. 1-29), and it culminated in civil charges that Xcaliber is not escrow compliant for its \"Berkley\" cigarettes. (Doc. No. 1-32.)\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.
