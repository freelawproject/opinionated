BOLDEN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Michael Bell and Colleen Bell (\"Plaintiffs\"), married and living in Killingworth, Connecticut, filed this lawsuit against the United States of America, the United States Department of Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"), seeking the return of money withheld from their income taxes in 2008. Compl. 1, ECF No. 1. The Bells claim that Dr. Bell's former employer, Pfizer, submitted an incorrect IRS Form W-2, based in part on a settlement agreement reached between Dr. Bell and Pfizer, that resulted in overpayment of Dr. Bell's income tax that year, and they seek a refund of that money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. The Bells argue that the settlement agreement reached between Dr. Bell and Pfizer represented payment for a physical injury and therefore should have been tax-exempt under 26 U.S.C. 104(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants now move for summary judgment, arguing that Dr. Bell has not established that Pfizer's Form W-2 was incorrect-rather, the government argues, Pfizer appropriately withheld taxes from its settlement payment to Dr. Bell because that payment was taxable wages not subject to Section 104(a)(2).

Declared legally blind in his left eye in 1995, Dr. Bell began to lose vision in his right eye in either 1998 or 1999. Def.'s Statement of Material Facts (\"SMF\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2002, Dr. Bell began working in the information technology department at Pfizer. SMF \u00b6 11. By that time, his vision problems were so severe that he struggled to read handwriting or distinguish details of photographs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. In 2004 or 2005, Dr. Bell stopped driving because he could not see, and in 2005, he was declared legally blind in his right eye.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Bell explained that several doctors had examined his eyes and had not conclusively diagnosed a reason for his blindness. Bell Deposition, SMF Ex. 4 at 38-40, ECF 24-4. Doctors have suggested that potential causes include intracranial hypertension, cone dystrophy, and end-stage glaucoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. Dr. Bell also stated that he planned to visit a genetic specialist who \"specializes in cone dystrophies and retinal type disorders because that's the only thing that might still explain why pressure, why tension, why stress, why intracranial pressure leads to this.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Bell asserts that stress causes or exacerbates his vision problems. Opp. to Mot. Summ. J. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Bell describes a number of difficulties during his time working for Pfizer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. He claims that, when he was hired, a Pfizer employee told him his salary and that Pfizer would pay to move him from New Jersey to Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He claims that, based on that representation, he decided to buy a house in Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Allegedly, after he moved he was told that a large part of the money he had been given would need to be repaid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Bell claims that he was irrevocably harmed by Pfizer because he would not have chosen to buy the home in Connecticut-which he could not afford-without the promise and payment of a large sum of money, and claims that the experience caused him much stress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants, on the other hand, claim that Dr. Bell was paid an erroneously high amount of money because of a clerical error and then was required to return the money that he never should have received. SMF \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Bell also claims that he endured a work environment where employees taunted and harassed him on account of his disability. Opp. to Mot. Summ. J. 3. Settlement negotiation conversations with Pfizer allegedly began when Dr. Bell reached out to Pfizer for compensation due to his physical injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2007, Dr. Bell and Pfizer negotiated a settlement agreement: Pfizer agreed to pay Dr. Bell $190,000 in 2007 and $990,000 in 2008. SMF \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants maintain that throughout negotiations with Dr. Bell about these payments, Pfizer repeatedly stated that Pfizer would treat the payments as wage income subject to taxes, and that the negotiated numbers represented amounts before withholding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-22. The agreements do not specify the grounds for the payments, but do note that, with these payments,\n   Bell has been paid \"in full any and all monies owed to him in connection with his employment with Pfizer and his termination from active service, including but not limited to payment for all services performed on behalf of the Company, except as otherwise specifically stated in this Supplemental Release Agreement.\" Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 7 \u00b6 2, ECF No. 24-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Bell, on the other hand, maintains that the payments were made on account of his (1) lost wages and (2) personal injury. Opp. to Mot. Summ. J. 3. He claims that the 2007 payment represented \"lost wages\" under a release agreement, and the 2008 payment was for a personal injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bell argues that the \"payment made [was] 'not ... for any wage or benefit' \" and therefore was paid \"for claims for personal injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pfizer paid Dr. Bell both amounts, and treated the payments as taxable wage income, withholding money for state and federal income tax and the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (\"FICA\") tax. SMF \u00b6\u00b6 33-37. In 2007, those taxes were: $47,500 in federal withholding, $2,755 in Federal MED/EE (Federal Medicare/Employer-Employee, i.e., the employee-paid portion of the Medicare Tax), and $9,500 in Connecticut withholding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. After taxes, Dr. Bell received $130,245.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2008, those taxes were: $252,840.15 in Federal W/H, $14,355.00 Federal Med/EE, and $49,500 in Connecticut W/H.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. After taxes, Dr. Bell received $673,304.85.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Bells submitted timely IRS Forms 1040X and 843, and included the IRS Form W-2 that Pfizer provided, despite allegedly doubting whether it was correct.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Bells filed this lawsuit on February 12, 2015, seeking a refund of payments under their timely filed IRS Form 1040X for the tax year ending December 31, 2008, plus interest to date; a refund of the employment tax payment under their timely filed IRS Form 843 for the tax year ending December 31, 2008, plus interest to date; and reasonable costs and fees, as permitted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207430\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Answer 3-4, ECF No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the Answer, Defendants admitted that the United States of America is the defendant to this action, but denied that the IRS is a defendant, explaining that the IRS cannot be sued and that the proper party in cases involving revenue issues is the United States.
