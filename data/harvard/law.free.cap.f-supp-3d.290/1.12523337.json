[Dkt. # 1]. In answering the complaint, defendants raised the defense that plaintiff's claim \"reflects improper selective enforcement of the antitrust laws.\" Answer 28 [Dkt. # 20]. Specifically, defendants assert that the challenge to their vertical merger was brought not due to any credible antitrust concerns, but because one of the Time Warner networks to be acquired, CNN, has engaged in political speech disfavored by President Trump.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2/16/2018 Hr'gTr.

Plaintiff objects to providing any of that\n   information. That brings us to the dispute currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By joint letter dated February 13, 2018, the parties, in accordance with the procedures established in the Case Management Order [Dkt. # 54], informed the Court that they were at an impasse in their negotiations over defendants' entitlement to the requested privilege logs. The parties explained their dispute at a status hearing held on February 16, 2018. On the one hand, defendants assert that they are entitled to the requested privilege logs because those logs are relevant to their selective enforcement defense. Accordingly, defendants ask that this Court require plaintiff to compile and turn over privilege logs that are responsive to the outstanding discovery requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 55:5-56:23. Plaintiff, for its part, argues that defendants have failed to establish their right to discovery on the issue of selective enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    at 59:1-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has moved to strike defendants' selective enforcement defense as well as to quash any outstanding discovery requests related to that defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    at 60:4-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With the trial date in this case fast approaching, all agree that we cannot afford to spend much of the little remaining preparation time litigating this matter. Even without the luxury of back-and-forth briefing, however, the parties, through arguments of able counsel, have made their positions clear. Both sides acknowledge that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    517 U.S. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), controls the analysis of defendants' entitlement to additional selective enforcement discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 11:11-18, 21:23-24. Thus, the issue here is whether defendants have satisfied\n   <em>\n    Armstrong's\n   </em>\n   requirements. For the reasons discussed below, I conclude they have not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As our Circuit has often recognized, \"[p]rosecutors have broad discretion to enforce the law, and their decisions are presumed to be proper absent clear evidence to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To be sure, defendants are correct that Executive Branch enforcement decisions are \"subject to constitutional constraints,\" including a prohibition on selectively prosecuting individuals for exercising their constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    517 U.S. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Att'y Gen. of United States v.

Those concerns range from a recognition of the judiciary's inability to competently assess the basis for a decision to prosecute, to the threat that courts may \"unnecessarily impair\" the Executive Branch's performance of a \"core\" constitutional function, to the practical fact that selective enforcement discovery \"will divert prosecutors' resources and may disclose the Government's prosecutorial strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    517 U.S. at 465, 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For those reasons, the Supreme Court and our Circuit have established a \"rigorous standard\" that defendants must meet before even obtaining discovery on a selective enforcement defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is therefore difficult to even conceptualize how a selective enforcement claim applies in the antitrust context, where each merger \"must be functionally viewed\" in \"the context of its particular industry\" and in light of a \"variety of factors\"-including the transaction's size, structure, and potential to generate efficiencies or enable evasion of rate regulation-that \"are relevant in determining whether a transaction is likely to lessen competition.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
