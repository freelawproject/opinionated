ECF No. 6-1, at 3-4 (Ryan Decl. \u00b6 2). The investigation has focused on two Social Security recipients with the same first and last names, one of whom is alive (the \"Living Beneficiary\") and the other deceased (the \"Deceased Beneficiary\").\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204443410\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Living Beneficiary, born in 1938, currently receives disability benefits from the Social Security Administration through the District of Columbia Department on Disability Services (\"DDS\"), which serves as his payee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Ryan Decl. \u00b6 3). The Deceased Beneficiary was born in 1935 and passed away in 2003, but the Social Security Administration has nonetheless disbursed benefits for him since at least 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Ryan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6). The two beneficiaries are assigned separate Social Security numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Ryan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SSA-OIG asserts that in June 2007, four years after the Deceased Beneficiary's death, Anomnachi applied to serve as the representative payee for benefits for the Deceased Beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Ryan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Since then, SSA-OIG claims, those benefits have been paid into a bank account maintained by Anomnachi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (Ryan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8). SSA-OIG further asserts that the subpoena at issue here is directed to that bank account, and is part of a legitimate investigation into the circumstances under which Social Security benefits intended for the Deceased Beneficiary were improperly paid out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Ryan Decl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Anomnachi sets forth his own version of the facts, corroborating SSA-OIG's assertion that he caused the Deceased Beneficiary's benefits to be paid into the account in question, but claiming that he did so unwittingly. He asserts that, in 2005, he was appointed guardian of an incapacitated person he now understands is the Living Beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1, at 2 (Affidavit of Gordy Anomnachi or \"Anomnachi Aff.\" \u00b6 1);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 184 (Letter from Anomnachi to Soc. Sec. Admin. (Apr. 8, 2016)). In the years that followed his appointment, he intended to apply for a birth certificate and Social Security card for the Living Beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (Anomnachi Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 3-11). In his telling, however, various government agencies committed errors that confused the identities of the Living Beneficiary and the Deceased Beneficiary during this process.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, the Social Security Administration reinstated benefits intended for the Deceased Beneficiary and paid them for almost ten years into the bank account Anomnachi opened; however, once the error was discovered last year, he requested that the benefits be terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-6 (Anomnachi Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 22-24);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 184 (Letter from Anomnachi to Soc. Sec. Admin. (Apr. 8, 2016)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On this record, there is obviously \"demonstrable reason to believe\" that SSA-OIG is conducting a legitimate investigation into how the Social Security Administration came to improperly pay out these benefits. To be sure, Anomnachi asserts that he is blameless of any wrongdoing, and that these circumstances are the result of innocent errors that caused a mix-up concerning the identities of the Living Beneficiary and the Deceased Beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (Anomnachi Aff. \u00b6 12). He claims that he applied all the funds he received for the benefit of the Living Beneficiary, as opposed to his own personal use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5 (Anomnachi Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 17, 19). And he insists that he did not know the Living Beneficiary was already receiving other Social Security benefits through DDS, a separate payee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 184 (Letter from Anomnachi to Soc. Sec. Admin. (Apr. 8, 2016)). All of these claims may well turn out to be true. But they provide no basis for the Court to quash the subpoena, for surely there is \"a good reason\" for SSA-OIG to investigate the matter.\n   <em>\n    Nicksolat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419039\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/122/#p124\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204443410\">\n    2017 WL 4443410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Feiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4296005\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/474/#p478\">\n    914 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   478 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    B.

And Anomnachi-again, as already set forth above-concedes that he opened the account into which the Social Security Administration disbursed the Deceased Beneficiary's benefits for years, although he claims to have done so only in connection with his guardianship of the Living Beneficiary, for whose sole benefit he directed those funds. Anomnachi further admits that it was determined that the funds were being improperly paid, and that he requested they be terminated. On this record, there is no doubt that the records of the bank account targeted by the subpoena are relevant to SSA-OIG's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Anomnachi argues that the bank records are not relevant to the investigation because the subpoena issued by SSA-OIG incorrectly identifies the Deceased Beneficiary-as opposed to the Living Beneficiary-as his joint account holder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1, at 4 (Anomnachi Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). The record is unclear regarding which of the beneficiaries is named on the account as Anomnachi's joint account holder. Ultimately, however, there is no discernable reason why this discrepancy, even if it exists, would nullify the demonstrated relevance of these bank records to SSA-OIG's investigation, and Anomnachi offers none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    C.

Dowty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302377\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mj/48/102/#p108\">\n    48 M.J. 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108 (C.A.A.F. 1998). As previously noted, the record is unclear regarding which of the beneficiaries is named on the account as Anomnachi's joint account holder. But whichever beneficiary is so listed, the Court concludes that SSA-OIG substantially complied with the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Assuming that Anomnachi is correct and the Living Beneficiary is in fact named as his joint account holder, SSA-OIG accomplished substantial compliance though service of the subpoena and notice on Anomnachi himself. \"Customer\" is defined as \"any person\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   authorized representative of that person\" who used the financial services in question.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203401\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (emphasis added). Therefore, the \"customer\" is notified so long as\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the person who utilized the services\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that person's representative is notified. In this case, Anomnachi states that he opened and operated the account in his capacity as guardian of the Living Beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1, at 2-3 (Anomnachi Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11). While the RFPA does not define \"authorized representative,\" Anomnachi was acting as the Living Beneficiary's \"authorized representative\" under any reasonable understanding of that term.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russell v. Dep't of Air Force\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7815963,7816127\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/915/1108/\">\n    915 F.Supp. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1116-20 (D. Colo. 1996) (finding that the Air Force qualified as an \"authorized representative\" under the RFPA in case where it opened credit card accounts for officer). Therefore, SSA-OIG effectively notified the Living Beneficiary when it notified his guardian, Anomnachi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Alternatively, if the Deceased Beneficiary is listed as Anomnachi's joint account holder, the statute-reflecting common sense-does not require him to be notified. Nothing in the RFPA requires the government to notify a person who, though named on an account, died years before the account was opened. Such a person never \"utilized ... any service of a financial institution\" in connection with the account,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203401\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5), and therefore is not a \"customer\" requiring notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Anomnachi's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and that SSA-OIG may enforce its subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Both parties' filings in this case contain numerous categories of information, such as bank account numbers, that must be redacted pursuant to Local Civil Rule 5.4(f). The Court has accordingly placed the filings under seal and ordered the parties to submit redacted versions for filing on the public docket. The parties have not yet complied with those orders, and so their supporting papers remain under seal as of the issuance of this Opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Court assumes for purposes of its analysis that Anomnachi is, as required by the statute, a customer \"to whom the financial records sought ... pertain.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203410\">\n     12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c). Anomnachi states that he opened and operated the bank account at issue in connection with his role as guardian for an incapacitated person, and asserts on that basis that he is \"not 'the customer whose records are being required by the government.' \" ECF No. 1-1, at 1 (Affidavit of Gordy Anomnachi or \"Anomnachi Aff.\") (emphasis omitted). Anomnachi's own statement would therefore appear to provide a separate basis for the Court to deny the motion. Nonetheless, the undisputed facts contained in his affidavit appear to show that he is, in fact, a \"customer\" within the meaning of the RFPA. The statute defines a \"customer\" as \"any person or authorized representative of that person who utilized or is utilizing any service of a financial institution ... in relation to an account maintained in the person's name.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203401\">\n     12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5). Anomnachi asserts that he opened and operated the bank account in question as a joint account, with himself as one of the named account holders.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 1-1, at 3-4 (Anomnachi Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14). Therefore, his status as a named account holder would appear to bring him within the ambit of the statute's definition, regardless of his relationship with any other joint account holder. In other words, he would appear to be a \"person ... who utilized ... any service of a financial institution ... in relation to an account maintained in [his] name,\" making him a \"customer\" to whom the financial records sought pertain.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203401\">\n     12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Anomnachi also alleges that SSA-OIG is conducting the investigation for \"punitive purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 1-1, at 1 (Anomnachi Aff.). Of course, law enforcement investigations may quite properly lead to punishment for those determined to be responsible for wrongdoing. To the extent Anomnachi asserts that the investigation is motivated by an\n    <em>\n     illegitimate\n    </em>\n    purpose, such as harassment or intimidation, he offers no facts to support his claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
