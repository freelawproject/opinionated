Bolden, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   PSARA Energy, LTD (\"Plaintiff\") filed a Verified Complaint on October 30, 2017, seeking attachment of SPACE Shipping and Geden Holdings's (\"Defendants\" or \"SPACE\") property located within the District of Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    See Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1. Specifically, Plaintiff sought attachment of a debt owed by a third-party, ST Shipping and Trading Pte. Ltd. (\"ST Shipping\"), to SPACE arising from an arbitration proceeding in London.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently pending before the Court is ST Shipping's motion to release the maritime attachment under Rule E(f)(4) of the Supplement Rules. Because the Court holds that it lacks personal jurisdiction over ST Shipping and, therefore, the debt\n   is not within the District of Connecticut, ST Shipping's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The attachment will be\n   <strong>\n    VACATED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PSARA is a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Compl. \u00b6 3. SPACE Shipping, one of the defendants in this matter, is a foreign company organized under the laws of Malta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 23, 2010, the parties entered into an agreement for the Defendants to charter Plaintiff's crude oil tanker, the CV STEALTH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants sub-chartered the vessel to a third party, who sailed it to Venezuela with the intention of loading the tanker with crude oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10. Upon arrival in the Venezuelan port of Puerto La Cruz, Plaintiff alleges that the \"Vessel was detained ... purportedly for being unauthorized to lift a cargo of crude oil from Venezuela and being employed to lift a cargo stolen\" from the Venezuelan state oil company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Venezuelan authorities released the vessel on October 3, 2017. Plaintiff alleges, however, \"due to her forced idleness\" for several years without maintenance, \"the vessel has suffered extensive damages and deterioration....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Plaintiff alleges that the vessel is \"out of class, uninsurable\" and will require numerous repairs that \"will exceed the sum of $15,000,000.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that delivery of the vessel \"in such a deteriorated state of extensive disrepair\" is a material breach of the bareboat charter that the parties signed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. In addition to the cost of repairs, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to make payments owed for the hire of the vessel, owe attorney's fees for an arbitration brought in London as well as interest, and owe damages for the time it will take to repair the vessel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-31. The total claim equals $19,604,297.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties entered into arbitration in London for the unpaid hire amount of $5,272,100.90.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Following the arbitration award, the parties pursued a settlement agreement addressing enforcement of that award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-22. Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants failed to make payments under the settlement agreement and therefore the Plaintiff is \"about to submit a claim in the London arbitration, which has continual jurisdiction over the claims for the January through June 2017 unpaid hires, interest, legal costs, and costs of the London arbitration, and any other claims arising under the bareboat charter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a Verified Complaint in this Court on October 30, 2017 and sought the attachment of an arbitration award between the Defendants and a third party: ST Shipping. Plaintiff alleged that the debt owed by ST Shipping to SPACE in relation to the award was intangible property within the meaning of Rule B and-based on a lawsuit filed by SPACE in this District to enforce the award against ST Shipping-that property existed within the District of Connecticut's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 1, 2017, this Court held that \"Plaintiff has met its initial burden in seeking attachment under Rule B, and the Court will authorize process of attachment and garnishment.\" Ruling On Attachment, ECF No. 15. The Court subsequently issued a writ of garnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ST Shipping filed a motion seeking to vacate the garnishment under Rule(E)(4)(f) of the Supplement Rules and sought a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Release Maritime Attachment, ECF No. 18. The Court then scheduled and held a hearing\n   on November 17, 2017, at which SPACE Shipping appeared for the first time. SPACE maintained that Plaintiff failed to inform the Court about developments in the London arbitration and therefore argued the Verified Complaint should be dismissed or, alternatively, reduced to account for those developments. ST Shipping argued that this Court lacked jurisdiction over the debt because this Court lacked personal jurisdiction over ST Shipping. Alternatively, it sought Court approval to transfer the funds it owed to an escrow account in London.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the November 17th hearing, the Court issued an order permitting the parties to submit any supplemental briefing on any issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 33. ST Shipping filed a supplement brief in which it argued that a debt is only found within this District only if a creditor-here, SPACE-could enforce that debt here. Garnishee's Supplemental Br., ECF No. 37 at 1-4. Additionally, ST Shipping argued that, in order for SPACE to enforce a debt in the District, there must be personal jurisdiction over ST Shipping and, as a foreign corporation, ST Shipping argues SPACE would be unable to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   SPACE adopted ST Shipping's jurisdictional arguments in their filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Objection 3, ECF No. 36. Additionally, they argued that the award should be vacated or reduced based on developments in the London arbitration between PSARA and SPACE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Specifically, SPACE argued that the arbitrators found many of the losses related to the condition of the vessel not yet ripe, and that PSARA should have notified the Court of this decision when filing the Verified Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. They argue that, by not informing the Court, \"Plaintiff has thus breached the heightened duty of disclosure imposed in rule B attachment actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Alternatively, they argue that the arbitration decision requires substantial reduction in the amount of the attachment: from $19,604,197 to $436,376.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PSARA argued that ST Shipping's debt has its situs in Connecticut because ST Shipping has maintained an office in Stamford, Connecticut. Pl. Supplemental Br., ECF No. 38 at 1-4. Additionally, they argue that the arbitration decision highlighted by SPACE \"does not contain findings of fact or conclusion of law\" and represented \"how things appeared when the claim submission of Plaintiff was made\" several weeks prior to the filing of the Verified Complaint in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. PSARA also submitted two declarations with several exhibits attached in further support their damage calculations. Decl. of Adamantios Adriotis, ECF No. 39 (detailing estimated costs of repairs and other figures regarding vessel's deterioration); Decl. of Jeremy Biggs, ECF No. 40 (detailing current posture of London arbitration).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Attachment in maritime or admiralty actions is governed by Rules B and E of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions. The Second Circuit has \"interpreted Rule B to permit a plaintiff to obtain an order of attachment if it can show that: 1) it has a valid prima facie admiralty claim against the defendant; 2) the defendant cannot be found within the district; 3) the defendant's property may be found within the district; and 4) there is no statutory or maritime law bar to the attachment.\"\n   <em>\n    Blue Whale Corp. v.

R. Civ. P. Supp. R. E(4)(f). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that each of the four requirements are met to justify attachment.\n   <em>\n    Sinoying Logistics Pte Ltd. v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This case presents the question of whether a debt, owed by a foreign third party to a foreign defendant, is within the jurisdictional reach of the Court for the purposes of maritime attachment, merely because the third party maintains an office in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties do not appear to dispute that Plaintiff has a valid prima facie admiralty claim against Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor do they debate that the second and fourth prongs are met: Defendants are not present in the District, and the parties have not raised any clear bars to the attachment. ST Shipping, however, challenges this Court's jurisdiction to enter the garnishment. While it does not dispute they owe some sum of money to SPACE, ST Shipping argues that it is not subject to the\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction of this Court. Therefore, it essentially argues that PSARA has not proved the third prong necessary to justify garnishment: that Defendants' property-here, the debt owed SPACE by ST Shipping-is within the District. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Property Within the District\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Maritime attachment has a long and storied history, and is used by admiralty courts to \"first, gain jurisdiction over an absent defendant; and second, to assure satisfaction of a judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Aqua Stoli Shipping Ltd. v.

The purpose of attachment was to allow admiralty courts to extend jurisdiction to this inherently fleeting property, while the property was within the court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Aqua Stoli Shipping\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674880\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/434/#p437\">\n    460 F.3d at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Maritime parties are peripatetic, and their assets are often transitory. Thus, the traditional policy underlying maritime attachment has been to permit the attachments of assets wherever they can be found and not to require the plaintiff to scour the globe to find a proper forum for suit or property of the defendant sufficient to satisfy a judgment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rule B codifies the longstanding practice in this Circuit of maritime attachment.\n   <em>\n    Aqua Stoli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674880\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/434/#p437\">\n    460 F.3d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court, however, must still have\n   jurisdiction over the property it seeks to attach. As the Second Circuit has noted: \"The 'jurisdiction' at issue in a Rule B attachment proceeding is quasi in rem, rather than\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    in rem.\n   </em>\n   In Rule B attachment proceedings, jurisdiction is predicated on the presence within the court's territorial reach of property in which the Rule B defendant has an interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481503\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/58/#p70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 69 n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Therefore, the Court must determine whether the property at issue-the debt owed by ST Shipping to SPACE-is within this Court's territorial reach. The\n   <em>\n    situs\n   </em>\n   of intangible property has traditionally be seen as \"fictional,\" but \"where the debtor and creditor are within the jurisdiction of a court, that court has constitutional power to deal with the debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Standard Oil Co. v.

SPACE Shipping is a foreign company organized under the laws of Malta. Compl. \u00b6 4.

Even assuming, however, that a foreign corporation could be sued by a foreign plaintiff under CONN. GEN. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 33-929(f), the Plaintiff points to no contract that has ties to the State of Connecticut, nor do they allege that the debt owed by ST Shipping arises from the solicitation of business by mail, the production and manufacture or distribution of goods within Connecticut, or from any tortious conduct by ST. Shipping. In fact, Plaintiff has not addressed the satisfaction of any of the requisites of the Court's jurisdiction over ST Shipping at all under \u00a7 33-929(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court therefore may not exercise personal jurisdiction over ST Shipping. It follows that any of SPACE's intangible property held by ST Shipping is outside the jurisdiction of this Court.

Because the Court holds that the property is not found within the District of Connecticut, it does not address Defendants' argument regarding the amount of that property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
