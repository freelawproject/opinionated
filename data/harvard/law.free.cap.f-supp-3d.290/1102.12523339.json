ECF No. 10. Federal Defendants Kevin Elliott, in his official capacity as Forest Supervisor of the Sequoia National Forest, and the United States Forest Service (\"USFS\") (together, \"Federal Defendants\") and Defendant-Intervenor Sierra Forest Products both opposed Plaintiffs' motion, ECF Nos. 21 and 22, and Plaintiffs replied, ECF No. 24. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At issue is a USFS fire salvage restoration project proposed and approved by the USFS to treat a strip of land along an area of roadways affected by the Cedar Fire. The Cedar Fire began on August 16, 2016, and burned for three weeks over 29,000 acres of mixed conifer and white fir forest, most of which were in the Sequoia National Forest. ECF No. 10-9, Preliminary Injunction Record (\"PIR\") 1393, PIR 1936.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USFS is working to abate the hazards associated with this burned area of forest, including through the \"Bull Run\" project, which is planned to involve felling dead and dying trees along 50.2 miles of road along the east side of the Greenhorn Mountains, outside the Giant Sequoia National Monument. This project would treat up to 3,500 of the 29,000 acres in the Cedar Fire burn area. ECF No. 22-1, Declaration of Kevin B. Elliott (\"Elliott Decl.\") \u00b6 7. On October 31, 2016, the USFS announced a single project to remove hazardous trees along roads on both the eastern and western sides of the Greenhorn Mountains in the Giant Sequoia National Monument. PIR 1, 14. The USFS later announced that it intended to treat the eastern and western components as two separate projects, with separate Environmental Assessments (\"EA\") prepared for each. PIR 14. The USFS then confirmed that it would undertake the Bull Run project separately from the \"Spear Creek\" project on the western side of the Greenhorn Mountains. PIR 20; PIR 932.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Much of the USFS's reasoning regarding regulatory issues related to the Bull Run project is set forth in a Revised Decision Memo, which outlines the proposed project as one designed to \"mitigate the hazards to public safety posed by the dead and dying trees along approximately 50.2 miles of road in the project area,\" which consists of approximately 3,500 acres on the border of Tulare and Kern Counties, roughly 30 miles southeast of Porterville, CA. ECF No. 22-2, Revised Decision Mem. at 1. The project will abate hazard trees within 300 feet of each side of the\n   road. Hazard trees will be identified using Forest Service guidelines and will be felled if they \"could potentially strike within the road's clearing width, or could roll or slide into the clearing after they fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Dead, dying, or damaged trees unlikely to fall into the road will not be felled unless they present a hazard to workers, and the memo is clear that the project \"is not authorizing a 'clearcut' within 300 feet of road edges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Felled trees will be removed if they \"represent an obstruction to use and maintenance within the road's clearing width,\" if leaving the tree in place will increase fuel loading, or if removal is needed for the reforestation process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Felled logs may be chipped or burned, and logs \"considered to have commercial value may be sold as saw timber, cull logs, firewood, chips, posts, and poles,\" and branches and limbs may also be sold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Some logs \"will be left in place for habitat\" and to meet the standard under the 2004 Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment for down woody material retention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the project will include activities to restore organic ground cover and to reforest the habitat, including planting seedlings, scattering seeds, and increasing organic ground cover by scattering limbs, branches, and chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the USFS undertook an analysis of the Bull Run project's potential effects on wildlife in an 86-page Biological Evaluation, ECF No. 22-3 (\"BE\"), and a 30-page Biological Assessment, ECF No. 22-4 (\"BA\"). It also consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\"), which produced a 22-page Biological Opinion concerning the potential impacts of the project on species listed under the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"). ECF No. 22-5 (\"BiOp\"). Under NEPA, proposed agency action need not be subject to further analysis through an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") or EA \"if there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action\" and the action fits into a categorical exclusion (\"CE\"), a category of action that the agency has determined does not have significant effects on the environment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The USFS determined that the project fit into three CEs, for road repair and maintenance (CE-4), timber stand and/or wildlife habitat improvement activities (CE-6), and post-fire rehabilitation activities (CE-11). Revised Decision Mem. at 3-4;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4), (e)(6), (e)(11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The USFS also determined that there were no extraordinary circumstances related to the project that would trigger further review through an EIS or EA pursuant to NEPA. Before approving a project under an agency-adopted CE, an agency must examine whether a particular project presents \"extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The agency is directed to examine \"the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on\" things such as \"Federally listed threatened or endangered species\" or \"Forest Service sensitive species.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The USFS did not find that the Bull Run project would have significant adverse impacts to the mountain yellow-legged frog (\"MYLF\"), Pacific fisher, or California spotted owl (\"CSO\") that would require the project to undergo further NEPA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The MYLF is listed as endangered under the ESA. PIR 1366. The project area contains no documented MYLF populations and no critical habitat, BA 19, and all three MYLF populations known to exist in the Sequoia National Forest are more than 20 miles away, BA 12. No recent comprehensive surveys have been conducted in the project area, however, and because of this lack of certainty, the FWS concluded\n   that the project \"may affect and [is] likely to adversely affect\" MYLF in the area because of \"an inability to guarantee that no take to the species or their habitat would occur with implementation of the project.\" BiOp 20. The FWS also concluded, however, that if MYLF populations do exist in the project area, \"population numbers are quite likely very low due to the habitat loss from recent fires and the last four years of intense drought conditions that have eliminated aquatic habitat from many of the streams and meadows within the action area,\" though last winter's high snowfall was expected to return the aquatic conditions to pre-drought levels. BiOp 12. Despite 30 \"site-specific measures\" designed to minimize the risks associated with the project, BA 27-30; BiOp 4-7, the USFS could not guarantee that no take would occur, BA 20. If more than the expected 197 acres are affected, or if \"more than one dead or injured mountain yellow-legged frog adult, juvenile, tadpole, or egg mass is detected as a result of the proposed project,\" FWS's BiOp required USFS to halt the project and reinitiate formal consultation with FWS. BiOp 15. FWS concluded that \"the prospects for these populations to recover and contribute to the overall recovery of the species are high,\" despite the potential loss of individual frogs as a result of the project. BiOp 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Pacific fisher is a sensitive species but is not endangered or threatened. BE 5. There are \"no [fisher] den sites in the project analysis area,\" BE 48, and research in the Sierra National Forest has shown that fishers do not use \"high severity burn areas\" at least in the immediate aftermath of a fire, though there is \"some evidence of limited foraging occurring along the burn edge.\" BE 54. Fishers appear to favor \"landscapes with more contiguous, unfrequented forests and less human activity\" and are negatively associated with road density. BE 47. The existence of roads has already affected the canopy cover in the area, BE 52, and the project \"focuses its efforts to encompass areas of highest burn severity where low canopy cover and structural attributes needed for resting and denning activity are no longer present.\" BE 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs submitted supplemental comments concerning the potential effects on fisher habitat connectivity. PIR 940. Plaintiffs argued that the Bull Run project is similar to the Rancheria project, where the USFS ordered a supplemental NEPA analysis in light of concerns about \"habitat fragmentation and loss of connectivity caused by the Cedar Fire.\" PIR 988. They contended that the USFS undertook no supplemental analysis to ensure that the fisher population in the Southern Greenhorn Mountains was not isolated in the wake of the fire. PIR 1002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Like the Pacific fisher, the CSO is sensitive but not endangered or threatened. The USFS undertook an analysis of the potential effects on the CSO, examining metrics including total available habitat and acres treated; estimated changes in structural characteristics of the habitat, such as canopy, snags, and large woody debris; disturbance effects; and the number of acres treated of certain habitat types and changes in percentage of relative habitat. BE 51. Field surveys conducted in the last three years identified four CSO territories near the project area. Two of the four CSO territories near the project area have minimal overlap with the planned area, BE 26-27, a third has likely been abandoned, BE 28-29, 56, and the fourth will have a monitor on site for any felling during the project, and if nesting owls are present, the project will be subject to a limited operating period, BE 10. Like the Pacific fisher, CSOs nest away from roads, and CSO habitat near roads is lower quality. BE 54. Accordingly, the\n   USFS found that the Bull Run project would have limited disturbance effects and be unlikely to result in significant losses of live foliage and canopy, strong habit factors for CSO. BE 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to CSO, Plaintiffs submitted two research summaries during the comment period that they contend the USFS did not adequately address. The first is a CSO ESA listing petition that Plaintiffs submitted with their comments, containing data from nine reports, which included evidence that Plaintiffs characterized as showing that most owl territories retain occupancy after a fire but that post-fire logging reduces the suitability of that habitat. PIR 127-31. The second is an evaluation prepared by Chad Hanson, a member of Plaintiff Earth Island Institute, that included supplemental comments and summaries of additional studies, which he believed to show that even low levels of post-fire logging within 1500 meters of territory centers show \"severe adverse impacts\" on CSO occupancy. Mot. at 19 (citing PIR 1309-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, on May 1, 2017, the USFS proposed the Spear Creek project to abate hazard trees on the western side of the Greenhorn Mountains. ECF No. 22-8, Excerpts from Proposed Spear Creek Roadside Hazard Tree Mitigation Project. Bull Run and Spear Creek are located in different watersheds on opposite sides of the Greenhorn Mountains. BE 6; BA 9, 11. Unlike Bull Run, Spear Creek is located within the Giant Sequoia National Monument (GSNM) and is subject to the special requirements of the GSNM Management Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate (1) that it is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

The district court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The removal of dead trees within one-half mile of all private land boundaries does not fit within the general description of timber stand and/or wildlife habitat improvement activities.

United States Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"637888\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/73/962/\">\n    73 F.Supp.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

Even assuming the salvage CE remained valid, the district court noted the board feet that it would allow was \"infinitely less than that proposed here.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2023281957\">\n    2003 WL 23281957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4. Yet the district court nowhere suggested that the salvage CE limited the application of other CEs. Rather, it concluded that the habitat improvement CE could not be stretched to fit the circumstances of the proposed project and at least suggested that USFS could choose between potentially overlapping CEs. Moreover, as mentioned, earlier in the decision, the district court found that the road maintenance CE did fit the circumstances of a project that is strikingly similar to the Bull Run project without ever mentioning the salvage CE, of which it was undoubtedly aware. In sum, unlike\n   <em>\n    Los Padres\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Forest Conservation Council\n   </em>\n   court did not treat the salvage CE as a limit on other types of projects that involved some form of \"salvage\", but which could arguably be covered by another CE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In reply, the Plaintiffs point to three other USFS projects involving roadside hazard salvage timber sale projects in which the agency elected\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to use any CE and instead went through the process of preparing EAs, presumably to point out inconsistencies in USFS application of NEPA. However, it is impossible to tell why the agency elected to prepare an EA for those projects. The Court cannot determine on the present record whether or not the requirement could have been triggered by some independent factor (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   the possibility of harm to sensitive species on those lands). Interestingly, in both of these EAs, hazard tree removal is mentioned as a component of road maintenance. For example, in the Nez Perce Roadside Hazard Tree Project situated in a National Forest in Idaho, it is acknowledged that \"removal\" of hazard trees is part of normal road maintenance, but the EA insists that the Nez Perce project is \"not a salvage project.\" U.S. Dep't of Agric., Decision and Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact, Nez Perce Roadside Hazard Tree Project at 9 (June 2013)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"This is not a salvage project. Hazardous trees will be removed from the roadway during normal road maintenance or felled with this project. In either case, the Nez Perce Forest will comply with Forest Plan direction to provide safe and effective transportation systems (NPFP, II-1, 2) by removing danger trees.\"). In the Rim Fire Hazard Tree Project, situated within the Sierra National Forest near Yosemite National Park, the project involves a range of road maintenance activities and the discussion of that activity suggests hazard tree removal is part of road maintenance. U.S. Dep't of Agric., Rim Fire Hazard Trees Environmental Assessment, at 9-10 (March 2014)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Road maintenance preserves the drainage function or serviceability of the road.

Maintenance actions generally do not disturb ground outside the existing road profile ... other than removal of material around culvert inlets.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Nez Perce EA seems to suggest that hazard tree \"removal\" can be considered a form of road maintenance, but makes a point of specifically denying that the project is a \"salvage\" project. As a result, it is unclear how relevant Nez Perce is to the present circumstances. Here, on the one hand, a large portion of the Bull Run project is being handled through a \"salvage\" timber contract that permits the removal of dead hazard trees. On the other hand, the project description seems to impose some restrictions on the removal of trees, permitting removal only where necessary to avoid road obstruction or excessive fuel loads, or when removal is needed to promote re-forestation projects. In other words, the Court cannot determine with certainty at this stage of the case to what extent the Bull Run project is a true commercial \"salvage\" operation or whether it is, in practice, more like the Nez Perce project, or whether, possibly, this is a distinction without a difference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For purposes of this motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court need not definitively determine the issue on the merits; it is enough to conclude that success on the merits as to the CE issue is unclear. There are authorities pulling in both directions. The single case,\n   <em>\n    Los Padres\n   </em>\n   , that suggests the salvage CE should be treated as a limit on other CEs so holds in contravention of the general principle that agencies should be afforded deference in interpreting the scope and meaning of their own CEs. Other cases directly suggest that hazard tree removal (even on a large scale) is a reasonable application of the road maintenance CE.

First, the MYLF is not known to be present in the area. FWS's conclusion that the project \"may affect and [is] likely to adversely affect\" MYLF in the area was \"based on ... an inability to guarantee that no take to the species or their habitat would occur with implementation of the project.\" BiOp 20. Though there are no\n   known occurrences of the MYLF in the project area, and all three documented populations of MYLF within the Sequoia National Forest are in the Golden Trout Wilderness in the Little Kern River drainage, located approximately 20.5 miles from the project area, no recent comprehensive surveys have been performed to determine whether MYLF exist in the project area. BiOp 12. Surveys in perennial streams in the nearby Greenhorn Mountains in 2000 and 2001 did not detect the presence of MYLF, and no recent comprehensive surveys have been performed to determine whether MYLF exist in the project area.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202457481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   FWS concluded, however, that if MYLF populations do exist in the project area, \"population numbers are quite likely very low due to the habitat loss from recent fires and the last four years of intense drought conditions that have eliminated aquatic habitat from many of the streams and meadows within the action area,\" though last winter's high snowfall was expected to return the aquatic conditions to pre-drought levels. BiOp 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the BA, the USFS outlined a number of potential adverse effects resulting from the project. Felled trees could crush frogs at various stages of development, and noise and disturbances in the project area could alter the behavior of individual frogs, driving them from preferred locations into areas with lower-quality resources. PIR 1371. Felling trees near sensitive aquatic areas may increase sedimentation in aquatic habitats, which may potentially fill deep-pool breeding habitats; may fill \"interstitial spaces\" in aquatic habitats that decrease available areas for adults, juveniles, and tadpoles to seek cover; and may \"increase water turbidity and decrease dissolved oxygen levels, thereby decreasing survival of eggs.\" BiOp 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To mitigate the effect of these potential adverse effects, the project includes 30 \"site-specific measures\" designed to minimize the risks associated with the project. BA 27-30; BiOp 4-7. For instance, tree felling within 100 feet of perennial and intermittent streams and meadows would be done with vehicles and other operating equipment restricted to the roadway, would be felled by hand, away from streams and culverts to the extent possible, left on site, and include no follow-up fuels treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   BA 27; BiOp 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Despite the potential impacts discussed in the BA and BiOp, FWS stated its belief that \"the risk of adverse impacts to individuals is low. Many of the treatment areas are located along the upper two-thirds of the slope where channel widths and depths are decreased, representing lower quality habitat for mountain yellow-legged frog for breeding purposes.\" BiOp 13; PIR 1371. Because MYLFs are \"highly aquatic,\" especially during summer months when activities would most likely take place, \"it is expected that activities outside of suitable habitat (82 feet) have a lower likelihood to directly crush and kill\" MYLFs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202457481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The 30 site-specific measures designed to minimize risks associated with the project \"will further reduce adverse effects to this species.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202457481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In concluding that the project is \"not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of\" the MYLF, FWS explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The proposed project has been designed to minimize adverse effects to individual mountain yellow-legged frogs and maintain habitat components important to the species; the effects to mountain yellow-legged\n   frog suitable habitat is small and discrete, relative to the entire range of the species; and, the proposed project is expected to result in higher forest ecosystem resiliency, thereby benefitting the mountain yellow-legged frog. The overall expectation is that the proposed project will maintain or enhance the conservation value of habitat for the frog within the action area by creating habitat conditions that are less conducive to future high-severity fires. In addition, the proposed project will, over time, result in improved aquatic and upland habitat conditions for the frog, such as decreased soil erosion rates and improved breeding habitat. The proposed project will, over time, result in increased growth of streamside vegetation, creating a variety of micro-climates for optimum water temperature and basking sites allowing frogs to better thermo-regulate, and improved upland refugia habitat conditions adjacent to streams.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   BiOp 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition to these low potential adverse effects in the short term, the FWS concluded that \"[w]hile project activities will slightly increase these adverse effects beyond current fire-caused levels, overall restoration activities will result in improved habitat conditions over time.\" BiOp 12. This conclusion is supported by the record and is consistent with the USFS's determination that it was unlikely that the project would cause significant harm to MYLF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Potential Effects On Pacific Fisher\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the USFS failed to explain why the potential adverse effects on the Pacific fisher are insignificant because it did not address habitat connectivity issues arising from the Cedar Fire. Mot. at 16-17. Plaintiffs argue that the Bull Run project is similar to the Rancheria project, where the USFS ordered a supplemental NEPA analysis in light of concerns about \"habitat fragmentation and loss of connectivity caused by the Cedar Fire.\" PIR 988. Plaintiffs argue that the USFS \"has already determined that there may be significant cumulative effects from the combination of the Rancheria Project and the Cedar Fire,\" and that despite the prior acknowledgement that the fire may lead to isolated fisher populations, the USFS here did not address the issue. Mot. at 17. In particular, Plaintiffs argue that the USFS did not respond to Plaintiffs' concerns in their comments that an isolated fisher community would suffer adverse effects as a result of a limited gene pool and the resultant lowered genetic health of the population.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202457481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The issue was enough to warrant a supplemental analysis for the Rancheria Project, they argue, but led to no analysis here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Bull Run project differs from the Rancheria project in a few important respects. First, the USFS ordered supplemental NEPA analysis for the Rancheria Project because the biological evaluation for that project had been completed in 2013, prior to the Cedar Fire, and the \"vegetation changes from tree mortality and recent wildfires ... present[ed] new information that was not previously addressed.\" PIR 988;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-9, Rancheria Supplemental Information Report, at 10 (\"The habitat fragmentation and loss of connectivity caused by the effects of the Cedar Fire was not considered in the 2013 Fisher BE. This change in conditions may be significant and alter the conclusions made in the original determination for this project.\"). The BE here, by contrast, was performed post-fire and with the pertinent circumstances accounted for. Moreover, the Rancheria project involved \"commercial thinning\" and \"fuels treatment (pre-commercial thin and [prescribed] burn)\" over an area almost 1800 acres larger than the 488 acres of fisher habitat at issue here. BE 63-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The BE discusses, among other threats to fishers in the Sierra Nevada population, the risk associated with habitat fragmentation, noting that activities giving rise to \"habitat fragmentation or population pose a risk to the persistence of fishers.\" BE 47. The BE notes that the existence of roads can alone result in the loss of habitat connectivity and cites studies on fisher populations near roads, which suggested that fishers \"favored landscapes with more contiguous, unfrequented forests and less human activity.\" BE 47. A study in portions of the Sierra Nevada found that the presence of fishers was \"negatively associated with road density.\" BE 47. The BE notes that the placement of roads has already affected the canopy cover in the area, BE 52, and that the project \"focuses its efforts to encompass areas of highest burn severity where low canopy cover and structural attributes needed for resting and denning activity are no longer present.\" BE 54. Live trees with canopy cover would not be felled. BE 65. Research in the Sierra National Forest has shown that fishers do not use \"high severity burn areas\" at least in the immediate aftermath of the fire, though there is \"some evidence of limited foraging occurring along the burn edge.\" BE 54. There are \"no den sites in the project analysis area.\" BE 48. Outside of the \"small linear strip of habitat (300 feet on each side of the road),\" BE 52, snags will remain untreated, and even within the treatment area, the design criteria call for an \"average of four snags per acre retained in the treated areas.\" BE 54. Despite being lower-quality habitat less likely to be used by fishers, the roadways in the project area \"are not anticipated to be rendered unusable and will continue to provide for foraging and dis[per]sal activities to occur.\" BE 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs object that the BE fails to address their concerns about habitat connectivity, but given the lengthy discussion of pertinent studies, the low quality of the habitat in the project area, and low likelihood of fishers present in the area, the USFS reasonably determined that the action would not significantly affect fishers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Potential Effects On California Spotted Owl\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Federal Defendants describe the BE's examination of the Bull Run project's potential effects on the CSO as a \"detailed, quantitative analysis\" that used \"multiple metrics,\" including total available habitat and acres treated; estimated changes in structural characteristics of the habitat, such as canopy, snags, and large woody debris; disturbance effects; and the number of acres treated of certain habitat types and changes in percentage of relative habitat.

First, they argue that the USFS did not address a CSO Endangered Species Act listing petition that Plaintiff John Muir Project submitted with its comments. Mot. at 18. The listing petition, containing data from nine reports, included evidence that Plaintiffs characterized as showing that most owl territories retain occupancy after a fire but that post-fire logging reduces the suitability of that habitat.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202457481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Federal Defendants respond that some of these studies were discussed in the BE\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Plaintiffs' summary does not describe the studies as addressing snags and hazard trees along roads, like the project at issue here. The BE's discussion of the\n   scientific literature also includes explanations concerning studies on which it placed less weight. For example, its discussion of one study finding spotted owls selectively foraging in high-severity burn areas explains that the study was based on a small sample size, for a short duration, long after the fire event, and that at least one of the owls was later spotted far outside the high-severity burn zone.

The project will fell dead and dying trees in low-quality habitat\n   <em>\n    within 300 feet of roads\n   </em>\n   , leaving 88% of the Cedar Fire area untouched and hundreds of thousands of snags intact.

Here, given that there are no reported instances of MYLF or fisher in the project area, the Court finds that irreparable harm to those species is unlikely.

As for the CSO, two of the four CSO territories near the project area have minimal overlap with the planned area, BE 26-27, a third has likely been abandoned, BE 28-29, 56, and the\n   fourth will have a monitor on site for any felling during the project, and if nesting owls are present, the project will be subject to a limited operating period, BE 10.

Dead and dying trees may collapse on cars or people, resulting in death or serious injury, or may roll onto roadways after collapsing. Trees may cause damage to property by falling on roads or other infrastructure directly, or may damage or clog drainage structures, resulting in flooded roads. Unstable snags present a risk to firefighters, who would either subject themselves to serious risk to enter the area in the event of another fire or avoid the area completely. The snags themselves also present a fire risk, and removal of conditions \"conducive to future high-severity fires\" represents another public benefit. Finally, delaying the project may limit its potential future scope. Dead and dying trees deteriorate\n   over time, resulting in structural degradation that may result in some portion of the trees presenting a risk of collapse too high for safe removal, resulting in a potential risk to public safety that may \"persist for decades.\" Opp. at 22 (citing Elliott Decl. \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Environmental concerns represent a significant public interest, but weighed against Plaintiffs' chances of demonstrating environmental harm on the merits, along with the very serious safety concerns related to removal of hazard trees near roads and recreation sites, the public interest tips strongly against granting the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 10) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Plaintiffs' Preliminary Injunction Record was filed in two parts, ECF No. 10-8 and 10-9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The USFS has also argued that the activities would fall under other CEs for \"[t]imber stand and/or wildlife habitat improvement activities,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n     36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(6), and for \"[p]ost-fire rehabilitation activities,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.6\">\n     36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(11), but the proposed \"salvage\" activities do not neatly fit into either category, which include as examples activities like tree planting, repair of damage to minor facilities, thinning brush, and prescribed burning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Available at:\n    <em>\n     http://a123.g.akamai.net/7/123/11558/abc123/forestservic.download.akamai.com/11558/www/nepa/94223_FSPLT3_1425113.pdf (last visited Nov. 16, 2017).\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Available at:\n    <em>\n     https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3792599.pdf (last visited Nov. 16. 2017).\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Plaintiffs also point out that in promulgating CE-13, USFS reviewed numerous example projects to determine the 250-acre project size, including some roadside hazard projects.
