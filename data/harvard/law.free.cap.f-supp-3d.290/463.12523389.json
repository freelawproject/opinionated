Davis, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Opinion and Order follows a two day evidentiary hearing/bench trial associated with Defendant's (\"NACCAS\") withdrawal of Plaintiff's (\"Wards Corner\") accreditation as a barbering and cosmetology academy. With the benefit of the trial transcript, the parties have submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Therefore, the matter is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November of 2014, Wards Corner submitted its 2013 Annual Report to NACCAS, self-reporting that its graduation rate was below the required threshold of 50%. In early December, 2014, Defendant informed Plaintiff that it was being placed on \"low outcomes monitoring\" and that Plaintiff had twelve months to bring its graduation rate into compliance. In the fall of 2015, within the twelve-month window, Plaintiff submitted its 2014 annual report to NACCAS. Upon review of such submission, NACCAS determined that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a compliant 2014 graduate rate. NACCAS nevertheless allowed Plaintiff one opportunity to submit supplemental information in an effort to demonstrate an accurate and compliant 2014 graduation rate, and after requesting and receiving an extension, Plaintiff submitted a supplement in January of 2016. In February of 2016, NACCAS held a week-long \"Commissioner's Meeting,\" and at such meeting, Defendant determined that Plaintiff's accreditation should be withdrawn. The withdrawal decision was later\n   affirmed through the NACCAS appeals process. While the instant lawsuit initially challenged several aspects of the withdrawal decision, the sole issue addressed at the evidentiary hearing was whether Plaintiff was denied its common law right to \"fair procedure\" in the accreditation review process as a result of the fact that Michael Bouman (\"Mr. Bouman\"), a NACCAS Commissioner that participated in such process, was an executive and part owner of a competitor cosmetology academy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   NACCAS' Commission is made up of thirteen Commissioners, including seven Commissioners that are owners or administrators of schools in fields of training within NACCAS' scope (which includes cosmetology and barbering), as well as two Commissioners representing each of the following areas: \"Professional Services,\" \"Academics,\" and \"Public Interest.\" During the relevant timeframe, Mr. Bouman was the \"Chair of the Commission,\" and he was one of the seven Commissioners in the school owner/administrator category as he is employed by Empire Education Group, Inc. (\"EEG\"), a privately held corporation that operates cosmetology schools in twenty-one states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   NACCAS' written Code of Ethics states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. INTEGRITY OF NACCAS-Each commissioner, officer and employee of NACCAS is expected to respect the integrity of NACCAS. Accordingly, no commissioner, officer or employee of NACCAS should be subject to influences, interests or relationships which conflict with the best interest of NACCAS and its objectives and purposes as set forth in its Articles of Incorporation and By-laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. CONFLICT OF INTEREST-A conflict of interest exists when the duty of loyalty to NACCAS, including the furtherance of its objects and purposes as set forth in its Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, can be prejudiced by actual or potential personal benefit from another source. Each commissioner, officer, and employee is expected to avoid any investment, interest or association which interferes with the independent exercise of judgment in the best interest of NACCAS and those persons for whose benefit NACCAS was formed. Disclosures of personal interests or other circumstances which might constitute conflicts of interest are to be reported promptly by the commissioner, officer, or employee to the Chairman of NACCAS for resolution in the manner best suited to the interests of NACCAS and such individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. ABUSE OF POSITION-No commissioner shall abuse his or her position to gain for himself, herself or others improper personal, material or pecuniary benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Joint Ex. 3. In addition to the above quoted excerpts, unquoted portions of the Code of Ethics provide specifically enumerated conflicts which exist, in order to control against both a conflict of interest and \"the perception of such conflicts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These additional provisions expressly preclude a Commissioner from participating in voting or discussion involving any school owned or operated by the Commissioner, any school in the state in which the Commissioner lives, and any school in the same state as the corporate headquarters of the Commissioner's institution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on the NACCAS conflict of interest policy, Mr. Bouman was automatically disqualified from participating in voting or discussions involving any EEG school, as well as\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   schools in Montana or Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to his automatic conflicts, Mr. Bouman would recuse himself on a case-by-case basis when he had some known interest or relationship with a school, such as when he had prior contact with a school regarding EEG's possible acquisition of such school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Turning to the facts surrounding the competitive \"conflict\" alleged by Plaintiff in this case, in 2013, EEG opened a cosmetology school in Virginia Beach, Virginia, approximately twelve miles from the Norfolk, Virginia location of Wards Corner's cosmetology and barbering academy. When identifying this location, and any other locations where EEG opens a new school, a key factor for EEG is accessibility to public transportation because 60-65% of EEG's students, companywide, rely on public transportation to commute to school. As described by Mr. Bouman, the average EEG student is between 19 and 24 years old, and the majority of students are single women with dependent children, a fact that can further complicate such students' ability to arrive to school on time through public transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When EEG first opened its Virginia Beach School, Wards Corner was operating both its long-established Norfolk school and a second more recently established school in Virginia Beach. Wards Corner's Virginia Beach school was approximately three miles from the location where EEG opened its school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December of 2014, Wards Corner closed its Virginia Beach location, with such closure due in part to the fact that Plaintiff's lease was expiring as the building where the school was located was being torn down and turned into residential housing. When Wards Corner closed its Virginia Beach location, most of the students transferred to the Norfolk School, a few decided to go to EEG's Virginia Beach school, and some just dropped out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A former Wards Corner manager believed that those students that did not transfer to the Norfolk location had transportation issues because they rode the bus and it is \"a trek from Virginia Beach to Norfolk.\" Logan Depo. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the parties strongly dispute the degree of competition between Wards Corner and EEG, the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing unquestionably established that Plaintiff's Norfolk school and EEG's Virginia Beach school are \"competitors\" at some level. The Hampton Roads area, including the contiguous cities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Hampton, and Newport News, is a single media market. Television, radio and local online advertising all extend across city lines into what, in some ways, resembles a single metropolitan area. That said, the socioeconomic factors\n   impacting students that attend both Wards Corner's and EEG's schools have a substantial impact on the area from which each school can attract students, with many of the students lacking access to private transportation. Such students naturally favor a school in close proximity to their homes due to the constraints involved in relying on public transportation, particularly for those students with young children. Moreover, because the cosmetology education process also involves developing a clientele during the period of instruction, to include friends and family, there are additional benefits associated with attending a school near an individual's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the timeframe most relevant to this case (2015 through February of 2016), there were five accredited cosmetology schools in the Hampton Roads area: Wards Corner (Norfolk), EEG (Virginia Beach), Regency Beauty Institute (Newport News), Rudy &amp; Kelly Academy (located either in Chesapeake or Virginia Beach) and Suffolk Beauty Academy (Suffolk).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's Norfolk school was the only school operated by Wards Corner in 2015 and 2016, whereas EEG's Virginia Beach school was one of approximately ninety schools operated by EEG in numerous states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Bouman estimated that EEG's Virginia Beach school accounted for slightly more than 1\u00bd percent of EEG's total revenue, with such school expected to generate a profit of approximately $50,000 to $60,000 a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In early 2016 when Wards Corner's accreditation was being evaluated by the NACCAS Commission, Mr. Bouman was EEG's \"President and COO\" and earned an annual salary of approximately $260,000. Additionally, Mr. Bouman owned a small fraction (less than 1%) of EEG's stock that he had acquired through an employee stock program. Mr. Bouman acquired his stock through executing a promissory note, and in 2016, the stock that Mr. Bouman owned was worth less than the balance owed on the note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Mr. Bouman testified that, as of February 2016, he was confused/ignorant as to whether he was actually a legal \"owner\" of EEG (because he never paid out-of-pocket for the stock and never personally possessed the stock certificates), any such misconceptions do not change the fact that Mr. Bouman was in fact a partial \"owner\" of EEG. He therefore had at least some personal financial interest in EEG performing well because his gain or loss on the company stock would presumably be determined (at some point in the future) based on EEG's performance/value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to his salary and small ownership interest, Mr. Bouman had in the past received bonuses from EEG. Specifically, he received an incentive bonus of over $137,000 in September of 2013 based on company-wide performance for fiscal year 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 92. Also paid to Mr. Bouman in September of 2013 was a $10,000 bonus representing a 2012 \"Christmas\" bonus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Due to an overall decline in the cosmetology industry, Mr. Bouman did not receive any subsequent incentive/performance bonuses, although he did receive two additional Christmas bonuses of approximately $5,000, paid in December of 2013 and December of 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Bouman received no bonuses of any kind\n   in 2015, and as of February 2016, being very familiar with EEG's performance and performance goals, Mr. Bouman was aware that it was very unlikely that he would receive a bonus in that year (and he ultimately did not receive a bonus in 2016). Mr. Bouman credibly testified that EEG, and many other companies in the industry, had been less profitable for several years due primarily to changes in government policy regarding the issuance of student loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Turning to February 2016, Mr. Bouman was present and participated in the week-long NACCAS Commission Meeting where Wards Corner's accreditation was withdrawn. As Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Bouman presided over the full Commission meeting, which occurred late in the week, by calling the agenda items and moderating the discussion. He did not vote on any individual school actions at the meeting of the full Commission, but he was available to vote in the event there was a tie. After Mr. Bouman called the Wards Corner agenda item, another Commissioner presented the matter to the full Commission for discussion and voting, and at the conclusion of such discussion, the Commission unanimously voted (11-0) to withdraw Wards Corner's accreditation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although Mr. Bouman did not \"vote\" to withdraw Ward Corner's accreditation, in the days leading up to the meeting of the full Commission, he personally participated in reviewing Wards Corner's file. As explained in detail in open court, the NACCAS annual meeting lasts for several days, and a day or two before the full Commission meets to vote on school actions, one of four NACCAS \"File Review Teams\" meets to review several upcoming agenda items. Each of the NACCAS File Review Teams is an established group of the same three Commissioners, who work together to investigate potential action items and develop a recommendation to present to the full Commission later that week. Members of a File Review Team do not know which school actions they will work on until they meet on the designated day of the multi-day Commission meeting (the files are assigned by NACCAS staff).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Bouman was not assigned to any of the four NACCAS file review teams. However, because File Review Team Two was missing one of its three members at the February meeting, Mr. Bouman filled in as a substitute member of such team. Wards Corner's file was assigned to File Review Team Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Bouman does not have a clear recollection of any specific discussions that Team Two had about Wards Corner, but he acknowledges that he was present in the room for at least some part of the discussion. Additionally, Mr. Bouman signed the Wards Corner \"Action Form,\" a two page document that includes limited information, but does expressly recommend withdrawal of accreditation. Such form was signed by Mr. Bouman as a \"School Owner Commissioner,\" and was also signed by an \"Academic Commissioner\" a \"Public Interest Commissioner,\" as well as two NACCAS \"Staff Members.\" Joint Ex. 17. During his time acting as a substitute member of File Review Team Two, Mr. Bouman was unaware of Wards Corner's proximity to EEG's Virginia\n   Beach School, and he had no prior dealings with Wards Corner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 251-52, 262, 264. Being unaware of the existence of a \"conflict,\" Mr. Bouman never even considered recusing himself from reviewing such file, and recommended withdrawal based on the merits of the file he examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted above, after the full Commission voted to withdraw accreditation, Plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed such ruling through NACCAS' appeal procedures. Subsequent to the appeal, the instant lawsuit was filed. This Court previously granted partial summary judgment in favor of Defendant, but the disputed evidence and conflicting inferences associated with Mr. Bouman's interest in the outcome of Wards Corner's accreditation decision required an evidentiary hearing/bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As explained in\n   <em>\n    Prof'l Massage\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]ccreditation agencies are private entities, not state actors, and as such are not subject to the strictures of constitutional due process requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n    at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, because such agencies are \"quasi-public\" and \"wield enormous power over institutions-life and death power, some might say,\" they owe a \"common law duty ... to employ fair procedures when making decisions affecting their members.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n    at 169-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Distilled to the simplest terms, the right to \"fair procedure\" requires accreditation agencies \"to play it straight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 170 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2 William A.

Lee,\n   <em>\n    The Law of Higher Education\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15.3.2.2 (5th ed. 2013) (explaining that state or federal \"common law\" has been applied by various courts both to require an accreditation agency to \"follow its own rules\" and to follow \"a variously described standard of fairness in their dealings with members,\" and that the \"primary 'fairness' requirement seems to be that the agency must provide institutions with procedural due process before denying, withdrawing, or refusing to renew their accreditation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to establishing the legal duty owed by accreditation agencies,\n   <em>\n    Prof'l Massage\n   </em>\n   defines the scope of the Court's inquiry and the degree of deference that is owed to an accreditation decision. Importantly, \"recognition that ... a common law duty exists does not authorize courts to undertake a wide-ranging review of decisionmaking by accreditation agencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Prof'l Massage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n    781 F.3d at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the proper scope of the fairness review authorizes reviewing courts \"to consider only whether the decision of an accrediting agency such as [NACCAS] is arbitrary and unreasonable or an abuse of discretion and whether the decision is based on substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n    at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A district court is therefore prohibited from substituting its judgment for that of the accrediting agency and may not \"conduct a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).

The Fourth Circuit, has, however, acknowledged that the scope of the Court's inquiry may be expanded if a plaintiff makes \"a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n    at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted). Such rule exists because \"an impartial decisionmaker is an essential element of due process\" regardless of whether a district court is addressing a constitutional due process claim or a claim grounded in the common law right to fair procedure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/\">\n    at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

The Fourth Circuit then explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   It is quite significant, we think, that the words \"however small\" apply only to a \"financial interest.\" Their meaning is perfectly clear. If a judge has an ownership interest in a party or in the subject matter in controversy, it matters not at all whether the interest is a large or infinitesimally small amount. But that is not so with respect to \"any other interest.\" The difference is a sensible one. A monetary or financial interest is by its very nature such an interest that may generate doubt as to a judge's impartiality. What is a small sum to one person may not be to another. But a \"bare expectancy\" or chance to ultimately benefit on an equal basis with all other customers is not so suspect in nature.

Although the pragmatic desire to have industry practitioners on an administrative board or commission cannot excuse the participation of a truly \"interested\" adjudicator, practical realities appear to allow, consistent with the common law right to fair procedure, that some degree of \"independence\" be forfeited in certain administrative contexts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stivers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415055\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/732/\">\n    71 F.3d at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that if a disqualifying conflict were found \"based solely on the fact that there may on occasion be 'some' competition for clients\" between the practitioner-decisionmaker's company and the company with a matter pending before the licensing board, \"[it] would call into question the composition\" of numerous boards across various industries); 2 Charles H.

The attendant differences are clear when drawing a comparison between a federal judge presiding over a criminal bench trial, and an administrative panel determining whether to revoke a professional accreditation. The judge in such hypothetical is presumed to be starting from a completely neutral position, and in the rare instances where a conflict or pecuniary interest is identified that even arguably calls the judge's impartiality into question, prudence often dictates that the judge be recused and the case reassigned to another judge. In contrast, a commission made up of multiple\n   <em>\n    industry practitioners\n   </em>\n   determining whether to withdraw the accreditation or license\n   of a\n   <em>\n    fellow practitioner\n   </em>\n   is presumed to often find itself starting from a position where some slight conflict/pecuniary interest exists, because whenever accreditation or a license to operate is withdrawn within a given field,\n   <em>\n    some potential benefit\n   </em>\n   will necessarily inure to a practitioner-decisionmaker based on the fact that an additional person/entity has been removed from the pool of competitors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 Koch &amp; Murphy,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6:10 (explaining in a subsection titled \"Nonconstitutional limits on bias in adjudication\" that \"Administrative officials are presumed to be objective and capable of judging particular controversies fairly and on the basis of their own circumstances,\" and that \"[a]dministrative adjudicators may not have the independence of an Article III judge but they may be held to the same standard of impartial decisionmaking\"). Stated differently, whether an alleged pecuniary conflict grounded in the competitive impact of a court case or administrative adjudication is \"direct\" and \"substantial\" or whether it is \"indirect\" or \"slight\" appears to depend on the nature of the adjudication, the industry in question, the degree of competition in the case, and the role the allegedly biased adjudicator played.

After conducting an evidentiary hearing to examine disputed evidence and inferences in these three areas in a case that presents a relatively close call, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to carry its burden of showing that Mr. Bouman's limited pecuniary interest overcomes the presumption of honesty and integrity and/or otherwise demonstrates such a substantial risk of bias that Plaintiff was denied its common law right to \"fair procedure\" based on Mr. Bouman's participation in the accreditation review process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Competition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial evidence demonstrates that, during the relevant timeframe, there was some degree of competition between Plaintiff's Norfolk School and EEG's Virginia Beach School.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the evidentiary hearing/bench trial, the limited distance between these Norfolk and Virginia Beach schools (approximately twelve miles) itself raised the specter of substantial competition; however, the trial evidence demonstrated that while competition unquestionably existed, the nature of the industry and the resources of the typical student educated by both Plaintiff and EEG created\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   limitations on the degree of direct competition. Notably, Defendant presented credible evidence that the majority of EEG's students do not have access to a private vehicle and therefore rely on public transportation to commute to school. Such reality limited EEG's ability to draw students from outside the immediate area surrounding its Virginia Beach school. Mr. Bouman's testimony on relevant socioeconomic factors and EEG's approach of targeting a student body in close proximity to its schools was not only credible, but it was supported by additional evidence, including Mr. Bouman's unrefuted testimony that EEG operates two schools approximately 20 to 25 miles apart near Richmond, Virginia (demonstrating the limited reach of each school). Moreover, Plaintiff's own evidence confirmed Mr. Bouman's statements about the nature of the industry, including: (1) the pretrial sworn statement by Plaintiff in its verified complaint indicating that the \"competitor\" schools in the region, which included EEG's school, were all \"a considerable\n   commuting distance away\" and that \"few of [Plaintiff's] students own or have access to private transportation,\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 45, ECF No. 28; (2) the live testimony of Plaintiff's President confirming that, in the \"market that we deal with,\" it is \"hard to afford transportation,\" and the difficultly securing transportation was \"reason alone\" for many students to drop out when Wards Corner lost its accreditation, Tr. 37-38, 44; (3) Plaintiff's acknowledgement that only three of fifty-eight students asked for documentation necessary to transfer their credits to EGG when Wards Corner lost its accreditation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44; and (4) the fact that Plaintiff had operated a Virginia Beach location for several years within approximately ten miles of its Norfolk location and its President presently co-owns a school in Suffolk operated by his ex-wife (both providing additional evidence of the limited geographic reach of each school),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In considering the case-specific facts relevant to the degree of competition, this Court also considers the fact that Wards Corner's Norfolk school was a cosmetology\n   <em>\n    and barbering\n   </em>\n   academy, whereas EEG's Virginia Beach school was limited to teaching cosmetology, further reducing the degree of competition between Plaintiff and EEG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, while the undisputed evidence demonstrates that both schools operate in the same broader media market, there is no evidence before the Court establishing that EEG took active steps to recruit students from the city of Norfolk and/or students that were otherwise considering enrolling at Plaintiff's school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In addition to the real, but limited, competition between the schools for a small percentage of cosmetology students, the fact that there are several other competitors in the broader Hampton Roads area, to include a \"competitor\" academy co-owned by the President of Wards Corner,\n   is relevant to the competition calculus. Also relevant is the size and scope of EEG's companywide operations. Mr. Bouman's testimony established that the Virginia Beach location was one of approximately ninety schools owned and operated by EEG, and that it accounted for slightly more than 1\u00bd percent of EEG's revenue, with anticipated annual profits of around $50,000 to $60,000. While such facts do not undercut the reality that EEG and Wards Corner competed on a local basis for some fraction of potential\n   <em>\n    cosmetology\n   </em>\n   students that would be willing,\n   <em>\n    and able\n   </em>\n   , to commute to either location, EEG did not compete with Wards Corner for the vast majority of its overall student body, who were educated in areas outside of Hampton Roads, Virginia. Stated differently, the size of EEG's overall company is certainly not dispositive because EEG has a legitimate business motivation to succeed in every market in which it participates; however, EEG's overall size lends useful context because the respective motivations of both schools, and the degree of familiarity (or lack thereof) that EEG had with Wards Corner would be far different if, for example, EEG was truly a \"local\" competitor whose entire operation consisted of two or three schools in Southeast Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Considering the likelihood, and scope, of any potential\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   benefit that EEG would realize from the closure of Plaintiff's school, first, EEG's Virginia Beach school was only one of four local \"competitors\" to Wards Corner, and would likely have to \"compete\" to a degree for any resulting benefit. Second, the scope of any immediate pecuniary benefit would have been expected to be (and was in fact) limited because, as explained by both Plaintiff's owner and Mr. Bouman, there are difficulties transferring credit hours from a school operated by one company to a school operated by another company due to differences in teaching methods and curriculums. Tr. 38-39, 221-23. Third, based on the economic status of Wards Corner's student body, \"few\" students would have been expected to have the resources to travel to another regional city for education, rendering it \"unlikely\" that many of Wards Corner's students would transfer/travel to EEG's Virginia Beach school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   To use Plaintiff's own word characterizing the regional market, in light of the fact that EEG did not offer a barbering course, and transportation concerns severely hindered many cosmetology students from commuting to another local city, the hearing evidence demonstrates that it is \"unlikely\" that EEG would have expected to secure any material financial benefit from the closure of Wards Corner's school (and as discussed in greater detail below, the perceived benefit that would potentially redound to EEG's president, an owner of less than one percent of EEG's stock, would be even further attenuated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the trial evidence demonstrates that, in early 2016, there was in fact \" '\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   ' competition for clients\" between Plaintiff and EEG,\n   <em>\n    Stivers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415055\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/732/\">\n    71 F.3d at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and although each school may have enrolled cosmetology students from the city where the other school was located,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   the degree to which socioeconomic and other factors impacted enrollment/recruitment\n   suggests a far lesser degree of \"competition\" than would exist in a case where two companies were directly \"bidding\" against each other, or otherwise\n   <em>\n    actively\n   </em>\n   \"competing\" for the same clients or contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Financial Interest in EEG\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The hearing evidence established that, in early 2016, Mr. Bouman had a small stock ownership interest in EEG, as several years earlier he executed a promissory note to purchase less than 1% of EEG's privately held stock (.67%). At the time of the Wards Corner accreditation decision, Mr. Bouman was aware that the EEG stock he owned was worth less than he agreed to pay for it, which created some motivation for Mr. Bouman, or more correctly stated, a reasonable person in Mr. Bouman's position, to act to improve EEG's financial condition. That said, considering all of the relevant facts, to include Mr. Bouman's salary level, a reasonable company administrator in Mr. Bouman's shoes would appear to be just as likely, if not more likely, to be motivated by a general desire to \"succeed\" and to have his or her company perform well as the desire to improve the company's financial condition in order to achieve a consequential benefit to his or her personal bottom line as owner of .67% of EEG's company stock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In addition to his ownership interest, it is undisputed that during\n   <em>\n    past periods\n   </em>\n   of company prosperity, Mr. Bouman had received raises to his salary and a substantial performance bonus and/or Christmas bonus from EEG. That said, the hearing testimony and evidence demonstrated that Mr. Bouman did not have any realistic opportunity to obtain a bonus at the time he participated in Wards Corner's accreditation decision (or in the foreseeable future). As noted above, Mr. Bouman credibly testified that both EEG, and the entire industry, had been in substantial decline for several years due primarily to changes in federal policy regarding student loan debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the record establishes that Mr. Bouman, who was approximately 70, was considering retirement from EEG, or semi-retirement, which undercuts any suggestion that he was motivated by a personal financial interest in improving EEG's long-term financial position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 245-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Participation in the Withdrawal Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The undisputed facts demonstrate that while Mr. Bouman did not formally \"vote\" to withdraw Wards Corner's accreditation at the meeting of the full Commission, he had\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   roles in the accreditation review process. First, and most significantly, Mr. Bouman was one of three members of the \"file review team\" that reviewed Wards Corner's file in the days leading up to the meeting of the full NACCAS Board of Commissioners. As noted above, Mr. Bouman's participation in such file review team was merely by happenstance as he was filling in for an absent Commissioner; however, Mr. Bouman did in fact participate in reviewing Wards Corner's file and he personally signed the \"action form\" recommending that the full Commission vote to withdraw accreditation. Joint Ex. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, in his role as Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Bouman presided over the meeting of the full Commission at which Ward's Corner's accreditation was considered and ultimately withdrawn by unanimous vote of the other eleven Commissioners (including the two Commissioners who were on the file review team with Mr. Bouman). Mr. Bouman did not leave the room during such discussion or otherwise recuse himself from his role \"moderating\" the discussion (although the record does not reflect the length of the discussion and/or whether any \"moderating\" actually occurred). Although Mr. Bouman, in his role as Chairman, did not personally participate in any debate engaged in by the full Commission and did not formally cast a vote to withdraw Ward's Corner's accreditation, his vote was arguably symbolically cast through his signature on the \"action form.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, in light of the combination of Mr. Bouman's two roles, if he were found to have had a direct and substantial pecuniary interest in the outcome, his involvement would likely be enough to result in the denial of Plaintiff's right to an impartial decisionmaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Considering the totality of the above case-specific facts, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that it was denied an impartial decisionmaker based on Mr. Bouman's indirect financial interest in the outcome of the Wards Corner accreditation review process. The evidence before the Court demonstrates that although EEG and Wards Corner may have competed over \"some\" fraction of students, the scope of such competitive interest is best described as limited based on the locations of the schools and the socioeconomic status of the student body of both Plaintiff's school and EEG's school. Moreover, assuming that a person in Mr. Bouman's position would know that the closure of Ward's Corner's school would provide a limited competitive benefit to EEG,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   degree to which such limited benefit would inure to Mr. Bouman,\n   <em>\n    if at all\n   </em>\n   , is even further removed, and accurately characterized as speculative. While Plaintiff successfully demonstrates that Mr. Bouman was a partial \"owner\" of EEG who had previously received performance bonuses, and thus a reasonable person in his position would have some financial motivation to advance the profitability of EEG's Virginia Beach school during the spring of 2016, the case-specific evidence reveals that such interest was both \"slight\" and\n   <em>\n    indirect\n   </em>\n   . Notably, closing Wards Corner's school would not result in a direct monetary payment to Mr. Bouman, and any \"trickle down\" financial benefits he would receive in the future were, at least on these facts, remote. Mr. Bouman's financial interest in the outcome of Wards Corner's accreditation review is best described as \"limited\" in light of: (1) the distances between the various schools; (2) the number of \"competitors\" in the Hampton Roads region; (3) the acknowledged reality that Plaintiff's students generally lacked access to private transportation and were \"unlikely\" to commute to EEG's Virginia Beach school; and (4) other relevant case-specific facts, to include the size of Mr. Bouman's base salary, his limited ownership interest in EEG, the fact that EEG's Virginia Beach school represents only approximately 1\u00bd percent of EEG's total revenue, Mr. Bouman's plan to retire in the near future, and the fact that Mr. Bouman had not received a performance bonus in several years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In addition to the above, Mr. Bouman credibly testified that he was unaware of the proximity of the two schools when he participated in the February 2016 Commissioner's meeting, and while it would have been prudent for a \"reasonable person\" in his position to perform additional research and consider recusal, even if only out of an abundance of caution to preserve the appearance of impartiality, the evidence fails to demonstrate that the competitive interest at issue in this case rises to the level that\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   recusal under the common law right to \"fair procedure\" and/or Defendant's own established ethical rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court considers as part of the overall calculus the fact that NACCAS's board is required to include a majority of industry practitioners, as well as Mr. Bouman's testimony regarding the value such practitioners' experience brings to the Commission. The desire to benefit from such specialized knowledge cannot be used as a shield to avoid the obligation to provide\n   member institutions an impartial decisionmaker; however, a company is not denied its common law right to a fair accreditation procedure merely because one of several commissioners might, on occasion, compete with such company for \"some\" customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court also considers as part of its calculus the fact that Mr. Bouman did not formally vote to withdraw accreditation, although he did \"recommend\" that accreditation be withdrawn and most, if not all, of the other Commissioners likely knew that he had made such recommendation. Even with such knowledge, however, in light of Mr. Bouman's limited personal interest in the outcome, and the fact that his participation in the file review team was by happenstance, it would strain credulity to suggest that, in the absence of any actual evidence of impropriety, eleven independent Commissioners, operating with a\n   <em>\n    presumption of honesty and integrity\n   </em>\n   , abdicated such role in order to follow a \"recommendation\" of Mr. Bouman rather than exercising their own independent judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This Court is well aware of controlling precedent regarding the impact of a biased individual on the independence of a judicial panel, and independent of this Court's obligation to follow such precedent, agrees entirely with its reasoning.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Additionally, judicial secrecy is not an issue in this case, and the parties have explored Mr. Bouman's participation in the Commission's decision making process.

Frankly, the instant case presented a relatively close call, ultimately requiring this Court, and the parties, to wade into a matter best resolved through the administrative process. While the evidence presented in open court demonstrates that Plaintiff's fair procedure rights were not violated, this Court notes its surprise that, in applying the code of conduct, individual NACCAS Commissioners do not always consider whether a school they own or operate is in close proximity to the school being evaluated and/or the degree to which an unfavorable ruling as to a \"competitor\" school might redound to the financial benefit of the interested Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Here, as suggested by this Court's summary judgment opinion, ECF No. 140, at 18-19, and as further bolstered by Mr. Bouman's credible testimony in open court, there is no evidence on which a reasonable juror could conclude that \"actual bias\" had any impact on the outcome of the accreditation review process.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marlboro Corp. v.

Accordingly, utilizing the nomenclature set forth in\n    <em>\n     Stivers\n    </em>\n    , the question before this Court is limited to whether Mr. Bouman's position at EEG created an impermissible risk of bias that warrants \"per se disqualification.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    As noted above, here, the NACCAS Board of Commissioners included seven industry practitioners that were school owners or administrators.

While Mr. Bouman plainly had an obligation to act in EEG's best interests when acting on its behalf, Plaintiff's suggestion that Mr. Bouman had a duty to EEG to drive all \"competitors\" out of business through the power he wielded as Chairman of NACCAS is not compelling. Such a rule would in essence preclude any practitioner from being a Commissioner, and ignores: (1) the reality that EEG's interests were likely furthered by having its President on the Commission; and (2) as an operator of nearly 100 schools, it was in EEG's interest that the Commission fairly evaluate\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    accreditation matters as the makeup of the Commission would change over time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The competition was obviously greater during the period that Plaintiff operated its Virginia Beach school; however, the closure of such school occurred long before Mr. Bouman participated in the challenged accreditation review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Plaintiff's President testified that the annual report submitted by Wards Corner to NACCAS in 2015 reflects that twenty percent of Plaintiff's students lived in Virginia Beach. Tr. 26. However, such report covered the prior academic year when Wards Corner still had its Virginia Beach location open. Additionally, a review of the documentation from such year reveals that some of the students who lived in Virginia Beach were enrolled in Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     barbering\n    </em>\n    program. Joint Ex. 46. Wards Corner's COO testified at the evidentiary hearing and provided a \"student by student\" review of numerous enrollees during 2014, but she identified only\n    <em>\n     two\n    </em>\n    students who lived in Virginia Beach and attended Wards Corner's Norfolk\n    <em>\n     cosmetology\n    </em>\n    program. Tr. 58-60. The fact that multiple Norfolk cosmetology students lived in Portsmouth, Virginia is of limited evidentiary value in light of the fact that Portsmouth did not have an accredited cosmetology academy and it is located immediately across the river from Norfolk and there are two tunnels connecting the cities. Shifting focus to the number of Virginia Beach students attending Plaintiff's Norfolk school\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    the Virginia Beach location closed, Plaintiff's post-hearing briefing asserts that 12% (7/58) of the students who left Wards Corner after its accreditation was lost in 2016 lived in Virginia Beach. ECF No. 150, at 6. Such figure, however, suffers from two infirmities. First, it is calculated based on such individuals' addresses as listed on Plaintiff's proposed witness list in the final pretrial order entered in this case, and therefore appears to reflect current addresses as of November 2017 rather than addresses at the time of enrollment. Second, and more importantly, such figure does not indicate how many of these seven students were enrolled in the\n    <em>\n     cosmetology\n    </em>\n    program, as contrasted with the\n    <em>\n     barbering\n    </em>\n    program. As noted above, it is unremarkable to the competition calculus if Virginia Beach barbering students attended Plaintiff's Norfolk school because EEG does not offer a barbering course in Virginia Beach. In summary, as repeatedly stated herein, while the record plainly demonstrates that \"some\" competition for cosmetology students existed in early 2016 when Mr. Bouman participated in the accreditation review process, the evidence suggests that the schools directly competed for a small fraction of their cosmetology student body.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    While Plaintiff's owner clarified such earlier-in-time sworn statement during his live testimony, suggesting that some students could use public transportation or \"Uber\" to commute, for the reasons discussed herein, it is unlikely that most students/prospective students could afford to travel by Uber on a daily basis, and while bus transportation is available in the region, a student's willingness to rely on the bus naturally decreases as the distance and/or number of required bus transfers increase.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    As a matter of local geography, it cannot be said that a student with a Norfolk address necessarily lived closer to Plaintiff's school than EEG's school as EEG's school is only a few miles from the Norfolk border.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Court notes that the record does not establish whether EEG had the capacity at its Virginia Beach school to accept a large number of transfer students in early 2016 and/or whether EEG was having any difficulty attracting students at its Virginia Beach location at such time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    From a subjective standpoint, the Court finds that Mr. Bouman, whose testimony demonstrated that he is both credible and principled, would have taken lawful and ethical steps to improve EEG's financial status regardless of whether he had any ownership interest in EEG because he was clearly dedicated to his company. Although the Court's objective analysis does not consider such fact, it appears that Mr. Bouman's ownership interest had no impact on the way he conducted himself as President of EEG, nor did it have any actual impact on his conduct as a Commissioner, to include his decision to recommend that Plaintiff's accreditation be withdrawn.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Mr. Bouman had not received a performance bonus since 2013, and his last Christmas bonus was: (1) more than a year removed from his participation in the Wards Corner accreditation decision; and (2) was approximately $5,000, a figure that must be considered in the context of both Mr. Bouman's salary and the fact that EEG's Virginia Beach school was just one of approximately ninety EEG locations (rendering it unlikely that any increased enrollment at this school would have a material impact on the profitability of the company as a whole).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Mr. Bouman's partial ownership of EEG would have been surrendered (and valued) at the time of his retirement, so he did have some personal financial interest in the short-term value of EEG's company as a whole.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    It does not appear that the members of the Commission actually had the action form before them when they met and voted unanimously to withdraw Wards Corner's accreditation.

That said, Mr. Bouman freely acknowledged during his testimony that the members of the Commission know which individuals are on which file review teams, that they all knew that one Commission member was absent from the February 2016 meeting, and that they likely knew that Mr. Bouman had filled in to help the file review team with the absent member.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 294-97.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The hearing testimony established that a cosmetology school does not need to be accredited in order to operate in Virginia, although accreditation is required to enroll students receiving federal financial aid (a critical funding source). Accordingly, while Mr. Bouman, or any other Commissioner, may have presumed that withdrawal of Wards Corner's accreditation would lead to its closure, such result was not a definite consequence. Moreover, there are other schools in the same geographic area competing for students, thus further mitigating any benefit to EEG if Wards Corner's school lost its accreditation and/or closed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The Court makes the observation that Mr. Bouman's substantial performance bonus for the 2012-2013 year, if divided evenly across all EEG's schools, amounts to approximately $1,500 per school. Similarly, if calculated on a revenue basis, the bonus attributed to EEG's Virginia Beach school would be around $2,200. While the Court does not rely on either figure in reaching its decision in this case (because such figures are speculative without factual detail as to actual performance of each school) it provides further context to the Court's findings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The Court notes that while the analysis herein is phrased primarily in a manner that addresses whether Plaintiff was afforded its common law fair procedure right to an impartial decisionmaker, such analysis applies equally with respect to whether NACCAS followed its own internal procedures. NACCAS' conflict of interest policy necessarily requires a Commissioner to evaluate the scope of a potential conflict in determining whether to recuse himself or herself from a specific agenda item, and the application of such fact-specific analysis is consistent with, and co-existent with, the common law right to an impartial decisionmaker.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    To the extent that Mr. Bouman's role is subject to being characterized as more akin to an administrative investigator/prosecutor making a recommendation to the panel of individuals that would cast the dispositive vote, the Supreme Court has recognized the while prosecutorial bias can rise to a level that raises serious constitutional questions, \"the strict requirements of neutrality cannot be the same for administrative prosecutors as for judges, whose duty it is to make the final decision and whose impartiality serves as the ultimate guarantee of a fair and meaningful proceeding in our constitutional regime.\"\n    <em>\n     Marshall v.

Such claim is untimely as it was not identified by Plaintiff as a triable issue in the final pre-trial order. ECF No. 131. Moreover, such claim is without merit as the fact that the NACCAS Board of Commissioners divided into small groups to evaluate individual agenda items in greater detail prior to a debate by the full Commission suggests a reasoned and fair process, not a process that creates a \"risk of unfairness [that] is intolerably high.\"\n    <em>\n     Withrow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541084\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/35/#p47\">\n     421 U.S. at 58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541084\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/35/#p47\">\n     95 S.Ct. 1456\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    7 West's Fed.

The issue requiring the resolution of disputed facts and inferences in this case has always been centered on whether Mr. Bouman's interest in EEG required him to recuse himself under the portions of NACCAS's ethical rules that are not subject to being defined with precision, such as the requirement that a Commissioner consider whether his or her \"duty of loyalty to NACCAS ... can be prejudiced by actual or potential personal benefit from another source.\" Joint Ex. 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The Court notes that there are two outstanding motions for attorney's fees in this case.
