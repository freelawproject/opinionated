Plaintiff Oceana, Inc. brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act challenging the Service's management plan for one such species: the dusky shark. But before reaching the merits of that challenge, the Court must first resolve Oceana's motion to compel the Service to complete or supplement the administrative record with four categories of documents: (1) studies and other documents cited in the final Environmental Impact Statement supporting the Service's dusky shark management plan, (2) catch-related data from fishing vessel logbooks and third-party observer reports, (3) documents withheld by the Service under the deliberative process privilege, and (4) certain other extra-record studies and data. Having considered the parties' arguments and supporting evidence, the Court will order that the record be supplemented with a subset of the materials in the first category of Oceana's request as detailed further below. The Court will deny Oceana's motion in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The National Marine Fisheries Service (\"Service\") is a federal agency within the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\"). Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Service is responsible for preparing management plans for all \"highly migratory\" fisheries under its jurisdiction in the Atlantic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201854\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These plans contain measures which are \"necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of the fishery, to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished\n   stocks, and to protect, restore, and promote the long-term health and stability of the fishery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201854\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1853(a)(1)(A). In order to protect against overfishing, in its management plans the Service sets an optimum annual yield for each fishery and species of fish.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.310\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2016, the Service released a draft amendment-Amendment 5b-to its Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan.

Oceana, Inc., an environmental and conservation organization, thereafter filed suit against Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, NOAA, and the Service itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After receiving the Service's answer, the Court set a summary judgment briefing schedule. Oceana then filed a motion to compel the Service to complete and supplement the administrative record. In light of Oceana's motion, the Court stayed summary judgment briefing and held a hearing on February 2, 2018. It will now grant Oceana's motion in part and deny it in part, as detailed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This confusion has arisen because the term \"supplement\" \"has been used synonymously to refer to both a circumstance in which a party argues that the administrative record does not actually reflect the materials that the agency had before it when it made its decision, and a circumstance in which a party seeks to add extra-record or extra-judicial information to the record that was concededly\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   before the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Colo.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917521\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/151/1/#p13\">\n    151 F.Supp.3d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oceana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271510\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/310/\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   317 n.7. The upshot is that it is unclear whether a plaintiff seeking to add evidence it has demonstrated was before the agency (and thus is properly part of the administrative record) must also show one of the three \"unusual circumstances\" from cases such as\n   <em>\n    City of Dania Beach\n   </em>\n   in order to prevail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court agrees with its colleagues who have not required that an \"unusual circumstance\" be demonstrated in such cases. After all, the administrative record properly consists of the materials before the agency and no more\n   <em>\n    nor less\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walter O.

If a plaintiff can show that a piece of evidence\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   before the agency at the time the decision was made-and thus that that evidence\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   part of the administrative record-it makes little sense to require that the plaintiff also show one of the three unusual circumstances before requiring the agency to add the properly-part-of-the-record evidence to the record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Colo.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917521\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/151/1/#p13\">\n    151 F.Supp.3d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court will grant Oceana's motion as to part of the first category of documents and deny it as to the rest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Studies and reports cited in the EIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The first set of documents that Oceana seeks to add to the record, listed in Exhibit A of its motion, consists of studies, memoranda, and assessments that the Service cited in the EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Compel Completion &amp; Supplementation (\"Pl.'s Mot.\") Ex. A. These documents received one of three treatments in the EIS: (1) some were cited in the body of the EIS for a substantive proposition; (2) some were cited in the body of the EIS but only as a source of additional information that readers might wish to consult; and (3) some were cited solely in a list of references and not in the body of the EIS. Oceana argues that because all of these studies were cited somewhere in the EIS, they were clearly before the Service at the time it made its decision and therefore belong in the administrative record. Pl.'s Mot. at 10-11. The Court agrees in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , there is a subset of documents listed in Oceana's Exhibit A that were cited substantively,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to justify a factual statement or assertion made in the EIS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a document was substantively cited, the Service clearly considered that document. After all, to know what the document said the Service had to at least read it, and by citing the document to justify a substantive factual proposition, the Service is purporting to have relied on the document and its contents. As such, these documents were before the Service and belong in the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Service's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. It contends, mainly, that the administrative record \"need not include all references cited in an administrative record document, as a citation alone does not show that the source document was 'before' the agency decisionmaker.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 9. True enough. As the cases that the Service cites recognize, the mere mention of a document in the agency's decision or the record does not always mean,\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   , that the agency considered the document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franks v.

An agency's decision to rely on a document to support a factual assertion is different from its mere mention of a document's existence. The use of a document to justify an assertion or proposition indicates that the Service consulted and thought about-and therefore considered-that document directly when issuing Amendment 5b. Indeed, one of the cases that Oceana relies on explicitly distinguishes a situation where an agency merely mentions a document from one where the agency cites a document for a substantive proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WildEarth Guardians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820214\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/1/#p6\">\n    670 F.Supp.2d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying supplementation of the record with \"a document that was mentioned-\n   <em>\n    but not substantively cited to\n   </em>\n   -on one occasion\" in the agency decision (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820214\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/1/#p6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820214\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/1/#p6\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Although\n   <em>\n    citation\n   </em>\n   to a document may ... indicate consideration of the contents of the document, the fact that a document is merely mentioned does not lead to the same conclusion.\" (emphasis added) ). The former may be insufficient, on its own, to show consideration, but the latter is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Service next argues that \"duplicative documents and references used for background information need not be included.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 10. But if the Service considered such documents, then they do need to be included: the administrative record consists of all such documents\n   <em>\n    and no less\n   </em>\n   . The key question is whether the Service considered the duplicative documents or background references. With respect to those documents cited substantively, the Service appears clearly to have consider them and they therefore belong in the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , there is a subset of documents that are cited in the body of the EIS, but solely as a source of further information for the reader rather than to justify a factual proposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast to the first category of documents, the Court concludes that Oceana has not met its burden to show these belong in the administrative record. The use of a document as a source for further reference is more akin to the sort of mere mention that is typically insufficient to prove the document belongs in the administrative record. There is nothing to indicate that the relevant decisionmakers actually thought about or even had these documents before them in the process of making a decision-it may well be that a staffer included a citation on her own initiative. In other words, the decision to cite a document as a further reference does not indicate that the contents of that document were ever used, discussed, or consulted by decisionmakers when determining the substance of the agency's decision. Thus, the Court has not been presented with concrete evidence that these documents were considered by the agency and will not require their addition to the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , there is a subset of documents that are never cited in the body of the EIS, but are included in the list of references appended to the end of each\n   EIS chapter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While this is a closer call than either of the previous two sets of materials, the Court ultimately concludes that these documents, too, belong in the administrative record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   While these documents are not expressly relied on for a substantive factual proposition, their inclusion in the list of suggests that the Service consulted their contents in the process of making the EIS.

These documents, therefore, belong in the administrative record as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Fishery observer and logbook data and reports\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Oceana next seeks to add data regarding dusky shark mortality and bycatch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 11.

After all, an agency staffer could have queried the databases, compiled the relevant data, aggregated it, and then presented the aggregated figures to higher-up agency personnel and decisionmakers to consult or use when formulating Amendment 5b. Put another way, the fact that the data was at one point disaggregated does not necessarily mean that that disaggregated data was consulted, thought about, or even seen by the agency decisionmakers. Thus, the mere fact that the Service used the raw databases to generate aggregated data to use in the final EIS does not alone provide a concrete, non-speculative basis upon which to conclude that it considered the disaggregated figures or the entire raw dataset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Oceana further contends that more data needs to be added to the record because the tables in the EIS do not contain the full spectrum of data available to the Service. For instance, it notes that some of the tables only reflect observer data and not logbook data. Pl.'s Reply at 8. Other tables, it says, reflect data from only some fisheries and not others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. But the mere fact that other data was available to the Service does not mean the Service considered the underlying data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does the fact that the Service considered\n   <em>\n    using\n   </em>\n   the data mean that it considered the\n   <em>\n    underlying data\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   A.R. 7260 (Service explaining why it did not look at data on landings of designated target species reported in Coastal Fisheries Logbook). The Service can determine which datasets to consult and utilize in its analysis without consulting or utilizing the underlying data in that set. And if the Service decisionmakers did not even look at, let alone consult or utilize the underlying data, then they have not considered it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, the mere fact that the Service had data available to it does not provide a concrete, non-speculative basis upon which to conclude that it considered that available data. Nor does the fact that the Service considered and used the aggregated data that already appears in the EIS provide a concrete, non-speculative basis upon which to conclude that it considered the underlying raw or disaggregated data.

Documents PR25 and PR26 from the Service's privilege log\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Service prepared a log listing the documents it withheld from the administrative record on the basis of privilege. It included documents withheld under the deliberative process privilege on the ground that they \"help form an understanding in the agency's decisionmaking process and ... the thought process the agency undertook in developing Amendment 5b.\" Schulze-Haugen Decl. \u00b6 24. Oceana first contends that the Service improperly withheld two documents on the log pursuant to the deliberative process privilege. The first, PR25, is described in the privilege log as \"Southeast Fisheries Science Center review of Amendment 5b Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), for internal agency discussion.\" Pl.'s Mot. Ex. L, at 19. The second document, PR26, is described as \"Southeast Fisheries Science Center review of comments and responses of Amendment 5b ... for internal agency discussion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456273,5411166\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/141/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At first blush, both of these documents seem to meet the requirements of the deliberative process privilege. Both are clearly predecisional: they are dated January 2017 and thus precede the final EIS issued in February 2017. They also appear to be deliberative. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center is a \" 'scientific agency' within\" the Service, and its comments thereby contain suggestions and feedback from agency staff on a preliminary draft of an\n   agency decision. Schulze-Haugen Decl. \u00b6 21. Such \"recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency\" are widely recognized as falling within the scope of the privilege.\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Oceana nonetheless contends that these documents are not protected because they contain factual material. Pl.'s Mot. at 18. But the so-called \"fact/opinion\" dichotomy is not as clearly delineated as Oceana contends. As the D.C. Circuit has explained in the FOIA context, \"the legitimacy of withholding [under the deliberative process privilege] does not turn on whether the material is purely factual in nature or whether it is already in the public domain, but rather on whether the selection or organization of facts is part of an agency's deliberative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v. U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206698,3555967\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/504/\">\n    641 F.3d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Margo Schulze-Haugen, a Service employee, has attested that the two comment documents at issue \"are not limited to purely factual or scientific information, as policy issues are often deeply intertwined with the scientific issues, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding data and the various options presented to and available to the agency for consideration.\" Schulze-Haugen Decl. \u00b6 21. In determining how to frame and interpret the data available to it, the Service exercises discretion in the selection and organization of facts. Comments on a draft concerning these issues-such as those here, according to Schulze-Haugen-fall within the scope of the deliberative process privilege. The Service therefore properly asserted the privilege over these two documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    2. Other unspecified documents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Oceana also argues that the agency withheld \"an unspecified amount of material, including drafts, emails, and other internal documents, that it characterizes as 'deliberative' which the agency believes are therefore not part of the record in the first instance.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 23-24. The Service contends that these documents would be protected under the deliberative process privilege. Defs.' Opp'n at 25-26. However, when addressing this category of documents, Oceana does not contest that some record materials are properly withheld under the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Mot. at 24. Nor does Oceana contest the applicability of the two-part test from FOIA and common law privilege cases to administrative record ones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206698,3555967\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/504/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 17 n.5. Instead, Oceana appears to take issue solely with the wholesale nature of the Service's withholding here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While Oceana may be correct that the Service cannot wholesale withhold a category of documents based only on their form-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , all memos from junior agency personnel to senior agency personnel-it may do so if the category of documents withheld by definition meets the requirements of the deliberative process privilege-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , all predecisional and deliberative memos from junior agency personnel to senior agency personnel. And to justify this withholding, the Service must simply represent that those documents meet the requirements of the deliberative process privilege. After all, if a document meets the test for the deliberative process privilege, then the agency has necessarily shown that its release would undermine the interests the privilege is designed to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court will thus deny Oceana's motion with respect to this set of documents for two reasons. First, Oceana fails to identify any specific documents or provide\n   concrete evidence and non-speculative grounds for the conclusion that these specific documents were considered by the agency. In light of the presumption of regularity that is afforded an agency's certification that it compiled the complete record, it is not enough for Oceana to simply contend, as it does here, that the agency must add all the documents it considered. By failing to point to specific documents and specific grounds on which to conclude those documents were considered, Oceana fails to meet its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, to the extent there are other internal, deliberative (and predecisional) documents that the agency did consider, those documents would be protected by the deliberative process privilege and thereby should not be added to the record. As noted earlier, internal and deliberative emails and drafts of agency decisions are the sort of materials often protected by the deliberative process privilege. For this reason as well, the Court will deny this aspect of Oceana's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Extra-record documents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Oceana seeks to add a set of data on dusky shark bycatch and mortality from various fisheries other than the highly migratory fishery (where dusky sharks are presumably most found). Oceana concedes that this is extra-record data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 27-28 (\"Despite this evidence, the Fisheries Service\n   <em>\n    did not consider\n   </em>\n   mortality data from non-HMS fisheries .... The observer and logbook data that Oceana seeks to add to the administrative record\n   <em>\n    as extra-record evidence\n   </em>\n   are listed in Exhibit D to the Hardy Declaration.\" (emphases added) ). Therefore, Oceana must show that one of the three unusual circumstances applies. It argues that two are present: (1) the agency deliberately or negligently ignored possibly adverse documents and (2) the reports are background information needed to determine if the agency has considered all the relevant factors. However, Oceana has not demonstrated that either circumstance is present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   With respect to the first alleged unusual circumstance-the agency deliberately or negligently ignored potentially adverse evidence-the D.C. Circuit has recently explained that a party must show evidence of bad faith on the part of the agency to carry its burden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dist. Hosp. Partners, L.P. v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222740,4191543\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/46/\">\n    786 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\"Meeting this exception requires a 'strong showing of [agency] bad faith'...\" (citation omitted) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Oceana provides no indication or evidence of bad faith. Nor does it explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   these reports are potentially adverse. Thus, Oceana does not carry its burden of showing this first unusual circumstance is present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This leaves the second circumstance-that the reports are background information\n   the Court will need in order to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors. But it is not at all clear that the Court needs to have this data in front of it to determine whether the Service should have consulted it. After all, the parties can adequately argue about whether the Service should have considered this data without the Court having the precise figures in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midcoast Fishermen's Ass'n v. Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699587\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/592/40/#p46\">\n    592 F.Supp.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (D.D.C. 2008) (\"Supplementing the record with the bycatch data from an earlier period will not provide any 'background' useful to resolving the case. No matter what 'background' is provided, the issue remains the same: did the agency err by only considering the data that it did?\"). Consequently, this data is not necessary for the Court to be able to address Oceana's argument on the merits and the second unusual circumstance is not present. Because Oceana has not demonstrated the presence of an unusual circumstance, the Court will deny its request to supplement the record with this extra-record information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reason, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Oceana's motion. The Service must complete the record with the documents listed in Oceana's Exhibit A excluding the first three documents listed (the 2008, 2011, and 2012 SAFE reports). However, the Court will not require the Service to add any of the other documents to the record.
