In particular, in justifying removal and in seeking dismissal, Defendant relies on a \"preemption\" argument it never made in state court-that Plaintiffs' action in substance challenges the results of a union election that already has been conducted, and thus the claims must be decided under Title IV of the LMRDA. In this context, however, this argument improperly conflates a preemption\n   <em>\n    defense\n   </em>\n   with \"complete preemption\" for purposes of removal jurisdiction. These related, although distinct, concepts are often confused. Here, even if Defendant's argument for a preemption defense has\n   merit, its argument for complete preemption does not. To explain why this is so, the court first addresses defensive preemption under Title IV of the LMRDA, and then analyzes whether the LMRDA completely preempts Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Preemption Defense Under Title IV of the LMRDA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff argues that this court (or\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   court) lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiffs' claims because the LMRDA provides the exclusive remedy for a direct post-election challenge. That remedy is a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, and possibly a subsequent federal court action brought by the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casumpang v.
