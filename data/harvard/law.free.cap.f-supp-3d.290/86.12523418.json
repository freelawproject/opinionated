All Petitioners reside in New Hampshire. In 2010, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") instituted a\n   humanitarian program called Operation Indonesian Surrender, through which Petitioners were granted Orders of Supervision, allowing them to seek employment and subjecting them to certain mandatory conditions. Petitioners also received temporary stays of removal that were renewed over multiple years. In the summer of 2017, these individuals were informed that they would be removed from the United States. They filed this habeas petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   raising claims under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\"), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Petitioners seek stays of their removal so that they are not removed before they have the opportunity to file motions to reopen based on \"changed country conditions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court temporarily stayed removal to determine if the Court has jurisdiction. An evidentiary hearing was held on October 20, 2017, at which Respondent Timothy Stevens, an ICE Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer with knowledge of Operation Indonesian Surrender, testified. In advance of the evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction, the Court also received affidavits from Russell F. Hilliard, Esq. (Docket No. 49-1), Reverend Sandra Pontoh (Docket No. 49-2), William Hahn, Esq. (Docket No. 49-3), Susan Church, Esq. (Docket No. 49-4), Trina A. Realmuto (Docket No. 49-5), and Jeffrey A. Winters, Ph.D. (Docket No. 49-6). The Court received declarations from The Honorable Jill H. Dufresne (Docket No. 36-1) and Christopher Gearin (Docket No. 36-2). The only issue before the Court is whether the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction. The Court holds that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioners are fifty-one Christian Indonesian nationals who have lived in the United States for many years. They are all subject to final Orders of Removal. Some individuals have children or spouses who are United States citizens; some have children who are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\"); some have children who have enlisted in the United States military; and some have serious medical conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioners claim that, if they are removed to Indonesia, they will face an \"alarmingly high and increasing\" risk of persecution, including \"intimidation, physical harm, and threats to their personal safety and well-being,\" based on their Christian religion. Winters Aff. (Docket No. 49-6) \u00b6 2. Indonesia is a majority Muslim country. According to Petitioners' expert, since 2008, the conditions in Indonesia for religious minorities have deteriorated substantially, as the country experiences a \"rising tide of extremist Islam\" targeting non-Muslim populations. Winters Aff. (Docket No. 49-6) \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The Winters affidavit details numerous examples of violence carried out by Islamic militants directed at Christians, including the burning of churches, riots, and assaults. The affidavit also presents evidence from reports showing that law enforcement in Indonesia\n   is unlikely to provide meaningful protection to religious minorities in the face of violence and intolerance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, in communication with members of the Christian community, ICE began a program called Operation Indonesian Surrender in New Hampshire. For a few weeks in 2010, ICE set up a mobile command center in the parking lot of the Strafford County district courthouse in Dover, New Hampshire. Indonesian nationals with final removal orders were encouraged to identify themselves to ICE either at the mobile command center or soon afterward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In exchange, the program participants were placed under Orders of Supervision (\"OSUPs\") and granted temporary stays of removal. These OSUPs allowed the participants to seek employment and also prescribed conditions with which the recipients had to comply, including \"appear[ing] in person at the time and place specified, upon each and every request of [ICE] for identification and for deportation or removal,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 37-2 at 85, informing ICE before traveling outside New England, and submitting to medical or psychiatric examinations at ICE's request. Petitioners received no oral or written promises that they could remain in this country indefinitely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately 100 Christian Indonesians are believed to have participated in the program and received OSUPs. They lived and worked under these OSUPs without incident until this year and generally complied with their conditions, including the condition that they not commit crimes. In addition, Petitioners were granted temporary stays of removal by ICE on a roughly annual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In late 2011, a group of program participants who did not have U.S. citizen children, U.S. citizen spouses, or health issues were told that they would be removed. They were informed that their stay requests were being denied, but they were given the opportunity to have an in-person interview with ICE at its Manchester, New Hampshire office before removal. After the interviews, ICE mailed the participants a notice revoking their OSUPs and confirming their departure from the United States approximately 90 days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Six years later, in February 2017, ICE began to notify Petitioners that it would no longer grant stays of removal. ICE advised pastoral leaders in June 2017 that it would be terminating Operation Indonesian Surrender. At this meeting, the leaders were informed that all remaining program participants would be deported, but ICE did not set a timeline for these removals. Based on the community's experience in 2011, the pastoral leaders believed that interviews would be scheduled with Petitioners before they were deported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Instead, at an August 1, 2017 check-in appointment pursuant to the OSUP conditions, a group of program participants were told that they would be subject to a \"30-30\" schedule. They would need to report to ICE at their next 30-day check-in with tickets to depart for Indonesia 30 days later. This proposed class action habeas corpus petition was first filed on September 25, 2017, two days before the first Petitioners were scheduled to be removed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Habeas Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioners assert that this Court has habeas jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Although Petitioners need not be physically detained to be in \"custody,\" in order for the Court to exercise habeas jurisdiction, Petitioners must challenge the legality of that non-detention custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (stating detainee must be \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\").

Essentially, Petitioners argue that the sudden policy change, combined with the 30-30 order, is \"preventing [them] from exercising their due process rights\" and their statutory right to move to reopen.

Attorney Realmuto cites \"at least two cases where ICE affirmatively informed the BIA of particular deportation dates but subsequently-unbeknownst to the BIA, and without providing the BIA any notice-moved up the dates of deportation and carried out the removal.\" Realmuto Aff.

Petitioners argue that the denials of their stay requests earlier in 2017 did not put them on notice that removal was imminent or that the conditions of their OSUPs had changed, because people may remain under OSUPs for years after stay requests are denied. They maintain that, until the 30-30 order, they did not know that deportations would occur so quickly. The Court finds that Petitioners were reasonable in relying on their protected status as long as they complied with the terms of their OSUPs. However, after August 1, 2017, any reliance was no longer reasonable. The Court finds that the August 1, 2017 notification that the protected status would terminate triggered the obligation to file motions to reopen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Petitioners argue that they need six to twelve weeks after their attorneys receive their comprehensive files containing their full immigration history (\"A-files\") to prepare adequate motions to reopen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Realmuto Aff.

Petitioners have already filed an expert affidavit on the changes in conditions in Indonesia since 2008,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Winters Aff. (Docket No. 49-6), so the need for the A-file is not necessarily persuasive unless an individual can show a specialized need (like litigation over asylum based on personal circumstances that make targeting more likely).
