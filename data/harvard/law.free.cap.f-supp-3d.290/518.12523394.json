Brinkema, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court are plaintiffs' and defendants' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs argue that the conditions of confinement that existed on Virginia's death row at the initiation of this litigation violated the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and that they are entitled to an injunction preventing defendants from returning to those conditions. Defendants argue that those conditions of confinement were constitutional and that this Court should decline to issue injunctive relief even if it finds a constitutional violation. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant summary judgment for plaintiffs and issue an injunction preventing defendants from returning to the unconstitutional conditions of confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   All of the plaintiffs in this civil action have been convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death and remain confined in a single unit (\"death row\") at Virginia's\n   Sussex I State Prison (\"SISP\") while their sentences are litigated. Plaintiffs Thomas Porter (\"Porter\"), Anthony Juniper (\"Juniper\"), and Mark Lawlor (\"Lawlor\") have respectively spent over ten, twelve, and six years on death row, and former plaintiff Ricky Gray (\"Gray\") had spent more than ten years on death row before being executed in January 2017. Compl. [Dkt. No. 1] \u00b6 2; Answer [Dkt. No. 49] \u00b6 2. Plaintiffs filed this civil action against defendants Harold Clarke (\"Clarke\"), the director of the Virginia Department of Corrections (\"VDOC\"), and Keith W. Davis, the former warden of SISP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming that the conditions of their confinement on death row violate the Eighth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. The still-living plaintiffs are three of the four inmates currently housed on death row in Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This litigation is related to an earlier civil action brought by a former death row inmate, Alfred Prieto, who claimed that his automatic placement onto death row, combined with the severe conditions death row inmates faced, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court found that the placement procedure violated the Fourteenth Amendment and granted Prieto summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Prieto v. Clarke\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:12-cv-1199,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206019215\">\n    2013 WL 6019215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. Nov. 12, 2013). That judgment was reversed by the Fourth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prieto v.

Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal [Dkt. No. 30].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When this civil action began, the conditions on death row were identical to those described in\n   <em>\n    Prieto\n   </em>\n   . Death row inmates were housed in a separate \"pod\" from the ones housing the general population of the prison. This pod consisted of two tiers, each holding 22 cells and three showers. Orig. Def. Mem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Dkt. No. 110] Ex. 1 (\"Clarke Aff.\") \u00b6 11. The cells' size of 71 square feet, with a 10.5 foot-high ceiling, was comparable to the size of cells housing general population inmates; however, unlike those inmates, death row inmates were isolated from other inmates in that they did not share cells and were not housed in adjacent cells.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Compl. \u00b6 5; Answer \u00b6 5. The cells had windows that were 5 inches high by 41.5 inches long and covered by wire mesh, although natural light came through and inmates could see out of them. Clarke Aff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 14. Each cell door had a rectangular in-set window that allowed inmates to look outside of their cell into the pod.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The doors were not soundproof, and inmates did attempt to communicate to other inmates while in their cells, but there is disagreement over how effectively they could do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; Orig. Pl. Mem. [Dkt. No. 115] Ex. 7 (\"Hendricks Report\") 11. While in their cells, inmates were permitted to have a television and a compact disc player, and they could request books from the law library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   VDOC Operating Procedure 460A (\"OP 460A\"), effective March 1, 2010, governed the daily lives of death row inmates, as did the SISP Institutional Rules and Regulations for Offenders, effective February 3, 2010. Clarke Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Under these regulations, death row inmates were allowed one hour of outdoor recreation five days per week, but such recreation was confined to individual enclosures that measured 7.9 feet by 20 feet and lacked any exercise equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. During that outdoor recreation time, some plaintiffs coordinated exercises with one another, despite not being permitted to use adjacent enclosures. Plaintiffs were also permitted to leave their cells to shower at least three times each week, and two inmates, Porter and Gray, were allowed out of their cells to perform their institutional jobs as houseman and barber, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-28. Visitation was limited to noncontact visitation on weekends and approved holidays; however, an inmate could request contact visitation, which the warden had the discretion to grant or deny.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also had access to wireless telephones that could be brought to their cell and used any day of the week between 8:00 a.m. and 9:30 p.m., with each call generally limited to 20 minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. Other than these limited out-of-cell interactions, death row inmates were generally not permitted to leave their cells. In particular, they were denied access to any form of congregate recreation, either indoor or outdoor; they were not allowed to eat meals outside of their cells; and they could not participate in congregate religious services or prison programming.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   OP 460A;\n   <em>\n    Prieto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206019215\">\n    2013 WL 6019215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs had interaction with prison staff, including mental health counselors, and could have essentially unlimited contact visitation with their attorneys. Corrections officers made rounds through the unit every 30 minutes and were allowed to converse with the inmates, medical personnel came through the pod twice each day, nurses came through the pod twice each day to perform a \"pill pass,\" the mental health practitioner visited once each week, each inmate's case counselor visited the pod daily, and inmates could request medical or mental health care at any point as well as meet with the chaplain as frequently as they wanted. Clarke Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 30-38. Each inmate was screened for mental health problems upon entering the facility for the first time and received a mental health code that was reviewed at least annually. Orig. Def. Mem. Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. According to the results of this screening, Porter and Juniper were (as of 2015) classified as MH-0, meaning they had no mental health issues or need for treatment in the preceding year, and Lawlor was classified as MH-2, meaning he had mild to moderate, but stable, mental health issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Clarke, he began considering changes to some of these policies as\n   early as 2011 but decided not to move forward with any changes after the\n   <em>\n    Prieto\n   </em>\n   litigation began in 2012; however, in mid-2014, he began solidifying plans to implement changes and decided to move forward with those changes even after this civil action began. Clarke Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. On August 6, 2015, Zook approved a number of interim rules and regulations for death row.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. In light of these changes, the Court granted the parties' motion to stay the litigation and to refer the matter to mediation should any disagreements remain after the changes were implemented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [Dkt. No. 88].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Some of the changes took effect immediately. By the initial round of summary judgment briefing, inmates were permitted to have contact visitation with immediate family members one day per week for one and a half hours at a time, while still being permitted to have non-contact visitation on weekends and holidays with immediate family members and one approved non-family member. Outdoor recreation time was increased to 90 minutes five days each week; showers became daily; and plaintiffs were allowed to congregate indoors for one hour each day, without restraints and in groups of up to four inmates at a time. This indoor congregation occurred in a newly screened off area of the death row pod that contained a television, two tables with seating, a bench, various games, and a JPAY kiosk that enabled inmates to download music, purchase books and movies, and send e-mails. The interim regulations anticipated that the day room would be used \"for congregate religious services, behavioral programming, and additional employment opportunities for Death Row Offenders,\" and at least one additional job for inmates was created with at least one more anticipated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stay Def. Mem. [Dkt. No. 85] Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to the immediate changes, the interim regulations called for the construction of a covered outdoor recreation yard that would include two sections, each equipped with a basketball court and stationary exercise equipment, in which groups of up to four death row inmates could congregate. Clarke Aff. \u00b6 57-60. Although the interim regulations anticipated that construction of the recreation yard would be completed by October 1, 2015, it had not been completed by the time the original summary judgment motions were filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Orig. Pl. Mem. Ex. 3 \u00b6 23. Since then, the construction has been completed and death row inmates may now use the outdoor recreation yard; in addition, the interim regulations have been adopted into final regulations, which took effect in June 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 161-1 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 (Operating Procedure 425. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After failing to resolve the litigation, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, primarily focusing on whether the prior conditions of confinement violated the Eighth Amendment. Based on the improvements made by defendants to the death row conditions, which satisfied plaintiffs' demands, the Court issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion, in which it found that the adoption of the interim regulations and the physical improvements had rendered plaintiffs' action moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order &amp; Mem. Op. [Dkt. Nos. 166 &amp; 167]. As such, the Court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, granted defendants' motion, and ordered that judgment be entered in favor of defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed to the Fourth Circuit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 171, which reversed that decision and remanded, holding that under the voluntary cessation doctrine, plaintiffs' action was not constitutionally moot,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 174;\n   <em>\n    Porter v. Clarke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277245\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/358/\">\n    852 F.3d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2017). On remand, plaintiffs engaged in limited additional discovery and\n   the parties have filed new briefs focusing \"on the question of whether equitable relief would be appropriate, presupposing (but not conceding) the existence of a constitutional violation.\" Dkt. No. 189. Both parties have expressly adopted and reincorporated their original briefing on the merits of the Eighth Amendment claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277245\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These renewed motions are now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A party is entitled to summary judgment if the party can show \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

For example, when describing particularly restrictive prison conditions, the United States Department of Justice's Report and Recommendations Concerning the Use of Restrictive Housing (Jan. 2016) (\"DOJ Report\") declines to use the term \"solitary confinement\" because it can be misleading and instead refers to segregated housing as \"restrictive housing\" and \"segregation.\" DOJ Report 3. The Report defines restrictive housing as \"any type of detention that involves three basic elements:\" \"[r]emoval from the general inmate population,\" \"[p]lacement in a locked room or cell,\" and \"[i]nability to leave the room or cell for the vast majority of the day, typically 22 hours or more.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206019215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This definition corresponds with the pre-2015 conditions at VDOC, where prisoners spent between 23 and 24 hours per day in their cells, although it does not account for the presence or absence of other aspects of the pre-2015 policies like telephone privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Therefore, plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that the pre-2015 conditions of confinement constituted \"solitary confinement\" or \"segregated\" or \"restricted\" housing, as those terms are understood by contemporary observers. But in any event, whether the conditions at issue here meet Justice Kennedy's (or any specific court's or expert's) description of \"solitary confinement\" is irrelevant. To the extent plaintiffs can show that they were sufficiently deprived of a basic human need such as human interaction and that the deprivation caused a significant harm or risk of harm, they have made out at least the objective prong of an Eighth Amendment claim.

Instead, as the following discussion makes clear, there is a substantial quantity of relatively recent information demonstrating the harms of extended solitary confinement that was not available to the Fourth Circuit in 1999-or, of course, to the Supreme Court in 1890.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To demonstrate the significant psychological and emotional harm that their solitary confinement has caused, plaintiffs rely primarily on a group of expert reports. First, plaintiffs submitted an expert report from Dr. Michael Hendricks, a clinical psychologist who evaluated each of the four plaintiffs and reviewed numerous records to assess whether plaintiffs have experienced any mental health consequences from the conditions of their confinement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hendricks Report 1. Dr. Hendricks found that \"each plaintiff has developed serious psychological and/or physical distress and impairment in functioning\" that \"exceeds any distress and impairment that was evident prior to each man's arrival on death row.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. In particular, prolonged isolation has \"led to clinical levels of depression that include dysphoric mood, constricted affect, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, anhedonia (loss of enjoyment in even basic pleasures), anergia (a low level or lack of energy), and suicidal ideation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Moreover, the restrictive confinement has caused a substantial reduction in plaintiffs' \"initiative and motivation to maintain contact with family members and other loved ones\"; reduced plaintiffs' \"initiative and motivation to maintain a healthy physical condition\"; and \"created a profound disturbance in sleep patterns and\" quantities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, the conditions have caused plaintiffs to develop a variety of \"coping strategies for dealing with the effects of isolation over a long period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. For example, plaintiffs have found \"creative use[s] of the limited items available to them\" and have devised \"ways of distracting themselves from boredom by relying on forms\n   of self-entertainment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although these coping mechanisms allow plaintiffs to deal with the negative effects of their restrictive confinement on a day-to-day basis, the cruel irony is that, over time, they \"thwart basic desire for human interaction\" by making plaintiffs reliant on \"internal resources that have no connection with meaningful social interaction with others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, the coping mechanisms \"have ultimately deprived [plaintiffs] of a core element of what it means to be human\" in a \"lasting\" way that Dr. Hendricks compared to the effects of war on soldiers' mental health.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to his personal evaluations of the plaintiffs and the conditions on death row, Dr. Hendricks also discussed the scientific findings relating to the effects of isolation, although most of the scientific literature examines \"the effects of isolation for a period of a few days up to a month,\" and not the results of years-long isolation, which \"far exceeds the duration of isolation examined under typical experimental procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Even so, the scientific literature has shown that \"[e]xtended periods of isolation lead to adverse mental health, and sometimes physical health, consequences in even previously healthy individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given plaintiffs' extremely long period of isolation, Dr. Hendricks found that it is to be expected that they would experience similar consequences \"but with a greater magnitude of symptomatology.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Hendricks's summary of the relevant scientific literature is bolstered by an expert declaration submitted by Dr. Mark Cunningham, a certified forensic and clinical psychologist. Orig. Pl. Mem. Ex. 10, at 1. Drawing on a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, Dr. Cunningham found that empirical research on isolating conditions like those experienced by plaintiffs has \"consistently and unequivocally\" demonstrated that these conditions lead to psychological harm-and that \"as isolation and stimulus deprivation increase, psychological deterioration and disorders correspondingly increase.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-26 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To counter the conclusions presented by Dr. Hendricks, defendants introduce an expert report from Dr. Gregory Saathoff, a licensed psychiatrist who has provided \"regular weekly consultation services within\" VDOC since 1991.

Based on these dueling experts, there is a genuine dispute of fact about the actual effects the death row housing conditions have had on plaintiffs' emotional and psychological health. But there is no genuine dispute about the significant risk that these conditions created. As Dr. Cunningham's report as well as the scientific evidence discussed in Dr. Hendricks's report make clear, prolonged isolation and lack\n   of stimulation can have devastating psychological and emotional consequences. And although defendants dispute Dr. Hendricks's conclusions about the mental health of plaintiffs, his interviews and report provide at least a concrete contextualization of the harm that solitary confinement can wreak. Therefore, because the objective prong of the Eighth Amendment standard does not require the actual infliction of a \"serious or significant physical or emotional injury,\" but only conditions producing a \"substantial risk\" of such an injury,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542398\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/520/#p525\">\n    708 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Angelone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123757\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/630/#p634\">\n    330 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   634 ), the dispute between Drs.

In response, defendants argue that their policies were tailored to mitigate any danger by providing constant mental health assistance and that the policies were justified by legitimate security risks. Orig. Def. Mem. 28-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs have the better argument. First, as discussed above, there is a large and growing body of literature-both academic and legal-discussing the potentially devastating effects of prolonged periods of isolation. As one district court put it nearly two decades ago: \"A conclusion ... that prolonged isolation from social and environmental stimulation increases the risk of developing mental illness does not strike this Court as rocket science.\"\n   <em>\n    McClary v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1583914\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/4/195/#p208\">\n    4 F.Supp.2d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208 (W.D.N.Y. 1998). Given defendants' status as corrections professionals, it would defy logic to suggest that they were unaware of the potential harm that the lack of human interaction on death row could cause. In fact, defendants' policies demonstrate their full awareness of this harm. VDOC procedures do not allow non-death row prisoners to stay in disciplinary segregation for longer than thirty days in a row. Orig. Def. Mem. Ex. 19, at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, defendants are certainly aware that extended stays in segregation can have harmful emotional and psychological effects. Moreover, defendants' argument hurts, rather than helps, their case. Although the provision of mental health services can help identify (and, hopefully, ameliorate) the harm caused by extended segregation, defendants' practice to have death row inmates \"constantly\n   checked by medical and mental-health personnel,\" Orig. Def. Mem. 28, evinces their awareness that those conditions create a significant risk of harm for the death row inmates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Therefore, plaintiffs have demonstrated that defendants acted with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm when imposing the pre-2015 conditions of confinement. As such, given that plaintiffs have already met the objective prong of the test, plaintiffs have shown that those conditions violated the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   IV. PLAINTIFFS' ENTITLEMENT TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although plaintiffs have demonstrated that the pre-2015 conditions of confinement violated the Eighth Amendment, they must also show that they are entitled to injunctive relief. To demonstrate the appropriateness of an injunction, plaintiffs must show that they suffered an irreparable injury, for which remedies at law cannot adequately compensate them, that balancing the hardships between the parties inclines in favor of an equitable remedy, and that the public interest is not disserved by an injunction.\n   <em>\n    eBay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276206\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/388/#p391\">\n    547 U.S. at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276206\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/388/#p391\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, because defendants here have voluntarily ceased the challenged conduct, plaintiffs must show that \"there exists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation.\"\n   <em>\n    W.T.

Finally, because this litigation challenges the conditions of confinement in a prison, the requested injunction must conform with the requirements laid out in the PLRA. Defendants challenge plaintiffs' ability to demonstrate their entitlement to an injunction at each step of this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Irreparable Harm and Adequate Remedies at Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To satisfy the first two elements of the permanent injunction analysis, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have suffered irreparable harm and that there are not adequate remedies available at law to compensate them. As a general rule, \"the denial of a constitutional right ... constitutes irreparable harm for purposes of equitable jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Meese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1716251\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/818/1132/#p1135\">\n    818 F.2d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (4th Cir. 1987). Here, plaintiffs have established that the pre-2015 conditions of confinement violated their Eighth Amendment rights and, as such, have made a clear showing that they would be irreparably harmed if the conditions were to be reimposed. Moreover, the reason the pre-2015 conditions violated the Eighth Amendment points to another, more concrete, form of irreparable harm. The potential emotional and psychological harm that prolonged periods of isolation, like those plaintiffs endured, can wreak on prisoners is paradigmatic irreparable harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In response, defendants do not contend that the violation of plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment rights is not an irreparable\n   injury. Instead, they argue that, particularly given their status as state officials, the Court should hesitate before granting an injunction based on the mere possibility of future irreparable injury. Ren. Def. Opp. [Dkt. No. 199] 18-19. As discussed above, this contention is addressed by the\n   <em>\n    W.T. Grant\n   </em>\n   line of cases and, as will be explained below, plaintiffs have met their burden by showing a cognizable danger of a recurrent violation. Nothing defendants argue in this section alters that analysis. As such, plaintiffs have met the first two prongs of the injunction analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Balancing the Hardships and the Public Interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To obtain an injunction, plaintiffs must also show that the balance of the hardships weighs in favor of injunctive relief and that the public interest would not be disserved by an injunction. Plaintiffs argue here that an injunction will impose practically no burden on defendants, who have already made the requested changes. Instead, what the injunction would accomplish would be to prevent defendants from returning to the pre-2015 conditions, as opposed to being forced to take some affirmative action. Ren. Pl. Mem. [Dkt. No. 192] 20. In addition, they argue that the public interest is served by an injunction because there is a strong public interest in upholding constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1716251\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/818/1132/#p1135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Newsom ex rel.

On the other hand, defendants argue that plaintiffs inadequately account for the federalism principles that counsel against federal courts issuing injunctions against state officials, the doctrine that prison officials should receive deference, and the public interest the citizens of Virginia have in ensuring their prison administrators can run their death row without undue interference. Ren. Def. Opp. 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although defendants' arguments have some merit, they cannot overcome plaintiffs' strong showing. Given the minimally intrusive nature of the requested injunction, and even considering traditional principles of federalism and comity, the negligible hardship state officials might have to endure in complying with the injunction cannot outweigh the hardships plaintiffs would suffer if forced to endure unconstitutional conditions of confinement. Moreover, although the citizens of Virginia certainly have an interest in their prison officials being able to exercise their professional discretion in setting policies, the injunction requested here barely intrudes on that discretion and barely offends the public interest. When this intrusion is considered against the strong public interest in vindicating constitutional rights and preventing future violations, it is clear that an injunction would not disserve the public interest. Therefore, plaintiffs have made the requisite showing and are entitled to an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Prison Litigation Reform Act Requirements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under the PLRA, \"[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs\" and a court may not grant or approve any prospective relief unless it \"finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). Defendants make two conceptually distinct arguments relying on this language. First, they argue that, as a matter of law, the PLRA bars\n   injunctive relief unless there is an ongoing constitutional or statutory violation. Ren. Def. Mem. [Dkt. No. 194] 18-20. Second, they argue that, under the circumstances of this litigation, plaintiffs' requested injunction does not fit the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement. Ren. Def. Opp. 17-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ongoing Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants argue that, as a matter of law, in \"situations where the alleged constitutional violation no longer exists,\" prospective relief would \"violate the express terms of the PLRA\" because, absent an ongoing violation, prospective relief cannot be necessary to \"correct the violation of the Federal right.\" Ren. Def. Mem. 18-20, 22-23. In support of this proposition, defendants turn primarily to three sources. First, they focus on the plain language of the PLRA, which they describe as foreclosing injunctive relief when it is not necessary to correct the violation of a federal right. Defendants argue that logic dictates that relief cannot be necessary to correct a violation if there is in fact no ongoing violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    at 19-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given this view of the PLRA, they argue that federal courts should abstain from issuing injunctive relief in the absence of an ongoing violation. Third, defendants cite a Ninth Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    Hallett v.

As such, plaintiffs argue, the Court should not interpret the PLRA to alter this bedrock principle in the absence of clear language indicating such a congressional intent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Second, plaintiffs argue that the differences in language between \u00a7 3626(a)(1)(A) and \u00a7 3626(b)(3), which limits a court's authority to extend prospective relief to situations where it \"remains\n   necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of a Federal right,\" indicate a difference in intent.

Third, plaintiffs point to a variety of case law in support of their position, including an Eleventh Circuit case explicitly holding that the \"current and ongoing\" requirement is not applicable to the question of initial prospective relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a case in this district where the court \"found that an injunction 'precluding Defendants from returning to a specific prior policy that is no longer in force and has been found to be unconstitutional comports with the requirements set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203625\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ' [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] that an injunction must be narrowly drawn, necessary, and the least intrusive means of granting relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203625\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203625\">\n    at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs' view is correct.

In the termination section of the PLRA, Congress provided that defendants can move to terminate an injunction related to prison conditions after two years and a court must grant such a termination motion unless \"the court makes written findings based on the record\" that, among other things, \"prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).

That Congress explicitly included an \"ongoing violation\" requirement in the termination provision and omitted it from the initial relief provision implies that Congress did not intend for courts to be bound by the \"ongoing violation\" requirement when determining whether equitable relief is initially available. At the least, the difference between the two provisions means that Congress did not give the \"clearest command\" that initial relief requires an ongoing violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Neither of defendants' remaining arguments is persuasive. As discussed above, the \"plain language\" of the PLRA does not in fact indicate that an ongoing violation is necessary to support the initial entry of an injunction, and although the context of the enactment of the PLRA is relevant and does incline toward a more onerous standard for the entry of injunctive relief, this context can neither provide the \"clearest command\" necessary to overcome the background legal rule that vests courts with the ability to issue prospective relief even in the absence of an ongoing violation nor overcome the implication from the language of the PLRA that different standards apply in the initial entry and termination contexts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As such, the Court finds that an ongoing violation of a constitutional right is not a prerequisite for the initial entry of injunctive relief under the PLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Need-Narrowness-Intrusiveness Requirement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants also argue that plaintiffs' requested injunction does not meet the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement because it is not \"sufficiently narrow\" and \"would not be the least intrusive means\" to correct the violation.

This explanation answers the bulk of defendants' rhetorical questions, as it specifically delineates the combination of conditions that plaintiffs want an injunction to prohibit.

Second, and where the parties disagree about the appropriate legal test, defendants appear to argue that even if plaintiffs can make this showing, additional \"prudential\" considerations should convince the Court to stay its hand and refuse to issue an injunction. It is the continued vitality of this \"equitable mootness\" doctrine that plaintiffs attack. The Court will consider the threshold\n   <em>\n    W.T.

Plaintiffs argue that this litigation was the catalyst for the changes made by defendants, who continue to believe that the pre-2015 conditions of confinement were justified by legitimate security concerns. Ren. Pl. Mem. 16-19. Plaintiffs contend that once this litigation is not hanging over defendants' heads, they may be willing to revert to the pre-2015 conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372865\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/629/#p633\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also point out that, without an injunction, there is no \"legal barrier to prevent VDOC from reinstating more restrictive conditions,\" because VDOC may \"promulgate and revoke regulations without notice, comment, or judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.

David Robinson (\"Robinson\") \"have all stated, under oath, that they do not intend to return to the prior policies\" and there is no evidence suggesting that these statements are false. Ren. Def. Reply 6. Moreover, defendants contest plaintiffs' characterization of the timeline of change, pointing to deposition testimony from Clarke and Robinson indicating that they had begun conversations about changing death row conditions as early as 2011, well before this civil action was filed, even though those changes were not implemented until 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ren. Pl. Mem. Ex. 1, at 139-42;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2, at 42-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The undisputed facts partially support both parties' version of events. On the one hand, plaintiffs are unable to produce any evidence to suggest that Clarke and Robinson did not begin engaging in conversations about death row conditions soon after Clarke was hired in 2010, and Clarke and Robinson have given sworn testimony consistent with each other that those conversations did take place. At the same time, those conversations were described only as preliminary and there is no documentary evidence indicating their content nor was the VDOC Executive Team looped in until 2015, after the litigation was started. Moreover, it is clear that there was at least some pressure put on VDOC by the pending litigation. For example, the record includes a variety of emails from Kimberly Lipp, Chief of VDOC's Architectural and Engineering Services Department, that discuss the death row project being particularly time-sensitive in reference to pending litigation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 (discussing how the death row construction project had previously \"avoided a major legal issue\" for VDOC and informing a colleague that VDOC was \"again under serious threat of being sued\" for issues relating to the project). Defendants do not dispute that there is no legal barrier to a future Director reinstating the pre-2015 policies nor do defendants dispute that the Director serves at the pleasure of the governor. The most persuasive evidence in this record, as recognized by the Fourth Circuit, is the\n   \"significant[ ]\" fact that \"throughout the course of this litigation, Defendants have refused to commit to keep the revised policies in place and not revert to the challenged practices.\" Fourth Circuit Op. 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Taken together, these facts are sufficient to establish that (1) defendants' change from the pre-2015 conditions of confinement to the current conditions was influenced, although not entirely dependent on, the current litigation; (2) there is no legal barrier to defendants' returning to the pre-2015 conditions nor is there any pre-implementation mechanism for plaintiffs to challenge such a return; and (3) although defendants individually state they do not currently intend to return to the pre-2015 conditions, they have declined to commit VDOC to this nonreversion promise. Given these facts, plaintiffs have met their burden of showing a \"cognizable danger of recurrent violation\" in the absence of injunctive relief because many different changed circumstances could lead VDOC to revert to the pre-2015 conditions. In particular, VDOC's consistent refusal to represent to the Court that it will not revert to the pre-2015 conditions and there being no way for plaintiffs to adequately and timely challenge a future reversal support the need for an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prudential Concerns\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The various \"prudential considerations\" cited by defendants do not convince this Court to forgo the exercise of its equitable discretion and decline to issue an injunction. The Fourth Circuit has, in the past, recognized the existence of a \"prudential\" or \"equitable\" mootness doctrine that is separate from constitutional mootness.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S-1 &amp; S-2 v.

In\n   <em>\n    Spangler\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit declined to grant injunctive relief based on three prudential considerations: a lack of a \"present need for remedial relief from the federal courts,\" the \"difficulty and sensitivity of the constitutional issue at the core\" of the action, and the ability for future plaintiffs to challenge the underlying conduct if it were to reoccur.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544455\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/832/294/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544455\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/832/294/#p297\">\n    at 297-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although defendants here primarily base their prudential arguments around these three factors, and plaintiffs seem to agree that the \"Fourth Circuit historically has looked to\" these three factors in deciding equitable mootness, Ren. Pl.

Def. Mem. 20-24. Plaintiffs respond that there is a legitimate risk of reversion to the unconstitutional conditions, Ren. Pl. Opp. 12-14,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and stress that the injunction they\n   seek is minimally intrusive, requiring only that defendants not revert to the pre-2015 conditions, not that they take specific affirmative steps to alter conditions now or in the future, and allowing for the possibility of temporarily reinstituting restrictive conditions in the event of an emergency,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18; Ren.

As\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   explain, Congress has passed a number of fee-shifting statutes, including\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to enable private parties adequately to enforce federal civil rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court has interpreted these statutes only to allow for parties to recover attorney's fees when they have obtained a judgment or other court order cementing their victory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v.

In doing so, the Supreme Court explicitly considered the possibility of tactical mooting, where defendants might be encouraged by a lawsuit to make structural changes that vindicate plaintiffs' rights but that they might do so before a court decides the case to avoid attorney's fee awards. This situation, the Supreme Court explained, is unlikely to occur frequently because the high constitutional standard for mootness ensures it is very difficult for a defendant unilaterally to moot a civil action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    at 608-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   explain, dismissing plaintiffs' claims on equitable mootness grounds would undercut this logic, as it would lower the bar for mootness and allow both the specific defendants in this action and future potential defendants to moot a case to avoid having to pay attorney's fees. This outcome would undermine the structure of private civil rights enforcement that Congress has established, which is predicated on the ability of private litigants to recover their attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Taken together, these prudential considerations do not convince the Court to stay its hand. Although the constitutional issues here are relatively sensitive and prison administrators typically receive broad deference from the courts in making security determinations, the particular circumstances of this action demonstrate that a ruling for plaintiffs on the merits would not overly intrude on defendants' ability to manage the prison system safely. At this point, discovery is complete, the constitutional issues are fully framed for the Court, the legal standard is clear, and the injunction plaintiffs request would require extremely little affirmative action from defendants. Moreover, as discussed above,\n   plaintiffs have shown at least a cognizable danger that VDOC administrators, present or future, may revert to the pre-2015 conditions, and defendants refuse to allay this concern by representing to the court that reversion will not occur. Finally, the concerns expressed by\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   about the danger that a broad application of equitable mootness poses to the carefully structured federal civil rights regime are well-taken and counsel against dismissing plaintiffs' claims on prudential grounds.
