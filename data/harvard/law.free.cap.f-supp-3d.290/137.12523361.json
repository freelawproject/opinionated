Two co-defendants, EM and Admiral Insurance, filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure arguing that the complaint fails to state a plausible claim for relief and the cause of action is time-barred.

Over the course of 30 paragraphs, L\u00f3pez Rivera alleged every action taken during his father's 24-hour visit to the Hospital, detailing every exam, inspection, and medication his father was subjected to. (Case No. 16-1129 (ADC), Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 11-40). As to the causes of action, L\u00f3pez Rivera asserted his father died due to lack of appropriate care by all co-defendants, who owed him a duty of due care and breached their duty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to L\u00f3pez Rivera, he did not learn of EM Physicians of Puerto Rico and Admiral Insurance Company's existence and their relationship with the other co-defendants until February 26, 2016. (Docket No. 62 at 9). Thus, three days later, he filed an amended complaint adding EM and Admiral to the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

In the complaint, L\u00f3pez Rivera alleges that Defendants failed to provide the required medical attention to his father, adequately diagnose and treat his father, perform an adequate physical exam to diagnose his father, among other new allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-48. This time, only EM and Admiral moved to dismiss the case for the same reasons as in the prior case-that the complaint fails to state a plausible claim for relief and the cause of action is time-barred. (Docket No. 24). Plaintiff responded in opposition, arguing that the cause of action is not time-barred because he filed within one year of knowing about EM and Admiral's existence.

Specifically, L\u00f3pez Rivera alleges that Defendants are liable for damages caused by its agents, and sets forth numerous allegations regarding their agents' negligence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 \u00b6 52). For example, L\u00f3pez Rivera alleges the agents failed to provide required medical attention, adequately diagnose, and treat L\u00f3pez Rivera's father. Among other facts of a similar nature, these state a plausible claim for relief under medical malpractice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants argue that L\u00f3pez Rivera's claim is time-barred because the statute of limitations expired and the claim is time-barred. (Docket No. 24 at 6). \"The law of Puerto Rico, which governs this diversity case, sets a one-year statute of limitations for tort actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramos-Baez v.

Hence, if a case is filed and dismissed without prejudice, the clock is reset to zero and begins to run on the date of dismissal. Before 2012, filing a claim against a joint tortfeasor tolled the statute of limitations as to every joint tortfeasor under Puerto Rico law. Nevertheless, in 2012, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court reversed course in\n   <em>\n    Fraguada Bonilla v. Hospital Auxilio Mutuo\n   </em>\n   , and held that \"the statute of limitations must be tolled separately for each joint tortfeasor.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera-Carrasquillo v.

Thus, in this case, L\u00f3pez Rivera must show that he filed the complaint within one year after he knew or should have known of EM and Admiral's identities as joint tortfeasors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court begins its analysis by noting that it will consider the facts conceded by L\u00f3pez Rivera in his response regarding the dates when he learned of EM and Admiral's existence: February 26, 2016. (Docket No. 62 at 16). L\u00f3pez Rivera acquired\n   this information from the attorney representing L\u00f3pez Rivera's mother's state court suit arising from the same tragedy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203655336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This attorney, in turn, learned this information the day before he notified L\u00f3pez Rivera.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203655336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Prior to that, L\u00f3pez Rivera claims he \"had no knowledge of the existence of any contracts\" and that \"[t]here was no information in the medical records regarding the existence of a contractual relationship\" with EM and Admiral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Three days after discovering this information, L\u00f3pez Rivera amended his complaint in Case No. 16-1129 (ADC).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. That case was dismissed without prejudice on April 3, 2017, and L\u00f3pez Rivera filed this complaint on May 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court cannot find that L\u00f3pez Rivera's complaint and related documents \"leave no doubt that [the] asserted claim is time-barred.\"\n   <em>\n    Warren Freedenfeld Assocs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870134\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/38/#p44\">\n    531 F.3d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The one-year prescriptive period as to EM and Admiral began running when L\u00f3pez Rivera learned of their existence on February 26, 2016. L\u00f3pez Rivera interrupted this period when he amended the complaint to add them three days later. Moreover, this period was reset when the Court dismissed L\u00f3pez Rivera's first case without prejudice on April 3, 2017. By filing a new case a little over a month after the one-year prescriptive period restarted, L\u00f3pez Rivera filed this action within the prescriptive period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court notes a distinction between this case and\n   <em>\n    Hodge v. Parke Davis &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542875\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/6/#p8\">\n    833 F.2d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (1st Cir. 1987). In\n   <em>\n    Hodge\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff claimed to lack knowledge of a defendant corporate parent company that bore almost the same name as the subsidiary. The First Circuit held that the plaintiff should have known of the defendant's identity if the plaintiff had acted with the degree of diligence required by law. This was so because \"such a fact about corporate relationships, normally a matter of public record ... is not a 'clandestine or hidden fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542875\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/6/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542875\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/6/#p8\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, EM and Admiral are not the corporate parent company of the other co-defendants. Instead, EM employs some of the co-defendants and Admiral is EM's insurer. This is not a matter of public record; in fact, it is something that would normally come up in discovery. Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hodge\n   </em>\n   , here L\u00f3pez Rivera was reasonably diligent when he added them as co-defendants within three days of knowing their existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court also rejects EM and Admiral's arguments that L\u00f3pez Rivera was not reasonably diligent. EM and Admiral claim that \"[a] simple investigation into the CM/ECF system would have revealed that EM physicians was the entity providing medical services to the auxilio mutuo (sic) in their emergency medical ward.\" (Docket No. 64-1 at 3). Accordingly, they argue that \"[u]nder the doctrine of a prudent and reasonable man, Plaintiffs were obligated to conduct efforts to determine who the defendants were.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542875\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/6/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, EM and Admiral do not cite any case law granting a motion to dismiss based on the proposition that a reasonable person would have investigated into the CM/ECF system or something similar. To wit, one could even argue that a reasonable person does not have a clue that the CM/ECF system exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   L\u00f3pez Rivera has alleged sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for relief and survive a 12(b)(6) motion. He also filed the case within the prescriptive period. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   co-defendants EM and Admiral's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
