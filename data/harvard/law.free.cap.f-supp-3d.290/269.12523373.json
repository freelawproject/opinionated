Def. Mem. at 7-10. This argument, however, need not be reached because, allowing every reasonable inference in plaintiffs' favor as we must at this stage of the litigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown Media Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270544,12276856\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/150/\">\n    854 F.3d at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the allegations in the complaint do not conclusively demonstrate that only one employee performed janitorial services in the plaintiffs' buildings, that each plaintiff was the only employee performing janitorial services who lived in his building, or that defendants actually designated either employee as a janitor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, Contrera and Lopez cannot be deemed to be janitors on the ground that they were the only employees who worked in their buildings, as this assertion is not made in the amended complaint. Indeed, the amended complaint states otherwise. It alleges that Fabian Herrera began working at the 655 West 160th Street building as a porter in approximately 2013, and that Herrera \"assisted Contrera.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 390. The amended complaint also alleges that Herrera occasionally performed\n   work at 638 West 160th Street, which is the building where Lopez worked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 364, 391. Thus, the face of the amended complaint does not allow a finding that Contrera and Lopez were the only employees who worked in their buildings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, while the amended complaint states that Contrera lived in the building in which he performed services,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 356, the complaint makes no such allegation as to Lopez, and in any event does not allege that each plaintiff was the sole resident janitor in their buildings. Defendants attempt to get around this fact by asserting that \"nowhere in their Memorandum (or via affidavit of Plaintiffs Contrera or Lopez) do they dispute the simple fact that Plaintiffs Contrera and Lopez were the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   live-in janitors who performed janitorial duties at their respective buildings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.2 (stating that plaintiffs \"never allege any other janitor resided in the same building as they did.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"Plaintiffs do not even allege other individuals performed janitorial duties, or lived, at their building.\"). The problem with this argument is that it is contrary to the standards that govern a motion to dismiss for failure to state claim. Case law does not require that a party opposing a motion to dismiss deny factual contentions asserted by a defendant seeking to interpose an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331281\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/72/#p81\">\n    798 F.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A plaintiff is not required to plead the absence of [an affirmative] defense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, defendants have failed to satisfy their burden of showing that the amended complaint establishes that the defendants designated either Lopez or Contrera as janitors. Certainly, no allegation in the complaint states that defendants made a written designation. This arguably ends the matter. Nonetheless, we recognize that case law permits a court to find a designation where certain conditions are met even without a written designation. For example,\n   <em>\n    Almonte\n   </em>\n   noted that courts have considered the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (I) whether Plaintiff was the only employee who lived in the building; (ii) the manner in which Plaintiff and other employees were compensated; (iii) whether Plaintiff was listed as a \"janitor\" or \"superintendent\" in the employer's official business records; (iv) whether Plaintiff received written notice that he would be compensated as a building janitor; and (v) whether Plaintiff or his employer represented to third parties that Plaintiff was the \"janitor\" or \"superintendent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Almonte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207460019\">\n    2015 WL 7460019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. But given that every reasonable inference must be drawn in plaintiffs' favor, the allegations in the amended complaint would not allow us to find that these factors favored defendants. Indeed, the amended complaint (through an annexed exhibit) even alleges that some of these factors did not apply. For example, a memorandum from \"StaffPro,\" through which defendants allegedly spoke,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 302-03, 309-10, 323, 335, 337-39, 343, 359, 423, and which is attached to the amended complaint, informed superintendents that if they \"work beyond their work hours, with the prior express approval of Management, [then they] will receive pay in accordance with their hourly rate and applicable overtime laws,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   StaffPro Memorandum (annexed as Ex. E to Am. Compl.), at *2. Although this statement does not necessarily mean that superintendents were entitled to overtime in light of the reference to \"applicable overtime laws,\" its mention of overtime and an \"hourly rate\" strongly suggests that they would be paid overtime. Similarly, the amended complaint also alleges that the defendants designated Contrera and Lopez as hourly employees\n   who were entitled to be paid overtime compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 362, 378. The fact that defendants indicated that Contrera and Lopez were entitled to overtime compensation is contrary to the notion that defendants designated Contrera and Lopez as janitors exempt from receiving such compensation. An employee receiving hourly compensation is also inconsistent with that employee's designation as a janitor, as the Building Services Industry regulations provide that janitors are to be compensated on a per-unit per-week basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Comp.%20Codes%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20tit.%2012%2C%20%C2%A7%20141-1.2\">\n    N.Y.

The statute gives no guidance on what constitutes a \"written consent.\" And courts have routinely found that \u00a7 256's requirement is satisfied where a named plaintiff files a sworn declaration with the court stating that he or she is the named plaintiff in a collective action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4313859\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/988/261/#p281\">\n    988 F.Supp.2d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff's signed declaration constituted valid written consent to commence a collective action when plaintiff identified himself as the named plaintiff in the action and the caption indicated that plaintiff brought the action \"on behalf of himself and other employees similarly situated.\");\n   <em>\n    Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265863\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/260/38/#p52\">\n    260 F.R.D. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Antuono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201188197\">\n    2012 WL 1188197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (written consent requirement of section 256 satisfied when the named plaintiff in a collective action filed an affidavit \"implicitly verifying the complaint, expressing an interest that legal action be taken to protect her rights, and expressing an interest in being a party plaintiff.\") (citations omitted). These cases note the purposes of requiring consent are to \"put the Defendants on notice\" of a plaintiff's participation in a lawsuit, and to \"ensure that\n   each plaintiff intends to participate in the case, and is not simply a procedural figurehead for an enterprising class action lawyer.\"\n   <em>\n    D'Antuono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201188197\">\n    2012 WL 1188197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although defendants argue that the above-cited cases \"are not overly insightful,\" Def. Reply at 3, defendants do not identify the flaw in their reasoning. Our examination of the statute persuades us they are correctly decided. First and foremost,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) expansively requires only a \"written consent to become a party plaintiff\" but does not specify any other requirements for that consent. Accordingly, where a signed declaration demonstrates a plaintiff's consent to be a party plaintiff in a collective action, we do not see why it would not satisfy the statutory requirement. Further, this manner of consent fulfills the purpose of the statute by putting the defendants on notice and ensuring that the declarant in fact intends to act as a plaintiff in a collective action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants cite to a string of cases to support the proposition that even for named plaintiffs in an FLSA collective action, \"until a 'consent to join' or 'opt-in' form, is filed with the court, the statute of limitations continues to run.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 10. But this proposition is undisputed. What is important is that none of the cases cited by defendants hold that a sworn statement of the kind Lopez filed in this action fails to qualify as a \"written consent\" under \u00a7 256. Indeed, none of the cited cases require that a written consent to join an FLSA collective action take any specific form, other than being written and filed with the court. Accordingly, these cases do not address the question of whether Lopez's declaration constitutes sufficient written consent to join this action, let alone counsel against so finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants also cite to cases holding that merely listing a plaintiff in a complaint is insufficient to constitute a written consent to join an action. See Def. Reply at 11-12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gomez v. Tyson Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340024\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1192/\">\n    799 F.3d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2015), and\n   <em>\n    Harkins v.

Defendants argue that by this same principle, the declaration at issue should also be deemed insufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319228\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/1099/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is a non sequitur. It makes sense that a complaint cannot function as a written consent where there is no indication that the plaintiff has approved his or her inclusion. This distinction was noted in\n   <em>\n    Harkins\n   </em>\n   which reasoned that \"[i]t makes no difference that you are named in the complaint, for you might have been named without your consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Harkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319228\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/1099/\">\n    385 F.3d at 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It does not apply any special canon of interpretation to the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, defendants argue that because Lopez \"filed an opt-in form on July 25, 2017, more than four months after his attorneys filed his declaration in support of his motion for conditional certification,\" it shows that he was not \"confident\" that his declaration satisfied the written consent requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 14. What matters, however, is whether the declaration showed that Lopez was consenting to join the lawsuit and thus satisfied the written consent requirement at the time it was\n   filed. If it did, then a subsequent filing of a consent form could not negate its effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, Lopez's declaration qualifies as \"written consent\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and therefore Lopez's FLSA claim was timely filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the motion to dismiss (Docket# 192) should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURE FOR FILING OBJECTIONS TO THIS REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the parties have fourteen (14) days (including weekends and holidays) from service of this Report and Recommendation to file any objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Fed.
