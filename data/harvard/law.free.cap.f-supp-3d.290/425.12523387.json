On May 24, 2014, Dr. Adamson ordered a right lower extremity electromyography (\"EMG\") nerve conduction study, which was performed on June 5, 2014 by Dr. John Welshofer. (AR 7000234); (AR 7000234). Dr. Welshofer reported that the EMG revealed \"[m]ild prolongation of the conduction velocity of the peroneal nerve around the fibular head,\" \"a mild peroneal neuropathy at the fibular head,\" and \"mild prolongation of the [right] medial and lateral plantar mixed sensory responses suggestive of a mild [right] tarsal tunnel compressive neuropathy,\" but no \"electrodiagnostic evidence to diagnose a lumbar radiculopathy\" or \"other significant electrodiagnostic abnormalities.\" (AR 7000237). Dr. John Lesher then ordered an ultrasound, which was performed on July 8, 2014. (AR 7000227); (AR 7000221). After reviewing the ultrasound, Dr. Lesher reported that he thought Plaintiff's symptoms are \"related to chronic right S1 radiculitis given his sensory involvement affecting the lateral aspect of his foot and diminished right Achilles reflex.\" (AR 7000223).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On May 16, 2014, while Plaintiff underwent the evaluations described above, Defendant sent a letter to Dr. Adamson, asking him to confirm that Plaintiff was able to perform \"Light Work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR 7000256-7000257.

The note attached to Plaintiff's letter from Dr. Welshofer states in pertinent part the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Dr. Lesher had suggested that the patient's symptoms could be due to S1 nerve root radicular symptoms but, like myself, he found no specific radiculopathy. I had discussed this with the patient at the time of his electrodiagnostic evaluation, I do not remember the specifics of the conversation, but in all likelihood my explanation to him was that the nerve can get irritated causing symptoms like what the described. Much akin to the occasional trippage of a circuit breaker. This discussion was mainly to generate an analogy for the patient to help explain the overall symptom complex. There is no evidence of ongoing nerve root damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR 7000216. The attached letter from Dr. Edwards states in pertinent part the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   At the time of his aviation medical examination on 9/23/2013, [Plaintiff] appeared to be doing well, but subsequent to this, he experienced episodes of leg \"collapsing,\" causing him to stumble and almost fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   His physicians have done an extensive evaluation that has not adequately explained the giving way of his leg. He has undergone physical therapy, where he gained essentially normal strength in the right leg, but he continues to have the leg giving way, reportedly several times a day. Mr. Cline is concerned that this problem could cause a significant safety issue in the event of an emergency situation when performing his airman's duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   I examined Mr. Cline on 8/8/14. I did not detect any problem with the knee (e.g. evidence of torn meniscus or instability) that might explain the giving way of the leg. I had him perform lunges, and with\n   the second lunge with the right leg, he nearly fell when the leg failed to hold him up. Based upon my observation, I am certain that his leg's giving way is real and is not a feigned symptom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   While the objective testing that has been done thus far has failed to document a measureable cause of his symptoms, it is my opinion that the giving way of Mr. Cline's leg is likely due to neurologic dysfunction related to his previous herniated disk or the aftermath of his surgery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (AR 7000218).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's appeal, Defendant obtained a \"physician review\", conducted by Dr. David McKenas on December 29, 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR 7000206-7000210.

Dr. McKenas reported about the conversation that Dr. Edwards discussed the knee issue with the regional flight surgeon, who \"... felt also he should be cleared.\" (AR 7000208). Dr. McKenas also reported from the conversation that \"Orthopedics also cleared the knee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. McKenas apparently recalled further from the phone conversation with Dr. Edwards that: \"The did his Class I physical in August [2014] and he passed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, it appears that Dr. Edwards had last performed a complete aviation medical examination on Plaintiff on September 23, 2013.

Dr. McKenas concludes further that \"[t]here is no objective pathology to explain the knee give-way symptoms.\" (AR 7000209).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On January 23, 2015, Defendant reaffirmed its original decision on initial appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR 7000178-7000180. In its notification letter, Defendant states, \"[o]ur review has found that you are concerned with resuming flight status due to your subjective complaints that your leg gives out.

[Doc. 1] at 4. Plaintiff states that he is disabled and unable to perform the material duties of his occupation; that Defendant did not give proper weight to the evidence in the administrative record that he is disabled; that Defendant's interpretation of the definition of disability is contrary to the plain language of the Policy and is unreasonable; that Defendant's claim resolution process is flawed as applied; and that Defendant violated its contractual obligations under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691138\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/622/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his brief in support of Plaintiff's Motion and his response in opposition to Defendant's Motion, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's denial of his claim for LTD benefits was not the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process, and that it was not supported by substantial evidence. [Doc. 9]; [Doc.12]. Additionally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant abused its discretion in concluding that Plaintiff was not disabled from his own occupation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691138\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/622/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant opposes Plaintiff's arguments, and in its brief in support of Defendant's Motion, recites the administrative record, arguing that its decision to deny Plaintiff's claim for LTD benefits was supported by substantial evidence and that it did not abuse its discretion. [Doc. 11-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Plan offers disability payments for two situations, one where claimant is disabled\n   from performing his own occupation and the other where claimant is disabled from any occupation. This case involves only the former arrangement, potentially providing benefits for 24 months after a 180 day elimination period. The criteria for an \"own occupation\" analysis put the focus on the material duties of the job in question. The plan in this case thus notably applies only with respect to the specific circumstances of the claimant's own occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The duties and requirements for performance of this job are laid out in detail as set forth in the Statement of Facts above. Although the plan calls for the relevant duties to embody only those for pilots as performed in the national economy rather than those of the particular employment relationship involved in the claim, Defendant has not taken issue with the NetJets listed duties, nor provided the Court with contrasting duties that might be standard in the national economy. Moreover, Mr. Cline's doctors evaluated his condition with a view toward his ability to perform in his own occupation, as indicated by their letters and reports. Thus, the Court considers the explicit NetJets criteria as the ones relevant to the current inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The evidence\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   included Plaintiff's patient history, his claim and appeal letters, medical reports, and the \"physician review\" of Defendant's consultant, Doctor McKenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court's responsibility here entails an examination of the job specifics laid over against the medical findings and other evidence produced to determine if the decision of the Defendant and its claim resolution process as shown by the administrative record was sound in the light of the\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court concludes that Defendant's decision was not reasonable in that it was not the product of a reasoned and principled process, was not supported by substantial evidence, was undermined by the inherent conflict of interest existing within Defendant, and constituted an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court finds that Defendant's process and decision fall short of the relevant standards and holds that Defendant's denial must be overturned and the Plan benefits awarded to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant's decision-making process was not reasoned and principled and relied on materials inadequate to constitute substantial evidence in support of its decision.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The primary fallacy in Defendant's analysis in this case stems from its failure to account for the subjective evidence of Plaintiff's impairments and the insistence on limiting its assessment of his condition to \"objective\" evidence, specifically the results of two tests, a nerve conduction study and an ultrasound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In Defendant's summary of its decision process in turning down the request for reconsideration Defendant repeated its position that \"no evidence\" or no \"medical evidence\" or \"no specific deficits\" had been presented to support a finding of disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Beginning with subjective evidence, one notes that the record is replete with Plaintiff's consistent accounts of his experience of symptoms incompatible with an ability to perform the physical requirements of his job. This evidence may be termed subjective in nature. It forms the personal basis of his claims to Defendant and his history as provided to doctors to facilitate his diagnosis and treatment. The law is clear in endorsing such evidence as fully probative of disability in a proper case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Subjective evidence is not only relevant, but may be sufficient in itself to support\n   the claim. It tends to show that his right leg intermittently collapses, and that this condition disqualifies him from safely piloting a plane.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DuPerry v. Life Ins.

Defendant relies heavily on the facts that an EMG nerve conduction study and an ultrasound test were essentially negative. Yet the reports of the very doctors conducting those tests-Drs. Welshofer and Lesher-found explanatory factors underlying Plaintiff's symptoms as noted in the statement of facts. Dr. Welshofer: the S1 nerve root \"can get irritated\" and act as in the case of \"a circuit breaker\" tripping. Dr. Lesher: \"I think Larry's symptoms are related to chronic radiculitis given his sensory involvement affecting the lateral aspect of his foot and diminished right Achilles reflex.\" (AR 7000223). In addition, Defendant's preoccupation with cause is off point. While the precise\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   is relevant to a discussion of an impairment, the practical\n   <em>\n    effects\n   </em>\n   on ability to perform certain specified duties controls under the Plan. Examples of effects are Plaintiff's doctors keeping Plaintiff out of work and the safety concerns of his treating doctors as related to specific functions of Plaintiff's occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Subsequent to his decompression surgery for lumbar stenosis, Plaintiff's reports to his doctors, and to Defendant as part of the claim process, unwaveringly recounted the ongoing effects of his right leg condition, namely its propensity intermittently to give way, or buckle, such as to undermine a reasonable level of confidence in his ability to perform the several identified essential requirements of his job, as set forth in NetJet's specifications. Moreover, his credibility in relating his experience has not been expressly attacked, most notably not by his examining and treating physicians, nor Defendant's counsel, nor Defendant in its denial of the claim. In support of Plaintiff's claim for LTD benefits, he submitted numerous reports and letters from his treating physicians, who point out that while objective testing hasn't pinpointed a measurable cause of Plaintiff's right leg collapsing, it is not a feigned symptom. Dr. Edwards declared that \"the giving way of Mr. Cline's leg is likely due to neurologic dysfunction related to his previous herniated disk or the aftermath of his surgery.\" AR 7000218 at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff pursued diagnosis and treatment in a diligent and good faith effort to overcome his symptoms, undergoing a successful physical therapy regimen to strengthen his leg. (AR 7000275). But the symptoms continued, along with their consequent debilitating results for reliable performance of his job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendant's appeal specialist, Ms. Dorman, took the negative aspect of those two specific tests as determinative, dismissing the subjective but medically probative basis for undertaking the tests and for the treating doctors' opinions, which lend support to Plaintiff's claim. They kept Plaintiff out of work and continued efforts to remediate his deficits. Defendant's narrow focus on the evidence reveals the superficial nature of Defendant's claim analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This tunnel vision defect may be seen also in the lack of consideration given to the issue of safety as it relates to the duties of a pilot such as Plaintiff. The question of safety in itself naturally arises in the context of the medical condition of a pilot. Moreover, the Plan of insurance directs one to take account of the duties and responsibilities of an insured pilot, which self-evidently spring from and implicate consideration of the safety of a plane in flight. Yet Defendant's decision documents denying the claim for disability insurance benefits barely discuss that component of the evidence beyond mere mention of it, and fail to explain its role in Defendant's denial of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In making its initial decision, Defendant had not sought medical review of Plaintiff's medical records. In upholding that decision on Plaintiff's appeal, Defendant relies mainly on Dr. McKenas's physician review, specifically his assertions that the Plaintiff lacked objective evidence, passed a Class I physical in August 2014 and was cleared by FAA authorities to flight status without restrictions. [Doc. 10-2] at 14-16. Here, the asserted lack of positive objective testing evidence stands in stark contrast to the reports and letters from Plaintiff's treating physicians. For example, Dr. Edwards reports that, \"[w]hile the objective testing that has been done thus far has failed to document a measureable cause of his symptoms, it is [his] opinion that the giving way of Mr. Cline's leg is likely due to neurologic dysfunction related to his previous herniated disk or the aftermath of his surgery.\" (AR 7000218). Defendant makes no effort to challenge Dr. Edwards' medical opinion other than reiterating its reliance on the record review of Dr. McKenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   While the Court does not re-weigh the evidence in its task to examine Defendant's decision for abuse of discretion, it must nevertheless give due consideration to the third enumerated\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   factor, which calls attention to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (3) the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Dr. McKenas' gave his written opinion after a review of Plaintiff's medical record and without an in-person medical examination. In this report Dr. McKenas states that his rationale to support a finding of non-disability is based on his analysis from both the clinical and FAA perspective, thereby seeming to elevate the latter to an equal plane with clinical findings. The Court finds this emphasis to be misplaced, but still the role of the \"FAA perspective\" in Defendant's decision bears close examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   First the Court looks to language of the Plan itself for a relevant indication of the place an FAA stance or certificate, if any, might properly hold in Defendant's claim decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Plan provides: \"If your\n   <strong>\n    own occupation\n   </strong>\n   requires a professional or occupational license or certification of any kind,\n   you will not be deemed to be disabled solely because of the loss of that certification.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AR 7010004). Thus, the Plan makes clear that non-issuance of any occupational certificate is not to be taken as decisive in itself. It follows that\n   <em>\n    issuance\n   </em>\n   of a certificate alone could likewise not be taken as determinative, but only as one factor in the disability decision. One may infer that the reason for this limitation on the probative value of \"certificate\" evidence is that the criteria used by the issuing authority for its decision may very well be different from those used to determine disability as such under a given plan of insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Plaintiff takes issue with Defendant's reliance (in its first appeal decision and in its final decision) on Dr. McKenas' report in respect of his conclusions concerning the FAA aspects of the evidence. Thus, the Court must assess the relevance and import of communication which took place between Dr. Edwards and Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") officials and a subsequent related telephone conversation between Dr. Edwards and Dr. McKenas on December 29, 2014. This latter phone call appears to be the sole source of Dr. McKenas's knowledge of the FAA position regarding Mr. Cline. Moreover, Dr. McKenas, for his part, laid great emphasis on this phone call, as thereafter he terminated his efforts to contact Dr. Adamson as part of his \"peer to peer consultation\", declaring that; \"after the call with Dr. Edwards, no further questions remain to be posed for this review.\" (AR 7000208).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Dr. McKenas misunderstood or mischaracterized what he learned from Dr. Edwards, resulting in a flawed report to Defendant. For its part, Defendant relies considerably and explicitly on Dr. McKenas's representations as to the purported FAA perspective on Plaintiff's condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In assessing Dr. McKenas's account of the phone call, the Court considers his statement that \"They did his class I physical in August [2015] and he passed.\" (AR 7000208). The Court concludes that this statement is inaccurate and unsupported by the record. No clinical notes or other record of a Class I physical or resulting actual certificate of any kind have been presented to the Court, and the statement is directly contradicted by Dr. Edwards's subsequent letter of April 21, 2015 (AR 7000185), indicating that the last such complete exam occurred on September 23, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court next turns to the question of whether Plaintiff would have been\n   <em>\n    eligible\n   </em>\n   for a first class certificate under FAA auspices during the period of coverage. Drs. Edwards and Mckenas corroborate one another with respect to Dr. Edwards's confirmation that Plaintiff was still medically qualified for a first class medical certificate. However, in the absence of actual issuance of such a certificate, as is the case here, it must remain a matter of pure speculation whether it would have contained restrictions consistent with Dr. Edwards's limitations outlined in his letter of April 21, 2015. Dr. Edwards, as regional aviation medical examiner, would have been the source of medical opinion underlying any such certificate. Thus, Dr. McKenas's further statement that: \"We therefore share the view that given the FAA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   feels he is safe to fly; he is cleared to flight duty with no restrictions,\" is also speculative and unsupported by the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Dr. Edwards credibly resolved the question of differences in the criteria for a medical certificate versus the Plan's criteria for disability insurance, when he stated: \"I have reviewed the job description, and in my opinion, while he is medically qualified to operate an aircraft, he could not safely and reliably perform some of the essential functions listed\" and went on to list those function as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Specific tasks that I would not consider him able to perform safely include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   5. \"climbing on wings\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   6. \"run while carrying or pulling suitcase, kitbags, etc.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   7. \"yaw (leg) control expecting 150 lbs. of force\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   8. \"Bending the body downward and forward by bending leg and spine.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (AR 7000185).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The most authoritative, specific and substantial evidence before Defendant on the appeal and the reconsideration request, as to Defendant's medical condition and its relationship to the material duties of his own occupation, comes from that letter of April 21, 2015, from Dr. Edwards himself. Dr. McKenas did not have the benefit of this letter in preparing his physician review because it was written and came into evidence subsequent to that review. Likewise, he did not have Dr. Senft's letter of March 21, 2015, confirming his opinion as treating and referring physician and due to his background as a flight surgeon in the United States Army, that Plaintiff is \"unsafe to fly commercial or private aircraft.\" (AR 7000186). But Defendant did have such benefit and nonetheless concluded that there was \"no evidence\" of Defendant's inability reliably to perform in his own occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The only evidence to the contrary of Dr. Edwards's report and those of the other doctors is that of Dr. McKenas, whose report, while independent, is ostensibly derivative of the findings of Plaintiff's doctors. The latter, however, uniformly reveal no doubts of Plaintiff's credibility concerning his symptoms, found a medical basis for them and concluded he could not be expected to perform the necessary material functions of his own occupation in the light of those symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   This certainly constitutes evidence of an objective functional deficit in Plaintiff's leg and is far from \"no evidence\". Defendant's reliance on Dr. McKenas's report is not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As indicated earlier in this opinion, the entire place of occupational licensure or medical certification, and the FAA posture, such as it may have been, is overblown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To keep one's eye on the ball in this case is to focus on the language of the Plan, and what it means for Plaintiff's medically ascertained inability to perform certain material particulars of his own occupation. The Defendant failed to keep that focus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, and considering the record as a whole, Defendant's adverse disability determination is not supported by substantial evidence, is not the result of a reasoned and principled process, and constituted an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant had a significant conflict of interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The eighth enumerated\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   factor concerns whether a conflict of interest existed. In this case, Defendant served as both the insurer and the administrator of the Plan. Defendant was responsible for deciding whether benefits should be paid and for paying those benefits, and serving in both of these roles creates a structural conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691138\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/622/\">\n    609 F.3d at 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Conflicts are but one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account,\" but this conflict of interest can be of great importance \"where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision....\"\n   <em>\n    Metro.

Structural conflicts of interest do not always merit significant weight. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit noted that structural conflicts of interest should not receive significant weight where the plan administrator initially found a disability and paid LTD benefits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691138\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/622/\">\n    609 F.3d at 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Defendant is both the insurer and administrator of the Plan, and this fact, when coupled with Defendant's narrow focus on the evidence and its excessive reliance on the opinion of Dr. McKenas, weighs toward Plaintiff in the Court's review for reasonableness and abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The decision making process is judged on the manner in which Defendant takes the medical evidence as a whole into account or fails to do so. The process may be found wanting and the conclusion may fall short on the standard of reasonableness where it is not sound in the light of the evidence as applied to the contractual specifications for disability as found in the Plan language. The first enumerated\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   factor is: \"the language of the Plan.\" Here, given the medical evidence in its entirety, Plaintiff's ability to perform his occupational requisites as a pilot are substantially compromised. The evidence to the contrary proved to be insubstantial. The third enumerated\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   factor comes strongly into play here in favor of Plaintiff's position-\"... the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it....\" Thus, the Defendant's decision to deny coverage failed to take the overall weight of substantial evidence into account as part of a reasoned process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

In the Fourth Circuit, if a party meets the initial burden of \"some degree of success on the merits,\" its claims for attorneys' fees under ERISA are governed by the following five-factor test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   (1) degree of opposing parties' culpability or bad faith;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys' fees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   (3) whether an award of attorneys' fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys' fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   (5) the relative merits of the parties' positions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691138\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/622/\">\n    609 F.3d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Quesinberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516057\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1017/#p1030\">\n    987 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1029 ). \"The five factor approach is not a rigid test, but rather provides general guidelines for the district court in determining whether to grant a request for attorneys' fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Quesinberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516057\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1017/#p1030\">\n    987 F.2d at 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Every factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff being awarded attorneys' fees except the fourth factor. Defendant unreasonably relied on a flawed report to uphold its decision to deny Plaintiff's claim for LTD benefits. The unprincipled nature of Defendant's decision-making was enhanced by the conflict of interest created by Defendant's role as both insurer and administrator of the Plan. The Court believes Defendant has the ability to satisfy an award of attorneys' fees, and that an award of attorneys' fees here may deter Defendant and other plan administrators from improperly relying on an independent review instead of the medical reports of a claimant's treating physicians. The merits of Defendants' arguments also weigh in favor of Plaintiff. Despite Plaintiff pointing out the inaccuracies of Dr. McKenas' report, Defendant failed to further investigate the evidence. Meanwhile, Plaintiff's treating physicians wrote additional letters, confirming their belief that it is unsafe for Plaintiff to pilot an airplane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to a retroactive award of his LTD benefits, prejudgment interest, and attorneys' fees and costs associated with this litigation. The parties shall file a joint pleading, or supplemental briefing, or both, as directed below, on all aspects of the subjects of amount of benefits, amount of prejudgment interest, and liability for and proposed amount, if any, of attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.
