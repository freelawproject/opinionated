The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly reached one or more of the following conclusions of law: (1) that the amendments to the informed consent allegation necessarily stated a claim for battery, rather than negligence, and thus stated a new cause of action that did not relate back to the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint; (2) that the fact that an inexperienced resident would perform significant parts of a patient\u2019s surgery was not material information that a patient should be told before giving his informed consent, and, accordingly, that there was no actionable negligence; and (3) that the plaintiffs\u2019 amended allegations of the defendants\u2019 negligence in obtaining Alswanger\u2019s consent arise from a different set of facts than the allegations of the original complaint, and, accordingly, were time-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>barred because they did not relate back either to the plaintiffs\u2019 informed consent allegations, or to the plaintiffs\u2019 general negligence allegations in the original complaint. We conclude that the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint alleging lack of informed consent regarding a resident\u2019s participation in the surgery arose from a different set of facts than the allegations set forth in the original complaint. The amended complaint, therefore, did not relate back and was barred under the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The plaintiffs initiated this action against the defendants, Douglas R. Smego, a physician, and Stamford Hospital (hospital), alleging, inter alia, that the defendants failed to advise the plaintiffs of all material risks involved in a certain surgical procedure. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint, specifically alleging that the defendants failed to obtain Alswanger\u2019s consent to the participation of a surgical resident, Jay Dewell, as a co-operating surgeon. The defendants filed motions for partial summary judgment with respect to this allegation, claiming that it was a new claim that did not relate back to the original complaint and, therefore, was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs withdrew their other informed consent allegations and the case went to trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>remaining issues. The court granted the hospital\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Smego. The court, subsequently, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict and rendered judgment for Smego. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. Smego had been treating Alswanger for a recurring superficial phlebitis condition of the right greater saphenous vein in his leg since 1986. Because of recurring problems, the parties agreed in January, 1990, that Smego would perform a surgical procedure to ligate and strip Alswanger\u2019s right greater saphenous vein. The surgery was performed on March 19, 1990, by Smego and Dewell, a first year medical resident. Immediately after the surgery, Alswanger experienced pain from his groin down into his right leg. The pain continued throughout Alswanger\u2019s postoperative treatment with Smego, which lasted until June, 1990. Alswanger\u2019s pain finally subsided when a second surgery was performed on May 1,1991, by a different physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendants on June 16, 1992. The complaint alleged that Smego was negligent in sewing through a nerve in Alswanger\u2019s upper thigh with permanent silk sutures, and in failing to disclose \u201call material risks involved in connection with his care and treatment, including the nature and possible consequences of the operation, the prospects of success, the prognosis if the procedure was not performed, and alternative methods of treatment available . . . .\u201d The complaint also included a general negligence allegation that the defendants \u201cfailed to exercise that degree of care, skill, and/or diligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ordinarily employed by surgeons under similar circumstances . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">On March 2, 1998, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The relevant portions of the amended complaint restated the allegations of the original complaint and added claims of negligence relating to Dewell\u2019s involvement in the surgical procedure. Specifically, the amended complaint alleged that Smego was negligent \u201cin that he failed to disclose to and inform [Alswanger] of all material risks involved in connection with his surgery, care and treatment, including but not limited to the nature and possible consequences of the operation, the prospects of success, the prognosis if the procedure was not performed, the alternative methods of treatment available, <em>and the fad that a medical resident, Jay Dewell, M.D., would participate as a cooperating surgeon . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The amended complaint also alleged that Smego was negligent \u201cin that the operation was performed without the consent of [Alswanger] to the participation of Jay Dewell, M.D., as a co-operating surgeon . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The defendants each objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendment. The court, <em>D Andrea, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the complaint, but explicitly declined to address the legal sufficiency of the new allegations, stating that those issues would be more appropriately addressed through other procedural vehicles. In answering the amended complaint, the defendants each asserted a special defense, claiming that the plaintiffs\u2019 amended allegations were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, \u00a7 52-584. The defendants, thereafter, each moved for summary judgment, again alleging that the plaintiffs\u2019 amended claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The court, <em>Tierney, J., </em>granted the summary judgment motions on August 17, 1998, and, in doing so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>explained the relation back doctrine. \u201cIt is proper to amplify or expand what has already been alleged in support of a cause of action, provided the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same. But where an entirely new and different factual situation is presented, a new and different cause of action is stated. In the event that a new and different factual situation is presented, any amendment will not relate back to the initial commencement of the lawsuit unless the original pleading had given a fair notice to the adverse party that a claim is being asserted against him for some particular transaction or occurrence.\u201d The general rule, the court explained, would be to consider whether it would permit the admission of evidence relating to the consent of Dewell\u2019s involvement in the surgery under the original complaint. Under this precept, the court determined that the original complaint lacked any allegations that there was a failure to obtain informed consent to Dewell\u2019s participation and, therefore, concluded that such evidence would not have been admitted. Accordingly, the court concluded that the amended complaint did not relate back to the original complaint and, therefore, granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The relation back doctrine has been well established by this court. \u201cA cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief. ... A right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff, and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant. The facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action. ... A change in, or an addition to, a ground of negligence or an act of negligence arising out of the single group of facts which was originally claimed to have brought about the unlawful injury to the plaintiff does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>not change the cause of action. ... It is proper to amplify or expand what has already been alleged in support of a cause of action, provided the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same, but where an entirely new and different factual situation is presented, a new and different cause of action is stated. . . . Our relation back doctrine provides that an amendment relates back when the original complaint has given the party fair notice that a claim is being asserted stemming from a particular transaction or occurrence, thereby serving the objectives of our statute of limitations, namely, to protect parties from having to defend against stale claims . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>232 Conn. 242, 263-64, 654 A.2d 748 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Two cases in particular are illustrative of this court\u2019s approach to the relation back doctrine. In <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>209 Conn. 59, 60, 546 A.2d 846 (1988), three men were asphyxiated in an underground fuel storage facility during the course of their employment. The plaintiffs, the administrators of the decedents\u2019 estates, alleged a wrongful death action based on negligent supervision in their first complaint. Id., 73. They subsequently amended their complaint to allege that the defendant had negligently designed and constructed the storage facility. Id. In concluding that the amended complaint did not relate back to the original complaint, the court held that \u201c[t]hese complaints involve two different sets of circumstances and depend on different facts to prove or disprove the allegations of a different basis of liability. . . . The defendants did not have fair-notice of the claim of negligent construction and design of the underground storage area when the original complaint merely alleged that [the defendant] was negligent in ordering the employees to enter the area.\u201d Id. Moreover, the court noted that \u201c[t]he fact that the same defendant is accused of negligence in each complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>and the same injury resulted . . . does not make any and all bases of liability relate back to an original claim of negligence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">This court came to a different conclusion in <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 590 A.2d 914 (1991). In that case, the plaintiff claimed that she had suffered injuries when her vehicle was struck in the rear by a driver who was intoxicated. Id., 534. The plaintiffs first complaint alleged that the defendant had acted negligently in operating his automobile while he was intoxicated. Id., 546. After the relevant limitations period had passed, the plaintiff amended her complaint to add allegations that the defendant had acted either wilfully, wantonly and maliciously, or outside the scope of his employment. Id. In distinguishing <em>Gurliacci </em>from <em>Sharp, </em>we explained that the amendment in <em>Sharp </em>was significant because \u201cthe defendant would have been required to gather different facts, evidence and witnesses to defend the amended claim.\u201d Id., 549. In <em>Gurliacci, </em>however, the amendment \u201cdid not inject two different sets of circumstances and depend on different facts . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Accordingly, we concluded that the amended complaint related back to the original complaint. Id., 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In the present case, we are faced with an amended complaint, filed after the statute of limitations had expired, alleging an act of negligence based on a different set of facts from that alleged in the original complaint. Although the focus of the original complaint was on the informed consent as it related to the surgical procedure itself, the amended complaint shifted the focus to consent by the patient to the participation of the individuals involved in the surgery. For example, the amended complaint would have required evidence as to Dewell\u2019s actual and specific role in the surgery, his experience, whether the plaintiffs were informed of the role he would play and his experience, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>defendants were required to provide that information to the plaintiffs, and the hospital\u2019s policy, as a teaching hospital, regarding a resident\u2019s involvement in surgery. Any discussion as to much of this evidence, however, would have been irrelevant under the original complaint, which asked whether the defendants adequately informed the plaintiffs regarding the surgical procedure. As in <em>Sharp, </em>the amendment in the present case would have forced the defendants \u201cto gather different facts, evidence and witnesses to defend the amended claim.\u201d <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 549. Accordingly, the trial court properly disallowed the relation back of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The plaintiffs claim that their amended complaint set forth only a more specific informed consent allegation and, therefore, the defendants were on notice that a lack of consent to Dewell\u2019s participation was an issue they could raise. We disagree that the amendments gave the defendants adequate notice. All of the informed consent cases in Connecticut have involved the adequacy of information disclosed regarding the procedure and treatment to be performed. See, e.g., <em>Fabrizio </em>v. <em>Glaser, </em>237 Conn. 25, 26, 675 A.2d 844 (1996) (alleging lack of informed consent for extraction of wisdom teeth); <em>Pedersen </em>v. <em>Vahidy, </em>209 Conn. 510, 512, 552 A.2d 419 (1989) (alleging lack of informed consent for failure to disclose risks associated with lipoma removal); <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 60, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986) (alleging lack of informed consent for failure to disclose spinal headache as risk of myelogram procedure); <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>191 Conn. 282, 284, 465 A. 2d 294 (1983) (alleging lack of informed consent for failure to disclose alternatives to percutaneous renal biopsy). In <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>supra, 292, we held that informed consent involves four specific factors: (1) the nature of the procedure; (2) the risks and hazards of the procedure; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the alternatives to the procedure; and (4) the anticipated benefits of the procedure. We are not aware of any case adjudicated by this court where the identity and qualifications of the participants in the procedure, and the policies of teaching hospitals, constituted a lack of informed consent claim. Thus, the defendants were reasonable in assuming that the originally alleged negligence involved only the procedure itself. Our case law supports the notion that the defendants had no reason to be on notice that informed consent to the surgical staff team was in issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The amended complaint, although alleging negligence related to the same surgery as the original complaint, had its basis in a different set of facts from the original complaint. That the injuries alleged and the parties involved in each complaint were identical did not eliminate the fact that the complaints were based on different facts. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C. J., and BORDEN and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-584 provides: \u201cNo action to recover damages for injury to the person, or to real or personal property, caused by negligence, or by reckless or wanton misconduct, or by malpractice of a physician, surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, hospital or sanatorium, shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of, except that a counterclaim may be interposed in any such action any time before the pleadings in such action are finally closed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> It is important to note that this decision is limited to the issue of whether the allegations in the amended complaint arose from a different set of facts than those alleged in the original complaint. The judgment of the trial court similarly was limited to this issue. Contrary to the claims set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 briefs, the trial court did not conclude that the amendments necessarily stated a claim for battery; nor did the trial court conclude that a patient is without the right to know the identity and experience level of those participating in his or her own surgery. At oral argument before this court, the plaintiffs acknowledged the trial court's limited holding. Accordingly, we decline to address the underlying issues involved in the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\"> In granting the hospital\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the court concluded that Dewell was the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d of Smego during the surgical procedure. Thus, Dewell\u2019s negligence, if any, could not be imputed to the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-11\"> Our holding should not be read to suggest that informed consent does not involve a patient\u2019s right to know the identity and qualifications of the surgical team involved in the patient\u2019s procedure. Rather, we make no comment on that issue. We cite these cases only to demonstrate the validity and reasonableness of the defendants\u2019 surprise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b86-9\">AXELROD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4l\">dissenting. I respectfully disagree with the result and the reasoning of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 amended allegations of the defendants\u2019 negligence in obtaining the informed consent of the named plaintiff arise from a different set of facts than the allegations of the original complaint, and, accordingly, are time-barred because they do not relate back to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 informed consent allegations in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The relevant portions of the first count of the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint provide in part: \u201c3. On January 19, 1990, plaintiff [Herman Alswanger] came to [the named defendant, Douglas R. Smego\u2019s] office for an exam. During the exam, [Smego] diagnosed plaintiffs discomfort as being caused by recurrent phlebitis and discussed the operative procedure of ligation and stripping the greater saphenous vein (essentially a varicose vein repair in which the vein is tied off and excised). [Smego] recommended that the plaintiff undergo such an operation and informed the plaintiff that such an operation would be performed on a day surgery basis at The Stamford Hospital (hereinafter, \u2018Hospital\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u201c4. The plaintiff continued to treat with [Smego] in connection with his discomfort and tenderness from January, 1990 through March 19, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u201c5.

The plaintiff continued treatment with [Smego] in connection with his discomfort and tenderness from January 1990 through March 1990.

In <em>Gurliacci, </em>the plaintiffs original complaint alleged that the defendant had acted negligently in operating his automobile while he was intoxicated. Id., 546. The proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>amendment sought to add allegations that the defendant had acted either wilfully, wantonly or maliciously, or outside the scope of his employment. Id. In allowing the amendment under the doctrine of relation back, the court stated that the \u201cnew allegations did not inject two different sets of circumstances and depend upon different facts . . . but rather amplified and expanded upon the previous allegations by setting forth alternative theories of liability. The fact that the new allegations had the potential effect of taking the claim outside the operation of the fellow employee immunity rule does not negate the identity of the cause of action. . . . <em>[The defendant] had adequate notice that a claim was being asserted against him arising out of the alleged motor vehicle </em>accident.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In the present case, Smego had adequate notice that a claim was being asserted against him under the doctrine of lack of informed consent. He also had adequate notice that there was a claim that Dewell was involved in the surgeiy. The cause of action that originally was based on lack of informed consent and the new allegations did not negate \u201cthe identity of the cause of action.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The majority holds that the focus of the original complaint was on the informed consent as it related to the surgical procedure itself, and that the amended complaint shifted the focus to consent by the patient to the participation of the individuals involved in the surgery. I respectfully disagree. The leading case in Connecticut on informed consent is <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>191 Conn. 282, 465 A.2d 294 (1983). In that case, the court held as follows: \u201cIn some of our cases, where the claim against the physician was contractual in nature, we have recognized the importance of informing the patient of certain aspects of the contemplated treatment or surgical procedure. . . . <em>The failure to make </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>a sufficient disclosure, which is ordinarily the basis for claiming lack of informed consent, has been regarded by most courts as presenting the question, not whether there was an effective consent which would preclude an action for battery, but whether the physician had fulfilled his duty of informing the patient under the appropriate standard. </em>... In a trilogy of cases decided in 1972 the traditional standard of customary medical practice in the community was abandoned by three jurisdictions as the criterion for informed consent in favor of a judicially imposed standard designed to provide a patient with information material to his decision upon a course of therapy.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 288-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">More recently in <em>Godwin </em>v. <em>Danbury Eye Physicians &amp; Surgeons, P.C., </em>254 Conn. 131, 137 n.3, 757 A.2d 516 (2000), this court again recognized that \u201c[t]he consent necessary to preclude a claim for assault and battery is different from the consent at issue on a claim of lack of informed consent, <em>where the issue is whether a, sufficient disclosure was made.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In that case, the focus of the complaint regarding informed consent did not relate to the surgical procedure itself, but rather, related to whether the physician had fulfilled his duty of making a sufficient disclosure to the patient under the appropriate standard. Id., 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u201cUnlike the traditional action of negligence, a claim for lack of informed consent focuses not on the level of skill exercised in the performance of the procedure itself but on the adequacy of the explanation given by the physician in obtaining the patient\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Dingle </em>v. <em>Belin, </em>358 Md. 354, 369-70, 749 A.2d 157 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In holding that the focus of the original complaint on the informed consent related to the surgical procedure itself and that the amendment shifted the focus to consent by the patient to the participation of the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>involved in the surgery, the majority opinion states that \u201c[f]or example, the amended complaint would have required evidence as to Dewell\u2019s actual and specific role in the surgery, his experience, whether the plaintiffs were informed of the role he would play and his experience, whether the defendants were required to provide that information to the plaintiffs, and the hospital\u2019s policy, as a teaching hospital, regarding a resident\u2019s involvement in surgery. Any discussion as to much of this evidence, however, would have been irrelevant under the original complaint, which asked whether the defendants adequately informed the plaintiffs regarding the surgical procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">All potential amendments to a complaint require that there be some new evidence presented. Thus, in <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 546, the amendment to the complaint would have required new evidence as to whether the defendant was acting either wilfully, wantonly or maliciously. Further, the amendment to the complaint would have required evidence as to whether the defendant was operating the motor vehicle outside the scope of his employment. Id. The fact that new evidence would be required in <em>Gurliacci </em>was not the determining factor as to whether the amendment would relate back to the original complaint. The amendment was allowed in <em>Gurliacci </em>in part because the defendant had adequate notice that a claim was being asserted against him arising out of the alleged motor vehicle accident and the amended complaint reiterated the negligence claim based on his operation of a motor vehicle. Id., 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In <em>Gurliacci, </em>the court held that \u201c[w]e have previously recognized that our relation back doctrine is akin to rule 15 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides in pertinent part: (c) RELATION BACK OF AMENDMENTS. Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading. . . . The policy behind rule 15 (c) is that a party, once notified of litigation based upon a particular transaction or occurrence, has been provided with all the notice that statutes of limitations are intended to afford. . . . Because rule 15 provides that an amendment relates back where the original complaint has given the party fair notice that a claim is being asserted stemming from a particular transaction or occurrence, the objectives of our statute of limitations, namely, to protect parties from having to defend against stale claims, is fully served.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 547-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Other courts have ruled that amendments similar to the one in the present case would relate back to the date of the original complaint. The issue of amending a complaint in a medical malpractice action to allege lack of informed consent was addressed in <em>Azarbal </em>v. <em>Medical Center of Delaware, Inc., </em>724 F. Sup. 279, 281-83 (D. Del. 1989), wherein the court stated: \u201cThe complaint alleges that the defendants were negligent in the performance of the amniocentesis. The complaint seeks damages for the child\u2019s injuries and for the parents\u2019 injuries resulting from the child\u2019s illness and death. On April 10, 1989, the plaintiffs filed this motion to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to amend the complaint in six respects. First, the plaintiffs seek to add a claim against [the physician] for failing to obtain the informed consent of [the child\u2019s mother] prior to performing the amniocentesis .... The court will first address the propriety of allowing the amendment alleging lack of informed consent to the amniocentesis. [The physician] contends that this amendment would be futile because it is barred by the statute of limitations. The limitations period for bringing medical malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>actions is two years. . . . Since the amniocentesis occurred more than two years before the motion to amend was filed, the informed consent claim would be barred were it not for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 (c). . . . This court finds that the original complaint gave [the physician] adequate notice of the basis of the claim regarding lack of informed consent to the sterilization .... This court believes the original complaint provided adequate notice of any claims [the mother] would have arising from the amniocentesis, including a claim that [the physician] should have revealed that the procedure had caused fetal injury. The claim therefore relates back to the date of the original complaint and is not time-barred. The court will thus allow the plaintiffs to amend this claim to their complaint.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">I believe, just as in Azarbal, that the original complaint in the present case provided adequate notice of any claims the plaintiffs would have arising from the surgery, including a claim that Smego should have revealed that Dewell would be performing the surgery. Under rule 15 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an amendment to a malpractice action to allege lack of informed consent after the statute of limitations has run relates back to the original complaint. Therefore, an original complaint sounding in malpractice that includes a claim of lack of informed consent should allow an amendment to the lack of informed consent claim after the statutes of limitations has run, and that amendment should relate back to the original complaint. Several New York courts have taken the same position as the court in <em>Azarbal. </em>Thus, in <em>Grosse </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>118 App. Div. 2d 539, 541, 498 N.Y.S.2d 863 (1986), and in <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>161 App. Div. 2d 1163, 555 N.Y.S.2d 959 (1990), medical malpractice actions were allowed to be amended to add a cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>for lack of informed consent after the statute of limitations had run. In <em>Ecker, </em>the court stated that \u201c[the] Supreme Court erred in concluding that [the] plaintiffs proposed amendment to her medical malpractice complaint was time barred. Although [the] plaintiff sought to amend by adding a new cause of action for lack of informed consent more than two and one-half years after [the] defendants\u2019 last treatment of [the] plaintiff . . . the facts alleged in the original complaint gave adequate notice of the transactions or occurrences asserted in the proposed amended complaint, and thus, the amendment is deemed to have been interposed at the time the original claims were interposed . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kokemoor, </em>199 Wis. 2d 615, 620, 545 N.W.2d 495 (1996), a patient brought an action against a surgeon alleging failure to obtain her informed consent to surgery. The court stated: \u201cIn this case information regarding a physician\u2019s experience in performing a particular procedure, a physician\u2019s risk statistics as compared with those of other physicians who perform that procedure, and the availability of other centers and physicians better able to perform that procedure would have facilitated the plaintiffs awareness of \u2018all of the viable alternatives\u2019 available to her and thereby aided her exercise of informed consent.\u201d Id., 623. \u201cWe reject the defendant\u2019s proposed bright line rule that it is error as a matter of law to admit evidence in an informed consent case that the physician failed to inform the patient regarding the physician\u2019s experience with the surgery or treatment at issue.\u201d Id., 639. \u201cWhen different physicians have substantially different success rates, <em>whether surgery is performed by one rather than another represents a choice between \u2018alternate, viable medical modes of treatment\u2019 </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>In <em>Barriocanal v. Gibbs, </em>697 A.2d 1169, 1170 (1997), an action was brought against a surgeon claiming lack of informed consent and negligence in performing the surgery. In reversing the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the plaintiffs proffered expert testimony that the surgeon had breached the applicable standard of care required to obtain informed consent by failing to inform the patient of the surgeon\u2019s lack of recent aneurysm surgery, the court stated: \u201cNext, we must determine whether the exclusion of the proffered testimony constituted \u2018significant prejudice so as to have denied the appellant a fair trial.\u2019 By statute in Delaware, a health care provider is required to disclose \u2018the <em>risks and alternatives </em>to treatment or diagnosis which a reasonable patient would consider material to the decision whether or not to undergo the treatment or diagnosis.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). Id., 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In <em>Dingle </em>v. <em>Belin, </em>supra, 358 Md. 357, the plaintiff retained a surgeon to remove her gallbladder. The surgeon was assisted by a medical student and a resident, who was just beginning her fourth year of residency training. Id., 358. The resident dissected the gallbladder and removed it. Id. The plaintiff filed a battery count that was dismissed. She also filed a breach of contract claim and counts for negligence arising from the lack of informed consent. Id., 359. The thrust of the lack of informed consent count was that without the plaintiffs knowledge or consent, the resident played a very active role in the surgery and did the cutting, clamping and stapling, which should have been performed by the surgeon retained by the plaintiff. Id. The claim was that by failing to inform the plaintiff of the scope of responsibilities that would be performed by the resident, the surgeon and the resident \u201c \u2018breached their duty to secure the fully informed consent of [the plaintiff] prior to commencing operating upon her.\u2019 \u201d Id. The court stated that the \u201c[r]isks, benefits, collateral effects, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>and alternatives normally must be disclosed routinely, but other considerations, at least if raised by the patient, may also need to be discussed and resolved. See Aaron D. Twerski &amp; Neil B. Cohen, \u2018The Second Revolution in Informed Consent: Comparing Physicians to Each Other,\u2019 94 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1 (1999); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kokemoor, </em>[supra, 199 Wis. 2d 615]. One of those considerations, in an expanding era of more complex medical procedures, group practices, and collaborative efforts among health care providers, may be who, precisely, will be conducting or superintending the procedure or therapy. This may be especially important with respect to surgical procedures, which usually involve collaboration between the chosen surgeon and other medical professionals who may be unknown to the patient. The physician, as [the surgeon] indicated was the case here, may be unwilling to accept limitations on the actual performance of the surgery, <em>but, if the identity of the persons who will be performing aspects of the surgery is important to the patient, the matter must be discussed and </em>resolved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Dingle </em>v. <em>Belin, </em>supra, 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The original complaint in the present case alleged lack of informed consent for failure to inform the plaintiffs of material risks involved and alternative methods of treatment available. The proposed amendments amplified and expanded upon those previous allegations by setting forth the claim that the failure to inform the plaintiffs that Dewell would be a co-operating surgeon failed to disclose to the plaintiffs the risks and alternatives to the treatment. Under the amendment, the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same. The actionable occurrence in the original complaint and in the amendment is lack of informed consent. Smego had fair notice of the claim of lack of informed consent in the original complaint, and the amendment amplified and expanded on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>I would hold that informed consent does involve a patient\u2019s right to know the identity and qualifications of the surgeons involved in the patient\u2019s procedure. I would not reach, at this time, the issue of a hospital\u2019s policy, such as a teaching hospital, regarding a resident\u2019s involvement in surgery and whether that involvement has to be unmasked to the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Accordingly, I would find that the trial court improperly granted Smego\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and I would remand the case for a new trial limited to the issue of lack of informed consent against Smego and the issue of damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
