Keeney. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that: (1) the office notes and transcription were inadmissible hearsay evidence to which the business records exception; General Statutes \u00a7 52-180;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>apply; (2) the notes and transcription did not satisfy the admissibility requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 52-174<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pertaining to medical records and reports of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>deceased expert witness; (3) the transcription contained double hearsay; (4) the transcription was secured without medical authorization in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prohibiting the disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of a patient\u2019s communications or information by a physician; and (5) the transcription was obtained through an ex parte communication between the defendant and Keeney. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The plaintiff brought this negligence action against the defendant, her daughter, for injuries that the plaintiff had sustained as a result of a February, 1993 collision in East Haven between an automobile operated by the defendant, in which the plaintiff was a passenger, and a truck owned by Asplundh Tree and operated by Richard A. Thomas. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and awarded her $6657.50 in economic damages and $6000 in noneconomic damages. The plaintiff moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial as to the issue of damages. The trial court denied these motions and rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On February 3, 1993, the defendant was driving the plaintiff home from an appointment at Keeney\u2019s office. As they were approaching the intersection of Forbes Place and Kimberley Avenue from the south, a truck known as a tree trimmer, which was operated by Thomas, was approaching the intersection from the east. At that intersection there was a three-way stop sign for all traffic except that approaching from the north. After coming to a complete stop, Thomas slowly proceeded through the intersection. The defendant failed to stop, however, and proceeded through the intersection striking the Asplundh Tree vehicle. Although neither the defendant nor Thomas was injured, the plaintiff was taken by ambulance to Yale-New Haven Hospital for examination. She was treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>for head, neck and back pain, and was released that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">On or about February 15, 1993, the plaintiff returned to Keeney, who believed that the plaintiff was in need of a cervical support and lumbar support. On March 1, 1993, to aid in her recovery, the plaintiff began treatment at the Functional Restoration Center (center) in Fairfield. She enrolled in the center\u2019s enhancement program in the hopes of alleviating her neck, shoulder and lower back pain. Thereafter, the plaintiff exacerbated a previous knee problem, and she chose to discontinue treatment at the center in order to begin treatment on her knee. The plaintiff consulted with Eric J. Katz, an orthopedic surgeon, on four occasions, the last of which took place in July, 1993. In 1996, the plaintiff moved to Florida where, sometime before April, 1998, she sought additional treatment for her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In November, 1993, the plaintiff brought this negligence action seeking monetary damages for the injuries that she had suffered. An extensive discovery process ensued. The defendant sought any information that would tend to show that the plaintiff had suffered any preexisting injuries. In the defendant\u2019s standard request for disclosure and production, the defendant sought, among other items, reports from any doctors or other care providers that related to any treatment that the plaintiff had received for injuries arising from this accident or from any similar injuries within the previous ten years. Among the records the plaintiff disclosed were those from the center, including a report from Joel S. Feigenson, a physician, which contained a reference to a prior history of lower back pain stemming from \u201can accident eight years ago.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The report stated that the plaintiff had been treated by Keeney. When then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>counsel for the defendant, Ida H. Rodriguez,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> inquired about the existence of any treatment notes regarding the earlier accident, the plaintiffs attorney, James O. Gaston, agreed to contact Keeney and send to Rodriguez any notes that Keeney had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On September 14, 1995, Gaston sent a letter to Keeney\u2019s office requesting \u201cany medical notes, reports and records\u201d of all services rendered to the plaintiff. On September 18, 1995, Keeney sent to the plaintiff two pages of partly indecipherable handwritten notes concerning the plaintiff. Accompanying the notes was a transmittal letter from Keeney addressed to Gaston, which stated that, because the notes were written with \u201ca system of abbreviations, coding and short-hand,\u201d they would be \u201ctotally unintelligible to anyone except [Keeney] . . . .\u201d Keeney therefore offered to Gaston to \u201csend a narrative report\u201d upon the receipt of $125. On January 23, 1996, Gaston sent a copy of Keeney\u2019s transmittal letter to O\u2019Donnell, along with a copy of the notes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In order to secure a transcription, O\u2019Donnell telephoned Keeney to confirm the proper mailing address, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and then sent a letter, which was dated June 28, 1996, requesting a transcription of the office notes, along with a check for $125. O\u2019Donnell requested that Keeney, in addition to transcribing the notes, \u201c \u2018spell out\u2019 \u201d any abbreviations developed by him or that commonly were used within the medical community. In July, 1996, Keeney sent a three page transcription to O\u2019Donnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">At trial, the issue of whether the plaintiff had any preexisting injuries was sharply contested, with the notes and transcription from Keeney potentially serving an important function in that regard. The plaintiff testified that, prior to the incident in the present case, the only other car accident in which she had been involved was \u201cabout twenty years ago.\u201d She also testified that she had no recollection of falling down a flight of stairs in November, 1992. Keeney\u2019s transcription states, however, that: \u201cShe did good until 11-92. Fell down a flight of stairs.\u201d Furthermore, the transcription covers visits beginning in June, 1990. The notes from this visit state: \u201cNow, swollen right shoulder and neck.\u201d When read in conjunction with the February 24, 1993 report from the center, which mentioned an accident eight years earlier and subsequent treatment by Keeney, a jury reasonably could have chosen to discredit the plaintiffs version of events. Thus, the admissibility of Keeney\u2019s transcription became an important issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Because Keeney had passed away before the commencement of trial, the defendant sought to admit Keeney\u2019s notes pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-174 and 52-180.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In order to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 52-180, the defendant offered the testimony of Keeney\u2019s widow, Kathleen Keeney, and Keeney\u2019s office manager, Judith Travaglino. Kathleen Keeney testified that Keeney\u2019s usual practice was to keep handwritten records regarding each patient in separate files, which reflected the treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>provided for or other information obtained from the patient. She identified the handwriting in the notes at issue as Keeney\u2019s. She further testified that it was part of his normal practice to make a typewritten transcription of his handwritten notes upon request, and that he normally did this transcription himself, at home on his personal computer. Travaglino testified that she had worked for Keeney for approximately eight years and also was familiar with his normal record keeping practices. She corroborated Kathleen Keeney\u2019s testimony concerning his note-taking and transcription practices. Travaglino also testified that she recalled Keeney handing her the transcription of the plaintiffs record and that she subsequently mailed it to O\u2019Donnell. Neither Travaglino nor Kathleen Keeney, however, observed Keeney write his original set of notes or later transcribe those notes and, thus, they were unable to testify as to precisely when the notes and the transcription had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">On the basis of the testimony of Kathleen Keeney and Travaglino, the defendant sought to enter into evidence Keeney\u2019s handwritten notes concerning the plaintiff and the typed transcription of those notes. The plaintiff objected on the grounds that both items were hearsay, and did not fall within either the business records exception of \u00a7 52-180 or within the medical records and reports exception of \u00a7 52-174. Additionally, the plaintiff argued that the transcription had been obtained through ex parte communications and in violation of \u00a7 52-146o; see footnote 5 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The trial court overruled the plaintiffs objections, ruling that both items were admissible under \u00a7\u00a7 52-174 and 52-180. The trial court stated: \u201cI also think that the sending of the letter by Mr. Gaston to Mr. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s office from Dr. Keeney talking about getting the shorthand translated is an invitation to go get that information and he didn\u2019t ask for additional information. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>asked to get a transcription of the notes, so I\u2019ll allow the notes into evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claims, we briefly set forth the standard by which we review the plaintiffs claims. \u201cOn appeal, a trial court\u2019s ruling as to the admissibility of evidence is accorded great deference . . . and we will reverse such a ruling only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>243 Conn. 168, 196, 700 A.2d 38 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly admitted Keeney\u2019s notes and transcription into evidence pursuant to \u00a7 52-180, which sets forth the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the notes and the transcription improperly were admitted pursuant to \u00a7 52-180 because the defendant was unable to show that either document had been made contemporaneously with or within a reasonable time after the treatment had been performed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u201cTo be admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule, a trial court judge must find that the record satisfies each of the three conditions set forth in ... \u00a7 52-180. The court must determine, before concluding that it is admissible, that the record was made in the regular course of business, that it was the regular course of such business to make such a record, and that it was made at the time of the act described in the report, or within a reasonable time thereafter. ... In applying the business records exception, the statute [\u00a7 52-180] should be liberally inteipreted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bell Food Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherbacow, </em>217 Conn. 476, 485, 586 A.2d 1157 (1991). In part, this is because the statute recognizes the inherent trustwor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>thiness of documents created for business rather than litigation purposes. <em>Emhart Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union376, U.A.W., </em>190 Conn. 371, 388-89, 461 A.2d 422 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">This court repeatedly has held that \u201c[i]t is not necessary . . . that the witness have been the entrant himself or in the employ of the business when the entry was made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bell Food Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherbacow, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 485. It is sufficient for a witness to testily that it was the regular business practice to create a document within a reasonable time after the occurrence of the event. This is sufficient to ensure that the document was created at the time when the event was fresh in the author\u2019s mind. <em>Emhart Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, U.A.W., </em>supra, 190 Conn. 388-89. Notations in the document itself may satisfy the contemporaneous requirement. <em>River Dock &amp; Pile, Inc. </em>v. O <em>&amp; G Industries, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 787, 797, 595 A.2d 839 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We first consider the admissibility of the notes prepared by Keeney concerning the plaintiffs treatment. At trial, the defendant introduced Keeney\u2019s notes through Kathleen Keeney and Travaglino. Travaglino testified that Keeney was very orderly and that, as he performed whatever course of action he deemed necessary, he would \u201cwrite down everything that he did to [the patients].\u201d She further testified that Keeney took these notes either while he was meeting with a patient or shortly thereafter. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the handwritten notes of Keeney were admissible under \u00a7 52-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">To require the defendant to produce a witness that could testify from personal knowledge as to the specific time that a particular document was made would unduly constrain the use of the business records exception and directly contradict the liberal interpretation that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>court has accorded to \u00a7 52-180. Travaglino\u2019s testimony that Keeney ordinarily wrote down his notes while he treated the patient or shortly thereafter, coupled with an examination of the handwritten notes, which contained dates corresponding to each entry, was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Keeney\u2019s notes satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 52-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We next consider the admissibility of the transcription of these notes. A comparison of the transcription to the original notes shows that the transcription closely tracks the writing contained in the notes, with each document containing the same dates and most of the same terms. Although Keeney, in his letter offering to translate his notes, describes his \u201csystem of abbreviations, coding and shorthand\u201d as \u201ctotally unintelligible to anyone except [himself],\u201d this is an exaggeration. Although some symbols or terms could have been explained only by Keeney, there are phrases in the notes that cannot be mistaken. For example, in an entry dated June 11,1990, Keeney scrawled: \u201cCan\u2019t wash hair, [indecipherable] raise arms, can\u2019t hook [indecipherable] (on uniform).\u201d In the transcription of the notes, Keeney wrote: \u201cCan\u2019t wash hair, can\u2019t hook bra (on uniform).\u201d There are enough of these types of passages for the trial court to have assured itself that the latter document was merely a translation of the former document, which we have deemed admissible. Additionally, Kathleen Keeney and Travaglino testified that it had been a regular part of Keeney\u2019s practice to make typewritten transcriptions of his handwritten notes upon request, that he normally had done them on his home computer, and that he had been the only person who would do the transcribing. Travaglino further testified that she recalled Keeney handing her the plaintiffs transcription in order to mail it to O\u2019Donnell, which she did, in July, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Taking into account these facts, and in keeping with the policy underlying the business records exception, namely, \u201cthat the essential hallmark of admissibility under \u00a7 52-180 is the trustworthiness of the document\u201d; <em>Jefferson Garden Associates </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>202 Conn. 128, 141, 520 A.2d 173 (1987); we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to have admitted into evidence the transcription of Keeney\u2019s notes. The fact that the transcription had not been prepared contemporaneously with the acts described in the report is not fatal to its admissibility, because it was merely a transcription of a document that itself had been prepared contemporaneously with the plaintiffs treatment. The transcription was not a completely independent document that was required, in and of itself, to satisfy the business records statute. Where, as here, the original document was admissible into evidence, and there was sufficient indication that the transcription contained substantially the same information, the transcription was also admissible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The plaintiff points out that, because Keeney had added parenthetical information in the transcription, which explained some of his symbols, it is impossible to know whether some information contained in the original notes had not been transcribed, and whether some information not contained in the original notes had been added to the transcription. Once a trial judge determines that a writing qualifies as a business record, however, it is the responsibility of the objecting party to make specific objections to those portions of the report that it wants redacted. <em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 628, 535 A.2d 338 (1987). It is not the trial court\u2019s responsibility to attempt to separate the admissible and inadmissible portions of the transcription. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>Mucci </em>v. <em>LeMonte, </em>157 Conn. 566, 571, 254 A.2d 879 (1969). In the present case, after making an initial objection to the admission of the transcription as a whole, the plaintiff made no further attempt to challenge the admissibility of specific portions of the writing. The plaintiffs argument, therefore, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The plaintiff further mentions, albeit in a cursory manner and for the first time in her reply brief, that Keeney\u2019s file contained two sets of handwritten notes, which contained much of the same information as the transcription, so that one cannot be sure which set of notes Keeney used to make the transcription. \u201cIt is a well established principle that arguments cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 843-44, 761 A.2d 705 (2000). \u201cOur practice requires an appellant to raise claims of error in his original brief, so that the issue as framed by him can be fully responded to by the appellee in its brief, and so that we can have the full benefit of that written argument. Although the function of the appellant\u2019s reply brief is to respond to the arguments and authority presented in the appellee\u2019s brief, that function does not include raising an entirely new claim of error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 312, 699 A.2d 921 (1997). We therefore decline to consider the plaintiffs untimely claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly admitted the transcription because it contained double hearsay, thus placing the transcription outside any hearsay exception. Because the plaintiff failed in the trial court to articulate this objection at an appropriate time,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we decline to review this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cWe have stated repeatedly that we ordinarily will not review an issue that has not been properly raised before the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 219-20, 682 A.2d 106 (1996) (court \u2018not required to consider any claim that was not properly preserved in the trial court\u2019); <em>Yale University </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>225 Conn. 32, 36 n.4, 621 A.2d 1304 (1993) (court declined to consider issues briefed on appeal but not raised at trial); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\u2018court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\u2019).\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Mobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>253 Conn. 453, 485, 754 A.2d 128 (2000). We see no cause to deviate from that general policy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The plaintiff further claims that the trial court improperly admitted the transcription into evidence because it had been obtained without medical authorization in violation of \u00a7 52-146o. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Section 52-146o (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as provided in sections 52-146c to 52-146j ... a physician . . . shall not disclose . . . any information obtained by him from, a patient . . . unless the patient or his authorized representative <em>explicitly consents </em>to such disclosure.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After the trial court concluded that the transcription was admissible under \u00a7\u00a7 52-174 and 52-180, the trial court added: \u201cI also think that the sending of the letter by Mr. Gaston to Mr. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s office from Dr. Keeney talking about getting the shorthand translated is an invitation to go get that information . . . .\u201d In its memorandum of decision denying the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict, the trial court elaborated: \u201c[T]here was no need for the plaintiffs attorney to send to the defendant\u2019s attorney the letter of transmittal requesting a check for $125 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>such a transcription unless it was contemplated that the defendant\u2019s attorney would undertake such action. . . . [T]he forwarding of the letter of transmittal constitutes an implied authorization to forward the check to the doctor . . . .\u201d We agree, and conclude that the plaintiffs actions constituted not only an implied authorization, but explicit consent for the defendant to obtain a transcription of Keeney\u2019s notes. Where, as here, the plaintiff\u2019s own attorney in a personal injury case explicitly forwards this information and invitation to the adversary, as part of an informal discovery process, the plaintiff was bound by the conduct of her attorney, who was her \u201cauthorized representative\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o (a) (2); for such purposes. Accordingly, we conclude that the transcription was not obtained in violation of \u00a7 52-146o.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">When Gaston forwarded a copy of Keeney\u2019s medical records with the transmittal letter from Keeney to Gas-ton offering to transcribe his notes upon the receipt of $125, Gaston, as the plaintiffs attorney, must be deemed to have expected the defendant to procure such a transcription. This is particularly so where the original notes were in Keeney\u2019s special coding and Gaston enclosed with the notes a letter explaining how to obtain a transcription of those notes. If Gaston, as the plaintiffs attorney, did not intend this letter to be considered authorization for the defendant to procure a transcription, as the person in the best position to control the use of the notes, he could have indicated as such in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The plaintiff also claims that even if the requirement of \u00a7 52-146o that the consent be \u201cexplicit\u201d was satisfied, the statute also requires that the consent be written and signed. Without deciding whether the term \u201cexplicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>consent\u201d requires such consent to be in writing,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we conclude that the letter to O\u2019Donnell dated January 23, 1996, written and signed by the plaintiffs attorney and authorized representative for such purposes, constituted a sufficient writing under \u00a7 52-146o. Thus, the explicit consent given in writing by the plaintiffs attorney was sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 52-146o.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly admitted the transcription because it was obtained through ex parte communications between O\u2019Donnell and Keeney. Specifically, the plaintiff challenges a telephone call between O\u2019Donnell and Keeney in which O\u2019Donnell requested the proper address to which to mail his $125 check for the transcription. The plaintiff also challenges the letter sent from O\u2019Donnell to Keeney requesting the transcription. As the plaintiff conceded in this court, however, if there was no breach of \u00a7 52-146o, there would be no wrongful ex parte communications in the present case. Because we concluded in part III of this opinion that there was no violation of \u00a7 52-146o, we conclude that the plaintiffs claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> The Asplundh Tree Expert Company (Asplundh Tree) and one of its employees, Richard A.

In the fall of 1995, attorney James E. O\u2019Donnell filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant and has represented the defendant since then.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\"> The text of Gaston\u2019s letter to O\u2019Donnell provided: \u201cPlease find enclosed copies of Dr. Keeney\u2019s office notes with respect to the above case. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.\u201d The trial court specifically found that Gaston also had forwarded Keeney\u2019s transmittal letter to the defendant\u2019s attorney. Gaston claims that he forwarded the letter to Rodriguez. O\u2019Donnell testified that he did not recall how he received the letter. Our conclusion does not depend on how O\u2019Donnell came into possession of the transmittal letter. Gaston concedes that he forwarded both the notes and the transmittal letter to one of the defendant\u2019s attorneys, either Rodriguez or O\u2019Donnell. Moreover, Gaston makes no claim that he instructed Rodriguez not to get a transcription, and Rodriguez would have had to turn over all of her documents to O\u2019Donnell once he assumed the defense. Thus, O\u2019Donnell was rightfully in possession of the transmittal letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> See footnotes 3 and 4 of this opinion for the texts of \u00a7\u00a7 52-174 and 52-180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> This conclusion, namely, that both the notes and transcription were admissible under \u00a7 52-180, renders it unnecessary to consider the plaintiffs contention that they were not admissible under \u00a7 52-174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> The first time that the plaintiff properly articulated a double hearsay claim was in the motion to set aside the verdict.
