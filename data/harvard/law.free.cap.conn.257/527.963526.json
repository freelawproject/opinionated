J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhB8\">This appeal presents two issues concerning the transfer of a workers\u2019 compensation claim to the defendant second injury fund (fund) that are identical to those decided by this court today in the case of <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 778 A.2d 33 (2001). Specifically, the named defendant, Norwalk Hospital (hospital), claims that General Statutes \u00a7 31-349c (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violates the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 10,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution. The fund argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>that the hospital\u2019s claim is moot in light of General Statutes \u00a7 31-349h.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Giaimo, </em>we concluded that \u00a7 31-349c (a) is unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions, as applied to the facts of that case; id., 516; and that \u00a7 31-349h does not bar the transfer of claims that were eligible for transfer prior to July 1, 1999, and that ultimately are found to be transferable. Id., 498. We conclude that \u00a7 31-349c (a) is also unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts. The plaintiff, Jean Zeoli, injured her back on March 26,1995, during the course of her employment with the hospital. The injury was found to be compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation act (act), and compensation was paid by the hospital and its insurer. The hospital subsequently sought to transfer the claim to the fund, claiming that the plaintiff had a preexisting physical disability to her back that had caused her disability from the second injury to be materially and substantially greater than it otherwise would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 31-349c (a), the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission assigned the claim to a panel of three physicians, consisting of Leo Willett, an orthopedic surgeon, John Basile, a neurosurgeon, and Robert Stem, a chiropractor. The panel examined the plaintiff and issued its report on February 5, 1998, concluding that the claim did not qualify for a transfer to the fund. On March 17, 1998, and again on April 29, 1998, the hospital wrote to the commissioner requesting that the commissioner enter a finding or order concerning the panel\u2019s decision so that the hospital would have a ruling from which to appeal to the compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>review board (board). When the commissioner took no action, the hospital, on October 14, 1998, requested a hearing on the panel\u2019s decision and again requested that the commissioner take some action with respect to the decision. A formal hearing was held on January 27, 1999, and on February 3, 1999, the commissioner issued a finding and dismissal, ruling that the panel\u2019s decision, that the plaintiffs preexisting condition had not caused her disability to be materially and substantially greater than it otherwise would have been, controlled, and denying the claim for a transfer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">On February 11, 1999, the hospital filed a motion to correct, which the commissioner denied on the same date. The hospital also filed with the board a petition for review and a motion for expedited reservation of the case to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-324.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fund moved to dismiss the hospital\u2019s petition for review and motion to correct on the grounds that the board had no subject matter jurisdiction in light of \u00a7 31-349h. The board issued its opinion on March 13, 2000, concluding that it could not reserve the constitutional question to the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>because it was not justiciable by the board in the first instance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The board held that the transfer of the claim was not barred by \u00a7 31-349h and affirmed the commissioner\u2019s February 3, 1999 decision. The hospital appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">For the reasons set forth in <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 498, the decision of the board is affirmed with respect to the board\u2019s ruling that the transfer of the claim was not barred by \u00a7 31-349h. The decision of the board is reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the board with direction to remand it to the commissioner for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-349c (a) provides: \u201cThe custodian of the Second Injury Fund and an insurer or self-insured employer seeking to transfer a claim to the fund shall submit all controverted issues regarding the existence of a previous disability under section 31-349 to the chairman of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. The chairman shall appoint a panel of three physicians, as defined in subdivision (17) of section 31-275, and submit such dispute to the panel, along with whatever evidence and materials he deems necessary for consideration in the matter. The panel may examine the claimant, who shall submit to any examination such panel may require. Within sixty days of receiving the submission, the panel shall file its opinion, in writing, with the chairman, who shall forward it, along with any records generated by the panel\u2019s work on the case, to the commissioner having jurisdiction over the claim in which the dispute arose. The panel\u2019s opinion shall be determined by a majority vote of the three members. Such opinion shall be binding on all parties to the claim and may not be appealed to the Compensation Review Board pursuant to section 31-301.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> Article first, \u00a7 10, of the constitution of Connecticut provides: \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-349h provides: \u201cAll transfers ol' claims to the Second Injury Fund with a date of injury prior to July 1, 1995, shall be effected no later than July 1, 1999.

The commissioner concluded at that healing that his ruling was controlled by the decision of the medical panel. Accordingly, the proceeding before the commissioner was merely pro forma, and its only purpose was to provide an opportunity for the commissioner to affirm the panel\u2019s decision without analysis thereof. For the reasons set forth in <em>Giaimo v. New Haven, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 516, we conclude that such a procedure is constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-324 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen, in any case arising under the provisions of this chapter, the Compensation Review Board is of the opinion that the decision involves principles of law which are not free from reasonable doubt and which public interest requires shall be determined by the Appellate Court, in order that a definite rule be established applicable to future cases, said Compensation Review Board may, on its own motion and without any agreement or act of the parties or their counsel, reserve such case for the opinion of the Appellate Court. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\"> The board\u2019s ruling that it would not reserve the constitutional question to the Appellate Court is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
