The plaintiff, the state of Connecticut, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying its application to vacate the arbitration award and granting the application to confirm the award filed by the defendant, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFLCIO, Council 4, Local 2663.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly confirmed the arbitrator\u2019s award granting overtime pay to commission staff attorneys because: (1) the arbitrator erroneously interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the statutory overtime exemption provided in the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, title 29 of the United States Code, \u00a7 201 et seq. (act); and (2) the arbitrator\u2019s award violated the public policy prohibiting overtime compensation for professional employees. We conclude that the trial court properly confirmed the award, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff and the defendant entered into a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) that covered the period from July 1,1994 through June 30,1999. The agreement contained provisions with respect to wages, hours and conditions of employment. The agreement also contained a provision regarding arbitration of disputes that arose under the agreement. The defendant submitted a grievance to arbitration, claiming that the plaintiff violated certain contractual provisions relating to overtime pay in general and, specifically for Veteran\u2019s Day, 1994. On September 12, 1997, the arbitrator issued its award. The arbitrator determined that the commission had violated the provisions of the agreement with regard to overtime pay and awarded overtime pay for commission staff attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an application in the trial court to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant filed an application in the trial court to confirm the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court denied the plaintiffs application to vacate the award and granted the defendant\u2019s application to confirm the award, and rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly denied its application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the arbitrator improperly had interpreted the statutory exemption provided in the act. The plaintiff contends that the arbitrator exceeded his power because the award violated the act. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the arbitration award violated \u00a7 213 (a) (1) of title 29 of the United States Code<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because it treated commission staff attorneys as hourly employees rather than as salaried employees. The defendant claims that the trial court properly granted the application to confirm the award because the award conformed to the submission. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We begin by setting forth the appropriate standard of review of arbitration awards. \u201cThe well established general rule is that [w]hen the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 185, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>211 Conn. 7, 14, 557 A.2d 1236 (1989); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 415-16, 544 A.2d 186 (1988). Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 4-5, 612 A.2d 742 (1992). Furthermore, in applying this general rule of deference to an arbitrator\u2019s award, [ejvery reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the [arbitral] award and of the arbitrators\u2019 acts and proceedings. . . . <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>237 Conn. 114, 119, 676 A.2d 825 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>254 Conn. 35, 43-44, 757 A.2d 501 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u201cWhen the parties have agreed to a procedure and have delineated the authority of the arbitrator, they must be bound by those limits. <em>Waterbury Board of Education </em>v. <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn., </em>[168 Conn. 54, 62, 357 A.2d 466 (1975)]. An application to vacate or correct an award should be granted where an arbitrator has exceeded his power. In deciding whether an arbitrator has exceeded his power, we need only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission. <em>New Britain </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>178 Conn. 557, 562, 424 A.2d 263 (1979); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 287, 291, 377 A.2d 323 (1977). A challenge of the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to a comparison of the award to the submission. . . . Where the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>on the grounds that the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved. <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Lakeridge Development Co., </em>173 Conn. 133, 135, 376 A.2d 1105 [1977].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bic Pen Corp. </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>183 Conn. 579, 584, 440 A.2d 774 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We interpret the plaintiffs argument as a claim that the arbitrator improperly interpreted the act\u2019s overtime exemption for professional employees. Although the plaintiff mentions that an award may be vacated for a manifest disregard of the law under <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 10, the plaintiffs brief does not assert that the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law. We therefore understand the plaintiffs claim simply to be that the arbitrator improperly interpreted the applicable law. Resolution of this issue depends on the scope of the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In the present case, the parties\u2019 submission to the arbitrator was voluntary pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. At oral argument before this court, both parties conceded that the submission was unrestricted. \u201c[J]udicial review of an award following an unrestricted submission is limited to whether the award conforms to the submission. <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Police Local 1159, </em>183 Conn. 102, 106, 438 A.2d 1171 (1981).\u201d <em>Wilson v. Security Ins. Group, </em>199 Conn. 618, 627, 509 A.2d 467 (1986). We, therefore, review the arbitrator\u2019s award only to the extent necessary to determine if it conforms to the submission. As the party challenging the award, the plaintiff \u201chas the burden of producing evidence sufficient to show that it does not conform to the submission.\u201d <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>210 Conn. 333, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>338-39, 555 A.2d 406 (1989). The plaintiff has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The submission to the arbitrator contained the following stipulated issues: \u201cDid the [commission] violate the provisions of Article 18, Section l<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and/or Article 27, Section 3<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the [agreement] via its method of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>pensating [commission] Staff Attorneys working overtime in general, and on November 14, 1994 (Veteran\u2019s Day) specifically? Further, did the [commission\u2019s] actions constitute a violation of Article 1, Section l;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Article 2;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and/or Article 19, Sections l<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 3?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the event of a violation, what shall be the remedy consistent with the [agreement]?\u201d The arbitrator first determined that the commission had violated the provisions of article 18, \u00a7 1, of the agreement in its compensation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>commission staff attorneys. By way of remedy, the arbitrator then awarded commission staff attorneys compensation for all hours worked beyond thirty-five hours per week, minus any hours for which compensatory time was allowed, and mandated that the relief be retroactive for thirty days prior to the date on which the grievance was filed. We conclude that the award clearly conformed to the terms of the unrestricted submission. We therefore do not review the award for the error of law claimed by the plaintiff. See <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 342, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly confirmed the award of the arbitrator because the award violates a clear public policy. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the arbitration award violates the clear public policy of prohibiting professional employees from receiving overtime compensation that is contained in the act and General Statutes \u00a7 5-245 (b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant, however, asserts that: (1) the plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of identifying a public policy contained in the act or \u00a7 5-245; and (2) even if the act and \u00a7 5-245 contain such a clear public policy, the plaintiff has not met its burden of demonstrating a clear violation of that policy. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We begin by setting forth the law that guides our analysis of the plaintiffs public policy claim. \u201cIn spite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of the general rule that challenges to an arbitrator\u2019s authority are limited to a comparison of the award to the submission, an additional challenge exists under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) when the award rendered is claimed to be in contravention of public policy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 387, AFL-CIO, </em>252 Conn. 467, 474, 747 A.2d 480 (2000). \u201c[W]hen a challenge to a voluntary arbitration award rendered pursuant to an unrestricted submission raises a legitimate and colorable claim of. violation of public policy, the question of whether the award violates public policy requires de novo judicial review. <em>Schoonmaker v. Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 429, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000). [Theplaintiffs] challenge raises such a claim. We therefore undertake de novo review of the award.\u201d <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201cThe public policy exception applies only when the award is clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong public policy. ... A challenge that an award is in contravention of public policy is premised on the fact that the parties cannot expect an arbitration award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between them. . . . When a challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s authority is made on public policy grounds, however, the court is not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator\u2019s decision but with the lawfulness of enforcing the award. . . . Accordingly, the public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and [a] court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of [collective bargaining agreements] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>erations of supposed public interests. . . . The party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated. . . . Therefore, given the narrow scope of the public policy limitation on arbitral authority, the plaintiff can prevail in the present case only if it demonstrates that the [arbitrator\u2019s] award clearly violates an established public policy mandate.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The plaintiff asserts that the federal act and the related state statute, \u00a7 5-245, embody a clear public policy prohibiting professional employees from receiving overtime. In response, the defendant argues that: (1) there is no such clear public policy prohibiting professional employees from receiving overtime; and (2) the act and \u00a7 5-245 establish minimum levels of employment benefits but allow for employees to contract for greater benefits. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The plaintiffs claim of a public policy of prohibiting overtime compensation for professional employees rests on the definition of \u201csalaried employee\u201d that is contained in \u00a7 541.118 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That section provides for the implemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tation of the act\u2019s overtime wage exemptions, which are contained in title 29 of the United States Code, \u00a7 213. Title 29 of the United States Code, \u00a7 213, exempts \u201cany employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\u201d from the provisions that guarantee overtime compensation. The Code of Federal Regulations provides: \u201cAn employee will be considered to be paid \u2018on a salary basis\u2019 within the meaning of the regulations if under his employment agreement he regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of his compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed. Subject to the exceptions provided below, the employee must receive his full salary for any week in which he performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked____\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118 (a) (2000). The definition of salaried employee includes provisions that \u201c[a]n employee will not be considered to be \u2018on a salary basis\u2019 if deductions from his predetermined compensation are made for absences occasioned by the employer or by the operating requirements of the business\u201d; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118 (a) (1) (2000); and that \u201c[d] eductions may be made . . . when the employee absents himself from work for a day or more . . . .\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118 (a) (2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The plaintiff claims that the definition of \u201csalaried employee\u201d containing references to \u201ca day or more\u201d and \u201ca day or longer\u201d; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118 (a) (2) (2000); indicates that status as a salaried employee is assumed and can be negated only by deductions in pay for absences of at least one day. It cites this narrow definition of salaried employee as evidence of the act\u2019s public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>policy prohibiting professional employees from receiving overtime compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">As the party challenging the award, the plaintiff \u201cbears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 46. The plaintiff, however, points to no specific language in the regulations to support the very narrow definition of salaried employee that it urges. The plaintiff quotes selected portions of the regulations that refer to absences of \u201ca day or more\u201d; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118 (a) (2) (2000); without clearly demonstrating that the regulations require salaried employee status to be based on deductions in pay made for absences of less than one day. The act and the minimum wage laws are remedial statutes, which are to be liberally construed. <em>Antenor </em>v. <em>D &amp; S Farms, </em>88 F.3d 925, 933 (11th Cir. 1996); <em>West </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>142 Conn. 437, 442, 115 A.2d 322 (1955). In addition, overtime exemptions are construed narrowly. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>147 Conn. 277, 283, 160 A.2d 257 (1960). We conclude, therefore, that the mere references in the Code of Federal Regulations to absences of \u201ca day or more\u201d and \u201ca day or longer\u201d; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.118 (a) (2) (2000); do not establish that the definition of salaried employee is so narrow as to demonstrate that the act incorporates a well defined or dominant public policy in favor of prohibiting professional employees from receiving overtime compensation. Moreover, even if we were to agree with the plaintiff that the regulations dictate that salaried employee status is negated only by deductions for absences of less than one day, we are unable to conclude that this definition alone demonstrates a well defined public policy in favor of prohibiting professional employees from receiving overtime compensation. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff has not met its burden of clearly demonstrating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the award conflicts with a dominant public policy of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Although the plaintiff focuses primarily on the federal regulations, an examination of the language of the federal overtime exemption statute itself; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213 (1994); also supports our conclusion that the act does not contain a clear public policy of prohibiting overtime compensation for professional employees. That statute provides in relevant part: \u201cThe provisions of section 206 (except subsection [d] in the case of paragraph [1] of this subsection) and section 207 of this title shall not apply with respect to\u2014(1) any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity . . . .\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213 (a) (1) (1994). Moreover, title 29 of the United States Code, \u00a7 207 (a) (1) (1994), requires employers to pay employees \u201cat a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate\u201d of pay for any time spent working in excess of forty hours per week. Section 207 establishes, therefore, minimum levels of overtime benefits to which employees are entitled. Section 213 merely exempts professional employees from the overtime compensation <em>mandated </em>by \u00a7 207. The explicit statutory language of \u00a7\u00a7 207 and 213 does not demonstrate a strong public policy prohibiting overtime compensation for professional employees, but merely exempts professional employees from <em>mandated </em>overtime compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the award violates the public policy underlying General Statutes \u00a7 5-245 (b), which provides in part that the provisions guaranteeing overtime compensation for state employees \u201cshall not be applied with respect to any employee employed in (1) an executive, administrative or professional capacity as such terms may be defined and delimited from time to time by the Commissioner of Administrative Services . . . .\u201d The commissioner of administrative services has not defined or delimited these terms. See Regs., Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>State Agencies \u00a7 5-245-1. In support of its argument that \u00a7 5-245 demonstrates a well defined public policy in favor of prohibiting overtime compensation for professional employees, the plaintiff asserts only that the previously quoted portion of \u00a7 5-245 is a reference to the federal statutory overtime exemption contained in the act. We interpret the plaintiffs claim, therefore, as asserting that the public policy prohibiting professional employees from overtime compensation is demonstrated in \u00a7 5-245 only insofar as \u00a7 5-245 incorporates the public policy of the act\u2019s overtime exemption. We concluded previously in part II of this opinion that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the act incorporated a well defined or dominant public policy of prohibiting overtime compensation for professional employees. Because the plaintiff points to no other authority establishing a well defined public policy behind \u00a7 5-245, we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the award clearly violated the public policy of \u00a7 5-245.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">To the extent that the plaintiff claims that the award violated public policy because the arbitrator misapplied the definition of salaried employee, we decline to undertake judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations in interpreting the terms of the contract. The arbitrator made a factual determination that commission staff attorneys are hourly, rather than salaried employees. \u201c[I]n undertaking de novo review of the plaintiffs public policy claim, we defer to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreements .... We therefore do not substitute our own reading of the contract terms for that of the arbitrator, but intervene only to the extent that those terms, as interpreted, violate a clearly established public policy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 432 n.8. The plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>demonstrating that the award violated a well defined or dominant public policy. We therefore will not substitute our own reading of the contract terms for that of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In urging that the act and \u00a7 5-245 establish a public policy prohibiting professional employees from overtime compensation, the plaintiff misconstrues these statutes. \u201cThe principal congressional purpose in enacting the [act] was to protect all covered workers from substandard wages and oppressive working hours, \u2018labor conditions [that are] detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.\u2019 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 202 (a).\u201d <em>Barrentine </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, </em>450 U.S. 728, 739, 101 S. Ct. 1437, 67 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1981). As a result, \u201c[t]he [act] sets a national \u2018floor\u2019 in terms of working conditions, in order to protect workers from the substandard wages and excessive hours .... Parties may, of course, contract for additional rights above those guaranteed by the statute.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>148 F.3d 52, 57 (2d Cir. 1998). The act is violated when employees are paid less than the amount set forth therein. Employers, however, do not violate the act when they provide employees with greater employment benefits than those required under the act. In this case, the arbitration award does not grant commission staff attorneys employment benefits that are below those required by the act. To the contrary, the arbitrator determined that commission staff attorneys are <em>contractually </em>entitled to overtime compensation benefits that exceed the minimum benefits required by the act. Therefore, even if commission staff attorneys are not guaranteed overtime compensation under the act and \u00a7 5-245, the award does not violate these acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated the public policy prohibiting overtime compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sation for professional employees because the legislature did not grant approval for paying overtime compensation to commission staff attorneys pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-278 (b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 5-278 (b) provides in part; that collective bargaining agreements \u201ctogether with a request for funds necessary to fully implement such agreement and for <em>approval of any provisions of the agreement which are in conflict with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>any statute or any regulation of any state agency, </em>and any arbitration award\u201d shall be submitted to the legislature for approval.
