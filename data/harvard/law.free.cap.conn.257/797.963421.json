The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>55 Conn. App. 630, 655, 739 A.2d 751 (1999). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>improperly admitted expert testimony regarding the ultimate issue in the ease was harmless error?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>252 Conn. 931, 746 A.2d 794 (2000). We conclude that the improperly admitted testimony was not harmless and, consequently, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cThe victim, S, was born on November 11, 1989. In 1993, the defendant lived with his mother, who is S\u2019s maternal grandmother. The defendant is the half-brother of S\u2019s mother. Also living with the defendant and his mother were S\u2019s great-grandmother and great-aunt. The defendant occupied two rooms in the house, one upstairs and one downstairs. In a downstairs room, known as \u2018David\u2019s room,\u2019 the defendant kept expensive electronic equipment and did not permit S\u2019s cousins of similar age in the room. S, however, was allowed into the defendant\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">\u201cS and her mother visited the house at least every other weekend. During [those] visits, S\u2019s mother sometimes ran errands and left S at the house while the defendant was home. During a visit in the summer of 1993, S disclosed to her grandmother that the defendant had licked her vagina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> S\u2019s grandmother repeated to her daughter, S\u2019s mother, what S had told her. Later that day, when S\u2019s father came home, S\u2019s mother told him about S\u2019s disclosure. Sometime thereafter, S disclosed to both of her parents that [the defendant] had sexually assaulted her in his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>\u201cRather than call the police, S\u2019s parents wanted to handle the incident as a family matter. A family meeting was held in September, 1993, at the home of S\u2019s parents at which the defendant, the defendant\u2019s brother and S\u2019s grandmother were present. During the meeting, S\u2019s father accused the defendant of sexually assaulting [S]. The defendant was upset about the allegations but offered to pay for S\u2019s counseling if she needed any.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">\u201cFollowing the summer of 1993, S\u2019s parents observed S acting in a sexually inappropriate manner for her age. In first grade, S began to see a counselor because of her behavior in school, where she would act inappropriately and talk about having sex. On February 6, 1996, S was evaluated [by Kimberly Herwerth, a certified child counselor with] Northeastern Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services in Willimantic, [whom] she told . . . that the defendant had had sex with her. Herwerth contacted the department of children and families and referred S to Deborah McGeehan, a clinical psychologist, for play therapy. During one of their play sessions, S told McGeehan that the defendant had sexually abused her. McGeehan testified that S\u2019s behavior during [the] play sessions was consistent with that of a child who had been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">\u201cAt trial, the defendant testified that he had been falsely accused. He testified that in the beginning of 1993, S had a tantrum in front of him after he repeatedly told her to stop poking him with a toy. The defendant also testified that in early 1993, he and S\u2019s father had a serious work-related argument that resulted in the defendant leaving his employment with S\u2019s father. The defendant maintained that he did not commit the acts with which he was charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\u201cOn November 12, 1997, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of eight years imprisonment, suspended after four years, and ten years probation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 632-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had permitted two of the state\u2019s witnesses, Herwerth and McGeehan, to testify regarding their belief that S\u2019s accusations against the defendant were credible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant that the challenged testimony had been improperly admitted, but concluded that the error was harmless. Id., 641, 643. On appeal to this court, the defendant renews his claim that the trial court improperly permitted Herwerth and McGeehan to testify regarding S\u2019s credibility and maintains that the admission of the improper testimony constituted harmful error. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The following additional relevant facts are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cOn direct examination by the state, Herwerth testified that she was a certified child counselor, advocate and interviewer who specialized in child sexual abuse. Herwerth stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>she had received extensive training in the areas of child sexual abuse, interviewing techniques and child development issues. She further testified that she had treated more than 900 children who complained of being victims of sexual assault or abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">\u201cDuring her testimony, Herwerth explained the nature of her relationship with S. In response to the state\u2019s question whether S had provided her with any details regarding the sexual assault, Herwerth testified that S had [provided details] and that \u2018[her] statements were very credible.\u2019 The defendant\u2019s objection to this testimony was overruled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u201cDuring cross-examination, after the jury was excused from the courtroom, the court reviewed the contents of a bench conference that had occurred prior to Herwerth\u2019s testimony in which defense counsel had stated that he would \u2018object to [expert] testimony on the basis of credibility and ultimate issue.\u2019 Thereafter, [the defendant] moved to strike all of Herwerth\u2019s testimony and requested a curative instruction on the ground that her testimony that \u2018[S\u2019s] statements were very credible\u2019 went to the ultimate issue and usurped the fact finder\u2019s function. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike, but directed the parties to draft proposed curative instructions. The defendant failed to provide the court with a proposed instruction as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">\u201cThe next expert witness to testify for the state was McGeehan. McGeehan testified that she was a licensed clinical psychologist who specialized in working with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>children who have been sexually abused. McGeehan stated that she had treated approximately 200 children who complained of being the victims of sexual assault or abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">\u201cDuring her testimony, McGeehan described the different types of behavioral characteristics often exhibited by children who complain of being the victims of sexual abuse. . . . [T]he state [thereafter] asked McGeehan what she was treating S for, [and] McGeehan responded that she was treating S for, inter alia, \u2018the trauma of the abuse that she experienced.\u2019 The defendant\u2019s objection to this testimony was overruled.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 634-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court instructed the jury as follows, notwithstanding its decision to overrule defense counsel\u2019s objections to the testimony of Herwerth and McGeehan: \u201cCritical to your decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>this case is the testimony of [S]. In order for you to convict the defendant, you must find her testimony is credible standing alone or when coupled with other evidence in this case is established\u2014is sufficient to establish that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The veracity of a witness is to be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">\u201cOrdinarily, our law does not permit another witness to give an opinion on the truthfulness of still another witness and that is true in this case. So, the testimony of Herwerth [and] McGeehan . . . was not presented so [either] of them could tell you her opinion of [S\u2019s] truthfulness. To the extent [that either] one of the . . . witnesses may have expressed her own opinion of [S\u2019s] truthfulness, you must not consider that opinion in coming to your decision. However, the testimony of these . . . witnesses was presented to you in order to furnish you with guidance on . . . how those deemed knowledgeable in the field evaluated sexual abuse allegations made by children. Each of these . . . witnesses testified about the methods used by her and others knowledgeable in the field to evaluate the legitimacy of such complaints or accusations by children. You heard [S\u2019s] testimony and the testimony from the so-called experts on how they and others in the field would examine and analyze what [S] had said to determine [S\u2019s] truthfulness regarding the accusations made in this case. You may use or not use it\u2014that\u2019s entirely up to you\u2014what the experts have said in deciding whether or not you believe [S\u2019s] testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The state agrees with the defendant that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion by allowing the state to elicit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>challenged testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 641, 643. We repeatedly have stated that an expert may not testify regarding the credibility of a particular victim. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ali, </em>233 Conn. 403, 432, 660 A.2d 337 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em>228 Conn. 582, 592, 637 A.2d 1088 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>227 Conn. 153, 173-74, 629 A.2d 1105 (1993). Thus, we have recognized the \u201ccritical distinction between admissible expert testimony on general or typical behavior[al] patterns of minor victims and inadmissible testimony directly concerning the particular victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 379, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). As the Appellate Court concluded, the statements of Herwerth and McGeehan reflected their view that S was telling the truth when she testified that the defendant had abused her sexually. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>supra, 640, 641-42. The Appellate Court correctly characterized Herwerth\u2019s testimony that \u201c \u2018[S\u2019s] statements were very credible\u2019 \u201d; id., 640; as \u201ca direct assertion that validated the truthfulness of S\u2019s testimony.\u201d Id., 641. With respect to McGeehan\u2019s statement that her treatment of S was for \u201c \u2018the trauma of the abuse that [she] experienced\u2019 \u201d; id., 641-42; the Appellate Court agreed that that testimony constituted \u201can indirect assertion that validated the truthfulness of S\u2019s testimony.\u201d Id., 642. The Appellate Court further noted that, although McGeehan\u2019s \u201ctestimony was not a literal statement of her belief in S\u2019s truthfulness, such testimony had the same substantive import and could be perceived as a conclusive opinion that S had testified truthfully.\u201d Id., 642-43. Thus, the testimony of Herwerth and McGeehan, to which the defendant timely objected, was improper and should have been stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The remaining question, therefore, is whether the testimony was harmful. Because the evidentiary impropriety is not constitutional in nature, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>bears the burden of demonstrating harm. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>246 Conn. 799, 812, 717 A.2d 1224 (1998). \u201cAs we recently have noted, we have not been fully consistent in our articulation of the standard for establishing harm. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shabazz, </em>246 Conn. 746, 759, 719 A.2d 440 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1179, 119 S. Ct. 1116, 143 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1999). One line of cases states that the defendant must establish that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result. . . . [E.g.] <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>242 Conn. 318, 329, 699 A.2d 911 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>236 Conn. 176, 188, 671 A.2d 1296 (1996) .... A second line of cases indicates that the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>245 Conn. 351, 371-72, 716 A.2d 36 (1998).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>supra, 812. For purposes of the present case, we need not choose between the two formulations or determine whether there is any functional difference between them because we conclude that the defendant has satisfied his burden of proving harm under either formulation of the standard. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">First, and most important, the state\u2019s case rested entirely on S\u2019s credibility. The state neither introduced physical or medical evidence of abuse nor presented any eyewitness testimony other than that of S. The state\u2019s case consisted of S\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the constancy of accusation testimony of several witnesses<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the testimony of Herwerth and McGeehan.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>the defendant testified and denied the victim\u2019s claim of abuse. The improper testimony of Herwerth and McGeehan, therefore, struck at the heart of the central\u2014indeed, the only\u2014issue in the case, namely, the relative credibility of S and the defendant. Moreover, the prejudice flowing from the improper testimony was compounded by the fact that <em>both </em>of the state\u2019s expert witnesses vouched for S\u2019s credibility. Finally, inasmuch as S\u2019s version of the events provided the only evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the state\u2019s case was not particularly strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The testimony that the state properly adduced to underscore the expert qualifications of Herwerth and McGeehan and the frequency of their contact with the victim increased the likelihood that the jury would rely on their evaluations of the victim\u2019s credibility. Herwerth stated that she had broad experience and training in the area of child sexual abuse and interviewing techniques, that she, herself, had served as a trainer in those fields, that she had treated well in excess of 900 victims of sexual abuse and that she had met with the victim on four or five separate occasions. McGeehan also testified regarding her strong professional qualifications, explaining that she had earned a doctorate degree in clinical psychology and that she had treated between 150 and 200 children who had complained of sexual abuse. McGeehan further stated that she had met with the victim approximately twenty-five times. Although the state, during closing arguments, made no mention of the challenged testimony, it did focus the jury\u2019s attention on the credentials of Herwerth and McGeehan in diagnosing and treating sexually abused children and the substantial contact that they both had with the victim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In view of Herwerth\u2019s and McGeehan\u2019s profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>sional experience and expertise, and their numerous interviews with the victim, it is reasonable to presume that the jurors likely would conclude that, if two such highly trained experts believed the victim, so should they.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">The state contends that the curative instruction that the trial court issued during its jury charge mitigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>any harm that otherwise might have resulted from the improper testimony. We acknowledge that, as a general matter, the jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s curative instructions in the absence of some indication to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>253 Conn. 210, 246, 751 A.2d 800 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>250 Conn. 526, 533, 737 A.2d 392 (1999). In the present case, however, the court did not give a curative instruction immediately following the improper testimony. Rather, the court, in the presence of the jury, <em>overruled </em>the defendant\u2019s contemporaneous objections to that testimony. Therefore, the jurors not only heard the highly damaging testimony, but also had no reason to believe that it was improper until after the close of evidence and closing arguments of counsel. By that late stage of the proceedings, it is reasonable to assume that the testimony already had made a substantial, and probably indelible, impression on the jury. To whatever extent the harm created by the improper testimony might have been mitigated by an immediate and forceful admonition by the court directing the jury to disregard the testimony, it is not likely that the prejudicial effect of the testimony was reduced significantly, if at all, by the court\u2019s untimely instruction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Furthermore, because the trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objections to the challenged testimony in the jury\u2019s presence, the curative instruction conflicted with the court\u2019s own rulings upholding the admissibility of the testimony. In light of the inconsistency between the court\u2019s rulings admitting the testimony and the court\u2019s general instruction indicating that testimony of that sort is not appropriate for consideration by the jury, it is difficult to see how the instruction would have had its intended curative effect. Indeed, in the improbable event that the instruction had any effect on the jurors, it most likely would have been to create confusion regarding the manner in which they were to treat the improper testimony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Although \u201c[w]e have always given great weight to curative instructions in assessing claimed errors\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>254 Conn. 739, 773, 760 A.2d 82 (2000); we also \u201chave recognized that a curative instruction is not inevitably sufficient to overcome the prejudicial impact of [inadmissible] evidence . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 535; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Girolamo, </em>197 Conn. 201, 208, 496 A.2d 948 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>192 Conn. 618, 633, 473 A.2d 1200 (1984). In light of the circumstances under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the curative instruction was given in this case, and inasmuch as the state\u2019s case was predicated entirely on S\u2019s version of the events, we are not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s curative instruction was adequate to ameliorate the substantial prejudice that necessarily resulted from the inadmissible testimony of Herwerth and McGeehan vouching for S\u2019s credibility. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to that court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

And what type of interviewing techniques were you using with [S]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201c[Herwerth]: I\u2019ve been trained to do\u2014it\u2019s considered a cognitive interview. It\u2019s basically to elicit facts. It\u2019s fact-finding, it\u2019s not therapeutic. It\u2019s an interview that is nonleading and it\u2019s objective questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: And did [S] tell you that she had been the victim of a sexual assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-10\">\u201c[Herwerth]: Yes. [S] told me that she had had sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-11\">\u201c[Assistant.

And did she provide you with any details regarding this alleged sexual assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-16\">\u201c[Herwerth]: Yes.

These are people who\u2014and again, I mean this with no disrespect: If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it\u2019s got to be a duck.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\"> Mental health experts frequently play a critical role in child sexual abuse cases due, in large measure, to the tender age of the victim, the abhorrence with which jurors are likely to view the alleged crime and the fact that such abuse is seldom undertaken in the presence of witnesses. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 460, 758 A.2d 824 (2000). We agree, moreover, with the following observations of the Vermont Supreme Court: \u201cThroughout the interviewing process, the mental health professional is not simply an investigator, but a sympathetic member of a helping profession and a healer. As a result of the complex and special relationship that the expert has with the victim before the case comes to trial, what the jury ends up seeing is not a \u2018hired gun\u2019\u2014the prototypical expert paid one day by a plaintiff, [the] next day by a defendant, to take different sides on controversial issues, and who maybe impeached by this very quality. Rather, the jury sees a concerned therapist who has examined the child, believed her, and is probably currently engaged in her recovery process.Asa result, the jury may reach the unspoken but unmistakable conclusion that the expert\u2019s recounting of the assault is the way it happened, aversion often more persuasive than even that presented by the child herself. Consequently, a juror, hearing a mental health expert testily that in the course of examining the child she told a story of abuse and named her abuser, will naturally conclude that the expert placed faith in the account. Certainly, a reasonable juror would be hard pressed to conclude otherwise. ... In short, when credibility is in issue, the risk that jurors will abdicate their responsibility to assess the victim\u2019s credibility by inferring that an examining psychologist believed the patient is too apparent to pass off as minimal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wetherbee, </em>156 Vt. 425, 434-37, 594 A.2d 390 (1991). It, therefore, is especially important in child sexual abuse cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>that the trial court remain committed to ensuring that the jury is not tainted by improper expert testimony regarding the credibility of the child victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\"> In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, the Appellate Court noted that, because the improper testimony regarding S\u2019s credibility was not prompted by questions specifically designed to elicit such testimony, \u201cthe validating effect that [the] statements might have had on S\u2019s credibility was limited.\u201d <em>State v. Grenier, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 644. We agree with the Appellate Court that the questions posed by the state were not designed to elicit the responses that they did. We disagree, however, that the form of those questions has any substantial bearing on the extent or degree of the prejudice that flowed from the answers. Our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim does not depend on the precise context in which the improper testimony was given, but, rather, the substance of that testimony. It is undisputed that the statements constituted inadmissible opinion evidence regarding the credibility of the state\u2019s only eyewitness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\"> We note, moreover, that the curative instruction was not as clear as it could have been. Although the court did explain that the jury should not consider any opinion testimony on S\u2019s credibility, the court thereafter stated: \u201cYou heard [S\u2019s] testimony and the testimony from the so-called experts on how they and others in the field would examine and analyze what [S] had said to determine [S\u2019s] truthfulness regarding accusations made in this case. You may use or not use it\u2014that\u2019s entirely up to you\u2014what the experts have said in deciding whether or not you believe [S\u2019s] testimony.\u201d These two sentences are not helpful insofar as they may be construed as underscoring the link between S\u2019s credibility and Herwerth\u2019s and McGeehan\u2019s improper testimony regarding S\u2019s credibility. Furthermore, the jury reasonably could have construed the last sentence of the instruction as approval for it to consider the improper testimony in assessing S\u2019s credibility. The defendant, however, did not object to the curative instruction as given.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
