We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cOn September 2, 1995, Linda Alexander lived at 30 Chapel Street in New London. On that day, Joseph Thompson was found dead on her bathroom floor, having been killed by a single gunshot wound to the head. The police seized two cigar blunts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a nine millimeter spent shell casing in the bathtub.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\u201cThat evening, the defendant was involved in the shooting death of Wade Denson in Brooklyn, New York. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The following day, September 3, 1995, Brooklyn detectives went to a Brooklyn apartment in an attempt to apprehend the defendant for Denson\u2019s murder. As the detectives were attempting to enter the apartment, the defendant and his brother fled out a back window and, after a short chase, were apprehended. While they were being pursued by the detectives, a nine millimeter handgun fell from the defendant\u2019s pants. The detectives seized the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u201cSoon after his arrest, the defendant provided the Brooklyn detectives with two statements. The first statement pertained to the shooting death of Denson in Brooklyn. In that statement, the defendant stated that he, Denson and a third person were smoking a blunt. When the blunt was passed to Denson, he dropped it on the floor. The defendant told Denson that he must pick it up and pass it without taking his turn. Denson refused to comply and took his turn anyway. The defendant then pointed the nine millimeter handgun at him. Although the defendant did not recall firing the gun, he fled the apartment immediately after the incident, and Denson was found dead from a gunshot wound a few hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u201cThe second statement concerned the shooting death of Thompson, which had occurred in New London just a few hours before Denson was killed in Brooklyn. In his statement, the defendant mentioned that he remembered pointing his gun at Thompson but did not remember it going off. The jury could have found from the testimony of one of the detectives, that the defendant, Ronald [Gadsden] and Thompson were smoking a blunt in Alexander\u2019s bathroom when Thompson dropped [the blunt]. Although blunt smoking protocol required that he pass it without taking his turn, Thompson disregarded the custom and took his turn anyway. This angered the defendant and caused him to point the handgun at Thompson. The defendant did not remem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ber firing the gun, but after the incident he and [Gadsden] immediately left for New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s version of the events is that the shooting was completely accidental. He claims that he wanted to show his friends his gun and as he pulled it out of his pants to show it to them, it discharged, killing Thompson. Not knowing what to do, he and [Gadsden] ran out of the house and made their way to New York.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>59 Conn. App. 484, 485-87, 757 A.2d 639 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">At trial, Gadsden, the only witness to the events giving rise to the murder charge against the defendant, successfully invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant claimed that Gadsden\u2019s testimony would exculpate him of the charges and was, thus, necessary to his defense. Accordingly, the defendant moved to have the trial court order the state either to grant immunity to Gadsden, or, in the alternative, dismiss the charges. The defendant also requested that the trial court itself grant immunity to Gadsden. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request, finding that it had no power to immunize the witness or to force the prosecution to do so. Thereafter, a jury convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming, in part, that the trial court improperly had denied his request to order the state either to grant immunity to Gadsden or, in the alternative, to dismiss the charges. The Appellate Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. Id., 490. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The defendant contends that Gadsden\u2019s testimony would have corroborated the defendant\u2019s defense at trial, which was that the shooting had been accidental. The defendant further claims that, when Gadsden successfully invoked his fifth amendment privilege at trial, the defendant\u2019s state<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and federal constitutional rights to due process and compulsory process required that Gadsden be given immunity or that the charges be dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">As a threshold matter, we must first determine the applicable standard of review that governs our examination of the defendant\u2019s claims. The issue of whether a defendant\u2019s rights to due process and compulsory process require that a defense witness be granted immunity is a question of law and, thus, is subject to de novo review. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>897 F.2d 1169, 1190-92 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845, 111 S. Ct. 130, 112 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1990) (engaging in de novo review of defendant\u2019s claim that due process and compulsory process required that defense witness be immunized).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201c[A] defendant has a right under the compulsory process and due process clauses \u2018to present [his] version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so [that] it may decide where the truth lies.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 685 n.9, 701 A.2d 1 (1997), quoting <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967). The compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment generally affords an accused the \u201cright to call witnesses whose testimony is material and favorable to his defense . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52, 107 S. Ct. 2704, 97 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1987). The defendant claims that his rights to due process and compulsory process required that Gadsden be granted immunity because he would offer testimony exculpatory to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We begin our analysis with the statutory provision concerning prosecutorial immunity for witnesses. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> authorizes the prosecution to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>grant immunity to state witnesses under certain circumstances. We explicitly have held that \u00a7 54-47a confers no such authority upon the courts with regard to defense witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 210-11, 365 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 1732, 48 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1976). Indeed, this court has held repeatedly that there is no authority, statutory or otherwise, enabling a trial court to grant immunity to defense witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McIver, </em>201 Conn. 559, 566-68, 518 A.2d 1368 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em>172 Conn. 542, 561, 375 A.2d 1014, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 855, 98 S. Ct. 174, 54 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>supra, 210-11. We have no occasion to revisit those holdings today.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We recognize that other courts have held that under certain compelling circumstances the rights to due process and compulsory process under the federal constitution require the granting of immunity to a defense witness. The federal Circuit Courts of Appeals have developed two theories pursuant to which the due process and compulsory process clauses entitle defense witnesses to a grant of immunity. They are the \u201c \u2018effective defense\u2019 \u201d theory, and the \u201c \u2018prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>misconduct\u2019 \u201d theory. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>supra, 897 F.2d 1190. Because such circumstances are not presented in this case, however, we need not decide whether either theory is a correct application of the due process or compulsory process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Under the effective <em>defense </em>theory, as developed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the trial court has the authority to grant immunity to a defense witness \u201cwhen it is found that a potential defense witness can offer testimony which is clearly exculpatory and essential to the defense case and when the government has no strong interest in withholding . . . immunity . . . .\u201d <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>615 F.2d 964, 974 (3d Cir. 1980); see generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucas, 12 Cal. 4th </em>415, 460, 907 P.2d 373, 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 525 (1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 838, 117 S. Ct. 114, 136 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1996). The Third Circuit has held explicitly that under the effective defense theory \u201c[i]mmunity will be denied if the proffered testimony is found to be ambiguous [or] not clearly excuplatory . . . .\u201d <em>Government, of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 972. Because the defendant in the present case has not shown that Gadsden\u2019s testimony would be exculpatory, the effective defense theory of immunity, even if recognized, would not apply to this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">At trial, Gadsden successfully invoked his fifth amendment privilege to not testify. Thus, the only indication of the likely substance of his testimony is an unsigned statement that he had given to a detective of the New York police department after the defendant\u2019s arrest on murder charges there. A fair reading of that statement reveals that it was not exculpatory as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defendant. In fact, several aspects of the statement were inculpatory to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The statement provided to the police begins: \u201cI am in the New York police department 76[th] precinct detective office. I am afraid of [the defendant]. I don\u2019t know where his head is, he is just zoning since he doesn\u2019t take his medication.\u201d After describing the events leading up to the shooting of Thompson, Gadsden stated: \u201cFor no reason [the defendant] shot [Thompson]. I heard the shot, and [Thompson] fell to the floor .... [The defendant] said to me, \u2018Come on, we gotta leave.\u2019 I asked [the defendant] why he did it, and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, son.\u2019 That\u2019s why I think he really went crazy.\u201d At the end of the statement, the detective who took Gadsden\u2019s statement wrote: \u201cGadsden stated [that] if he signed [the] statement [the defendant] would know, and retaliate. Gadsden [was] terrified. He did not want to leave [the] precinct house.\u201d A fair reading of Gadsden\u2019s statement indicates that his testimony at trial would not <em>clearly </em>exculpate the defendant. We conclude, therefore, that even if we recognized the effective defense theory, the defendant has failed to satisfy the requisite burden of proof under the theory that would warrant its application in this case. See <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. Smith, supra, 615 F.2d 972, 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The defendant would fare no better under the prosecutorial misconduct theory of immunity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This theory is based on the notion that \u201cthe due process clause [constrains] the prosecutor to a certain extent in her decision to grant or not to grant immunity.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>supra, 897 F.2d 1191. Under this theory, however, the constraint imposed by the due process clause is operative only when the prosecution engages in certain types of misconduct. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 115 (2d Cir. 1999) (court must find that \u201cthe government, through its own overreaching, has forced the witness to invoke the Fifth Amendment or, that the government has engaged in [the] discriminatory use of grants of immunity to gain a tactical advantage; second, the witness\u2019 testimony must be material, exculpatory and not cumulative; and third, the defendant has no other source to obtain the evidence\u201d); <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>124 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1997) (defendant must show that prosecution has intentionally distorted fact-finding process by harassing or intimidating potential witnesses or deliberately withholding immunity for purpose of hiding exculpatory evidence from jury); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>200 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 885, 121 S. Ct. 202, 148 L. Ed. 2d 141 (2000); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>848 F.2d 785, 799 (7th Cir. 1988); <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 615 F.2d 968-69;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Carter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>684 A.2d 331, 341 (D.C. 1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>532 N.W.2d 813, 822 (Iowa App. 1995).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The defendant has not claimed that the prosecution engaged in impropriety or misconduct of any kind. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim would fail under the prosecutorial misconduct theory of immunity as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a.-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-13\"> \u201cAt trial, a blunt was defined as a hollowed-out cigar with marijuana placed inside of it.\u201d <em>State v. Holmes, </em>59 Conn. App. 484, 485 n.2, 757 A.2d 639 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> We granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the defendant\u2019s right to due process and compulsory process require the state to either immunize a defense witness or to have the case against the defendant dismissed?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>254 Conn. 939, 761 A.2d 763 (2000). We note that the certified question may not be broad enough to cover the issue before the court. The defendant, at trial, requested that the trial court require the state to grant immunity to the defense witness or, in the alternative, dismiss the case. The defendant also requested that the trial court itself either grant immunity to the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>witness or dismiss the charges against the defendant. We thus construe the certified issue broadly so as to encompass all of the defendant\u2019s claims on this issue insofar as they were raised in his briefs and at oral argument. See <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>244 Conn. 523, 527 n.3, 710 A.2d 757 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\"> Because the defendant has not briefed adequately his state constitutional claims under the six factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-85, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), we decline to review his state constitutional claims. \u201cWe have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the [party] has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 721, 631 A.2d 288 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b270-11\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments, provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to have compulsory process to obtain witnesses in his behalf . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a provides: \u201c(a) Whenever in the judgment of the Chief State\u2019s Attorney, a state\u2019s attorney or the deputy chief state\u2019s attorney, the testimony of any witness or the production of books, papers or other evidence of any witness (1) in any criminal proceeding involving narcotics, arson, bribery, gambling', election law violations, felonious crimes of violence, any violation which is an offense under the provisions of title 22a, corruption in the executive, legislative or judicial branch of state government or in the government of any political subdivision of the state, fraud by a vendor of goods or services in the medical assistance program under Title XIX of the Social Security Act amendments of 1965, as amended, any violation of chapter 949c, or any other class A, B or C felony or unclassified felony punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of five years for which the Chief State\u2019s Attorney or state\u2019s attorney demonstrates that he has no other means of obtaining sufficient information as to whether a crime has been committed or the identity of the person or persons who may have committed a crime, before a court or grand jury of this state or (2) in any investigation conducted by an investigatory grand jury as provided in sections 54-47b to 54-47g, inclusive, is necessary to the public interest, the Chief State\u2019s Attorney, the state\u2019s attorney, or the deputy chief state\u2019s attorney, may, with notice to the witness, after the witness has claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, make application to the court for an order directing the witness to testily or produce evidence subject to the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u201c(b) Upon the issuance of the order such witness shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books, papers or other evidence in such case or proceeding on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>supra, 897 F.2d 1191.

See id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\"> This approach differs from the effective defense theory in two important respects. First, the focus of the inquiry is on the conduct of the prosecutor, rather than on the defendant\u2019s need for the evidence. See <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 615 F.2d 969-70. Second, the defendant\u2019s remedy under the prosecutorial misconduct theory is not a judicial grant of immunity; instead, the trial court requires that the state give the witness immunity, or, in the alternative, dismiss the charges against the defendant. See id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit employs both the effective defense theoiy and the prosecutorial misconduct theory.
