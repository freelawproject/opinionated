The plaintiff, Carol Collins, was injured in a multicar accident, and brought an action against the defendants, Raymond A. Sardinas and Raymond D. Sardinas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and her uninsured motorist carrier, the named defendant Colonial Penn Insurance Company (Colonial Penn), alleging negligence on the part of both the defendant and the unidentified driver of another vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a settlement was reached with Colonial Penn, and a jury verdict subsequently was rendered against the defendant, the trial court, <em>Melville, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motions for remittitur, to set aside the verdict, and for collateral source reduction. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. On November 14, 1994, the plaintiff sustained personal injuries and damage to her vehicle from a three car chain reaction collision. The accident arose as a result of an unidentified hit-and-run driver striking the defendant\u2019s vehicle, which in turn caused the defendant\u2019s vehicle to strike the plaintiffs vehicle in the rear while it was stopped at a traffic signal. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant and Colonial Penn. The plaintiffs complaint alleged negligence on the part of both the defendant and the unidentified driver. Specifically, the plaintiff sought to recover damages from the defendant and Colonial Penn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Four days after the jury trial commenced, the plaintiff withdrew her action against Colonial Penn after settling for $95,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial proceeded against the defendant. After the close of evidence and the conclusion of a charge conference, but before closing arguments, the defendant submitted a memorandum of law asking the trial court to instruct the jury that negligence and damages should be apportioned between the defendant and Colonial Penn pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>In addition, the defendant asked the court to submit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>verdict form to the jury that would have allowed it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>apportion the percentage of negligence and damages found in the event of a plaintiffs verdict. After hearing argument on whether apportionment applied to uninsured motorist benefits, the trial court concluded that it would not charge the jury or submit jury interrogatories on the issue of apportionment because the claim would fail procedurally and substantively.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>declined to permit this issue to be inserted into the case at that late date and further ordered counsel not to discuss the issue during closing arguments. Thereafter, the trial court charged the jury that, if it found the defendant liable for negligence, it was to award \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d damages. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $86,340.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The defendant then filed a motion for remittitur pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a motion to set aside the verdict pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-228b,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 52-572h (f) and (n)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the common law, and a motion for collateral source reduction pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-225a.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>that, in order to prevent a double recovery, there should be a setoff reducing the jury award for the plaintiff by the amount of the settlement that the plaintiff had received from Colonial Penn, and, in the alternative, that the principles of apportionment should have been applied pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h. The trial court denied these motions, concluding that the principles of apportionment did not apply to uninsured motorist settlements. The trial court also concluded that the plaintiff had not received a double recovery and that, although the plaintiff may have come out better than she would have if there had not been an unidentified driver, equitable principles prevented the court from allowing the defendant, as a tortfeasor, rather than the plaintiff, from taking advantage of the settlement. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">This appeal raises the following issues: (1) whether the trial court improperly afforded the plaintiff a double recovery when it refused to deduct from the jury verdict rendered against the defendant the amount recovered under the antecedent settlement with Colonial Penn; and (2) whether the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury regarding the issue of apportionment. We conclude that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury regarding the issue of apportionment. Because our resolution of the apportionment issue disposes of the appeal, we decline to address the double recovery issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury on the issue of apportionment of liability between the defendant and the unidentified driver. Thus, a precise construction of the issue before this court is whether the trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h, should have instructed the jury to apportion liability between Colonial Penn, which previously had settled, and the remaining defendant, whom the jury found liable for damages. As correctly recognized by the trial court, this issue was not properly preserved.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 219-20, 682 A.2d 106 (1996); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s statutory claim, however, falls under the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\u201cBecause statutory interpretation is a question of law, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>232 Conn. 392, 396, 655 A.2d 759 (1995). \u201cWell settled principles of statutory interpretation govern our review. When we construe a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law. . . . <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). We construe each sentence, clause or phrase to have a purpose behind it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 346, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992). In addition, we presume that the legislature intends sensible results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>from the statutes it enacts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 165, 496 A.2d 186 (1985). Therefore, we read each statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results. . . . <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 319, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). . . . <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, 583-84, 726 A.2d 502 (1999).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>254 Conn. 348, 357-58, 757 A.2d 549 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of the evolution of tort law in this state regarding the apportionment of damages among multiple tortfeasors. Prior to October 1,1986, this state followed the rules of joint and several liability with no contribution among joint tortfeasors. Stated briefly: \u201cIf the illegal conduct of each of the defendants was a proximate cause of the collision, they would be liable jointly and severally, the plaintiff would have a right to recover the entire amount of damages awarded from either, and, if he did so, the defendant paying them would have no right of contribution against the other; or the plaintiff might have sued either alone, and of course in the event of a recovery, that one would have been compelled to pay the entire amount of damages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>234 Conn. 660, 666, 662 A.2d 1269 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Under the common law of joint and several liability, therefore, even a defendant whose degree of fault was comparatively small could be held responsible for the entire amount of damages, so long as his negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. \u201cThus, the plaintiff could collect the entire amount of his judgment from the richest defendant, or from the defendant with the deepest pocket.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>In response largely to these concerns, the legislature undertook to reform the tort recovery provisions of our civil system, by enacting No. 86-338 of the 1986 Public Acts (Tort Reform I), which took effect October 1,1986. Tort Reform I replaced the common-law rule of joint and several liability with a system of apportioned liability, holding each defendant liable for only his or her proportionate share of damages. Specifically, \u00a7 3 (f) of Tort Reform I provided that each defendant initially would be liable for only that percentage of his negligence that \u201cproximately caused the injury, in relation to one hundred per cent, that is attributable to each person whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the damages . . . .\u201d Therefore, under Tort Reform I, the jury, in determining the percentage of negligence attributable to any defendant, could take into account the negligence of any other person, regardless of whether that person was a party to the action. \u201cTort Reform I, however, did not provide the plaintiff with a means of securing payment of damages unless that person was also a party.\u201d <em>Dormer </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\u201cUnder Tort Reform I, to avoid the possibility that a jury would find that the negligence of a nonparty was aprox\u00edmate cause of [the plaintiffs] injuries, [the] plaintiff was required to name as defendants all persons whose actions suggested even the slightest hint of negligence. The unwanted practical effect, therefore, was that plaintiffs were required to pursue claims of weak liability against third parties, thereby fostering marginal and costly litigation in our courts. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\u201cThe legislature amended these tort recovery provisions just one year later when it enacted No. 87-227 of the 1987 Public Acts (Tort Reform II), the pertinent provisions of which now are codified in part under \u00a7 52-572h. These revisions, which took effect October 1, 1987, altered the class of individuals to whom the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>could look in determining whose negligence had been aprox\u00edmate cause of a plaintiff s injuries. In short, these revisions changed the focus of this class of negligent individuals from any person to any party and certain other identifiable persons. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (c), (d), (f) [and] (n). Thus, while Tort Reform I provided that the jury, in determining the percentage of responsibility of a particular defendant, could also consider the entire universe of negligent persons, Tort Reform II limited this universe to only those individuals who were parties to the legal action or who were specifically identified in \u00a7 52-572h (n).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eskin </em>v. <em>Castiglia, </em>253 Conn. 516, 525-26, 753 A.2d 927 (2000). Thus, the provisions set forth in \u00a7 52-572h establish two classes of persons whose negligence must be considered by the trier of fact: (1) the parties to the action; and (2) settled or released persons, as the term is defined in subsection (n).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Against this legislative landscape, we now consider whether, pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h, the jury in the present case should have been instructed to apportion liability between Colonial Penn, which previously had settled with the plaintiff, and the remaining defendant, whom the jury found liable for damages. The defendant argues that the juiy should have been instructed to apportion liability between the defendant and the unidentified driver pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h. Specifically, the defendant relies upon subsection (n) of \u00a7 52-572h, which provides that, although the settled or released person is discharged from all liability for contribution, the total award of damages is to be \u201creduced by the amount of the released person\u2019s percentage of negligence determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.\u201d Furthermore, the defendant argues that Colonial Penn was acting as a surrogate for the unidentified driver because it was brought into the dispute solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>to litigate the unidentified driver\u2019s negligence. Therefore, the defendant argues, the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury to apportion liability pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (n). In response, the plaintiff contends that no apportionment is allowed in an uninsured motorist action for the conduct of an unidentified driver. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that apportionment is available only in actions sounding in negligence, and that because her claim against Colonial Penn was a contract action, apportionment would have been improper. In support of her claim, the plaintiff relies on \u00a7 52-572h (o) for the proposition that there is no apportionment of liability or damages between parties liable for negligence and parties liable \u201con any basis other than negligence . . . .\u201d Because the plaintiffs claim against Colonial Penn had its basis in contract, rather than negligence, the plaintiff argues, no apportionment was required. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">An uninsured motorist claim may be brought in a multitortfeasor context so long as one of the tortfeasors is uninsured, or if one of the putative tortfeasors is unidentified, or the insurance coverage of one of the tortfeasors has been exhausted. See <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, 213, 603 A.2d 385 (1992). Traditionally, an action against an uninsured motorist carrier is one for insurance benefits and not for damages per se. <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 384-85, 698 A.2d 859 (1997); <em>Mazziotti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., 240 </em>Conn. 799, 817, 695 A.2d 1010 (1997). We previously have held, however, that in certain contexts, because of the \u201chybrid\u201d nature of uninsured motorist coverage, the uninsured carrier operates in part as a \u201csurrogate\u201d for the financially irresponsible tortfeasor. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>243 Conn. 17, 25, 26 nn.9 and 10, 699 A.2d 964 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>In <em>Haynes, </em>we addressed the issue of whether payments made pursuant to an underinsured motorist policy should be treated as a common-law collateral source.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 22-23. We held that underinsured motorist benefits were not collateral sources, and we recognized the long-standing principle that an injured party may recover just damages for the same loss only once. Id., 28-31. In <em>Haynes, </em>a panel of arbitrators had determined that the plaintiffs claim against the underinsured motorist carrier was worth $650,000. The plaintiff made a full recovery of $650,000, receiving $630,000 from the underinsured motorist carrier, and $20,000, which the plaintiff already had recovered from the tortfeasor driver. Id., 20-21. On appeal, this court invoked the principle of double recovery and declined to permit the plaintiff to recover additional damages from the hospital and physicians who also allegedly had committed negligence. Id., 27-30. We reiterated the principle that the plaintiff may not be compensated twice where full recovery already had been made. Id., 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Our holding in <em>Haynes </em>acknowledged that underinsured motorist payments are not purely contractual in nature because such payments \u201coperate in part as a liability insurance surrogate for the underinsured motorist third party tortfeasor.\u201d Id., 25. We recognized that \u201cunderinsured motorist benefits are sui generis. They are contractual, but they depend on principles of tort liability and damages. Whether in any particular case underinsured motorist benefits should be treated as are other types of insurance must depend on a case-by-case analysis of the underlying purpose and the principles that apply to such benefits.\u201d Id., 24. With regard to uninsured motorist benefits, therefore, we noted that the issue was whether such proceeds should be treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>as a collateral source in each factual context. Id., 27. We concluded that, because the uninsured motorist carrier stepped into the shoes of, and acted as a surrogate for, the unidentified tortfeasor for purposes of characterizing payments under the uninsured motorist carrier, the relationship between the \u201cunderinsured motorist carrier and the defendant may be viewed as analogous to that of joint tortfeasors, and thus that the general tort rule precluding double recovery from joint tortfeasors should apply.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">When examining \u00a7 52-572h, we must address not just whether a remand for apportionment is required, but how the plaintiffs settlement with Colonial Penn should be treated. In resolving the present dispute, it is important to understand the distinction between a jury award and a settlement. Unlike in <em>Haynes, </em>the plaintiff in the present case received a prior settlement award, not a prior arbitration award. Moreover, <em>Haynes </em>involved only common-law principles, rather than \u00a7 52-572h. Subsection (n) of \u00a7 52-572h provides that \u201cthe total award of damages is reduced by the amount of the <em>released person\u2019s percentage </em>of negligence determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The underlying rationale of subsection (n) is that, rather than a settlement reducing the amount of the jury or arbitration award dollar-for-dollar, as occurred in <em>Haynes, </em>the amount of the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>is reduced by the settling party\u2019s percentage of negligence. Thus, if a claimant settles with one potential tortfeasor, the plaintiff is allowed to keep the amount of that settlement, but the award against the remaining tortfeasor is reduced by the percentage of negligence attributable to the settling tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-225b<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> specifically provides that \u201c \u2018[collateral sources\u2019 do not include amounts received by . . . settlement.\u201d We affirmed this principle in <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Yap, </em>247 Conn. 638, 654, 726 A.2d 92 (1999). In <em>Nash, </em>although decided pursuant to Tort Reform I, rather than Tort Refoim II, we noted that the statutory collateral source doctrine rested on the rule against double recovery, and that, \u201c[u]nder Tort Reform I, but not under Tort Reform II, settlements are treated as deductible collateral sources.\u201d Id., 649. Therefore, under Tort Refoim II, because settlements are not collateral sources, the jury\u2019s allocation of the settled person\u2019s percentage of liability measured against the total amount of the plaintiffs total damages, as stated in the jury award, determines whether the plaintiff will receive a windfall or a shortfall.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A plaintiffs settlement with one tortfeasor in a multitortfeasor context, however, does not necessarily represent a claimant\u2019s fair, just and reasonable damages but, rather, represents, in part, the parties\u2019 assessments of the risks of litigation. Once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>having undertaken to bargain regarding those risks, the plaintiff receives the benefit or burden of the settlement. Our interpretation in the present case reaffirms our recognition of the public policy of encouraging settlements of claims. <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>ECAP Construction Co., </em>250 Conn. 553, 560-61, 737 A.2d 398 (1999) (\u201cbroad public policy considerations favor pretrial resolution of disputes between contracting parties\u201d); <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 759, 687 A.2d 506 (1997) (recognizing legitimate public policy interest of encouraging pretrial settlement of claims). The plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to keep the proceeds of the settlement with Colonial Penn.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Having clarified that the plaintiff is entitled to retain the settlement proceeds, we now address whether the remaining defendant is required to pay the entire amount of the fair, just and reasonable damages assessed by the jury for the injury that occurred. Resolution of this issue requires a close examination of \u00a7 52-572h. The pertinent provisions of \u00a7 52-572h provide in relevant part: \u201c(c) In a negligence action to recover damages resulting from personal injury, wrongful death or damage to property occurring on or after October 1,1987, if the damages are determined to be proximately caused by the negligence of more than one party, <em>each party </em>against whom recovery is allowed shall be liable to the claimant only for such party\u2019s proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and the recoverable noneconomic damages except as provided in subsection (g) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u201c(d) The proportionate share of damages for which each party is liable is calculated by multiplying the recoverable . . . damages by a fraction in which the numerator is the party\u2019s percentage of negligence, which percentage shall be determined pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, and the denominator is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>total of the percentages of negligence, which percentages shall be determined pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, to be attributable to all parties whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the injury . . . <em>including settled or released persons under subsection (n) of this section. </em>Any percentage of negligence attributable to the claimant shall not be included in the denominator of the fraction. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">\u201c(f) The jury or, if there is no jury, the court shall specify . . . the percentage of negligence that proximately caused the injury, death or damage to property in relation to one hundred per cent, that is attributable to <em>each party </em>whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the injury, death or damage to property <em>including settled or released persons </em>under subsection (n) of this section ....</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\u201c(n) . . . [T]he total award of damages is reduced by the amount of the <em>released person's percentage </em>of negligence determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">\u201c(o) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, there shall be no apportionment of liability or damages between parties liable for negligence and parties liable on any basis other than negligence including, but not limited to, intentional, wanton or reckless misconduct, strict liability or liability pursuant to any cause of action created by statute, except that liability may be apportioned among patties liable for negligence in any cause of action created by statute based on negligence including ... an action for injuries caused by a motor vehicle owned by the state pursuant to section 52-556.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">We recognize that the damages sustained by a claimant may be caused by the negligence of more than one tortfeasor under \u00a7 52-572h. Also, it is important to note that the purpose of \u00a7 52-572h was to change the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>mon law of joint and several liability such that a defendant would be liable only for that portion of the damages\u2019 for which he was responsible.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In order to be consistent with both the language and the underlying policy of \u00a7 52-572h, this is a case where we acknowledge, as we did in <em>Haynes, </em>the sui generis nature of uninsured motorist benefits. Colonial Penn acted, in part, as a surrogate for the third party tortfeasor as well as a party against whom the plaintiff maintained a first party contract claim. See <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 26-31. In the present case, Colonial Penn was not only a named, identifiable party in the original complaint, but its function in this case was to litigate the blameworthiness of the unidentified hit-and-run driver. That is, its liability in the uninsured motorist contract was predicated on the negligence of the phantom driver. Id., 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The plaintiff, in her complaint, linked the cause of her damages not only to the negligence of the defendant, but also to the negligence of the unidentified driver when it named Colonial Penn as a defendant. Specifically, the plaintiffs complaint against Colonial Penn alleged that: \u201cThe injuries and damages suffered by the plaintiff were the result of the negligence and carelessness of the unidentified motor vehicle operator in that the unidentified operator failed to keep a proper lookout; the unidentified operator failed to properly brake his/her vehicle or take other evasive actions, so as to avoid a collision; in that he/she failed to keep his/her vehicle under proper control . . . .\u201d As to the defendant, the complaint stated: \u201cIn addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>negligence and carelessness of the unidentified motor vehicle operator, the injuries and damages sustained by the plaintiff were the result of the negligence and carelessness of the defendant . . . .\u201d It is clear that, not only was the cause of action against Colonial Penn based on the negligence of the unidentified driver, but that the plaintiff affirmatively alleged that the unidentified driver and the defendant caused her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">During trial, Colonial Penn, acting as a surrogate for the unidentified tortfeasor, settled its claim with the plaintiff for $95,000. Thereafter, the jury assessed the plaintiffs fair, just and reasonable damages in the amount of $86,340. Because the jury was not instructed to allocate the unidentified driver\u2019s percentage of negligence, pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (n), however, we do not know the percentage of liability that the remaining defendant is responsible for and what percentage of negligence can be attributed to the unidentified driver.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To require the defendant to pay the entire amount of damages assessed by the jury in this multitortfeasor situation without apportionment, taking place essentially would be a reversion to the common law of joint and several liability, which was abolished by Tort Reform I and Tort Reform II, and in particular, by \u00a7 52-572h.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Our conclusion is also consistent with subsection (f) of \u00a7 52-572h. Subsection (f) (4) of \u00a7 52-572h provides that the jury is required to specify the percentage of negligence that is \u201cattributable to each parly whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the injury, death or damage to property <em>including settled or released persons under subsection (n) of this section </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this case, the jury was not given an opportunity to allocate liability regarding the defendant or the settled party\u2019s percentage of negligence. Although the plaintiff relies on <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Yap, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 642, for the proposition that the defendant is required to pay the jury determination of damages and that the plaintiff also retains any prior settlements, the proposition overlooks that in <em>Nash, </em>unlike in the present case, the jury had allocated the percentage of negligence of three tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Moreover, the plaintiffs reliance on \u00a7 52-572h (o), as amended by No. 99-96 of the 1999 Public Acts, which provides that \u201cthere shall be no apportionment of liability or damages between parties liable for negligence and parties liable on any basis other than negligence,\u201d for the proposition that apportionment is not required because her claim against Colonial Penn was based on contract, not negligence, is misplaced. The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>argument ignores the nature of the complaint filed as described in the preceding paragraphs. The uninsured motorist statutes and regulations incorporate the negligence law of liability and damages involving claims where joint tortfeasors are present. The uninsured motorist statute, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (l),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> mandates uninsured motorist protection \u201cof persons insured thereunder who are <em>legally entitled to recover damages </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Without proof of the negligence of a tortfeasor and without proof of damages from such negligence or an inference of negligence and damages that prompts the uninsured motorist carrier to settle, there can never be a recoveiy of uninsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, this principle is reiterated in \u00a7 38a-334-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which provides that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>uninsured carrier is required to pay all sums that the insured is \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages\u201d from the uninsured tortfeasor. \u201cWhere, as here, more than one [provision] is involved, we presume that the legislature intended them to be read together to create a harmonious body of law . . . and we construe the [provisions], if possible, to avoid conflict between them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Allied Van Lines, Inc., </em>246 Conn. 170, 179, 717 A.2d 195 (1998). We conclude that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7\u00a7 52-572h and 38a-336, did not intend to create a separate law of damages for uninsured motorist claims different from that which exists for traditional negligence awards. An insured, therefore, is \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages\u201d under \u00a7 38a-334-6 (a), her damages after they properly are apportioned pursuant to the dictates of \u00a7 52-572h.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In this case, recognizing the hybrid nature of uninsured motorist coverage with regard to the facts of this case allows for the principles guiding Tort Reform II to be applied equitably. For example, if the plaintiff had filed claims against two tortfeasors and subsequently released or settled with one, the remaining defendant would still be allowed the opportunity, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-102b and 52-572h, to have the jury apportion the percentage of negligence of each tortfeasor. Also, if the other driver had been underinsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>instead of a hit-and-run driver, and had settled with the plaintiff, \u00a7 52-572h (n) would have been triggered and apportionment principles would have been submitted to the jury. Moreover, if one tortfeasor was uninsured <em>and identified, </em>and the injured party did not have uninsured motorist protection, this \u201cfinancially irresponsible [driver]\u201d could still be brought into the litigation for apportionment purposes and the plaintiffs recovery from the solvent tortfeasor potentially could be diminished. Lastly, if the unidentified motorist had been identified in this case and his Lability carrier paid money to the plaintiff on behalf of the tortfeasor, there would be no question that apportionment should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Our conclusion in the present case should not be interpreted as recognizing no legal distinction between an uninsured motorist carrier and the unidentified tortfeasor. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 25 (uninsured motorist carrier and third party tortfeasor \u201cdo not share a <em>complete </em>legal identity\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Mazziotti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 240 Conn. 817 (for purposes of collateral estoppel, uninsured motorist carriers are not \u201cthe alter ego of the tortfeasor\u201d and \u201cdo not share the same legal [status]\u201d). In the present case, however, it would be inequitable and contrary to the spirit underlying \u00a7 52-572h, to allow a plaintiff who does have uninsured motorist coverage and has collected an amount pursuant to a settlement in a automobile accident involving multiple tortfeasors, to deny application of the principles of Tort Reform II, namely, that each individual tortfeasor pay its fair share or portion of damages sustained. This is especially significant because Colonial Perm was brought into the litigation <em>solely </em>to litigate the blameworthiness of the unidentified driver. We conclude that in this case there should be no substantive difference for apportionment purposes merely because the other tortfeasor is unidentified, so long as the under-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>insured carrier is named in the complaint to act as the unidentified driver\u2019s surrogate. Therefore, given the statutory scheme underlying this case, the nature of the complaint, and the cause of the accident, we conclude that the surrogate analysis can be extended to apportionment principles and that our decision is consistent with Tort Reform II and \u00a7\u00a7 52-572h and 52-225b. We conclude that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury regarding the issue of apportionment. The plaintiff is entitled to retain the settlement proceeds, but the case must be remanded so that the jury may assess the percentage of negligence and portion of liability for which the remaining defendant is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ, PALMER and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-10\"> The plaintiff brought an action against Raymond D.

Although the parties complied with that instruction, the defendant\u2019s requests did not include a request to charge on apportionment. Therefore, despite Colonial Penn\u2019s submission of a preliminary request to charge the jury on the issue of apportionment, that request was not considered at the charge conference because the plaintiff had withdrawn her claim against Colonial Penn and the defendant had never adopted that apportionment request. The court stated that, despite the fact that the defendant had not formally submitted a request to charge, the court would nevertheless consider the defendant\u2019s memorandum as a motion akin to one in limine because it appeared to be a part of the defendant\u2019s final argument.

Id., 520-21. We held that the defendant could not file such a complaint for two reasons. First, under \u00a7 52-102b, we recognized that there has to be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>identifiable person upon whom to serve a complaint. Id., 523-24. Second, we recognized that allowing such a complaint would be contrary to the policy underlying \u00a7 52-572h that limits \u201c 'the universe of negligence\u2019 \u201d to be considered to identifiable persons. Id., 527. Despite the fact that, in the present case, the unidentified tortfeasor, for whose conduct the plaintiffs uninsured motorist carrier settled, was also a hit-and-run driver, <em>Eskin </em>does not control our decision herein. Because Colonial Penn already was in the case as an original codefendant, the obstacle of \u00a7 52-102b is not present Thus, \u201cthe universe of negligence\u201d in this case includes the negligence of the unidentified driver because Colonial Penn is acting, in part, as a surrogate. Significantly, we also note that an injured plaintiff may recover money from an uninsured motorist carrier who serves as a surrogate for the unidentified person, unlike where a plaintiff merely had brought an action against an unidentified person as in <em>Eskin.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334, with limits for bodily injury or death not less than those specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underinsured motor vehicles and insured motor vehicles, the insurer of which becomes insolvent prior to payment of such damages, because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> Further evidence of the link between the tort law and uninsured motorist benefits is seen regarding the scheme for conversion coverage.

As we have explained, the fact that the plaintiffs action against her uninsured motorist carrier was based on her contract with that carrier does not preclude the concomitant fact that the legal basis of that contract claim required her to establish the negligence of that uninsured tortfeasor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b762-8\">VERTEFEUILLE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AtW\">with whom SULLIVAN, J., joins, dissenting. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that liability must be apportioned between the negligent defendants, Raymond A. Sardinis and Raymond D. Sardinis (defendants), and the defendant Colonial Penn Insurance Company (Colonial Perm), the plaintiffs uninsured motorist insurance carrier, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h. I would conclude that \u00a7 52-572h (o) bars apportionment between a party liable for negligence and an uninsured motorist insurance carrier, whose liability arises under the contractual provisions of an insurance policy. That statute provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, <em>there shall be no apportionment of liability or damages between parties liable for negligence and parties liable on any basis other than negligence </em>including, but not limited to, intentional, wanton or reckless misconduct, strict liability or liability pursuant to any cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>created by statute, except that liability may be apportioned among parties liable for negligence in any cause of action created by statute based on negligence including, but not limited to, an action for wrongful death pursuant to section 52-555 or an action for injuries caused by a motor vehicle owned by the state pursuant to section 52-556.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (o).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Less than one year ago, in a case raising a similar issue, we interpreted \u00a7 52-572h (o) and unanimously concluded that it does not permit apportionment between a negligent defendant and a defendant liable on a product liability theory. <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Liberty Oil Equipment Co., </em>253 Conn. 787, 798-99, 756 A.2d 237 (2000). We recognized therein that \u201c[t]he general effect of [\u00a7 52-572h (o)] was to make clear that the apportionment principles of \u00a7 52-572h do not apply where the purported apportionment complaint rests on any basis other than negligence . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Our decision in <em>Allard </em>offers important background for my analysis of the present case. The defendant in that case, Liberty Oil Equipment Company (Liberty Oil), which was allegedly liable in negligence, sought to apportion liability to a product seller. Id., 789. In its apportionment complaint, Liberty Oil alleged only a theory of negligence against the product seller. Id., 790. We concluded, however, that \u201cLiberty Oil cannot . . . convert its apportionment claim against [the product seller] into something other than a product liability claim simply by alleging only negligent misconduct.\u201d Id., 800. The question before us, therefore, was whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u00a7 52-572h, as amended by No. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (o), of the 1999 Public Acts (P.A. 99-69), allows for the apportionment of liability to a defendant on a product liability claim. Id., 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We began with a careful examination of the legislative history of P.A. 99-69 and concluded that \u201c[t]he legislative history of P.A. 99-69 makes clear that its principal purpose was to overrule legislatively a portion of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bhinder </em>v. <em>Sun Co., </em>246 Conn. 223, 717 A.2d 202 (1998). See, e.g., 42 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1999 Sess., pp. 1797-98, remarks of Senator Donald E. Williams, Jr.; 42 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1999 Sess., p. 1916, remarks of Representative Michael P. Lawlor; id., pp. 1918-19; see also generally Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4,1999 Sess., pp. 1271-74, 1310-29, 1340-46, 1355-58, 1362, 1365, 1418-20, 1426-31; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5, 1999 Sess., pp. 1538-50.\u201d <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Liberty Oil Equipment Co., </em>supra, 253 Conn. 801-802. We further explained that in <em>Bhinder </em>v. <em>Sun Co., </em>supra, 225, \u201c[t]his court held that: (1) as a matter of statutory interpretation, \u2018the plain language of \u00a7 52-572h provides that only negligent persons may be cited in by the defendant for apportionment of liability purposes\u2019; id., 230; and (2) nonetheless, \u2018as a matter of common law, we should extend the policy of apportionment to permit a defendant in a negligence action to cite in as an apportionment defendant a party whose conduct is alleged to be reckless, wilful, and wanton.\u2019 Id., 234.\u201d <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Liberty Oil Equipment Co., </em>supra, 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">On the basis of that examination of the legislative history of P.A. 99-69, we determined that the three purposes of P.A. 99-69 were as follows: \u201cFirst, the legislature reaffirmed that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, only negligent persons may be cited in as apportionment defendants pursuant to the statute. . . . Second, the legislature made clear its intent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>apportionment principles would not apply where the basis of liability of the purported apportionment defendant was based on conduct \u2018other than negligence,\u2019 including but not limited to intentional, wanton or reckless misconduct, strict liability, and liability pursuant to any cause of action created by statute. . . . Third, the legislature made clear its intent that, despite the specific bar to apportionment regarding statutory actions, liability <em>may </em>be apportioned among parties liable for negligence in statutory actions based on <em>negligence, </em>such as wrongful death actions and actions for injuries caused by state-owned motor vehicles.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 803-804. We concluded, therefore, that \u201cthe apportionment principles of \u00a7 52-572h do not apply where the purported apportionment complaint rests on any basis other than negligence . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 801. We further concluded that \u201cit would be inconsistent with the provisions of \u00a7 52-572h, as amended by P.A. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (o), to permit a defendant sued in negligence to claim apportionment against a product seller whose alleged misconduct tracks that of product liability . . . .\u201d Id., 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">I believe that our reasoning in <em>Allard </em>should guide our analysis in the present case. The plaintiff\u2019s claim against Colonial Penn is a common-law contract claim based on the contract of insurance between Colonial Penn and the plaintiff. In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that \u201c[a]t the time of [the collision, the plaintiff] had an automobile policy with [Colonial Penn] providing for $100,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. [Colonial Penn] provided that [it] would pay to the plaintiff all damages suffered because of bodily injury to which she is legally entitled to recover from the unidentified motor vehicle operator up to the limits of the [Colonial Penn] policy applicable to this accident. Under the contract of insurance described above, the plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>demanded that [Colonial Penn] pay to the plaintiff $100,000 but [Colonial Penn] has refused and neglected to pay the same.\u201d The majority concludes, however, that the jury should have apportioned liability between the defendants and Colonial Penn under \u00a7 52-572h (o) because the claim against Colonial Penn is based on negligence in that Colonial Penn acts as a surrogate for the negligent unidentified tortfeasor in this case. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The majority concludes that the action in the present case is based on negligence because \u201cColonial Perm acted, in part, as a surrogate for the third party tortfeasor . . . .\u201d The majority requires apportionment as to Colonial Penn based on the reasoning that the \u201cplaintiff . . . linked the cause of her damages not only to the negligence of the defendants], but also to the negligence of the unidentified driver when it named Colonial Penn as a defendant.\u201d This reasoning is similar to that which we rejected in <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Liberty Oil Equipment Co., </em>supra, 253 Conn. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In <em>Allard, </em>Liberty Oil argued that it was appropriate to apportion liability to the product seller \u201c[g]iven that the . . . apportionment claim alleges negligence in relation to a defective product . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 805. In rejecting Liberty Oil\u2019s argument that its product liability claim was essentially one based on negligence, we concluded that \u201c[t]he theory behind the statutory limitation of apportionment claims to those involving negligence is that, in such a case, both the underlying claim of the plaintiff and the apportionment claim of the defendant are in relative pari materia, in that they both involve negligent conduct. The statutory actions based on negligence given as examples are consistent with that theory because they rest on the same notions of fault embodied in nonstatutory negligence actions. Product liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>claims, however, do not rest on notions of fault.\u201d Id., 805-806.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Similarly, a claim for uninsured motorist insurance benefits does not rest on the fault of the insurance carrier, but arises out of the insurance contract with the carrier. Although Colonial Penn\u2019s liability is \u201cpremised in part on the contingency of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability\u201d; <em>Mazziotti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>240 Conn. 799, 817, 695 A.2d 1010 (1997); the action by the plaintiff against Colonial Penn is not based on any allegations of fault by Colonial Penn. As we recognized in <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Liberty Oil Equipment Co., </em>supra, 253 Conn. 803-804, the legislature clearly intended that liability be apportioned only on the basis of negligence, whether in an action arising under the common law or statute. The claim against Colonial Penn in this case is based on its insurance contract with the plaintiff and not on any negligence by Colonial Penn. The terms of \u00a7 52-572h (o) therefore expressly prohibit apportionment to Colonial Penn.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">I further find that the reliance on <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>243 Conn. 17, 699 A.2d 964 (1997), by the majority for its surrogacy reasoning is misplaced. Citing <em>Haynes, </em>the majority concludes that \u201cbecause of the \u2018hybrid\u2019 nature of uninsured motorist coverage, the uninsured carrier operates in part as a \u2018surrogate\u2019 for the financially irresponsible tortfeasor.\u201d Although we acknowledged in <em>Haynes </em>that an uninsured motorist carrier can be seen as a surrogate for the toitfeasor, <em>Haynes </em>is not applicable to this case for two reasons. First, <em>Haynes </em>was based on common-law principles and not on \u00a7 52-572h, the statute that is directly at issue in the present case. Second, <em>Haynes </em>was decided in 1997, two years before \u00a7 52-572h was amended by adding subsection (o), which explicitly prohibits apportionment between parties liable in negligence and parties liable on any other basis. The reasoning in <em>Haynes </em>therefore has been superseded by the legislature\u2019s adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tion of \u00a7 52-572h (o) and should not be applied to reach a result contrary to the explicit provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (o).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201cIn construing a statute, we seek to ascertain and give <em>effect to the </em>apparent intent of the legislature. . . . [W]e are guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>237 Conn. 169, 180, 676 A.2d 375 (1996). Also, \u201c[i]t is a well-recognized rule of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed to know all the existing statutes, the judicial interpretation of them, and the effect that its action or nonaction will have on them.\u201d <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Saars, </em>150 Conn. 290, 298, 188 A.2d 863 (1963). \u201cAnd it is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or non-action produces.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Civardi </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>231 Conn. 287, 298, 649 A.2d 523 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In adopting subsection (o) of \u00a7 52-572h, the legislature could not have spoken more clearly: apportionment to a party liable on a basis other than negligence is expressly prohibited. Because the plaintiffs claim against Colonial Penn arises under a contract of insurance, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 52-572h requires apportionment of liability to Colonial Penn in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> Although <em>Allard </em>involved a defendant that was impleaded as an apportionment defendant and in the present case, Colonial Penn was an original defendant in the action brought by the plaintiff, the principles governing the apportionment issue in both cases are the same as both cases involve a claim for apportionment based on \u00a7 52-572h.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
