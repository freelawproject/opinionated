The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>59 Conn. App. 341, 757 A.2d 621 (2000). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the defendant to have access to certain school records of the teenaged complaining witness?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>254 Conn. 938, 761 A.2d 764 (2000). We conclude that certain portions of the records should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>have been disclosed to the defendant. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The record contains the following facts and procedural history. Prior to trial, the defendant had filed a motion seeking disclosure of certain of the victim\u2019s school records, including psychological and psychiatric records that may have been contained therein. In that motion, the defendant sought to have the court conduct an in camera inspection of the records to determine whether anything contained therein would bear on the credibility of the victim or his ability to testify truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The trial court, <em>Scheinblum, J., </em>after granting the pretrial motion and conducting an in camera inspection, determined that there was nothing in the records that would bear' on the ability of the victim to testify truthfully. Accordingly, the court denied the defendant access to and use of the records. The case proceeded to trial and at the end of the defendant\u2019s case, he moved that the trial court, <em>Cutsumpas, J., </em>conduct an in camera review of the school records to determine if they contained information that would bear on the truthfulness of the victim\u2019s testimony. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that another court at an earlier stage in the same proceedings had reviewed the records and had denied the defendant access to them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>In deciding whether the trial court improperly had denied the defendant access to the victim\u2019s school records, including any psychological or psychiatric records that may have been contained within such records, the Appellate Court inspected the records based upon its obligation \u201c \u2018to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to release those records to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 345-46. Concluding that the trial court reasonably could have found that they contained no evidence that was probative of the victim\u2019s ability to be truthful, the Appellate Court determined that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the victim\u2019s school and psychiatric records. Id., 346.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 350. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We have reviewed the records in connection with this appeal and conclude that the defendant should have been given access to portions of the records, and that the failure to afford him access at trial was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The following evidence adduced at trial is pertinent to the issue before this court. The victim, a male child between the ages of fourteen and fifteen at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>the alleged occurrences involved herein, lived with his father, his father\u2019s girlfriend and a younger brother in New Britain. According to his father\u2019s testimony at trial, the victim loved motor vehicles, built model cars, read books about cars, helped his father work on cars, visited race tracks and talked constantly about cars. Additionally, the victim loved motorcycles and raced his own motorcycles in various events in the amateur class. According to his father, the victim first met the defendant in the summer of 1993, when he stopped at the defendant\u2019s automobile repair and restoration business, called Valley Enterprises, located in New Britain. He and the defendant began to spend time together, sharing what the victim\u2019s father believed was a love of cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In 1995, the victim stole his father\u2019s truck, which he drove to another location in New Britain, where he stole another vehicle and thereafter drove to Delaware. Following the receipt of a telephone call from the police in Wilmington, Delaware, the victim\u2019s father retrieved the victim and thereafter imposed certain restrictions on his freedom. As a further consequence of the victim\u2019s behavior, his father started recording his telephone conversations. After hearing conversations between the defendant and the victim containing abbreviations that he thought were spoken in some sort of code, the victim\u2019s father approached the victim in an effort to learn what the victim and the defendant had been saying to one another. Thereafter, during a counseling session with a psychologist that the victim and his father had started seeing sometime in late 1994 or early 1995, the victim\u2019s father first learned that the victim had been having sexual relations with the defendant. He also learned that the defendant had exhibited bizarre behavior involving the victim\u2019s hair and that, among other things, the defendant enjoyed giving the victim haircuts while engaging in sexual activity. The victim\u2019s father contacted an attorney, and thereafter brought the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>to the Berlin police department, where the victim was interviewed by the police. Sometime thereafter, the victim, through his father, commenced a civil action against the defendant based on the alleged conduct of the defendant involved herein. Although the victim\u2019s father testified that he had no prior knowledge of the sexual activities in which his son and the defendant had engaged, he had been aware, even before allowing his son to go on an unchaperoned trip with the defendant to Vermont, that the defendant was a forty-three year old male who liked to cut his son\u2019s hair and whom the father believed was a pedophile.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The victim testified at trial that soon after he had met the defendant, he began visiting him at work several times a week. The victim\u2019s father traveled frequently due to business and the victim enjoyed watching the defendant work on the cars. The victim related how the defendant took him to his home, ostensibly to show him model cars, and that while there, the defendant persuaded him to view the \u201cDirty Dozen,\u201d a pornographic videotape, and to masturbate. The victim testified that initially, he did not consider that he was doing anything improper. He described other videotapes the defendant had that depicted bestiality and children having sex with other children, and noted the defendant\u2019s obsession with cutting hair. The victim identified a written contract, which he and the defendant had executed, that allowed the defendant to have full control over the victim\u2019s hair in exchange for a promise by the defendant to sell the victim, at cost, a Ford Mustang when he turned sixteen years of age.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the victim, they engaged in oral sex on several occasions, and frequently, the defendant gave the victim money and model cars in exchange for sex. On one occasion, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>dant\u2019s greyhound dog was involved. Although each time the defendant invited him to his home the victim expected that they would engage in sexual activity, he, nevertheless, accompanied the defendant because he felt that the defendant controlled him.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Thomas Hodolitz, the police officer to whom the victim first reported the events leading to the defendant\u2019s arrest, described the victim as reluctant. Additionally, the victim\u2019s first statement to police on April 18, 1995, although long, was incomplete. Consequently, the victim returned to the police station two days later to provide additional information. On the same evening that the first statement was given, the Berlin police executed a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s home, resulting in the seizure of, among other things, a pornographic videotape entitled the \u201cDirty Dozen,\u201d thirteen other videotapes, including tapes depicting child pornography, an adult magazine, several locks of hair, a memo book, some haircutting tools, pliers, tweezers and a bag of fireworks.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Bruce Freedman, a clinical psychologist, testified for the state at trial in general terms about children who have been victimized sexually. According to Freedman, most are reluctant to disclose the abuse, and such reticence is particularly prevalent when the abuser is an adult of the same sex as the child. He concluded that the detail provided by the victim in his statements to the police was \u201cconsistent with a true report of the child\u2019s sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Largely through cross-examination of the victim, his father and Hodolitz, the defendant painted a picture of the victim as a troubled young man, whose problems began long before his involvement with the defendant. The victim\u2019s parents had separated when he was just one year old, and he lived with his mother for twelve years. For a period of six years, the victim and his father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>had no contact. Shortly before the victim\u2019s involvement with the defendant, the victim allegedly had been physically abused by his mother\u2019s boyfriend, who lived with the victim and his mother. As a result of those allegations, an investigation by the state department of children and families was conducted and the victim\u2019s father sought a change in his son\u2019s custody. Unfortunately, the victim had significant troubles in school, which ultimately led his father to remove him from school and to \u201chome school\u201d him. At one point, the victim stole two vehicles in an effort to run away from home. When he was apprehended in Delaware, the victim told the police that he had fled because his father was forcing him to work for free, an explanation he later denied having given. Nevertheless, despite these problems and despite the allegations of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the victim, the victim\u2019s father chose to discontinue his son\u2019s counseling shortly after they reported the alleged abuse to the police. Finally, it was disclosed that at the time of trial, the victim had burglary and criminal mischief charges pending against him in Meriden, and robbery, burglary and assault charges pending against him in Bantam.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The defendant testified that he began working at a garage when he was twelve years of age. He loved cars and was an avid collector of car models and memorabilia. During his testimony, he identified a variety of cutting implements that he used in connection with his work on car models. He also cut hair, a hobby he had enjoyed for thirty years. The defendant kept a book containing an extensive list of names of people for whom he regularly cut hair. He cut hair for men only and their ages ranged from thirteen to fifty. He also colored hair for people and explained that the hair samples seized by the police had come from people whose hair he had lightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>The defendant related that the first time the victim came to his shop was in the summer of 1993. Thereafter, he came by sporadically, for a glass of water or to watch the mechanics work. In the late summer of 1993, the victim and a friend were chased off the defendant\u2019s property by a coworker because the boys had been rummaging through the cars parked there. The defendant did not see the victim again until June, 1994, when he started to come around occasionally, either riding his bicycle or driving a red Saab automobile or a white Ranger pickup truck. Because he had seen the victim driving these vehicles, the defendant assumed the victim was older than he actually was.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Thereafter, in September, 1994, the victim came to the defendant\u2019s house to get a haircut. In his testimony, the defendant denied that any sexual contact had occurred at that time. Rather, he claimed that he only had cut the victim\u2019s hair as requested. During the fall of 1994, the victim began to come to the defendant\u2019s shop more frequently, asking to help out. This pattern of behavior continued until the early part of 1995. The defendant testified that he found the victim to be an irritant. The defendant also explained that the contract about which the victim had testified was something instigated by the victim, who desperately wanted a Mustang, and that he had told the victim to \u201cwrite what you want\u201d in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The defendant testified that the victim seemed to be sexually knowledgeable, bragging that he had seen his girlfriend nude, and that the victim knew lyrics to a song entitled \u201cDetachable Penis.\u201d The defendant related that in February, 1995, the victim came to his home for a haircut, and that while the defendant was out walking his dog, the victim began to watch a pornographic movie entitled the \u201cDirty Dozen,\u201d a movie loaned to the defendant by an elderly friend, whom he identified by name. The defendant testified that he never told the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>about the movie; nor had he ever watched it with him. The defendant had borrowed a few such videotapes from his friend, along with some magazines, but never possessed any videotapes depicting bestiality or child pornography. The defendant explained some of the abbreviations the jury had heard on the tape-recorded telephone conversations between him and the victim, ascribing an innocent interpretation to each one. Finally, the defendant testified that the fireworks found by the police had been purchased by him for his twenty-nine year old niece, whom he also identified by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">John H. Felber, a psychiatrist, testified for the defendant regarding typical behavior that is exhibited by an adult homosexual pedophile. According to Felber, such a person is a predator, who is eager to obtain many victims. Felber also testified that a person who has a hair fetish is fixated on hair and that hair is the object of that person\u2019s affections. He concluded that there was no correlation between pedophilia and fetishes, and opined that there was no correlation between pedophilia and bestiality. Finally, Felber testified that, based on his experience, three factors might induce a person to lie about having been sexually abused: money; vengeance; and a child custody dispute. George Higgins, a clinical psychologist, testified that in his private practice he had treated approximately 1000 homosexuals, some of whom were pedophiles. On the basis of his experience, Higgins opined that some teenagers make false allegations of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons. The most common reason for these false allegations relates to the family structure, and the occurrences are more prevalent in \u201cdysfunctional families.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">After his last witness, the defendant once again sought access to the victim\u2019s school records. As noted previously; see footnote 3 of this opinion; the trial court did not consider it necessary to revisit the pretrial ruling by Judge Scheinblum precluding disclosure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>records and accordingly denied the defendant\u2019s request for disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Following the defendant\u2019s conviction of four of the six counts charged; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and pursuant to a motion for production made in connection with the civil action brought by the victim against the defendant alleging sexual abuse, the defendant sought and received access to the victim\u2019s school records, including a January, 1994 report from James C. Black, a psychiatrist, and a November, 1993 psychological evaluation by Cynthia Rutledge, the victim\u2019s school psychologist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction in his criminal action to the Appellate Court, which determined that the decision of Judge Cutsumpas denying the defendant access to the records was proper. <em>State v. Slimskey, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 346. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses, which may include impeaching or discrediting them by attempting to reveal to the jury the witnesses\u2019 biases, prejudices or ulterior motives, or facts bearing on the witnesses\u2019 reliability, credibility, or sense of perception. <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 19, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 457, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). Thus, in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>instances, otherwise privileged records, like the ones in this case, must give way to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to reveal to the jury facts about a witness\u2019 mental condition that may reasonably affect that witness\u2019 credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 401-402, 533 A.2d 866 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 227, 514 A.2d 724 (1986), on appeal after remand, 208 Conn. 683, 546 A.2d 286 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1016, 109 S. Ct. 1131, 103 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The defendant in the present case does not argue that his right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution was violated by the trial court\u2019s denial of access to the victim\u2019s school records merely because he was precluded from inquiring into the victim\u2019s troubled youth. He recognizes that the right to cross-examine witnesses \u201cdoes not include the power to <em>require </em>the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that <em>might </em>be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 53, 107 S. Ct. 989, 94 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1987). The defendant concedes that the confrontation clause guarantees \u201c \u2018an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish\u2019 \u201d; id., quoting <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>supra, 474 U.S. 20. Therefore, the defendant acknowledges that he was not entitled to an unlimited inspection of the victim\u2019s school records in the hope of discovering material evidence. He claims, however, that he has a legitimate interest in access to records bearing on the testimonial reliability of the victim at or around the time of trial, or of the occurrence about which he is to testify, and that he was entitled to access to the victim\u2019s school records, in particular the reports compiled by Black and Rutledge. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>The need to balance a witness\u2019 statutory privilege to keep psychiatric records confidential against a defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause is well recognized. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 108-109, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The test and the associated burdens imposed on a defendant are equally well chronicled. \u201cIf, for the purposes of cross-examination, a defendant believes that certain privileged records would disclose information especially probative of a witness\u2019 ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth, he may, out of the jury\u2019s presence, attempt to make a preliminary showing that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness. ... If in the trial court\u2019s judgment the defendant successfully makes this showing, the state must then obtain the witness\u2019 permission for the court to inspect the records in camera.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A witness\u2019 refusal to consent to such an in camera inspection entitles the defendant to have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">\u201cUpon inspecting the records in camera, the trial court must determine whether the records are especially probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences. ... If the court determines that the records are probative, the state must obtain the witness\u2019 further waiver of his privilege concerning the relevant portions of the records for release to the defendant, or have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>witness\u2019 testimony stricken. If the court discovers no probative and impeaching material, the entire record of the proceeding must be sealed and preserved for possible appellate review. . . . Once the trial court has made its inspection, the court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s access to the witness\u2019 records lies in the court\u2019s sound discretion, which we will not disturb unless abused.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McMurray, </em>217 Conn. 243, 257-58, 585 A.2d 677 (1991).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">\u201cAccess to confidential records should be left to the discretion of the trial court which is better able to assess the probative value of such evidence as it relates to the particular case before it . . . and to weigh that value against the interest in confidentiality of the records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Harris, 227 Conn. 751, 762, 631 A.2d 309 (1993). \u201c[T]he linchpin of the determination of the defendant\u2019s access to the records is whether they sufficiently disclose material especially probative of the ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth ... so as to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>breach of their confidentiality and disclosing them to the defendant in order to protect his right of confrontation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 379, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The defendant claims that, in the course of this court\u2019s in camera inspection of the records, we will discover that they contained material evidence relating directly to the victim\u2019s ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth. Therefore, he contends that we must conclude that the trial court failed to discharge its duty to disclose that evidence to him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Our review of the victim\u2019s school records, viewed in conjunction with the entire trial transcript, convinces us that portions of the Black and Rutledge reports directly relate to his credibility and could have created a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Rutledge stated in her report that the victim \u201cis prone to distort his perception of reality with paranoid and persecutoria! ideas.\u201d Black\u2019s report contained a reference gathered from his meeting with Rutledge that the victim had \u201cconcocted a story about being victimized.\u201d When the victim was suspended for bringing a plastic cap gun and ammunition to school, he claimed that they belonged to another student and that he had been \u201cframed,\u201d despite the fact that the evidence indicated that he was responsible. Black described numerous episodes of the victim acting out in sexually inappropriate ways and then fabricating stories to exonerate himself, including incidents in which he exposed himself to a particular female student, whom he had followed home and into whose home he had attempted, uninvited, to gain entry; exposed himself in class; urinated in the hallway at school; and followed girls to the bathroom. When questioned about the episode involving the female student he had fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>lowed home, the victim falsely stated that it was another student who had carried out the actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">By engaging in a review of the records, a specific procedure designed to accommodate the inherent tension between the defendant\u2019s rights of confrontation and the victim\u2019s right to confidentiality, we conclude that the trial court should have disclosed those portions of the records that we have referenced, and that its failure to do so constituted an abuse of discretion. Although the determination whether to disclose the records, in whole or in part, rests, in the first instance, within the trial court\u2019s discretion, our assessment of the trial court\u2019s decision to restrict the defendant\u2019s access to the witness\u2019 confidential records must, however, take into account the recognized principle that such a restriction \u201cimplicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to impeach and discredit state witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 532, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). Whether this type of impropriety warrants a new trial may depend on whether the defendant must demonstrate that it was more probable than not that the impropriety affected the result of the trial; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 786, 601 A.2d 521 (1992); or whether the state must demonstrate harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>249 Conn. 735, 753, 738 A.2d 117 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Although the confrontation right is not absolute and is subject to reasonable limitation; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 401, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); there is, nevertheless, a minimum level of cross-examination that must be afforded to the defendant into matters affecting the reliability and credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>197 Conn. 602, 609, 500 A.2d 555 (1985). In the present case, the defendant was denied access to information compiled by trained professionals that was relevant to and probative of the victim\u2019s ability to comprehend, to know and to relate the truth. As a conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>quence, the defendant had <em>no </em>opportunity to elicit evidence regarding the victim\u2019s predilection for concocting stories about being victimized or his tendencies \u201cto distort his perception of reality with paranoid and persecutorial ideas.\u201d Having determined that the evidence in issue was especially probative and having concluded that there was no other available means of inquiry into the victim\u2019s propensity to lie, we necessarily have concluded that the confrontation clause requires the disclosure. Therefore, we resolve the burden of proof issue against the state, which, accordingly must prove that the trial court\u2019s decision denying the defendant access to portions of the reports was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">\u201cThe correct inquiry for identifying harmless constitutional error is to ask whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Whether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 333, 618 A.2d 32 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">In this case, there was no physical evidencie that both corroborated the victim\u2019s version and contradicted the defendant\u2019s account of the events. The search of the defendant\u2019s home resulted in the seizure of several hair-cutting implements, assorted pieces of human hair, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>few pornographic videotape cassettes and a Hustler magazine. Those items corroborated some aspects of the victim\u2019s testimony. They also corroborated, however, some aspects of the defendant\u2019s testimony, and no physical evidence corroborated the essential elements of the alleged sexual conduct. In short, the only determination necessary was whether the alleged sexual activity occurred. The answer to that question turned on the credibility of the victim. Certainly, if his testimony had been discredited altogether,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the jury properly could not have returned the same guilty verdicts. Cf. <em>State </em>v. Gonzales, 186 Conn. 426, 435, 441 A.2d 852 (1982). Therefore, on the present record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision denying the defendant access to the records was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed in part and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the defendant\u2019s convictions of sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child and to remand the case for a new trial on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In this opinion BORDEN and NORCOTT, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-12\"> The defendant had been charged in a six count amended information with: (1) risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-21 for having permitted the victim on diverse dates between 1991 and April, 1995, to view a sexually explicit videotape; (2) risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 for having engaged in fellatio with the victim on or about January, 1995; (3) sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), for having engaged in fellatio with the victim on or about January, 1995; (4) risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 for having engaged in fellatio with the victim on or about March, 1995; (5) sexual assault in tire second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71(a) (1) for having engaged in fellatio with the victim on or about March, 1995; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>(6) possession of fireworks in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 29-357.

J., joins, dissenting. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s application to the facts in this case of our established test to determine whether a defendant should be granted access to the psychological and/or psychiatric records of a witness. Particularly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that certain portions of reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>compiled by James C. Black, a psychiatrist, and Cynthia Rutledge, the victim\u2019s school psychologist, relate directly to the victim\u2019s ability or capacity to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth and therefore should have been disclosed to the defendant. Although I do agree that one comment from Rutledge\u2019s report does relate to the victim\u2019s ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to allow the defendant access to that comment was harmless. Because I would affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction, I therefore must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 459, 464 A.2d 829 (1983), this court stated that \u201c[t]he linchpin of the determination of the defendant\u2019s access to the records is whether they sufficiently disclose material <em>especially probative of the ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth </em>... so as to justify breach of their confidentiality and disclosing them to the defendant in order to protect his right of confrontation. Access to records bearing on the <em>mental unsound,ness </em>of a witness (i.e., <em>relating to a trait importing in itself a defective power of observation, recollection or communication), </em>at or around the time of trial or of the occurrence about which he is to testify . . . should be granted to the defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">I agree that the statement in Rutledge\u2019s report that the victim \u201cis prone to distort his perception of reality with paranoid and persecutorial ideas,\u201d is \u201cespecially probative\u201d of the victim\u2019s ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth and should have been disclosed to the defendant. I disagree, however, with the majority when it reaches the same conclusion with regard to comments found in Black\u2019s report that disclose that: (1) the victim had \u201cconcocted a story about being victimized\u201d; (2) the victim had lied that a gun and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ammunition, which he had brought into school and subsequently was suspended for, belonged to another student and that he had been framed; and (3) the victim had lied to exculpate himself from numerous incidents of sexually inappropriate behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">With regard to these comments, I conclude that the trial court properly withheld these portions of the records from the defendant because they are not especially probative of the victim\u2019s ability or capacity to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>221 Conn. 447, 458, 604 A.2d 1294 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>McMurray, </em>217 Conn. 243, 258-59, 585 A.2d 677 (1991). Rather, they describe incidents in the past when the victim had lied. I agree with the majority that these comments demonstrate that when the victim, a teenager, had put himself in a situation where he would be reprimanded or punished, he would lie to exonerate himself. Telling lies to exonerate oneself, however, is not an indication of an inability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth. Unfortunately, adolescents do sometimes tell lies in order to exonerate themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">None of these statements taken from the victim\u2019s confidential records bear on the victim\u2019s \u201c \u2018mental unsoundness.\u2019 \u201d <em>See State v. Storlazzi, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 459. They do not relate \u201cto a trait importing in itself a defective power of observation, recollection or communication . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. I therefore would conclude that, apart from the comment taken from Rutledge\u2019s report, the trial court properly denied the defendant access to the victim\u2019s psychiatric and psychological records.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">I next consider whether the trial court\u2019s improper withholding of the single comment from Rutledge\u2019s report requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions for risk of injury to a child and sexual assault in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>second degree. I agree with the majority that \u201cthe state . . . must prove that the trial court\u2019s decision denying the defendant access to portions of the reports was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cWhether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. . . . If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 254, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A. 2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">I recognize, as the majority points out and the state concedes, that the testimony of the victim concerning the alleged sexual assault was not directly corroborated by other testimony. I conclude, however, that the overall strength of the state\u2019s case and the extent of the cross-examination of the victim that was permitted by the trial court would have rendered the withholding of Rutledge\u2019s single statement harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In his statements to the police and during his testimony at trial, the victim, although initially hesitant, gave a detailed account of the alleged sexual abuse by the defendant. The victim also correctly described the defendant\u2019s home, including the defendant\u2019s bedroom area, demonstrating that he had spent a considerable amount of time there. The victim also demonstrated an accurate memory of the defendant\u2019s pornography <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>collection, including pornographic videotapes and magazines. In particular, the victim described videotapes depicting bestiality and children having sex with other children. He also identified the videotape entitled the \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d and described the contents of the film. The victim also had intimate knowledge of the defendant\u2019s bizarre hair fetish and gave gruesome details about what the defendant had done with the victim\u2019s hair. The victim also described with particularity the tools the defendant had used to \u201cpull\u201d the victim\u2019s hair out.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Although there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged incidents of fellatio, to a large extent, the victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated on material points by other evidence. The police, on the basis of the victim\u2019s statement, had executed a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s home. They found, among other things, several pornographic videotapes, including child pornography videotapes and the \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d videotape, pornographic magazines, one of which was found on a table in the defendant\u2019s living room, a bag nearly one-half filled with human hair, and haircutting tools. Furthermore, Bruce Freedman, a clinical psychologist, explained that the victim\u2019s reluctance to give the police a statement and the details concerning the sexual abuse ultimately provided by the victim in his statements to the police were consistent with children who have been abused sexually. The prosecution\u2019s case was strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Moreover, I am \u201cconvinced that nothing in the [psychiatric] records would have added weight to the defendant\u2019s thorough cross-examination of [the victim] . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. Howard, supra, 221 Conn. 458; <em>State </em>v. Crosswell, 223 Conn. 243, 270, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992). On the basis of my review of the record, the defendant thoroughly cross-examined the victim, eliciting various inconsistencies between the statements the victim had given to the police and his testimony during the trial. The defendant also elicited testimony from the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>that could have led the jury to believe that the victim\u2019s father had pushed the victim to fabricate this story against the defendant so that the victim\u2019s father could bring a civil action against the defendant. The victim\u2019s father eventually did bring a civil action against the defendant, which was pending at the time of the criminal trial, and the defendant elicited this information from the victim. The defendant\u2019s cross-examination also showed contradictions between the victim\u2019s testimony and certain other evidence, reflecting on his truthfulness and his memory of the alleged events. Finally, the defendant elicited from the victim testimony concerning various criminal charges that were pending against the victim in other towns, further depicting the victim as a very troubled teenager. I do not believe that Rutledge\u2019s statement that the victim was \u201cprone to distort his perception of reality with paranoid and persecutoria! ideas\u201d would have influenced the judgment of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">On the basis of the overall strength of the state\u2019s case and the leeway the trial court afforded the defendant during his cross-examination of the victim, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision denying the defendant access to Rutledge\u2019s single statement concerning the victim\u2019s propensity to \u201cdistort his perception of reality with paranoid and persecutorial ideas\u201d was harmless. I would affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and, therefore, I respectfully dissent</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
