On December 10, 1997, the plaintiff, Sherry Nunno,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was the operator of a motor vehicle that was involved in a collision with a motor vehicle operated by the defendant Walter Wixner II and owned by the defendant Walter Wixner (defendants). After filing this action, the plaintiff filed an offer of judgment for $19,000 pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants did not accept the offer of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Subsequently, the case was referred to an arbitrator under the court\u2019s mandatory arbitration program pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ant to \u00a7 52-549u and Practice Book \u00a7 23-61.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a hearing, the arbitrator issued a decision awarding the plaintiff $21,945. The arbitrator\u2019s decision and award subsequently became a judgment of the court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-549z<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 23-66.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The plaintiff thereafter filed a \u201cMotion to Determine Plaintiffs Offer of Judgment,\u201d seeking an award of 12 percent interest on the judgment pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a because the amount awarded by the arbitrator, which became the judgment of the court, exceeded the amount of the plaintiffs offer of judgment. The trial court ultimately denied the plaintiffs motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the offer of judgment statute, \u00a7 52-192a, applies to court-mandated arbitration because the arbitration proceeding was part of a civil action. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the arbitration proceeding constituted a civil action because it was required by the court and was held in the form of a summary trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In response, the defendants assert that the offer of judgment statute does not apply to a court-mandated arbitration proceeding because it is not a trial within the meaning of \u00a7 52-192a (b) and that applying offer of judgment interest would under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>mine the purposes of the court-mandated arbitration statute. We agree with the defendants and conclude that the legislature did not intend \u00a7 52-192a (b) to apply to court-mandated arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Our resolution of the plaintiffs claim is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. . . . In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutoiy language as applied to the facts of this case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Finally, because the question presented by this appeal involves an issue of statutory construction, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Northwest Associates, </em>255 Conn. 379, 386, 767 A.2d 687 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The plain language of \u00a7 52-192a (b) supports our conclusion that offer of judgment interest does not apply to judgments resulting from arbitration proceedings. The statute provides in part that \u201c[ajl'ter trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 which the defendants failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain stated in his \u2018offer of judgment\u2019, the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (b). The wording of \u00a7 52-192a (b) indicates the legislature\u2019s intention that offer of judgment interest apply only \u201cafter trial . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>We conclude that an arbitration proceeding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-549u and Practice Book \u00a7 23-61 is not a trial within the meaning of \u00a7 52-192a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The trial court is authorized to refer to an arbitrator any civil action in which the court has a reasonable expectation that the judgment will be less than $50,000. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-549u and Practice Book \u00a7 23-61. In such court-mandated arbitration proceedings, a lawyer with a minimum of five years civil litigation experience serves as the arbitrator. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-549w<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 23-60.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No record is made of the proceedings and strict adherence to the rules of evidence is not required. See Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u00a7 23-63.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The arbitrator is required to submit a decision in writing within 120 days after the hearing. See Practice Book \u00a7 23-64.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The parties then have the opportunity to request a trial de novo pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-66 (c)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> within twenty days of the filing of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. If neither party requests a trial de novo within twenty days, the decision of the arbitrator becomes the judgment of the court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 23-66 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Court-mandated arbitration proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 52-549u do not include many of the distinctive hallmarks of a trial. In a case involving private arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201c [arbitration differs from judicial proceedings in many ways: arbitration carries no right to a jury trial as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment; arbitrators need not be instructed in the law; they are not bound by rules of evidence; they need not give reasons for their awards; witnesses need not be sworn; the record of proceedings need not be complete; and judicial review, it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>held, is extremely limited.\u201d <em>Republic Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>379 U.S. 650, 664, 85 S. Ct. 614, 13 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1965). In another case the United States Supreme Court also distinguished arbitration from judicial proceedings, concluding that \u201carbitral factfinding is generally not equivalent to judicial factfinding. . . . [T]he record of the arbitration proceedings is not as complete; the usual rules of evidence do not apply; and rights and procedures common to civil trials, such as discovery, compulsory process, cross-examination, and testimony under oath, are often severely limited or unavailable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>West Branch, </em>466 U.S. 284, 291, 104 S. Ct. 1799, 80 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1984). This court also has distinguished arbitration from judicial proceedings, concluding that an arbitration proceeding is not an \u201caction\u201d for purposes of the statute of limitations. See <em>Dayco Corp. </em>v. <em>Fred T. Roberts &amp; Co., </em>192 Conn. 497, 503, 472 A.2d 780 (1984). In doing so, the court concluded that \u201carbitration proceedings do not occur in court, indeed that their very purpose is to avoid the formalities, the delay, the expense and vexation of ordinary litigation. . . . [T]hese proceedings are not governed by our rules of procedure. . . . [A]n arbitration proceeding is not an action within the meaning of that word as used in the [s]tatute of [limitations.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">An examination of the arbitration proceeding in the present case supports our conclusion that the arbitration proceeding was not conducted as a trial. Although the arbitrator stated in his decision that \u201c[this] hearing was held in the form of a summary trial,\u201d no witnesses testified for either party and no formal exhibits were offered. The parties merely submitted copies of a police report, photographs, transcripts of depositions, medical reports and medical bills. The parties also summarized their respective cases through their counsel. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>reviewing all of the information provided, the arbitrator issued his nonbinding award. The arbitration proceedings in this case differed greatly from a trial. The procedures were informal and parties were allowed to present unsworn evidence. None of the rules of evidence applied in this proceeding. In addition, the proceeding was presided over by a nonjudicial officer, whose decision was not binding on the parties. The court-mandated arbitration proceeding in this case did not constitute a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">An examination of the definition of the word \u201ctrial\u201d found in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary further supports our conclusion that arbitration proceedings do not constitute a trial for the purposes of \u00a7 52-192a (b). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) defines trial as \u201c[a] formal judicial examination of evidence and determination of legal claims in an adversary proceeding.\u201d It further defines \u201cjudicial\u201d as \u201c[o]f or relating to, or by the court\u201d and \u201cdetermination\u201d as \u201c[a] final decision by a court or administrative agency . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. The court-mandated arbitration proceeding in this case was not formal, was not presided over by a judge, and did not result in a binding determination of any of the legal claims. The arbitration proceeding therefore did not constitute a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The absence of any express language referring to arbitration proceedings in \u00a7 52-192a (b) further confirms our conclusion that offer of judgment interest does not apply to judgments resulting from arbitration awards. The legislature has adopted several statutes that establish procedures for converting arbitration awards into judgments of the court. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-549z (a); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-417 et seq. Section 52-417 et seq., which provide generally applicable procedures for confirming, vacating and modifying arbitration awards by court order, were enacted prior to the legislature\u2019s adoption of the offer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>judgment statute. The legislature was, therefore, aware that arbitration awards can result in judgments of the court when it adopted \u00a7 52-192a (b). \u201cThe legislature is presumed to be aware and to have knowledge of all existing statutes and the effect which its own action or nonaction may have on them. <em>Windham First Taxing District </em>v. Windham, 208 Conn. 543, 554, 546 A.2d 226 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 386, 698 A.2d 859 (1997). Despite its awareness that arbitration decisions can become judgments of the court, the legislature did not include judgments on arbitration awards within the express provisions of \u00a7 52-192a (b). Furthermore, the legislature has not amended \u00a7 52-192a (b) to include court-mandated arbitration proceedings since it adopted the statutes providing for court-mandated arbitration proceedings in 1982. The legislature\u2019s failure to include arbitration proceedings in the express language of \u00a7 52-192a (b) supports our conclusion that the legislature did not intend offer of judgment interest to apply to judgments resulting from arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The legislative history of the statutes providing for court-mandated arbitration provides strong support for our conclusion that \u00a7 52-192a (b) does not apply to judgments resulting from that arbitration process. This legislative history demonstrates that the legislature intended these arbitration proceedings to be a form of alternate dispute resolution designed to assist parties to settle cases voluntarily. In 1997, during the course of the legislative debates concerning the enactment of the bill that later amended \u00a7 52-549u, the members of the House of Representatives discussed the purpose of the court-mandated arbitration proceedings. In the course of the debate, Representative Michael P. Lawlor, a proponent of the bill, was asked why the rules of evidence would not apply in these arbitration proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ings. 40 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4,1997 Sess., p. 1391. Representative Lawlor replied that \u201c[t]his whole process of arbitration is an alternate dispute resolution mechanism which [is] intended to avoid unnecessary court delays. <em>In effect these are the two parties sitting down with an impartial hearing officer to figure out if there is a resolution to the ease which would avoid a lengthy and expensive trial. . . . [T]his is what you might consideran elaborate pre-trial discussion.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., pp. 1391-92. Representative Lawlor went on to indicate that the purpose of the legislation was \u201cessentially trying to encourage as many people as possible to go this route for a relatively small case where there are relatively simple issues at hand.\u201d Id., p. 1393. Representative Lawlor\u2019s comments clearly indicate that the legislature did not understand these arbitration proceedings to be a trial, or its equivalent. To the contrary, we conclude that the legislature intended these arbitration proceedings to be a desirable, informal means of resolving disputes <em>before </em>trial. The legislature\u2019s understanding of these arbitration proceedings as a form of alternate dispute resolution, the use of which the legislature wanted to encourage, further supports our conclusion that \u00a7 52-592a (b) does not apply to a judgment entered as a result of court-mandated arbitration proceedings because, if the statute did apply, the parties would have an incentive to reject the arbitrator\u2019s award and seek a trial de novo in order to avoid the payment of offer of judgment interest. This result would contravene the legislature\u2019s intention in adopting court-mandated arbitration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The punitive nature of the offer of judgment statute also reinforces our conclusion that \u00a7 52-549u does not apply to arbitration judgments. The punitive nature of \u00a7 52-192a has been recognized repeatedly. \u201cAn award of interest pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (b) is punitive in nature .... <em>Crowther </em>v. <em>Gerber Garment Technology, Inc., </em>8 Conn. App. 254, 267, 513 A.2d 144 (1986); <em>Kusha </em>v. <em>Respondowski, </em>3 Conn. App. 570, 574, 490 A.2d 1014 (1985). . . . This interest is mandated when the amount recovered is greater than or equal to the offer of judgment; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (b); and that amount can include interest and attorney\u2019s fees; <em>Crowther </em>v. <em>Gerber Garment Technology, Inc., </em>supra, 270-71; as well as double or treble damages. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent a Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 301, 307, 472 A.2d 316 (1984).\u201d <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>21 Conn. App. 549, 554, 575 A.2d 230, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 815, 576 A.2d 544 (1990). The offer of judgment statute was \u201cenacted to promote fair and reasonable pretrial compromises of litigation\u201d by penalizing defendants who do not settle cases prior to trial. <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>22 Conn. App. 640, 651, 579 A.2d 545, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 820, 581 A.2d 1055 (1990). By awarding 12 percent interest on all amounts recovered, including interest and attorney\u2019s fees, \u00a7 52-192a \u201cimposes a penalty for wasting this state\u2019s judicial resources . . . [and serves as] an indigenous procedural device for promoting judicial economy . . . .\u201d Id., 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The punitive nature of the offer of judgment statute is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intention in enacting court-mandated arbitration. The legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>encourage parties in fairly simple cases to use the arbitration proceeding to resolve cases without the need for lengthy and expensive trials. 40 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 1391-92. Imposing a substantial penalty on a defendant who voluntarily settles a case as a result of court-mandated arbitration would both discourage such settlements and encourage demands for trials de novo. Both of these consequences would be in contrast to the legislative purpose to promote court-mandated arbitration as an additional method of alternate dispute resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a provides: \u201c(a) After commencement of any civil action based upon contract or seeking the recovery of money damages, whether or not other relief is sought, the plaintiff may before trial file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 signed by him or his attorney, directed to the defendant or his attorney, offering to settle the claim underlying the action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain. The plain\u00fcff shall give notice of the offer of settlement to the defendant\u2019s attorney, or if the defendant is not represented by an attorney, to the defendant himself. Within thirty days after being notified of the filing of the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the defendant or his attorney may file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018acceptance of offer of judgment\u2019 agreeing to a stipulation for judgment as contained in plaintiff\u2019s \u2018offer of judgment\u2019. Upon such filing, the clerk shall enter judgment immediately on the stipulation. If the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 is not accepted within thirty days and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the \u201coffer of judgment\u201d shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled. Any such \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 and any \u2018acceptance of offer of judgment\u2019 shall be included by the clerk in the record of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">\u201c(b) After trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an \u2018offer of judgment,\u2019 which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain stated in his \u2018offer of judgment\u2019, the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount, computed from the date such offer was filed in actions commenced before October 1, 1981. In those actions commenced on or after October 1, 1981, the interest shall be computed from the date the complaint in the civil action was filed with the court if the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 was filed not later than eighteen months from the filing of such complaint. If such offer was filed later than eighteen months from the date of filing of the complaint, the interest shall be computed from the date the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 was filed. The court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars, and shall render judgment accordingly. This section shall not be interpreted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>abrogate <em>the </em>contractual rights of any party concerning the <em>recovery </em>of attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the provisions of any written contract between the parties to the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Section 52-192a was amended by No. 01-71, \u00a7 1, of the 2001 Public Acts, to require any offer of judgment to be filed not later than thirty days prior to trial.

J., and ZARELLA, J., join, dissenting. At the core of this opinion is whether the offer of judgment statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a, applies to court-mandated arbitration proceedings commenced pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-549u. Today, based upon the \u201cplain\u201d language of \u00a7 52-192a and the legislative history of that statute, the majority concludes that \u00a7 52-192a does not apply to court-mandated arbitration proceedings. Because I disagree with this conclusion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">The majority places heavy emphasis on the punitive nature of \u00a7 52-192a, concluding that applying the statute to court-mandated arbitration proceedings would undermine the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting court-mandated arbitration, namely, to provide an incentive to parties to \u201csettle cases voluntarily.\u201d The majority also focuses on the phrase \u201cafter trial\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 52-192a (b), concluding that it <em>necessarily </em>refers to a judicial proceeding that is presided over by <em>a judge </em>and formally governed by the mies of evidence, not to a court-mandated arbitration proceeding that is presided over by a nonjudicial officer in which a formal application of the rules of evidence is not required. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ingly, the majority concludes that the arbitration proceeding in this case was not a trial, and therefore, that the offer of judgment statute does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Although I agree with the majority that one <em>effect </em>of the arbitration program is that it aids in settling cases, I disagree that that is the primary purpose of the program. More importantly, I fail to see how a goal of encouraging parties to settle cases voluntarily applies in the context of this case in which neither party <em>elected </em>to participate in the arbitration program. Furthermore, I do not agree that the punitive effect of \u00a7 52-192a undermines \u00a7 52-549u. Finally, although the language of \u00a7 52-192a is hardly a model of clarity, I do not read the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201ctrial\u201d as narrowly as the majority. Accordingly, I believe that mandatory arbitration proceedings constitute \u201ctrials\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-192a.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">My analysis begins with the purpose of \u00a7 52-192a. \u201cIn all litigation, a party faces the potential adverse consequences of a defeat, including the expense of a trial and costs. Section 52-192a provides an additional incentive to settle a lawsuit and avoid a trial in certain cases by imposing an increased penalty upon a nonsettling litigant.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Marmon Group, Inc., </em>562 F. Sup. 856, 859 (D. Conn. 1983); see also <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 301, 305, 472 A.2d 316 (1984) (purpose of \u00a7 52-192a is encouragement of settlements); <em>Lutynski </em>v. <em>B. B. &amp; J. Trucking, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 806, 814, 628 A.2d 1 (1993) (statute \u201cencourage[s] early, fair, and reasonable settlements and . . . encourage[s] plaintiffs to make offers of judgments promptly\u201d by penalizing defendants who do not settle cases prior to trial), aff'd, 229 Conn. 525, 642 A.2d 7 (1994). As the majority correctly notes, quoting <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>22 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>App. 640, 655, 579 A.2d 545, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 820, 581 A.2d 1055 (1990), \u201c\u00a7 52-192a \u2018imposes a penalty for wasting this state\u2019s judicial resources . . . [and serves] as an indigenous procedural device for promoting judicial economy ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\u201cConsistent with this broad statutory intent, \u00a7 52-192a (a) authorizes a plaintiff\u2019s offer of judgment . . . [in] <em>any </em>civil action based upon contract or for the recovery of money . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 305. Thus, the plain language of this provision grants a plaintiff the unqualified right to submit an offer of judgment to a defendant in <em>any contract action </em>for the recoveiy of money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No distinction is made between actions in which a trial judge presides and actions in which a trial judge refers the case to an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The issue is whether the purpose of \u00a7 52-192a can be accomplished without undermining the goal of arbitration. Unlike the majority, I consider that both statutes can be accommodated. First, although I recognize that settling cases may be one <em>effect </em>of arbitration in general, and indeed, an ancillary benefit of \u00a7 52-549u, I do not agree that that is the <em>primary </em>goal of \u00a7 52-549u. The legislative history of \u00a7 52-549u indicates that the primary goal in enacting \u00a7 52-549u was to <em>reduce the backlog of civil jury cases, </em>independent of the issue of settlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See 25 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1982 Sess., p. 3658, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>remarks of Senator Howard T.

On the contrary, I believe that, in the context of a mandatory arbitration program, as utilized in this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the punitive component of \u00a7 52-192a used to encourage settlement, and thereby avoid wasting scarce judicial resources, can be harmonized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>with the goal of \u00a7 52-549u to reduce court backlog. Indeed, just as judicial resources are wasted in jury-cases, they too are wasted, admittedly to a lesser degree, in court-mandated arbitration proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Furthermore, I disagree with the majority that if \u00a7 52-192a were to apply in court-mandated arbitration proceedings, \u201cthe parties would have an incentive to reject the arbitrator\u2019s award and seek a trial de novo in order to avoid the payment of offer of judgment interest.\u201d I am hard pressed to believe that a defendant against whom the arbitrator has ruled would seek a new trial and the attendant expenses <em>simply </em>to avoid prejudgment interest. Moreover, should that unlikely event occur, the successful plaintiff would be free to waive the prejudgment interest in exchange for the binding \u201cjudgment of the court . . . .\u201d See Practice Book \u00a7 23-66 (a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">I now turn to the issue of whether mandatory arbitration proceedings constitute \u201ctrials\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-192a. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-192a, in defining the guidelines for calculating the interest award to be levied against the defendant for nonacceptance of the plaintiffs offer of judgment, refers to a \u201ctrial.\u201d In its discussion of the significance of the use of the word trial, the majority states that the term refers to \u201c[a] <em>forma1 judicial </em>examination of evidence and determination of legal claims in an adversary proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority concludes that because \u201cthe court-mandated arbitration proceeding in this case was not formal, was not presided over by a judge, and did not result in a binding determination of any of the legal claims,\u201d it was not a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>First, although I agree that the term trial <em>generally </em>refers to a formal judicial proceeding,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 do not agree that this is its <em>only </em>meaning. Cf. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 306 (term \u201cverdict\u201d has more than one meaning). The word trial has been defined as \u201c \u2018the investigation and decision of a matter in issue between parties <em>before a competent tribunal, </em>including all the steps taken in the case from its submission to the court or jury to the rendition of judgment.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Tureck </em>v. <em>George, </em>44 Conn. App. 154, 157, 687 A.2d 1309, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 914, 691 A.2d 1080 (1997), quoting 88 C.J.S., Trial \u00a7 1 (1955); see also 75 Am. Jur. 2d, Trial \u00a7 1 (1991) (defining trial as \u201ca judicial <em>investigation </em>and determination of the issues between the parties to an action\u201d [emphasis added]). The phrase \u201cafter trial\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 52-192a (b) has been defined simply as referring to a \u201cfinal judgment . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tureck </em>v. <em>George, </em>supra, 162. In this case, there was an investigation by a competent tribunal, the arbitrator. In addition, I believe that this proceeding was judicial in nature because it took place at the direction and under the guidance of the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>over, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the arbitration proceeding in this case did not result in any binding determination of any legal claims is not accurate. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-66 (a), \u201ca decision of the arbitrator shall become a <em>judgment of the court </em>if no claim for trial de novo is filed in accordance with subsection (c).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 23-66 (c) provides in part that \u201c[a] claim for a trial de novo must be filed with the court clerk within twenty days of the filing of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. . . .\u2019\u2019In this case, the plaintiff did not file a claim for a trial de novo. Accordingly, the decision of the arbitrator was a binding final judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Furthermore, I believe that the majority\u2019s narrow interpretation of the word trial is inconsistent with this court\u2019s precedent in which we have interpreted terms under \u00a7 52-192a broadly. In <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 305-306, this court examined the word \u201cverdict\u201d as it was used in the revision of \u00a7 52-192a (b) that existed at the time of the 1982 trial court judgment in that case. The court concluded that under \u00a7 52-192a (b), verdict referred not only to jury trials, as that term generally connotes, but to court trials as well, despite the fact that the statute did not expressly specify that it applied to court cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 305. Specifically, the court noted that \u00a7 52-192a (a) authorized a plaintiffs offer of judgment in \u201cany civil action . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. On that basis, the court concluded that \u201c[tjhese broad statutory provisions should not be undermined solely because \u00a7 52-192a (b), in determining the penalty for nonacceptance of a plaintiffs offer of judgment, refers to a \u2018verdict.\u2019 \u201d Id., citing <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Marmon Group, Inc., </em>supra, 562 F. Sup. 859-60. Similarly, in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>case, I believe that we should interpret the term trial broadly to refer not only to court cases, but to court-mandated arbitration proceedings as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Second, the majority\u2019s reliance on the informal application of the rules of evidence in support of its conclusion that the arbitration proceeding did not constitute a trial is misplaced.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, in juvenile proceedings, courts routinely relax their \u201cstrict application of the formal rules of evidence to reflect the informal nature of juvenile proceedings,\u201d yet such actions are still considered trials. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 1-1 (b), commentary; see also Practice Book \u00a7 34-2 (a) (juvenile proceedings are essentially civil in nature and should \u201cat all times be as informal as the requirements of due process and fairness permit\u201d); <em>In re Jessica B., </em>50 Conn. App. 554, 571, 718 A.2d 997 (1998) (formal rules of evidence given \u201c \u2018liberal interpretation\u2019 \u201d); <em>In re Cynthia A., </em>8 Conn. App. 656, 662, 514 A.2d 360 (1986) (inpermitting hearsay evidence to be admitted, court noted that \u201cin juvenile proceedings certain procedural informalities are constitutionally permissible, allowing, for example, the liberal interpretation of the formal rules of evidence as long as due process standards are observed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The majority also makes much of the fact that the parties stipulated to all the evidence, indicating that this impacts the determination of whether the arbitration proceeding constituted a trial. Parties are entitled to stipulate to evidence. In fact, trial courts routinely allow parties to do so. Accordingly, I fail to see how this controls the issue of whether the proceeding at issue constituted a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Third, the fact that the proceeding was presided over by an arbitrator does not dictate whether there was a trial because the parties in this case did not <em>voluntarily </em>proceed to arbitration. Indeed, as noted previously, the trial court, exercising its discretion under to \u00a7 52-549u, referred this case to the arbitrator under its mandatory arbitration program. There was no agreement by the parties to proceed to arbitration with the goal of settling the case. Moreover, the decision by the parties not to file a claim for a trial de novo is no more or less a settlement than a decision by the parties not to appeal from a judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Finally, under Practice Book \u00a7 23-66 (a) and (c), the parties in this action were entitled to file a claim for a trial de novo within twenty days following the filing of the judgment by the arbitrator. The phrase, \u201ctrial de novo\u201d clearly suggests that the arbitration proceeding was, in fact, a trial. Indeed, the legislative history of \u00a7 52-549u supports this view. During debate in the House of Representatives, Representative Michael P. Lawlor stated that \u201cany finding of an arbitrator shall not be admissible in a <em>subsequent trial\u2014what lawyers call a trial [de novo] or a trial from scratch </em>.... [Ejvery party who is affected by such an arbitration decision shall have a right to elect a <em>trial, another trial, a new trial, a trial [de novo].\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 40 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1997 Sess., p. 1388. Therefore, I do not agree with the majority that the arbitration proceeding in this case did not constitute a trial. Accordingly, I believe that \u00a7 52-192a, read in its totality, encompasses court-mandated arbitration proceedings. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Marmon Group, Inc., </em>supra, 562 F. Sup. 858 (\u00a7 52-192 \u201cclearly creates a <em>substantive </em>statutory right .... Rather than governing merely the manner and means of pursuing a claim in court, the law creates a right in all civil plaintiffs to claim interest on responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>settlement offers . . . .\u201d [Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Lutynski </em>v. <em>B. B. &amp; J. Trucking, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 812 (\u201can award of interest under \u00a7 52-192a is mandatory, and the application of [the statute] does not depend on an analysis of the underlying circumstances of the case or a determination of the facts\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In conclusion, because I believe that the offer of judgment statute should apply to court-mandated arbitration proceedings, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> In this case, all parties agree that the arbitration proceeding constituted a civil action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\"> In 1997, the legislature amended \u00a7 52-549u.

On the floor of the House of Representatives, Representative Lawlor was asked why, under the 1997 bill, the rules of evidence would no longer govern mandatory arbitration proceedings. He responded in general terms noting that the <em>\u201cwhole process of arbitration </em>is an alternate dispute resolution mechanism <em>which [was] intended to avoid unnecessary court delays. </em>In effect these are the two parties sitting down with an impartial hearing officer to figure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>out. if there is a resolution to the case which would <em>avoid a lengthy and expensive trial. </em>I suppose <em>on one level </em>this is what you might consider an elaborate pre-trial discussion. ... If it, the current system, is to employ these strict rules of evidence which requires people to make objections against hearsay and other things . . . [i]t makes it a much more formal and therefore, <em>a lengthy process. </em>... So we\u2019re trying to balance <em>our interest in a speedy resolution of many cases </em>which really are not that complicated, with every party\u2019s right to a full and fair trial before a jury if they [later] choose.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 40 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1997 Sess., pp. 1391-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Therefore, although I agree that Representative Lawlor believed that arbitration proceedings, in general, had the <em>effect </em>of encouraging people to settle cases due to their informal nature, it is clear to me that he believed the purpose of the arbitration program was to dispose of uncomplicated cases quickly. Indeed, eliminating the requirement that the rules of evidence must govern arbitration proceedings aids in this goal because cases can be resolved faster, enabling a greater number of cases to be referred from the trial court to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">As I have indicated; see footnote 2 of this dissent; in 1997, the legislature added the following language to \u00a7 52-549u: <em>\u201cAny party </em>may petition the court to become eligible to participate in the arbitration process . . . .\u201d [Emphasis added.) P.A. 97-24, \u00a7 2. Prior to that amendment, only \u201ca court, in its discretion\u201d could refer a case to an arbitrator. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 52-549u. Accordingly, when one or both parties <em>elect </em>to participate in the arbitration program, I agree that the legislature likely intended to encourage parties to resolve cases voluntarily without a lengthy and expensive trial. Indeed, this would also help to reduce the backlog of civil jury cases. When the parties have not agreed to participate in the arbitrat ion program, however, and, in fact, have been <em>mandated </em>by the court to proceed down that path, I fail to see how they necessarily have any intent to settle the case voluntarily. Therefore, I do not agree with the majority that <em>mandatory </em>arbitration promotes the <em>voluntary settlement </em>of cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> As noted previously, all parties in this case agree that the arbitration proceeding was <em>court-manda ted </em>and that neither party had elected to participate. in the arbitration process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\"> Arbitrators are paid $100 per day and an additional $25 for each decision filed with the court.

This informality is indeed more consistent with how this dissent views trials, as discussed subsequently herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> It is also important to note that the arbitrator <em>expressly </em>referred to the proceeding as a \u201csummary trial\u201d in his memorandum of decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> Section 52-192a (a) has since been amended and now expressly includes the phrase \u201cprior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury <em>or an award by the court </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Lawlor (amendment \u201celiminates the requirement which has been the case up until now that the rules of evidence shall govern the proceedings\u201d). This requirement was eliminated in order to speed up the arbitration process. Id., p. 1392.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
