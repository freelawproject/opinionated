We dismiss the appeal because the claims presented by the defendant do not present colorable claims of double jeopardy that support this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">In 1997, the defendant was charged with assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (4), kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), and conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree and kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a), 53a-59 (a) and 53a-92 (a). The defendant pleaded guilty to the charged offenses. The sentencing court, <em>Dean, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence on all convictions of twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>five years imprisonment, execution suspended after eleven years, followed by five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Subsequently, following the death of the victim in November, 1998, the state filed this information charging the defendant with manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1). The defendant moved to dismiss this second prosecution on the grounds that it violated the principles of double jeopardy and due process under the federal and state constitutions. The trial court, <em>Nigro, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The following facts and procedural history, as set forth by the trial court, are relevant to this appeal. \u201c[The defendant], together with [three] others, had been arrested on July 29, 1995, because of an assault on the victim .... The assault occurred in the evening hours of July 28, 1995. Among other injuries resulting from the assault, the victim sustained a severe craniocerebral trauma and, shortly after the assault, lapsed into a coma of several months duration. He slowly regained some consciousness in mid-December of 1995, but remained hospitalized in a \u2018vegetative\u2019 state. He was fed intravenously and breathed with the assistance of a respirator through a tracheal tube. He lingered as a patient in a rehabilitative hospital in this condition until his death on November 23, 1998. The autopsy Usted the cause of death as \u2018delayed medical complications of craniocerebral trauma\u2019 and the manner of death as [a] \u2018homicide.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">\u201cIn March, 1997, while the victim was still hospitalized, the state filed [an] amended [information] against [the defendant] charging the crimes of (1) assault in the first degree while aided by two or more persons actually present and by means of a dangerous instrument; (2) kidnapping in the first degree; and (3) conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree and kidnapping in the first degree. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u201cOn May 15, 1997, the defendant . . . entered a plea of guilty to each of the three counts. On August 5, 1997, [the defendant] was sentenced on the kidnapping in the first degree count to incarceration for twenty-five years, execution suspended after eleven years, and probation on the unexecuted portion for five years. On the counts of assault in the first degree and conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, the defendant was sentenced to eleven years on each count to run concurrently with the kidnapping count, to a total effective sentence of twenty-five years, suspended after eleven years, and probation [on] the unexecuted portion of the sentence for five years.\u201d At both the May 15, 1997 and August 5, 1997 hearings, the state explicitly reserved its right to bring appropriate homicide charges in the event that the victim died.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The trial court also stated: \u201cAfter the death of the victim . . . the state secured the issuance of [an] arrest [warrant] charging [the defendant] with the crime of manslaughter in the first degree. It is the information filed on the basis of [this warrant], alleging that with intent to cause serious physical injury to [the victim], he caused the death of [the victim], that [the defendant] seeks to have dismissed.\u201d The trial court determined that the subsequent prosecution for manslaughter did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional protection against double jeopardy or violate his due process rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The defendant claims that the state cannot now seek to impose additional punishment for the death of the victim because he already has been sentenced for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>participation in the beating that led to the victim\u2019s death. According to the defendant, the imposition of additional punishment in connection with that beating would violate the multiple punishments prong of the double jeopardy clause. We conclude that the defendant has misconstrued our double jeopardy jurisprudence, and in doing so, has failed to proffer a colorable double jeopardy claim that supports an interlocutory appeal. Thus, this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider this interlocutory appeal under our final judgment jurisprudence. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d The double jeopardy clause is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. See <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969). \u201cAlthough the Connecticut constitution has no specific double jeopardy provision, we have held that the due process guarantees of article first, \u00a7 9, include protection against double jeopardy. <em>Kohlfuss </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>149 Conn. 692, 695, 183 A.2d 626, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 928, 83 S. Ct. 298, 9 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1962).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 706, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>231 Conn. 545, 550, 651 A.2d 1264 (1995) (right to protection against double jeopardy is implicit in due process guarantees of state constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">It is axiomatic that appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>230 Conn. 441, 447-48, 645 A.2d 978 (1994); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>also General Statutes \u00a7 52-263.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we have stated, however, \u201c[t]here is a small class of cases that meets the test of being effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment and therefore, is subject to interlocutory review. The paradigmatic case in this group involves the right against double jeopardy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>178 Conn. 67, 420 A.2d 1153, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 950, 100 S. Ct. 423, 62 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1979). <em>Because jeopardy attaches at the commencement of trial, to be vindicated at all, a colorable double jeopardy claim must be addressed by way of interlocutory review. The right not to be tried necessarily falls into the category of rights that can be enjoyed only if vindicated prior to trial, and, consequently, falls within the second prong of State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983) (otherwise interlocutory order appealable in two circumstances: [1] where order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or [2] where order or action so concludes rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them). See <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>253 Conn. 134, 167, 749 A.2d 1147 (2000) (because criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional double jeopardy right includes right not even to be tried for same offense, denial of motion to dismiss criminal charges, filed on basis of colorable claim of double jeopardy, is immediately appealable final judgment under second prong of <em>Curdo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">\u201cWe have entertained several interlocutory appeals from denials of motions to dismiss based on double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>jeopardy claims. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 305-309, 488 A.2d 778 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>189 Conn. 416, 425, 456 A.2d 279, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 124, 78 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Seravalli, </em>189 Conn. 201, 206 n.6, 455 A.2d 852, cert. dismissed, 461 U.S. 920, 103 S. Ct. 2076, 77 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1983). That constitutional right not only protects against being twice punished but also is a guarantee against being twice put to trial for the same offense. <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 661, 97 S. Ct. 2034, 52 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1977). The only real question is whether the double jeopardy claim is colorable.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>256 Conn. 262, 275-76, 773 A.2d 308 (2001). \u201cFor a claim to be colorable, the defendant need not convince the trial court that he necessarily will prevail; he must demonstrate simply that he <em>might </em>prevail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 276-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In the present appeal, the defendant\u2019s claim that the state cannot now seek additional punishment by bringing manslaughter charges because to do so would violate the multiple punishments prong of the double jeopardy clause does not satisfy this minimal standard. As we have stated: \u201cThe constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy serves three separate functions: (1) It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. [2] It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [3] And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense [in a single trial]. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969) [overruled on other grounds, <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 109 S. Ct. 2201, 104 L. Ed. 2d 865 (1989)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>237 Conn. 81, 99, 675 A.2d 866 (1996). The first two prongs, or functions, may be regarded as constituting the \u201csuccessive prosecution\u201d part of the double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>jeopardy protection. The third prong, which is analytically different from the first two, involves multiple punishments for the same offense in a single prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The rationale for the rule permitting a criminal defendant to file an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is based on the first two prongs of the double jeopardy protection\u2014protections against successive prosecution for the same offense, namely, (1) a subsequent prosecution after a prior acquittal, and (2) a subsequent prosecution after a prior conviction. The rationale is that those two prongs prevent a defendant even from having to go through a second trial. \u201c[T]he [s]tate with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>221 Conn. 685, 698, 607 A.2d 376, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 923, 113 S. Ct. 344, 121 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1992). Thus, in order to give meaning to the successive prosecution part of the protection against double jeopardy, we permit a defendant to file an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss so long as that motion presents a colorable double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Indeed, our cases involving such interlocutory appeals are all cases in which the defendant had made a colorable <em>successive prosecution </em>double jeopardy claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On occasion, however, this court has entertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>interlocutory appeals that have not fallen within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>successive prosecution rubric. These cases have involved administrative proceedings followed by criminal charges, in which the defendants based their double jeopardy claims on a multiple punishments, rather than a successive prosecutions, argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although we may have analyzed these cases under the third, or multiple punishments, prong of our double jeopardy jurisprudence, what these defendants essentially sought was immunity <em>even from being tried </em>on the criminal charges, which is consistent with the rationale for permitting interlocutory appeals in the successive prosecution context.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the extent, however, that these cases suggest that a double jeopardy claim of <em>multiple punishment, </em>rather than successive prosecution, may be appealed interlocutorily, they are overruled because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>multiple punishment claim is simply inconsistent with the rationale for such an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim is not of the successive prosecution type. It is a claim based on the multiple punishments prong of our double jeopardy jurisprudence. The defendant does not claim that he may not be forced to undergo a trial for the current charges; he claims only that he may not be punished for those charges. Indeed, in his brief and at oral argument before this court, the defendant specifically conceded that he may be tried on the manslaughter charge. Thus, his claim simply does not fall within the rationale for permitting an interlocutory appeal, and he must await a final judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The defendant also claims that his guilty plea and conviction on the charge of assault in the first degree, in which the sentencing court considered the likelihood that the victim would die because of the severity of the beating, collaterally estops the state from seeking additional punishment based on the fact that the victim subsequently died. This claim involves the collateral estoppel branch of double jeopardy jurisprudence; see <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 445, 90 S. Ct. 1189, 25 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1970) (fifth amendment guarantee against double jeopardy embodies collateral estoppel as constitutional requirement); which, unlike his other claims, does involve the successive prosecution aspect of double jeopardy. We conclude, nonetheless, that his claim does not present a colorable double jeopardy claim and, therefore, does not support this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">\u201cCollateral estoppel is given constitutional dimensions by the double jeopardy clause. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>[223 Conn. 384, 388, 614 A.2d 401 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 972, 113 S. Ct. 1414, 122 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1993)]. In a criminal case, collateral estoppel is a protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>included in the fifth amendment guarantee against double jeopardy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>215 Conn. 570, 584, 577 A.2d 1000 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1089, 111 S. Ct. 968, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1054 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>247 Conn. 662, 675, 725 A.2d 316 (1999). Collateral estoppel \u201cmeans simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>supra, 397 U.S. 443. \u201cTo establish whether collateral estoppel applies, the court must determine <em>what facts were necessarily determined in the first trial, </em>and must then assess whether the government is attempting to relitigate those facts in the second proceeding. ... A defendant who seeks to protect himself from being retried pursuant to the principles of collateral estoppel carries the burden of establishing that the issue he seeks to foreclose from consideration in the second case was necessarily <em>resolved in his favor </em>in the prior proceeding.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The very foundation of a colorable double jeopardy collateral estoppel claim is that the defendant was <em>tried and acquitted </em>on the issue that he now seeks to prevent the state from relitigating. The defendant cannot meet this standard because there was no prior trial, only a guilty plea, and there was no acquittal, only a conviction. The defendant, therefore, has failed to proffer a colorable collateral estoppel claim under our double jeopardy jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-10\"> The defendant appealed from the ruling of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty o\u00ed manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or o\u00ed a third person; or (2) with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person under circumstances which do not constitute murder because he committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, as provided in subsection (a) of section 53a-54a, except that the fact that homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance constitutes a mitigating circumstance reducing murder to manslaughter in the first degree and need not be proved in any prosecution initiated under this subsection; or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">\u201c(b) Manslaughter in the first degree is a class B felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\"> We note that the defendant\u2019s due process claim, namely, that he entered into a plea bargain when he pleaded guilty to the charges of assault in the first degree, kidnapping in the first degree, conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the first degree, in the expectation that he would not be prosecuted on any additional charges if the victim later died, is not before this court in this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b793-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides: \u201cUpon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kruelski, </em>250 Conn. 1, 737 A.2d 377 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1168, 120 S.
