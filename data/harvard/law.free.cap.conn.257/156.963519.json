We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. The charges, which resulted in the defendant\u2019s conviction, were brought after the victim, J., the defendant\u2019s granddaughter, divulged to a social worker from the department of children and families (department) that she had been sexually abused by the defendant on several occasions while living in New Haven. The department and the New Haven police conducted an investigation, which resulted in the defendant\u2019s arrest, trial and conviction. On appeal, the defendant argues, inter alia, that he was deprived of his constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution because the trial court excluded evidence regarding the alleged prior sexual abuse of J. by another individual.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The defendant contends that the trial court: (1) deprived him of his constitutional rights to confrontation, to present a defense and to a fair trial when it improperly applied Connecticut\u2019s rape shield statute; General Statutes \u00a7 54-861';<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and denied him the opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>nity to cross-examine witnesses on, or introduce evidence of, the prior sexual abuse of J. to show a possible alternative source of the sexual knowledge she displayed; and (2) improperly allowed three constancy of accusation witnesses to testify regarding the details of the alleged sexual assault in violation of the rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 304-305, 677 A.2d 917 (1996). We agree with the defendant that he is entitled to a new trial because he was denied his constitutional rights to confrontation, to present a defense and to a fair trial when the trial court prohibited him from presenting evidence of J.\u2019s prior sexual abuse where the factual similarities between the present and previous instances could have: (1) demonstrated an alternative source for J.\u2019s sexual knowledge; and (2) resulted in J.\u2019s confusion over the identity of the perpetrator. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>detailed testimony of three constancy of accusation witnesses in violation of the standards governing admission of such testimony set forth in <em>State </em>v. Troupe, supra, 304-305.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the issues on appeal. The victim, J., bom on March 9, 1990, resided in Puerto Rico with her mother, N., and her younger brother, L., until January, 1994. While in Puerto Rico, N., a diagnosed schizophrenic, experienced severe mental health problems rendering her unable to take care of herself or her children. N.\u2019s father, the defendant, went to Pueito Rico and brought her back to New Haven to obtain treatment and counseling. J. and L. remained in Puerto Rico with their father, paternal grandmother and the paternal grandmother\u2019s boyfriend.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1994, N. returned to Puerto Rico with the defendant to seek custody of her children. The record indicates that during the custody proceedings, J. exhibited behavior indicative of having been sexually abused. The court in Puerto Rico found that J.\u2019s paternal grandfather had been sexually abusing her since she was as young as eight months of age.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, the court awarded custody of both children to N. Custody, however, was conditioned upon the court\u2019s order that the family reside with the defendant in Connecticut. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The defendant and his family returned to New Haven in January, 1994.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While living in New Haven, J. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>L. began acting out sexually toward one another. N. reported finding them \u201ctouching and kissing each other.\u201d Concerned that the behavior was linked to the abuse J. had suffered in Puerto Rico, the defendant and N. contacted the department to obtain counseling. Several other organizations also treated J. for the trauma she had incurred as a result of the abuse in Puerto Rico, including the department, Hill Health Center (Hill center), and the Yale New Haven Child Sex Abuse Clinic (Yale clinic).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In April, 1995, the defendant moved his family to a larger apartment. By this time, however, the relationship between the defendant and N. had deteriorated significantly. N. reported to social workers that the defendant was too controlling, that his punishment of the children was too severe and that he had a violent temper. In May, 1995, N. went to the department and explained to social workers there her fear of the defendant. As a result, police escorted N. to the defendant\u2019s apartment to remove her belongings and those of the children. N. took the children and moved out of the defendant\u2019s home. The family moved to Willimantic, where J.\u2019s maternal grandmother lived with N.\u2019s older son. After temporarily residing with her mother, N. moved to her own apartment with her two younger children. The family did not see the defendant again after moving out of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Social workers employed by the department in Willimantic continued to treat the family after their move from New Haven. According to social worker Syndia Serrano, the focus of J. \u2019s treatment was the sexual abuse that she had suffered while living in Puerto Rico. J. and L. were also taught how to cope with their mother\u2019s mental illness. Social workers continued to observe N.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>neglect of the children, however, despite her continued treatment. As a result, in March, 1996, while the family was still under the care and monitoring of the department, the commissioner filed a petition for temporary custody. The children were removed from N.\u2019s care and taken to the department for processing and placement in foster care. On that date, social workers observed \u201csexual play\u201d between J. and L. The children built a \u201ctent,\u201d went inside, and were kissing and touching each other. The observation of that behavior led the department to place the children in separate foster homes. After being removed from N.\u2019s care, J. and her brother continued counseling with the department in Willimantic. During 1994 and 1995, J. was counseled by Serrano, and the two became very close.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Approximately ten months after J. was removed from N.\u2019s care, J. first disclosed to Serrano the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse. Alarmed by the disclosure, Serrano reported to the department\u2019s investigative office that J. told her that \u201cwhen she lived with her mother and [the defendant] in New Haven, [the defendant] would \u2018kiss her all over.\u2019 . . . J. reported that when she told [the defendant] to stop, he would not.\u201d She usually referred to the defendant as \u201cPoppy Santos.\u201d At that time, J. was also in counseling at United Services Counseling Center in Willimantic and had made similar disclosures of the sexual abuse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Michelle Lumb, an investigative social worker, was assigned to the case. Lumb interviewed J. after discussing her history with Serrano. J. told Lumb that the defendant \u201cput his hands and \u2018huevitos\u2019 on her \u2018chocha\u2019.\u201d \u201cHuevitos\u201d is the Spanish word for the male genitalia; \u201cchocha\u201d is the Spanish word for vagina or female genitalia. Lumb showed J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>anatomically correct drawings of a young girl approximately J.\u2019s age and of an older man resembling the defendant. J. told Lumb in Spanish that \u201cPoppy Santos\u201d had \u201cput his \u2018huevitos\u2019 on her \u2018chocha.\u2019 \u201d When Lumb asked J. to circle the areas where the defendant had touched her, she indicated the genital, buttocks and breast areas. When Lumb asked J. to indicate what parts of his body the defendant had used to touch her, she indicated his hands and his genital area.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Lumb contacted the New Haven police department and informed Detective Lisa Fitzgerald of the details of J.\u2019s disclosure. Fitzgerald subsequently contacted the defendant and notified him of the allegations. The defendant denied ever having touched J. in an inappropriate manner. When Fitzgerald contacted N. about the allegations, she was very hostile and said that her daughter was fabricating the story. Fitzgerald contacted clinics and health care facilities that had counseled J., which included the department, the Hill center, and the Yale clinic. In an interview with Florence Fruedenthal of the Yale clinic, Fitzgerald was informed of the prior sexual abuse in Puerto Rico for which J. had been counseled in 1994 and 1995. Fitzgerald noted in her arrest warrant that Fruedenthal \u201cstated that [J.] had stated to her that Rene [Salvia] had touched her here and here pointing to her vaginal and anal area . . . that Rene had touched her with his hand and fingers \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">As part of the investigation, counselors arranged for J. to have a medical examination in order to document any physical manifestation of the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse. In June, 1996, J. was accompanied by Serrano to the Yale clinic for a physical assessment. Janet Murphy, the examining nurse, was informed of J.\u2019s allegations against the defendant, and that the sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ual abuse was alleged to have occurred during the period from January, 1994 until approximately April, 1995. Thus, at the time of J.\u2019s medical examination, a little more than one year had passed since the alleged abuse. According to Murphy, the physical examination was inconclusive, revealing only some vaginal irritation that could have been caused by any number of factors. Muiphy also noted, however, that J.\u2019s delayed disclosure could have led to the inconclusive findings because any significant injuries caused by the sexual abuse would have had time to heal. Inconclusive findings of that nature are common when there is a delayed disclosure. Muiphy prescribed some cream for the irritation but made no conclusive finding regarding sexual abuse. Despite the lack of physical evidence, Fitzgerald determined that there was probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest in light of J.\u2019s disclosures and the subsequent police investigation. The defendant turned himself in and was charged with the aforementioned offenses. lie entered a plea of not guilty to all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In September, 1996, the defendant filed a pretrial motion for discoveiy and inspection of certain materials and information. That motion, although denied in part, unearthed documents that disclosed J.\u2019s past sexual abuse while in Puerto Rico, and the state stipulated to its occurrence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant filed memoranda in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>support of the admissibility of the past sexual abuse evidence, arguing that it was both necessary and relevant to his defense. Specifically, the defendant sought the introduction of the Hill center records with respect to \u201crelevant declarations made by [J.] regarding her past sexual conduct, previous history of injury and disease caused by someone other than the defendant, [and] her medical and psychiatric interventions and therapeutic treatments.\u201d The Hill center records were offered to show the possible \u201cmental confusion that there might be existing in the victim\u2019s mind with respect to the identity of the alleged peipetrator\u201d since the two incidents both involved grandfather figures and were \u201cnot that remote in time.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant claimed that the prior sexual abuse evidence was \u201cso relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate [his] constitutional rights . . . namely, his right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The defendant\u2019s offer of proof was that the Hill center records would show the similarities between the allegations in both the Puerto Rico and the New Haven incidents of sexual abuse, and that those similarities would show apossible alternative source for J.\u2019s sexual knowledge, an issue critical to his defense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 471 A.2d 949 (1984), the defendant argued in a memorandum submitted to the court that evidence of the prior sexual assaults should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>admitted \u201cto show that [J.] [had] mistakenly accused the [defendant of sex offenses which someone else had committed at previous times . . . .\u201d He also claimed that \u201cadmission of evidence to show a commonality of circumstances of the prior offenses to the ones alleged against him should be allowed, when such prior-offenses are not so remote in time, [are] similar to the offenses charged and are committed by a person that may be similar in [J.\u2019s] mind to the [defendant.\u201d The trial court, <em>Devlin, J., </em>found a reasonable basis for in camera review of the records based on the general rationale of <em>Esposito, </em>despite its factual differences.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In August, 1998, the state filed a motion in limine regarding the admissibility of evidence of sexual conduct, seeking to \u201cprohibit defense counsel from introducing any evidence of and from cross examining [J.] as to her sexual conduct except for that relating to this case and this defendant . . . .\u201d The state argued that the evidence was inadmissible under \u00a7 54-86f, which protects the privacy of victims where the prejudice to the victim far outweighs the probative value of the admissibility of such evidence. Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 53, 644 A.2d 887 (1994), as \u201cdirectly on point,\u201d the state argued that the rape shield statute was meant to \u201cprotect the victim\u2019s personal privacy\u201d and \u201cshield [the victim] from unnecessary harassment and embarrassment\u201d by preventing the admission of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>type <em>of </em>evidence of a sexual assault victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, especially in those cases where there is no issue of mistaken identity. The state asserted, therefore, that there was \u201cno reason why any evidence about what occurred to [J.] [in the past] should be relevant to this particular case.\u201d The state also claimed that the evidence being offered did not meet any of the statutory exceptions to \u00a7 54-86f, was not relevant to any critical issue in the case, did not affect J.\u2019s credibility and did not interfere with the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation and due process because he would have an opportunity to cross-examine J.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The state stressed that prior incidents of sexual abuse could not be brought in \u201cmerely to attack the credibility of [J.] . . . [without satisfying] a clear exception to the rape-shield standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">At a pretrial hearing on the state\u2019s motion, the defendant argued that he had a right to confront J. on several issues including: (1) the source of her sexual knowledge or injuries; (2) her credibility; and (3) the significance of the delay in her disclosure of the abuse. The defendant claimed that the prior sexual abuse J. had suffered in Puerto Rico was substantially similar to the alleged sexual abuse and, therefore, was relevant to show that there may have been either: (1) another source from which J. could have obtained her sexual knowledge (or injury); or (2) a question as to J.\u2019s credibility with respect to the charges because of inconsistencies in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>reporting and similarities between this and past sexual abuse. The defendant claimed that the prior sexual abuse evidence would explain J.\u2019s advanced sexual knowledge and, without it, the state would get \u201cthe upper hand\u201d when it refused to raise the issue on direct examination, thereby precluding cross-examination of J. on that subject. The defendant argued that if the department\u2019s observations and testimony were going to be offered about \u201cwhat [J.\u2019s] grandfather did\u201d without mentioning which grandfather, he would be precluded from asking if \u201c[the] activity happened to her more than once.\u201d Thus, without evidence of the prior abuse, he could not examine any witness, whether on cross-examination or direct, in order to clarify who committed the sexual abuse or whether or not J. simply was confused. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s argument seeking the admission of the alleged exculpatory evidence, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion in limine excluding the prior sexual abuse evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Citing the legislative intent behind \u00a7 54-86f, the state filed additional pretrial motions requesting that the court restrict \u201cdefense counsel from attempting to elicit testimony from witnesses concerning their belief in the truth of [J.\u2019s] assertions [on the grounds that] [t]he credibility of the complaining witness is a matter for the jury to determine . . . .\u201d The state\u2019s motions were intended to prohibit the defendant from \u201cinjectfing] extraneous issues into the case such as matters determined by the court in Puerto Rico or any present issues involving custody in Juvenile Court . . . .\u201d The motions were granted and, thus, the defendant was barred from raising at trial any issue concerning J.\u2019s past sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">At trial, J.\u2019s testimony concerned only the allegations against the defendant. She testified that \u201cPoppy Santos\u201d would \u201ctake [her] into his bedroom,\u201d \u201clock the door\u201d and do \u201cbad stuff . . . [t]hat he wasn\u2019t supposed to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>. . . fresh stuff.\u201d J. testified that the defendant would lock them both in his room and he would try to take her pants off and she would hide or try to escape under the bed. She testified that he would put her in his bed and \u201che\u2019d hold his feet with [her] feet and then he\u2019d hold his hands with [her] hand\u201d and that she could not get up. J. also testified that the defendant would sometime take off both her pants and her underpants, that he would remove his pants and \u201ctry to put his private into [hers],\u201d or that he would touch her private parts with his hands and fingers, and \u201c[i]t hurted.\u201d J. claimed that she would tell the defendant to stop, but he would not. Finally, J. described when the defendant would try to make her touch his \u201cwee-wee,\u201d but that she \u201cwould put [her hands] straight\u201d in order to avoid touching it, because she did not like touching him. On cross-examination, the defendant strictly was limited to questions regarding the current allegations because the state did not raise the issue of prior abuse during J.\u2019s direct testimony. Accordingly, the defendant was unable to question J. regarding issues that might indicate to the jury another source for her mature sexual knowledge. Thus, cross-examination of J. was limited to rehabilitating the defendant\u2019s character by showing that he had a positive relationship with J. that would never lead to such abuse. The defendant\u2019s attempts to elicit inconsistent testimony and call into question J.\u2019s credibility mostly were unsuccessful. J. seemed intimidated by the formal proceedings owing to her young age and her traumatic experiences and was, therefore, uncooperative when the defendant attempted to test her sexual knowledge or elicit testimony that might suggest prior abuse.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The state offered several constancy of accusation witnesses to corroborate J.\u2019s story, including Serrano, Lumb, Fitzgerald, Murphy, and the state\u2019s expert, John Leventhal, a physician with the Yale clinic. Serrano and Lumb both corroborated J.\u2019s testimony. Lumb described the anatomically correct drawings that J. had used to illustrate how the defendant had perpetrated the alleged sexual abuse, and she testified that J. specifically pointed out the hands, buttocks and genital areas on the male and female drawings. Both Serrano and Lumb provided details of their interviews with J. and testified as to the substance of her disclosures. Murphy, also offered as a constancy of accusation witness, repeated the allegations as they were reported to her by the department and put them in the context of J.\u2019s physical examination. Finally, Leventhal, offered as an expert on the reactions and behaviors of children who have been sexually abused, testified on both the physical and psychological manifestations of sexual abuse in a child, generally and as applied to the facts in J.\u2019s case. Leventhal stated that: (1) delayed disclosure is common among child sexual abuse victims; (2) misbehavior on the part of a child could be indicative of sexual abuse; and (3) different kinds of physical manifestations can result from child sexual abuse and not all of them may be detectable through medical examination depending on the extent of the abuse and the passage of time.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Leventhal\u2019s testimony also discussed the inconclusiveness of the medical findings in J.\u2019s case, pointing out that such findings are common in cases where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>is a delay between the abuse and the reporting, or when there is a question as to penetration. The state rested its case after the testimony of Leventhal. The defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The defendant then called several witnesses, all of whom had been instructed, outside the presence of the jury, not to speak about the prior sexual abuse that had occurred in Puerto Rico. The defendant\u2019s wife and other relatives were restricted to testifying only as to the defendant\u2019s good character and his positive relationship with J. Each of them testified that the defendant would not have committed the sexual abuse. Dianabel Aviles, a psychotherapist at the Hill center who had treated J. after her disclosures of the sexual abuse in Puerto Rico, pointed out to the court, in the absence of the jury after the court\u2019s limiting instruction, that \u201c[t]he presenting problem, the identifying problem had to do with what happened in Puerto Rico.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Aviles, nevertheless, was restricted to discussing only her observations of family interaction, her knowledge of the excessive discipline the defendant used with the children as divulged by N., and the deterioration of the relationship between the defendant and N. At the close of his case, the defendant again moved for a judgment of acquittal. The motion was denied. Jury deliberation began on September 28, 1998. On September 29,1998, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court violated his constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution by excluding evidence that J. was sexually abused by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>family member, namely, her paternal grandfather. The defendant claims that subdivision (4) of \u00a7 54-86f allows the admission of J.\u2019s past sexual conduct if it helps to prove a relevant and material issue critical to the defendant\u2019s case that, if excluded, would result in a violation of his constitutional rights. He argues that the court\u2019s exclusion of the prior sexual abuse evidence violated his rights to confrontation, a fair trial and to present a defense by: (1) preventing him from showing an alternate source for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge; and (2) eliminating an entire line of questioning that would have called into question the victim\u2019s credibility. We agree that the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse was critical to the defense and should have been admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We first set forth the standard of review for determining whether the exclusion of this evidence entitles the defendant to a new trial. Upon review of a trial court\u2019s decision, we will set aside an evidentiary ruling only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Provost, </em>251 Conn. 252, 257, 741 A.2d 295 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 822, 121 S. Ct. 65, 148 L. Ed. 2d 30 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 283, 533 A.2d 553 (1987). \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination and [e]very reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. ... To establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>255 Conn. 581, 591, 767 A.2d 1189 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u201cAlthough the outright denial of a defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine a witness on an element of the charged offense implicates the constitutional protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tion of the confrontation clause, such a denial is [still] subject to harmless error analysis . . .

In every criminal case, the defendant has an important interest in being permitted to introduce evidence relevant to his defense. \u201cEvidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>[241 Conn. 784, 788-89, 699 A.2d 91 (1997)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 54, 770 A.2d 908 (2001), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 257, 745 A.2d 800 (2000). \u201cWhenever the rape shield statute\u2019s preclusion of prior sexual conduct is invoked, a question of relevancy arises.

General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f prohibits the admission of a victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, in relevant part, \u201cunless such evidence is (1) offered by the defendant on the issue of whether the defendant was, with respect to the victim, the source of . . . injury, or (2) offered by the defendant on the issue of credibility of the victim, provided the victim has testified on direct examination as to his or her sexual conduct ... or (4) otherwise so relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. . . .\u201d The trial court is vested with wide discretion when considering whether evidence is relevant in a particular case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 549, 613 A.2d 770 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>203 Conn. 385, 392, 524 A.2d 1143 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 54 (evidence of prior sexual conduct of victim that would be inadmissible under other provisions of statute admissible if otherwise so relevant and material to critical issue in case that excluding it would violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). Consequently, whether the record supports a defendant\u2019s offer of proof on the admissibility of a complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct is a matter to be determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis. <em>See State v. Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 704; see also <em>Tague </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>3 F.3d 1133, 1137 (7th Cir. 1993) (although state rape shield statute may be held constitutional on its face, \u201cconstitutionality of such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>law as applied to preclude particular exculpatory evidence remains subject to examination on case by case basis\u201d). \u201cA clear statement of the defendant\u2019s theory of relevance is all important in determining whether the evidence is offered for a permissible purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 43, and the legislative intent underlying \u00a7 54-86f, the state argues that the evidence of J.\u2019s past sexual abuse is irrelevant in this case. The state further argues that the evidence does not fall within any exception to \u00a7 54-86f, does not affect J.\u2019s credibility, and does not interfere with the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights because he will still have the opportunity to cross-examine J.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See id., 50-56. The defendant argues, however, that the \u201calternative source of sexual knowledge theory\u201d is both material and relevant to his claim that J. was confusing him with her grandfather in Puerto Rico because of her young age at the time of the previous assault, the reasonably close proximity in time between the first assault and the current allegations, the similarities between the prior assault and the current allegations, and the fact that the accusations against the defendant arose while J. was being counseled for the prior abuse. Furthermore, the defendant argues that he should be able to prove that if the prior incidents did occur, they could be the basis for J.\u2019s familiarity with sexual intercourse. The prior abuse, as an alternative source of sexual knowledge, may have given J. the experience necessary to create a parallel story with the defendant as the perpetrator. If the evidence is excluded, the defendant will not have the opportunity to cross-exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ine J. on the issue of the source of her sexual knowledge, e.g., whether that knowledge came from the current or former alleged sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The state also relies <em>State v. Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 43, in arguing that the evidence was properly excluded because it was prejudicial to J. and was irrelevant for purposes of this case and this defendant. In <em>Kulmac, </em>the defendant argued that he should be permitted to examine the two young girls charging him with sexual assault regarding past abuse perpetrated against them by their father and, in the case of one of the complainants, two other men. Id., 51. He argued that past sexual abuse evidence \u201cwas relevant to demonstrate that [the complainants] had mistakenly attributed assaults allegedly committed on [them] by other people to the defendant.\u201d Id. He further argued that \u201cthe multiplicity of people who sexually abused the victims created a risk of confusion between, and misidentification of, the various perpetrators. . . . [Therefore] precluding cross-examination on this possibility [of confusion] violated his right to confrontation.\u201d Id., 55.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The trial court excluded the evidence and we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\"><em>Kulmac </em>is distinguishable from the present case, however. The facts of <em>Kulmac </em>indicate that the two victims were subjected to a series of sexual assaults by the defendant over a span of two years, from 1985 to 1987.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Id., 51. The other alleged abuse did not begin until 1987. Furthermore, the victims in <em>Kulmac </em>were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ages fourteen and fifteen at the time of trial; id., 49; an age at which most young adults are less likely to be confused over an individual\u2019s identity and are capable of understanding matters of a sexual nature. According to the trial court, neither victim appeared confused when identifying the defendant as their abuser. \u201cWhether there is a sufficient basis for a claim that a witness is confused, so as to permit cross-examination that would otherwise be inadmissible, is a question of fact that is properly left to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Id., 55. Thus, in a case where the trial court, after observing extensive cross-examination, \u201cexplicitly found that [a] victim [did not appear] confused, and that any abuses committed on [the victim] were too remote in time from the abuses at issue in the trial to cause confusion,\u201d exclusion of the evidence would be justified. Id. In <em>Kulmac, </em>the victims were old enough to understand and clearly articulate the identity of their abuser. J., on the other hand, was significantly younger than the victims in <em>Kulmac. </em>A child of preschool age is much more likely to confuse the identity of her abuser due to the psychological trauma of experiencing sexual abuse at such a young age. In the present case, we do not have the same facts that existed in <em>Kulmac, </em>nor do we have the same clear-cut observations by the trial court. Instead, we conclude that this case presents a sufficient likelihood of confusion to warrant the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the victim on matters of past sexual abuse. Accordingly, we conclude that <em>Kulmac </em>is not controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We look for guidance, therefore, from our sister states. \u201cOther jurisdictions have concluded that evidence of a young victim\u2019s sexual history is relevant where the defendant seeks to admit the evidence to show a source for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge. Specifically, these courts found the evidence relevant to rebut the inference that a child victim could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>describe the sexual acts unless the defendant had committed the alleged acts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grovenstein, </em>340 S.C. 210, 217, 530 S.E.2d 406 (App. 2000), and cases cited therein. \u201cA minority of states refuse to admit such evidence on the grounds [that] it is irrelevant, confusing to the jury, and an invasion of the victim\u2019s privacy.\u201d Id., 218-19, and cases cited therein. The rationale many courts use in justifying their deviation from the strict parameters of rape shield laws is that such evidence is allowable where a victim\u2019s sexual conduct is \u201coffered for a purpose other than to attack the victim\u2019s morality.\u201d Id., 216, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>304 S.C. 300, 301, 403 S.E.2d 677 (App. 1991). This policy is safeguarded by our continued adherence to the rules of evidence, as prescribed by rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides that, even when such evidence is relevant, it \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 164, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Pulizzano, </em>supra, 155 Wis. 2d 633, as an appropriate standard for us to follow. In <em>Pulizzano, </em>the defendant was charged with, and convicted of, four counts of first degree sexual assault after her nephew, M.D., testified that she had had sexual contact with him and three other children, including her own two children and another nephew. The allegations of sexual contact included \u201cfondling, fellatio, [and] anal penetration with an object . . . .\u201d Id., 640-41. At trial, the court excluded expert testimony offered by the defendant that M.D. had suffered a similar sexual assault in the past, the facts of which also included an \u201c \u2018older\u2019 woman\u201d and three men committing \u201cfondling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and \u2018sodomy of the penis\u2019 . . . and [possibly] anal penetration . . . .\u201d Id., 639. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s request to introduce the evidence of the prior sexual assault for the purpose of establishing an alternative source for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge. Id., 640. Unable to establish a defense without the \u201calternative source of sexual knowledge\u201d theory, the defendant was convicted on all counts, and she appealed. \u201cThe [C]ourt of [A]ppeals [reversed the conviction in part] on the ground that [the defendant\u2019s] offer of proof established a \u2018good faith\u2019 basis to cross-examine M.D. regarding the prior sexual assault.\u201d Id., 642. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the defendant was denied her constitutional rights to confrontation and compulsory process when the trial court, pursuant to Wisconsin\u2019s rape shield statute, excluded evidence of a prior sexual assault experienced by M.D., one of the four complaining witnesses. Id. It held that \u201cunder the \u2018balancing\u2019 test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>[supra] 415 U.S. 308 . . . [the defendant] was denied her sixth amendment rights because [the Wisconsin rape shield statute] excluded evidence of the prior sexual assault\u201d; id., citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Pulizzano, </em>148 Wis. 2d 190, 198-202, 434 N.W.2d 807 (App. 1988); which the Court of Appeals concluded was relevant and material to the critical issue that there might be an alternative source for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge. The state petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court for review on the issue of whether or not the prior sexual abuse evidence was admissible under the rape shield statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pulizzano, </em>supra, 155 Wis. 2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In <em>Pulizzano, </em>the Supreme Court of Wisconsin devised the following test for a defendant \u201cto establish a constitutional right to present otheiwise excluded evidence of a child complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct for the limited purpose of proving an alternative source for sexual knowledge . . . .\u201d Id., 656. \u201c[P]rior to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the defendant must make an offer of proof showing: (1) that the prior acts clearly occurred; (2) that the acts closely resembled those of the present case; (3) that the prior act is clearly relevant to a material issue; (4) that the evidence is necessary to defendant\u2019s case; and (5) that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d Id. We conclude that in cases involving child sexual abuse the test set forth in <em>Pulizzano </em>is a proper standard for determining whether prior sexual conduct should be admissible at trial for purposes of showing an alternative source for the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We also conclude that this is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>proper test for determining the admissibility of evidence of prior sexual conduct for purposes of rebutting evidence offered through an expert witness to show that a child exhibits behavior indicative of sexual abuse, by showing an alternative explanation for that behavior. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bear Stops, </em>997 F.2d 451 (8th Cir. 1993) (basic factual details of prior sexual assault admissible when offered to provide alternative explanation for prosecution\u2019s persuasive evidence about victim\u2019s behavioral manifestations of sexually abused child); cf. <em>Tague </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>supra, 3 F.3d 1133 (when state offers medical expert to verify that child\u2019s physical injury is result of sexual abuse, defendant must be allowed to introduce prior sexual abuse evidence to show that prior abuse may be source of injury).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>Pulizzano </em>and its progeny illustrate the critical nature of prior sexual abuse evidence in the defendant\u2019s effort to rebut the inference that he is the source of J.\u2019s sexual knowledge or behavioral characteristics. \u201c[I]f the jury is not allowed to learn of the [prior sexual] offenses against [the] complainants, then [it] will inevitably conclude that the complainants\u2019 highly age-inappropriate sexual knowledge could only come from [the] <em>defendant </em>having committed such acts.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>231 Mich. App. 424, 426, 586 N.W.2d 555 (1998). Without that evidence, \u201c[t]he inference that [a victim] could not possess the sexual knowledge he [or she] does unless [a defendant] sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>assaulted [him or her] greatly bolsters [a victim\u2019s] allegations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pulizzano, </em>supra, 155 Wis. 2d 655. \u201cIn order to rebut that inference, [the defendant] must establish an alternative source for [the victim\u2019s] sexual knowledge . . . [as] a necessary and critical element of [his] defense.\u201d Id. \u201cSimply put, the prior sexual conduct must account for how the child could provide the testimony\u2019s sexual detail without having suffered defendant\u2019s alleged conduct.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 289 Ill. App. 3d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not apply the proper standard in excluding the evidence of prior sexual conduct. We further conclude that if the proper standard had been applied the evidence would have been admitted and the trial could have had a different outcome. Thus, we conclude that exclusion of the evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We recognize, however, that J.\u2019s privacy also must be protected and that \u201ccaution should be taken to lessen any further trauma\u201d to her. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pulizzano, </em>supra, 155 Wis. 2d 656. This can be accomplished by examining the records in camera before admitting the evidence at trial, guarding against excessive cross-examination of J. and eliciting testimony on the issue of prior sexual abuse through other witnesses permitted to testify thereon. See id.; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>supra, 231 Mich. App. 437-38; <em>State </em>v. <em>Budis, </em>125 N.J. 519, 540, 593 A.2d 784 (1991). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly allowed detailed constancy of accusation testimony in violation of the rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 284. We agree. Although the first issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>is dispositive ol- this appeal, we address this general issue in order to guide the trial court on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The constancy of accusation doctrine is well established in Connecticut and recently has been reaffirmed by this court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 36; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 645; <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 297-98, 303-304; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 565, 643 A.2d 854 (1994). \u201cUntil <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 304, we permitted witnesses to testify about the details of a victim\u2019s accounts of the alleged sexual assault on the theory that, if the victim\u2019s story were true, the evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details, and the truth would the more clearly appear.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 645. \u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 284, however, we restricted the doctrine so that a constancy of accusation witness could testify only to the fact and the timing of the victim\u2019s complaint. Even so limited, the evidence would be admissible solely for corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony, and not for substantive purposes. Id., 304.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 645. We limit the testimony of constancy witnesses mainly because \u201ca defendant has an interest in not being unreasonably burdened by such accrediting or supporting evidence which . . . generally is not admissible in the trial of crimes other than sexual assault.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 302. If every individual to whom the victim reported an assault out of court was permitted to testify about the details of that disclosure, \u201cthere is an enhanced risk that the jury may be unduly swayed by the repeated iteration of the constancy of accusation testimony.\u201d Id., 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">We recognized in <em>Troupe, </em>however, that the rule limiting constancy of accusation testimony to time, place and identity, \u201cdoes not affect those cases in which the details of a sexual assault complaint are otherwise admissible, as, for example, in the case of a spontaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>utterance or in the case of a prior consistent statement admitted to rebut a claim of recent fabrication. Moreover, we recognize that the defendant, on cross-examination of a constancy witness, may elicit details of the victim\u2019s complaint for the propose of demonstrating inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s trial testimony about the sexual assault and the victim\u2019s report of the incident. In such cases, the effect of oro- modification of the constancy of accusation doctrine is merely to shift the timing of the introduction into evidence of the details. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendricks . . </em>. 891 S.W.2d [597] 603 [Tenn. 1994] (excluding details from state\u2019s casein-chief serves to require \u2018courts to condition the admissibility of the details of the complaint upon the most fundamental principle governing the admissibility of a prior consistent statement\u2014that the victim\u2019s credibility must have already been attacked before the rehabilitative evidence is admissible\u2019).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304 n.19.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding our decision in <em>Troupe, </em>we recognize that the constancy of accusation doctrine creates a tension between competing well recognized principles. It remains a powerful weapon in the state\u2019s arsenal to secure justice for victims of sexual assaults. It also, however, constitutes a potential threat to the accused\u2019s right of confrontation under the sixth amendment to the constitution of the United States and under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. To resolve this tension, the defendant must be allowed an adequate opportunity to cross-examine constancy of accusation witnesses. Such cross-examination properly includes questioning the witness not only about the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>report of the present charge, but also about the victim\u2019s prior false statements, to that witness, that tend to undermine the credibility of the victim\u2019s present complaint.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In light of these principles, we reject the state\u2019s argument that the constancy of accusation testimony properly was admitted at trial in this case. Prior to trial, the state filed a memorandum of law in support of the constancy of accusation witnesses it intended to offer at trial. In that memorandum, the state argued that the trial court should allow the detailed testimony of Serrano, Lumb and Murphy as constancy of accusation witnesses. The state relied upon the language of footnote 19 of <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304, in seeking admission of the detailed testimony. The state argued that, because \u201cthe defense conducted a very lengthy and exhaustive cross-examination of [J.] . . . exposing the details of her disclosure . . . inconsistencies, and contradictions in her testimony . . . [and] examined her in areas of delay, motive, behavior and bias,\u201d that the state was \u201cnow permitted to bring in the entire details of her disclosures to the constancy witnesses under the Doctrine of Prior Consistent Statements,\u201d for the limited puipose of ascertaining the credibility of J.\u2019s own testimony. The defendant opposed the state\u2019s position arguing that detailed constancy of accusation testimony should not be admitted because it was being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, e.g., that the defendant was the sole perpetrator of sexual abuse committed against J. The defendant asserted that the state\u2019s \u201cprior consistent statement\u201d argument failed because cross-examination did not raise any significant inconsistencies in J.\u2019s testimony, but simply showed some confusion on matters also raised on direct examination. In fact, the defendant had little success cross-examining J. on sexual matters owing to the vague nature of her answers and her gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>eral lack of cooperation when addressing questions of a sexual nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The trial court, however, allowed the state to offer detailed testimony through its constancy witnesses. The trial court held that \u201cthe state [could] use detailed information in its constancy of accusation testimony only to the extent that the details . . . would be the result of a prior consistent statement of [J.] that ... is directly inconsistent with the statement made by [J.] during her videotaped testimony.\u201d The trial court allowed the constancy testimony for the sole purpose of rehabilitating J. under the \u201cprior consistent statement\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay. We conclude that this holding was improper under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Because the defendant was precluded from alluding to prior sexual conduct, he did not have a meaningful opportunity to attack J.\u2019s credibility on cross-examination, but was limited to questioning J. as to her memory of the details of the abuse, rather than her memory of the abuser. Our review of the record satisfies us that the inconsistencies in her testimony were insignificant and did not justify the repeated use of detailed constancy of accusation testimony for rehabilitation purposes. The state should not have been permitted to rehabilitate J. to prove the truth of her testimony against the defendant where the defendant was prevented from offering evidence that might prove that she was confused about who committed the sexual abuse in the first instance. In sum, the state should not have been permitted to rehabilitate J. through constancy witnesses where: (1) any attack on J.\u2019s credibility was precluded by the exclusion of the evidence of prior sexual abuse; and (2) even if the defendant did attempt to attack J.\u2019s credibility, any inconsistencies elicited during cross-examination were insignificant. As a result of the trial court\u2019s improper admission of the constancy testimony, the multiple recitations of the substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>allegations by the constancy witnesses proved to be far more prejudicial than probative, especially since J.\u2019s credibility was virtually intact at the end of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination. Id., 297-99. The state\u2019s constancy of accusation witnesses, therefore, should have been limited by the rule in <em>State </em>v. Troupe, supra, 237 Conn. 304, which permits testimony as to the \u201cfact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint . . . [e.g.] the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator.\u201d Id. We do not, however, pass judgment on whether or not the detailed testimony of the constancy of accusation witnesses would be admissible on retrial. The detailed testimony offered by the constancy of accusation witnesses, although inadmissible in the first trial, may be admissible on retrial if it satisfies an exception to the rule against hearsay, as established in <em>State </em>v. Troupe, supra, 304 n.19. That determination will be governed by the discretion of the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We conclude that the trial court improperly precluded the defendant from presenting evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual abuse. We also conclude that the trial court improperly allowed the detailed testimony of the three constancy of accusation witnesses offered by the state in violation of the rule limiting such testimony set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> General Stalutes \u00a7 53a-70 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...
