We reverse the ruling of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">On or about December 11,1996, undercover Hamden police officers made arrangements to purchase three ounces of marijuana from someone named \u201cMo\u201d for $375. A meeting was held at an arranged location, and the defendant, Maurice S. Malcolm, arrived with the marijuana and was arrested. The defendant appeared to be under the influence of marijuana at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The defendant was charged with the sale of a controlled substance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> possession of a controlled substance, less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>four ounces of marijuana, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and conspiracy to sell a controlled substance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 21a-277.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 20, 1998, after coming to an agreement with the state, the defendant pleaded guilty to the sale of marijuana in violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (b). Although the defendant and the state had agreed on a sentence of five years imprisonment, execution suspended, with a two year period of probation, the trial court sentenced the defendant to three years imprisonment, execution suspended, and two years of probation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On or around May 10, 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service took the defendant into custody and instituted deportation proceedings against him. The defendant was transferred to an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention facility in Oakdale, Louisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>ana. On May 20,1999, the defendant filed an emergency motion to vacate the judgment and withdr aw his guilty plea on the grounds that the trial court failed to comply with \u00a7 54-lj in accepting his guilty plea and that he was likely to be deported within two weeks. The trial court granted the motion on June 4, 1999. The state, on the granting of permission, appealed to the Appellate Court, and this court transferred the appeal to itself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. On appeal, the state claims that the trial court improperly found that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea canvass did not comply with \u00a7 54-lj and, therefore, improperly vacated the defendant\u2019s conviction. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">FINAL JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The state argues that the trial court\u2019s vacating of the defendant\u2019s conviction is an appealable final judgment under <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">In <em>Curdo, </em>we held that \u201c[a]n otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Id. The state relies on the second prong of this test, which \u201cfocuses not on the proceeding involved, but on the potential harm to the appellant\u2019s rights.\u201d Id., 33. It points out that, in this case, the defendant pleaded guilty on August 20, 1998, in exchange for a sentence of three year's imprisonment, suspended after thirty days served, and two years probation. The defendant had already served the thirty days in lieu of posting bond at the time that the sentence was imposed. In reliance on the defendant\u2019s representations at the plea canvass and on the existence of a final, partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>executed judgment against the defendant, the state then destroyed the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We conclude that these circumstances distinguish this case from <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 454 A.2d 266 (1983). In that case we held that a judgment of dismissal of the charges, with prejudice, entered on the state\u2019s own motion, was \u201ca sufficiently serious precondition to the right of appeal to provide adequate assurance that this procedure will not be resorted to lightly\u201d; id., 50-51; and allowed the appeal. In the present case, although the state has not dismissed the charges against the defendant as a precondition to the appeal, in reasonable reliance on the defendant\u2019s representations that he had discussed the immigration consequences of his plea with his lawyers, it has destroyed the evidence against him, thereby significantly impairing its ability to retry him. \u201cA presentence order will be deemed final for purposes of appeal only if it involves a claimed right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\u201d Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 33-34. Because the practical value of the state\u2019s right to seek a judgment against the defendant will be destroyed if it is not allowed to appeal, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling vacating the conviction and allowing the defendant to withdraw the guilty plea was an appealable final judgment under the second prong of <em>Curcio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">COMPLIANCE WITH GENERAL STATUTES \u00a7 54-lj</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court did not comply with \u00a7 54-lj<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> before accepting his plea. At the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>canvass, the trial court questioned the defendant as follows: \u201cThe law says that I have to tell you that if you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States, conviction of this offense can result in your being deported, being denied admission to the United States or being denied readmission to the United States, have you discussed that with your lawyers too?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cIs there anything you want to ask your lawyer right now? Take a minute if you do,\u201d and the defendant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The defendant points out that \u00a7 54-lj provides that the defendant shall be warned about each of three potential consequences of a guilty plea: (1) deportation; (2) denial of admission to the United States; and (3) denial of naturalization. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction, which warned of only deportation and denial of admission, was improper. The state contends that the trial court\u2019s advisement substantially complied with \u00a7 54-lj and was, therefore, proper. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">This court previously has not considered whether a trial court must strictly comply with \u00a7 54-lj. Other jurisdictions, however, have addressed the issue. In <em>Daramy v. United States, </em>750 A.2d 52, 554 (D.C. 2000),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the trial court instructed the defendant, who was not a citizen, that the \u201c \u2018Immigration and Naturalization Service could review your status to decide whether to allow you to remain in the United States or to return to your home country. If you were required to depart, put it plainly, if you were deported, you could be barred from re-entry at some future date.\u2019 \u201d As in the present case, the trial court in <em>Daramy </em>did not mention the denial of naturalization. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals looked to the legislative history of the District of Columbia statute and found the statute to be a legislative response to the apparent \u201creluctance of the courts to grant a motion to withdraw a guilty plea when the defendant had not been advised of potential consequences with respect to the prisoner\u2019s immigration status.\u201d Id., 555-56. The court found that the purpose of the statute was to put noncitizens on notice that a plea of guilty could result in immigration consequences. Id., 556. It concluded that, even though the trial court did not warn the defendant that he could be denied naturalization, he could have inferred such a consequence because he could not have been deported if he were naturalized. Id., 556-57. The court held that, while it would have been better for the trial court to have read the statute verbatim, the warning as given was acceptable. Id.; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>23 Cal. 4th 183, 194, 199, 999 P.2d 686, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 463 (2000) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>(where trial court did not specifically mention one potential consequence listed in statute, namely that defendant could be excluded from admission to United States, court held that, under state constitution, to vacate plea, defendant must show he was prejudiced by trial court\u2019s noncompliance with statute); <em>Delatorre </em>v. <em>State, </em>957 S.W.2d 145, 150-51 (Tex. App. 1997) (trial court\u2019s instruction substantially complied with statute \u201cbecause it included the most severe action which could have befallen the defendant,\u201d namely deportation); <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>State, </em>877 S.W.2d 809, 813 (Tex. App. 1994) (\u201ctrial court\u2019s admonishment, \u2018if you\u2019re not a citizen or if you\u2019re not legally in this country, that it could mean that you would have to be sent back to your original country,\u2019 substantially complied\u201d with Texas statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>234 Wis. 2d 304, 310-11, 312, 610 N.W.2d 180 (App. 2000) (warning sufficient, despite the fact that it did not follow statute<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> verbatim, because defendant confirmed that he understood risk of deportation, was instructed that his status would be uncertain and deportation prime consideration in plea negotiation). We agree with the reasoning of these cases and conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>that it was not necessary for the trial court to read the statute verbatim. We conclude, rather, that only substantial compliance with the statute is required to validate a defendant\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Moreover, this court repeatedly has held that only substantial compliance is required when warning the defendant of the direct consequences of a guilty plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-19<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in order to ensure that the plea is voluntary pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-20.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>253 Conn. 375, 380, 751 A.2d 825 (2000) (\u201conly substantial, rather than literal, compliance with \u00a7 39-20 is required in order to validate a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 360, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981) (\u201cconstitutional rights of a criminal defendant in taking either a guilty or a nolo plea must be scrupulously protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>. . . [however] the failure to comply with each and every requirement of [the statute] does not automatically require the vacating of the defendant\u2019s plea\u201d [citations omitted]). We will not require stricter compliance with regard to the collateral consequences of a guilty plea.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Furthermore, such a standard is consistent with the legislative intent behind \u00a7 54-lj. Although there is little legislative history regarding \u00a7 54-lj, comments made by Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr., to the Senate on April 14,1982, shed some light on the legislative intent behind the statute. After summarizing the text of the statute, Senator Owens indicated that \u201cif the court fails to advise the defendant of the possible consequences of the conviction, [and] the defendant shows that his plea and conviction could result in deportation . . . [t]he court could, at a subsequent date, be required to vacate the judgment and permit the defendant to withdraw his plea and enter a plea of not guilty.\u201d 25 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1982 Sess., pp. 1263. Senator Owens added, \u201c[a lot] of people are not aware of the consequences of these [Immigration and Naturalization Service rules] and face deportation and being able to do nothing about it.\u201d Id. These remarks suggest that \u00a7 54-lj, rather than demanding that trial courts instruct defendants on the intricacies of immigration law, seeks only to put defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>dants on notice that their resident status could be implicated by the plea. Id.; see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>27 Mass. App. 840, 844-45, 545 N.E.2d 52 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">By instructing the defendant that he could be deported or excluded from readmission to the United States, the trial court in the present case substantially complied with \u00a7 54-lj. The defendant was warned adequately that his immigration status could be implicated by his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Although it would have been better practice for the trial court to have read the statute verbatim, strict compliance was not necessary to put the defendant on notice that a conviction could have implications beyond the state criminal justice system. To allow the defendant now, years after the charges were brought, and after the evidence has been destroyed, to withdraw a plea into which he entered knowingly and voluntarily would be to assert form over substance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lopez, 426 Mass. 657, 662, 690 N.E.2d 809 (1998) (\u201cstrict standard for postconviction motions promotes judicial efficiency and finality by discouraging a defendant from entering a guilty plea to test the weight of potential punishment\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Commonwealth v. Hason, </em>supra, 27 Mass. App. 845 (judges \u201cshould only grant a postsentence motion to withdraw a plea if the defendant comes forward with a credible reason which outweighs the risk of prejudice to the Commonwealth\u201d [internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>marks omitted]). The legislature did not intend to create a loophole for defendants to use as grounds for vacating guilty pleas, years after they have been entered, once evidence is destroyed or witnesses become unavailable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>290 Or. 707, 714, 625 P.2d 1300 (1981) (\u201cwhat the defendant now seeks is to have the benefit of his plea bargain now that the other charges against him have been dismissed and to nevertheless challenge the validity of his conviction based upon a contention which was not brought to the attention of the trial court\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>175 Wis. 2d 366, 371, 498 N.W.2d 887 (App. 1993) (\u201c[consistent with this legislative history, we conclude that the legislature did not intend a windfall to a defendant who was aware of the deportation consequences of his plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We also note that the defendant is now threatened with deportation, a subject on which he was instructed, not denial of naturalization. He argues that, had he been able to be naturalized, he could have avoided deportation. This argument, however, simply underscores the interrelated nature of the three potential immigration consequences. Although deportation, exclusion and denial of naturalization are distinct from each other, they are sufficiently related, such that a warning about the first two puts a defendant on notice that the third could be implicated. See <em>Daramy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 750 A.2d 557 (where trial court omitted any specific reference to naturalization, court reasoned: \u201cOnly by denying the conferral of United States nationality upon Daramy through naturalization would the [Immigration and Naturalization Service] be in a position to return [the defendant] to [her native country]. As only aliens can be made to leave the United States, the plain import of the trial court\u2019s statement is that the [Immigration and Naturalization Service] could choose not to naturalize [the defendant]. . . . There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>fore, while the trial court did not quote the statute verbatim,\u201d it did place the defendant on notice that she might be denied naturalization.). Because we are not persuaded that a verbatim reading of \u00a7 54-lj is required, we reverse the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In this opinion, MCDONALD, C.

It is well settled that \u201c[t]his court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited by statute to appeals from final judgments; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-197a, 52-263;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and [that] accordingly we have no discretion to enlarge our jurisdiction in abrogation of the final judgment rul <em>e.\u201d State v. Southard, </em>191 Conn. 506, 508, 467 A.2d 920 (1983). This final judgment rule \u201cserves the important public policy of discouraging the delays and inefficiencies attending piecemeal appeals. . . . That policy applies with particular force in criminal cases because, as both this court and the Supreme Court of the United States have recognized, undue litigiousness and leaden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>footed administration of justice [are] particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The appealable final judgment in a criminal case is ordinarily the imposition of sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>180 Conn. 290, 293, 429 A.2d 871 (1980). General Statutes \u00a7 54-96<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits the state to appeal from rulings and decisions of the Superior Court upon questions of law arising in criminal trials, provided that the appeal is from a final judgment. We previously have recognized, however, in both criminal and civil cases, that certain otherwise interlocutory orders may constitute final judgments for puiposes of appeal. \u201cAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). \u201cUnless the appeal is authorized under the <em>Curcio </em>criteria, absence of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect that results in a dismissal of the appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>210 Conn. 110, 119, 554 A.2d 702 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">\u201cThe first alternative, termination of a separate and distinct proceeding, requires the order being appealed to be severable from the central cause to which it is related so that the main action can \u2018proceed independent of the ancillary proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 307, 488 A.2d 778 (1985). The state makes no claim in this case that the trial court order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea terminated a separate arid dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>tinct proceeding. Rather, the state seeks to fit this case within the second prong of the <em>Curdo </em>test, arguing that, if the defendant\u2019s trial is permitted to proceed, the state will lose forever its right to challenge the trial court\u2019s vacating of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. The state reasons that, if the defendant is convicted following a trial, the state\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly allowed the defendant to withdraw his plea will be moot, while if he is acquitted, any appeal by the state would be fruitless because the double jeopardy clause would prohibit the reinstatement of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">At the outset, I agree with the state\u2019s analysis of the double jeopardy issue. The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have reiterated often the principle that a \u201cjudgment of acquittal, however erroneous, bars further prosecution on any aspect of the count and hence bars appellate review of the trial court\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Sanabria </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 69, 98 S. Ct. 2170, 57 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1978) (involving erroneous exclusion of evidence). Additionally, I recognize that, at first blush, the circumstances of this appeal appear to fit literally within the language of the second prong of the <em>Curdo </em>test, as the state contends. The issue as I see it, however, is whether the state may rely on the threat of double jeopardy to avoid the final judgment rule, without terminating the prosecution in order to appeal the trial court order. I would conclude that it cannot. \u201cThe intent of that constitutional prohibition is to shield criminal defendants from repeated prosecution; for that reason, the prohibition cannot in and of itself be utilized by the state as a sword to obtain review of interlocutory orders that would be unavailable to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 511-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 49-51, 454 A.2d 266 (1983), the state appealed from an allegedly improper suppression of crucial evidence. That appeal was predicated upon a judgment of dismissal of the charges, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>prejudice, entered on the state\u2019s own motion. Id., 45. Because the state\u2019s appeal <em>m Ross </em>was thus conditioned on its willingness to stake the outcome of the prosecution on reversing the trial court\u2019s order suppressing evidence, this court held that \u201c[a] decision by the state to obtain dismissal of a prosecution with prejudice is a sufficiently serious precondition to the right of appeal to provide adequate assurance that this procedure will not be resorted to lightly.\u201d Id., 50-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 512, this court dismissed the state\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s order denying its demand for a jury trial because \u201cthe state ha[d] not satisfied the precondition set down by <em>Ross.\u201d </em>The court concluded that, in the absence of any precedent supporting the state\u2019s position that the denial of its claim for a juiy trial could have been reviewed by apretrial appeal without putting into jeopardy the possibility of securing a conviction at a court trial, the state was not entitled to review of its claim. Although the court in <em>Ross </em>recognized the seriousness of the state\u2019s interest in the resolution of the jury trial issue, it emphasized that the final judgment rule, and consequently, this court\u2019s jurisdiction, \u201chas never turned upon the gravity of the claims that are denied interlocutory review.\u201d Id., 512.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The state acknowledges that, because the drugs involved in this case have been destroyed, its ability to successfully prosecute the defendant at trial has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>impaired significantly. Nevertheless, the state complains in its brief that it is not practical to \u201crequire the state to nolle the underlying charges and have the case dismissed\u201d because, if the state were to prevail on appeal, \u201cit would have to move the trial court to vacate the dismissal and the nolle, file a new information, and have the defendant enter his plea again. Allowing the state to appeal the trial court\u2019s order vacating the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction would be a much more efficient and sensible procedure that would maintain the status quo pending resolution of the appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in Southard, the state\u2019s claim in the present appeal bears no significant distinction from \u201cany of the myriad evidentiary and procedural rulings which might possibly disadvantage the state during the course of a criminal proceeding, such as orders excluding evidence, requiring disclosure of information or granting changes of venue.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 512. Consequently, the state\u2019s claim here no more satisfies the second prong of <em>Curdo </em>than did the state\u2019s claim in <em>Southard. </em>As this court stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 50-51, and reiterated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>255 Conn. 477, 486-87, 774 A.2d 927 (2001), the state\u2019s willingness to have the charges dismissed provides the assurance that the appellate procedure has not been resorted to lightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The state also claims that General Statutes \u00a7 54-lj<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> gives this court jurisdiction to consider this appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>That statute vests jurisdiction in the trial court to revisit a plea canvass after a sentence has been imposed; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>251 Conn. 617, 741 A.2d 902 (1999); it does not confer jurisdiction on this court to consider an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">As this court previously has stated, \u201cunless the appeal is authorized under the <em>Curdo </em>criteria, absence of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect that results in a dismissal of the appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 119; see <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>167 Conn. 282, 283, 355 A.2d 255 (1974). Therefore, I would dismiss the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-197a (a) provides: \u201cAppeals from final judgments or actions of the Superior Court shall be taken to the Appellate Court in accordance with section 51-197c, except for small claims, which are not appealable, appeals within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided for in section 51-199, appeals as provided for in sections 8-8 and 8-9, and except as otherwise provided by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides: \u201cUpon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> General Statute's \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to 1he Supreme Court or to the Appellate Court, in 1he same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\"><em> Not, </em>only is the gravity of the claim not controlling, but the obvious gain in judicial efficiency that could be realized whenever a full trial can be avoided also is not determinative; see <em>State v.

Indeed, General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a, for example, requires a defendant to plead nolo contendere to an offense in order to gain review of an adverse trial court decision on a motion to suppress, even when the evidence! in question is the only evidence linking the defendant to the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> note that a remand in this case, had the state properly dismissed the charges prior to filing its appeal, would be less complicated than the state\u2019s scenario threatens.
