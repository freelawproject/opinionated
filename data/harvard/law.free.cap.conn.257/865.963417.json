The plaintiff, Union Carbide Corporation, appealed to the defendant\u2019s board of assessment appeals (board) from the valuation of its property as of October 1,1987. The board dismissed that appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>and the plaintiff appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the appeal, from which the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>tiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The plaintiff claims, inter alia, that the trial court improperly: (1) relied on an agreement between the plaintiff and a real estate assessment firm hired by the defendant as to the value of the plaintiffs property; (2) accorded presumptive validity to the defendant\u2019s assessment; (3) relied on sale-leaseback market evidence to determine the value of the plaintiffs property; and (4) ruled on the admissibility of certain evidence. Because we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff was estopped from seeking a reduction in the valuation of its property, it is not necessary to reach the remaining issues raised by the plaintiffs appeal. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The property at issue in this case, which is located at 39 Old Ridgebmy Road in Danbury, consists of a 1,308,721 square foot corporate headquarters building (building) and a 99.5 acre parcel of land on which the building is located. The building and 99.5 acre parcel are surrounded by 546 acres of undeveloped land.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The defendant conducted a revaluation of the plaintiffs property in 1987, and, on October 1, 1987, the building was valued at approximately $294,827,400 and the 99.5 acre parcel of land and a substantial portion of the undeveloped land, comprising a total of 626 acres, were valued at approximately $51,231,000, for a total valuation of approximately $346,058,400. The defendant\u2019s grand list of October 1,1988, separated the unde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>veloped land from the building and the 99.5 acre parcel, and placed the value of the building and 99.5 acre parcel at $306,803,857. Pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 12-62a (b), the building and 99.5 acre parcel were assessed at a rate of 70 percent of that value, bringing the assessed value to about $214,762,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The defendant retained the firm of Cole, Layer and Trumbull (firm) to assist in the 1987 revaluation. Harold J. Maddocks, a senior commercial and industrial appraiser with the firm, supervised the revaluation. At the time of the revaluation, Maddocks had more than thirty years experience in the fields of assessment and appraisal, including the appraisal of facilities of large corporate headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">At an October 22, 1987 meeting involving, among others, Maddocks and David Keating, the plaintiffs director of general services and manager of taxes, Mad-docks and Keating agreed on a fair market value of between $350,000,000 and $355,000,000 for the building, 99.5 acre parcel and surrounding undeveloped land. Maddocks figured that his calculation would result in an annual tax savings of approximately $600,000 for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Maddocks testified that, as a result of this agreement, Maddocks expressed to Keating that he would submit a figure of between $350,000,000 and $355,000,000 to the defendant for assessment purposes provided that the plaintiff understood, inter alia, that the agreed upon value would remain in effect throughout the period covered by the October 1, 1987 revaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Maddocks was succeeded by Daniel Thomas in November, 1987, who issued an assessment notice to the plaintiff that allegedly set the value of the plaintiffs property higher than the value agreed upon by Mad-docks and Keating at the October 22, 1987 meeting. After Keating contacted Thomas in December, 1987, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>about the discrepancy and informed Thomas about his prior agreement with Maddocks, Thomas agreed to reduce the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property by approximately $10,000,000 for assessment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Before considering the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments, we set forth the basic legal principles and standard of review applicable to this appeal. \u201c[I]n <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>242 Conn. 550, 698 A.2d 888 (1997), we [set forth] the legal tenets governing tax appeals brought pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a .... [T]he trial court tries the matter de novo and the ultimate question is the ascertainment of the true and actual value of the [taxpayer\u2019s] property. ... At the de novo proceeding, the taxpayer bears the burden of establishing that the assessor has overassessed its property. . . . The trier of fact must arrive at his own conclusions as to the value of [the taxpayer\u2019s property] by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing on value, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value. ... If the trial court finds that the taxpayer has failed to meet his burden because, for example, the court finds unpersuasive the method of valuation espoused by the taxpayer\u2019s appraiser, the trial court may render judgment for the town on that basis alone. ... A taxpayer . . . who fails to carry [the burden of establishing overvaluation] has no right to complain if the trial court accords controlling weight to the assessor\u2019s valuation of his property.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>249 Conn. 110, 117-18, 733 A.2d 817 (1999), quoting <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>supra, 556-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">An appellate court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s decision is circumscribed by the appropriate standard of review. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>ings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeSena </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>249 Conn. 63, 72-73, 731 A.2d 733 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">On the basis of the agreement between Keating and Maddocks, the defendant asserted, as a special defense, that the plaintiff was estopped from seeking a reduction in the October 1, 1987 valuation of the plaintiffs property. In its articulation, the trial court found the following facts regarding this special defense: \u201cThe action taken and the words spoken by the [plaintiff] are found in the meeting between Maddocks on behalf of the [defendant], and . . . Keating representing [the plaintiff], on October 22, 1987. That meeting included a discussion of what Maddocks had found to that date and general data about the property freely and willingly provided by [the plaintiff]. As a result of that meeting, an agreement was reached between Maddocks and Keating [that set the fair market value of the building, 99.5 acre parcel and undeveloped land at between $350,000,000 and $355,000,000]. That agreement produced an annual tax savings of . . . $600,000 . . . for [the plaintiff].</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">\u201cAfter Maddocks was discharged by [the firm] . . . Thomas assumed his duties in November of 1987. He sent an assessment notice to [the plaintiff], which generated a complaint from Keating mid-December that year that the valuation set forth in [the] notice from Thomas was higher than the parties had agreed to in October of that year. Thomas, on behalf of the [defendant and] in reliance upon that agreement, reduced the [amount stated in the] assessment notice by . . . $10,000,000 .... [The plaintiffs] attempts to refute the claimed agreement were exposed as false when Keating was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>presented with a document which indeed referred to the existence of that agreement. Keating\u2019s own hand lent credence to the [defendant\u2019s] claim of such an agreement and completely and thoroughly nullified [the plaintiffs] position that there was no such contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant had established its special defense of estoppel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Our jurisprudence regarding the doctrine of equitable estoppel is well established. In <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>66 Conn. 9, 33 A. 536 (1895), this court stated: \u201cThe modem estoppel in pais is of equitable origin, though of equal application in courts of law. It is much more than a rule of evidence. It establishes rights: it determines remedies. An equitable estoppel does not so much shut out the truth as let in the truth, and the whole truth. Its office is not to support some strict mle of law, but to show what equity and good conscience require, under the particular circumstances of the case, irrespective of what might otherwise be the legal rights of the parties.\u201d Id., 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">\u201cEstoppel has its roots in equity and stems from the voluntary conduct of a party whereby [the party] is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed ... as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse. 3 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th Ed. 1941) \u00a7 804, p. 189; 28 Am. Jur. 2d, Estoppel and Waiver \u00a7 76; accord <em>Spear-Newman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Modem Floors Corporation, </em>149 Conn. 88, 91, 175 A.2d 565 (1961); <em>Tradesmens National Bank of New Haven </em>v. <em>Minor, </em>122 Conn. 419, 424, 190 A. 270 (1937); <em>MacKay </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>118 Conn. 538, 548, 173 A. 783 (1934).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ted.) <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 375, 383-84, 673 A.2d 77 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">\u201cWe [have] recognized that estoppel always requires proof of two essential elements: the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. <em>Bozzi </em>v. <em>Bozzi, </em>177 Conn. 232, 242, 413 A.2d 834 (1979); <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 344, 353, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976); <em>Pet Care Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>150 Conn. 42, 53-54, 184 A.2d 797 (1962).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that Keating\u2019s statements induced Thomas to believe that his predecessor, Maddocks, and Keating had agreed upon a value of the plaintiffs property that was lower than the value Thomas had established in the assessment notice that he issued to the plaintiff. Consequently, Thomas, acting on behalf of the defendant, changed his position to the defendant\u2019s detriment by reducing the value of the plaintiffs property in accordance with Keating\u2019s representations concerning the agreement, thereby reducing the amount of revenue that the defendant would derive from an assessment on the plaintiffs property. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff is estopped from proving that the defendant\u2019s valuation of its property is unjust. Because the plaintiff cannot prove that the valuation is unjust, the trial court properly refused to adjust the value. See, e.g., <em>Gorin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>178 Conn. 606, 608, 424 A.2d 282 (1979) (\u201c[o]nly when the court finds that the action of the board [of tax review] will result in the payment of an unjust and, therefore, illegal tax, can the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>proceed to exercise its broad discretionary power to grant such relief as is appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The plaintiff, relying on the doctrine of promissory estoppel, argues that, in the absence of a \u201c \u2018clear and definite promise\u2019 \u201d between the parties that reasonably could have been expected to induce reliance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is not estopped from <em>appealing </em>the October 1,1987 valuation. The plaintiff further argues that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The plaintiff has misconstrued the trial court\u2019s decision. The trial court, in its articulation, concluded: \u201cThis court is thoroughly satisfied and finds that the [defendant], in accordance with the credible evidence [it has] offered . . . has indeed <em>established that special defense of estoppel which it </em>pleaded.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant alleged, with respect to its special defense of estoppel, that \u201c[t]he plaintiff is . . . estopped from requiring the defendant in effect to reduce the October 1, 1987 valuation of its property.\u201d The defendant did not challenge the plaintiffs right to <em>appeal </em>but, rather, the plaintiffs right to obtain a reduction in the valuation to which the plaintiff had agreed. The trial court concluded, and we agree, that the plaintiff did not waive its right to appeal. For example, if any structures on its property were to become damaged after the valuation, the plaintiff could appeal the valua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>tion on the basis of General Statutes \u00a7 12-64a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>DeSena </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">We also disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>conclusion that the defendant established its special defense of equitable estoppel. The trial court found that Keating and Maddocks had met and agreed orally to a certain value for the plaintiffs property. Keating\u2019s notes<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and testimony<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> regarding the meeting confirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>both that an agreement was reached and the substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>of that agreement. The trial court found that, after Keating received the assessment notice from Thomas, which reflected a value of approximately $362,000,000 instead of the agreed upon value of between $350,000,000 and $355,000,000, he attempted to call Maddocks. Instead of reaching Maddocks, who no longer worked for the firm, Keating spoke with Thomas, who was unaware of the agreement between Keating and Maddocks. In reliance upon Keating\u2019s representation about the agreement, Thomas advised Keating that the revised assessment notice would reflect a value of approximately $352,000,000, which is $10,000,000 less than the value reflected in the original assessment notice. We, therefore, conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had established its special defense of equitable estoppel. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a provides: \u201cAny person, including any lessee of real property whose lease has been recorded as provided in section 47-19 and who is bound under the terms of his lease to pay real property taxes, claiming to be aggrieved by the action of the board of tax review or the board of assessment appeals, as the case may be, in any town or city may, within two months from the date of the mailing of notice of such action, make application, in the nature of an appeal therefrom, with respect to the assessment list for the assessment year commencing October 1, 1989, October 1, 1990, October 1, 1991, October 1,1992, October 1, 1993, October 1, 1994, or October 1, 1995, and with respect to the assessment list for assessment years thereafter, to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated, which shall be accompanied by a citation to such town or city to appear before said court. Such citation shall be signed by the same authority and such appeal shall be returnable at the same time and served and returned in the same manner as is required in case of a summons in a civil action. The authority issuing the citation shall take from the applicant a bond or recognizance to such town or city, with surety, to prosecute the application to effect and to comply with and conform to the orders and decrees of the court in the premises. Any such application shall be a preferred case, to be heard, unless good cause appears to the contrary, at the first session, by the court or by a committee appointed by the court. The pendency of such application shall not suspend an action by such town or city to collect not more than seventy-five per cent of the tax so assessed or not more than ninety per cent of such tax with respect to any real property for which the assessed value is five hundred thousand dollars or more, and upon which such appeal is taken. If, during the pendency of such appeal, a new assessment year begins, the applicant may amend his application as to any matter therein, including an appeal for such new year, which is affected by the inception of such new year and such applicant need not appear before the board of tax review or board of assessment appeals, as the case may be, to make such amendment effective. The court shall have power to grant such relief as to justice and equity appertains, upon such terms and in such manner and form as appear equitable, and, if the application appears to have been made without probable cause, may tax double or triple costs, as the case appears to demand; and, upon all such applications, costs may be taxed at the discretion of the court. If the assessment made by the board of tax review or board of assessment appeals, as the case may be, is reduced by said court, the applicant shall be reimbursed by the town or city for any overpayment of taxes, together with interest and any costs awarded by the court, or, at the applicant\u2019s option, shall be granted a tax credit for such overpayment, interest and any costs awarded by the court. Upon motion, said court shall, in event of such overpayment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>enter judgment in favor of such applicant and against such city or town for the whole amount of such overpayment, together with interest and any costs awarded by the court. The amount to which the assessment is so reduced shall be the assessed value of such property on the grand lists for succeeding years until the tax assessor finds that the value of the applicant\u2019s property has increased or decreased.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\"> The plaintiffs reliance on the doctrine of promissory estoppel is misplaced. Under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, as opposed to the doctrine of promissory estoppel, proof of a clear and definite promise is unnecessary. <em>In re David, W., </em>52 Conn. App. 576, 586, 727 A.2d 264 (1999), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 254 Conn. 676, 759 A.2d 89 (2000) (\u201c[t]he absence of a clear and definite promise [does] not preclude application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel\u201d); see also 28 Am.
