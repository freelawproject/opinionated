The commissioner issued a ruling pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (e),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which he concluded that the chemical was not exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed that appeal, and the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment. This court transferred the appeal to itself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) andPractice Book \u00a7 65-1. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff sells a chemical under the trade name Ultra Etch, which is used to dissolve excess copper from printed circuit boards. During use, the etchant is contaminated with copper salts that eventually render the etchant unusable, or spent. The circuit board manufacturers that purchase Ultra Etch are contractually required to return the spent etchant to the plaintiff, which stores and processes it. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) applied the standard of review; (2) upheld the commissioner\u2019s ruling that the spent etchant is a hazardous waste; and (3) upheld the commissioner\u2019s ruling that the spent etchant is subject to regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-454.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We begin with a brief overview of the regulatory framework governing hazardous waste. Under federal law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 et seq., establishes a regulatory program to manage the treatment, transport and storage of hazardous waste from its generation to final disposal. <em>Environmental Defense Fund </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Agency, </em>210 F.3d 396, 397 (D.C. Cir. 2000); see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6902 (a) (8) (1994). The primary purpose of the act \u201cis to reduce the generation of hazardous waste and to ensure the proper treatment, storage, and disposal of that waste ... so as to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Meghrig </em>v. <em>KFC Western, Inc., </em>516 U.S. 479, 483, 116 S. Ct. 1251, 134 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1996), quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6902 (b) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The act requires the federal Environmental Protection Agency (agency) to promulgate regulations that identify the characteristics of hazardous waste and identify solid wastes that are hazardous. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6921 (b) (1994). While the agency regulations establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>minimum requirements for the management of hazardous waste; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marine Shale Processors, </em>81 F.3d 1361, 1367 (5th Cir. 1996); Congress has authorized the states to establish their own regulations, which may be more stringent than those established by the agency. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6929 (b) (1994).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The agency generally does not enforce the federal standards in states that have authorized regulatory programs that are no less stringent than the agency regulations. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6926 (d) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Connecticut has a hazardous waste program that is authorized by the agency. See generally Connecticut; Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program, 55 Fed. Reg. 51,707, 51,707-13 (December 17,1990). Section 22a-449 (c) of the General Statutes authorizes the commissioner to establish and enforce regulations to carry out the intent of subtitle C of the act; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6921 et seq.; and, in 1990, the commissioner established such regulations. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 22a-449 (c)-100 through 22a-449 (c)-110. Those regulations incorporate by reference portions of the agency regulations without substantial change.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See generally id., \u00a7 22a-449 (c)-101 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Hazardous waste also is regulated in this state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-454, which exists apart from the state regulations promulgated pursuant to sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>title C of the act. Section 22a-454 requires persons who \u201cengage in the business of collecting, storing or treating . . . chemical liquids or hazardous wastes ... [or who] dispose of . . . chemical liquids or waste solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes\u201d to obtain a permit from the commissioner. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-454 (a). The department of environmental protection refers to materials regulated under \u00a7 22a-454 as \u201cConnecticut Regulated Wastes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The plaintiff obtained two permits in 1994: (1) a hazardous waste permit issued pursuant to \u00a7 22a-449 (c) authorizing the plaintiff to store spent etchant before it is recycled; and (2) a permit issued pursuant to \u00a7 22a-454 regulating the recycling process. In 1997, the plaintiff petitioned the commissioner to issue a declaratory ruling that the plaintiffs spent etchant is not a solid waste that is subject to regulation under Connecticut\u2019s hazardous waste management regulations. The plaintiff also sought a declaratoiy ruling that its spent etchant is exempt from regulation under \u00a7 22a-454.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Hazardous waste is defined as solid waste that is not otherwise excluded from regulation as a hazardous waste and that exhibits any one of the following characteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity or toxicity. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 261.3, 261.20 through 261.24 (2000).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff does not dispute that its spent etchant exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste; rather, the plaintiff argues that its spent etchant is not a solid waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">A solid waste is defined as any \u201cdiscarded material\u201d; id., \u00a7 261.2 (a) (1); and discarded material, in turn, is defined as any material that is \u201cabandoned,\u201d \u201crecycled\u201d or \u201cinherently waste-like.\u201d Id., \u00a7 261.2 (a) (2) (i) through (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">A material is recycled if it is \u201cused, reused, or reclaimed.\u201d Id., \u00a7 261.1 (c) (7). Whether a material is a solid waste when it is recycled requires an examination of: (1) the substance or material; and (2) the manner in which that material is recycled. <em>American Mining Congress </em>v. <em>United States Environmental Protection </em>Agency, 824 F.2d 1177, 1180 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Hazardous Waste Management System; Definition of Solid Waste, 50 Fed. Reg. 614, 618 (January 4, 1985). The parties agree that spent etchant is a spent material, which is defined as \u201cany material that has been used and as a result of contamination can no longer serve the purpose for which it was produced without processing . . . .\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1 (c) (1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The plaintiff describes its recycling process of spent etchant as follows: \u201cThe spent etchant [that the plaintiff] obtains from its customers is stored in either [fifty-five] gallon drums or in one of three [8000] gallon storage tanks depending upon whether it was returned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>drums or transported in one of [the plaintiffs] tanker trucks. When [the plaintiff] desires to use the spent etchant to produce new end-products, it transfers a portion of the etchant from a storage tank to one of two vessels which are known as \u2018reactor tanks.\u2019 Caustic soda and heat are added. The ensuing chemical reaction is allowed to proceed for approximately [twelve] to [fifteen] hours. During the reaction, copper oxide precipitates out of the spent etchant/caustic soda mixture and ammonia gas is generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u201cAt the end of the reaction, the copper oxide is allowed to settle and the liquid remaining in the reactor tank is pumped into another vessel for treatment and disposal as a process wastewater. The copper oxide remaining in the reactor tank is washed and discharged to a filter press for final processing. The copper oxide is the first end-product of the [plaintiffs] process which uses spent etchant as an ingredient.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cThe ammonia gas generated in the reactor tanks is transferred to another type of tank known as a \u2018scrub tank\u2019 as that gas is being generated. The ammonia gas is reacted with hydrochloric acid in the scrub tanks to produce ammonium chloride. That reaction occurs throughout the twelve plus hour process as the ammonia gas is being introduced into the scrub tanks. The ammonium chloride produced in the scrub tanks is the second end-product of the above described process which uses spent etchant as an ingredient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Spent materials \u201care not solid wastes when they can be shown to be recycled by being . . . [u]sed or reused as ingredients in an industrial process to make a product, provided the materials are not being reclaimed ----\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (e) (1) (i) (2000). \u201cA material is \u2018used or reused\u2019 if it is . . .

However, <em>a material will not satisfy this condition if distinct components of the material are recovered as separate end products </em>(as when metals are recovered from metal-containing secondary materials) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., \u00a7 261.1 (c) (5) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u201cA material is \u2018reclaimed\u2019 if it is processed to recover a usable product . . . [for example] recovery of lead values from spent batteries . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 261.1 (c) (4). Even if a material is used or reused, that material will be deemed solid waste if it is \u201cused in a manner constituting disposal, or used to produce products that are applied to the land . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 261.2 (e) (2) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly applied the standard of review in upholding the commissioner\u2019s ruling. The plaintiff does not challenge the trial court\u2019s statement of the standard of review in administrative appeals generally. Rather, the plaintiff argues that the trial court misapplied that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\u201cJudicial review of [an administrative agency\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. (UAPA)] . . . and the scope of that review is very restricted.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 205 Conn. 767, 773, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988). \u201cWith regard to questions <em>of </em>fact, it is neither the function of the trial court nor of this court to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S.

Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 635, 642, 708 A.2d 202 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The plaintiff argues that, because \u201cthere was no dispute as to any . . . evidence in the record, [its petition for a declaratory ruling raised] \u2018pure questions of law.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff claims that these legal questions with which the commissioner was presented previously have not been examined by a court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the trial court, instead of reviewing these legal issues de novo, improperly deferred to the commissioner\u2019s conclusions of law. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In reviewing the commissioner\u2019s factual findings that the plaintiff was extracting ammonia and copper values from its spent etchant,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court employed the substantial evidence rule. We conclude that the trial court properly deferred to the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Moreover, an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference. \u201c[I]t is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986); accord <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 372, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993). \u201cThis principle applies with even greater force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own duly adopted regulations.\u201d <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 497. When an agency has expertise in a given area and a history of determining factual and legal questions similar to those at issue, its interpretation is granted deference by the courts. See, e.g., <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 555-56, 400 A.2d 712 (1978); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 493, 362 A.2d 785 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that the commissioner\u2019s application of the regulations at issue in the present case presents pure questions of law. Rather, the application of those regulations requires a technical, case-by-case review; see, e.g., Hazardous Waste Management System; Definition of Solid Waste, supra, 50 Fed. Reg. 619 (\u201cthe same material can be a waste if it is recycled in certain ways, but would not be a waste if it is recycled in other ways\u201d); that \u201cis precisely the type of situation that calls for agency expertise.\u201d <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 627, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990) (\u201c[w]hether the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed activity within the stream channel encroachment lines is a placement of an \u2018obstruction or encroachment\u2019 requiring them to obtain a permit pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 22a-342 and whether the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed use of their land is an \u2018agricultural or farming\u2019 use within [General Statutes] \u00a7 22a-349 are factual determinations best left to the commissioner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court correctly noted that, \u201c[b]ecause [it is] reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, [its] review is highly deferential. . . . Ordinarily, [the trial] court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>considerable weight by the [reviewing court].\u201d The trial court, faced with two equally plausible interpretations of the regulatory language, reasonably could have deferred to the commissioner\u2019s construction of the regulations of the agency over which he presides. See <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 376. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court applied the appropriate standard in reviewing the commissioner\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly upheld the commissioner\u2019s ruling that the spent etchant is a solid waste because it is reclaimed and because it is used to produce products that are applied to land. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In its petition for a declaratory ruling and before the trial court, the plaintiff argued that its recycling process constitutes a reuse of spent etchant; therefore, the plaintiff argued, the spent etchant is not a solid waste and, as such, is exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste. The plaintiff argued that, because the two end products of its recycling process, namely, copper oxide and ammonium chloride, are not present in the spent etchant, those products are not \u201cdistinct components . . . [that] are recovered as separate end products\u201d during that process; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1 (c) (5) (i) (2000); and, therefore, its process is manufacturing, not waste management.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff renews this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>In order to better understand the plaintiffs argument, it is necessary to explain its recycling process in greater detail. The chemical formula for spent Ultra Etch is Cu(NH3)4C12. The spent etchant is put into a reactor tank and sodium hydroxide, or NaOH, and heat, are added. The resulting reaction produces four substances: anhydrous ammonia gas, or NH3; sodium chloride, or NaCl; copper oxide, or CuO; and water, or H20. The water and sodium chloride are pumped out of the tank at the end of the reaction cycle, processed and ultimately disposed of through a wastewater treatment system. Although some copper oxide precipitates out of the reactor tank during the reaction cycle, the copper oxide remaining at the end of the reaction cycle is allowed to settle. Thereafter, that copper oxide is washed, pressed and then either sold or used in the plaintiffs products, including copper sulfate, copper chloride and electroless and electrolytic copper plating materials. During the reaction cycle, the anhydrous ammonia gas that is produced in the reactor tank is transferred to a scrub tank, where it is combined with water and hydrochloric acid, or HC1, to produce ammonium chloride, or NH4C1.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In its petition, the plaintiff noted that, although copper, or Cu, is present in the spent etchant, copper oxide, or CuO, is not. Similarly, the plaintiff argued that, although ammonium chloride ions are present in the spent etchant, or Cu(NH3)4Cl2, the anhydrous ammonia gas, or NH3, that is transferred to the scrub tank is different than the ammonium chloride, or (NH3)4C12, that is present in the spent etchant, which, in turn, is different from the ammonium chloride, or NH4C1, produced in the scrub tank.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>that neither copper oxide, nor anhydrous ammonia gas or ammonium chloride is recovered from spent etchant; rather, those substances are manufactured using spent etchant as an ingredient.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The commissioner determined that the plaintiff is not reusing spent etchant because \u201cdistinct components of [spent etchant, namely, copper and ammonia values] are recovered as separate end products . . . .\u201d40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1 (c) (5) (i) (2000) (material is not reused \u201cif distinct components of the material are recovered as separate end products\u201d). The commissioner reasoned that \u201cregardless of the chemical changes that may take place or the varying chemical forms in which a material may appear, the definition of \u2018used or reused\u2019 requires an examination of whether material values are being extracted or recovered from the material in question. If such extraction or recovery is taking place, and products are being produced from the material values being extracted, the materials do not meet the definition of used or reused. Since [the plaintiff] is extracting copper and ammonia values from spent etchant to recover copper and ammonia based products, it is not using or reusing spent etchant; rather, it is reclaiming spent etchant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The commissioner also determined that, because the plaintiff processes spent etchant to extract usable products, namely, copper and ammonia values, the recycling process constitutes reclamation of spent etchant, not the manufacture of new products using spent etchant as an ingredient; see 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1 (c) (4) (2000) (\u201c[a] material is \u2018reclaimed\u2019 if it is processed to recover a usable product\u201d); and, therefore, the spent etchant does not qualify under the use/reuse exception. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (e) (1) (i) (2000) (material is not solid waste if \u201c[u]sed or reused as ingredients in an industrial process to make a product, <em>provided the materials are not being </em>reclaimed\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The trial court agreed with the commissioner\u2019s determination that the plaintiff was reclaiming copper and ammonia values during its recycling process. The court concluded that the commissioner\u2019s ruling was \u201csupported by an analysis of the entire process which supports the determination that what [the plaintiff] is primarily doing is waste management not . . . manufacturing] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We conclude that the trial court properly upheld the commissioner\u2019s determination that, because the plaintiff recovers material values from its spent etchant as separate end products, the plaintiff is engaged in waste management. The plaintiff acknowledges that both ammonia ions<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and copper ions are present in its spent etchant. Thus, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that substantial evidence supports the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\u2019s process extracts those copper and ammonia values as end products.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Furthermore, the commissioner\u2019s determination that the plaintiff is reclaiming its spent etchant is supported by the purpose of the distinction between use or reuse and reclamation, which is to distinguish processes in which the material is being recycled as a form of waste management from those in which recycled materials function as substitute raw materials or feedstocks for industrial processes. See, e.g., Hazardous Waste Management System; Definition of Solid Waste, supra, 50 Fed.

We conclude that the trial court properly concluded that, because the plaintiffs process does not reuse spent etchant, the plaintiff is managing waste, not manufacturing products.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The plaintiffs argument rests upon the assumption that, in order for a distinct component or material value of a spent material to be reclaimed as a separate end product, the distinct component or material value must be in the same chemical form as the end product. The plaintiff does not cite to anything in the regulations or their history that compels such an interpretation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, the history of the regulations reveals that a claimed use or reuse of spent materials carefully must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>be examined to determine whether the process through which the spent materials are claimed to be used or reused is more akin to waste management than to manufacturing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In its proposed rules, the agency stated that it was \u201csomewhat concerned that [with respect to the use of materials as ingredients to manufacture products] the propos[ed] [rule] leaves unregulated certain processes that could constitute waste management. Processes where secondary materials are the predominant (or even the sole) ingredient are conceivable examples, particularly where the process operator is paid to take the materials. In addition, processes using spent materials may be more logical candidates for regulation because spent materials (having already fulfilled their original use) are more inherently waste-like than byproducts and sludges.\u201d Hazardous Waste Management System, supra, 48 Fed. Reg. 14,488.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The plaintiff argues that the commissioner already has determined that a comparable process used by Old Bridge Chemicals, Inc., of New Jersey (Old Bridge) constitutes a reuse of spent etchant. Although we agree that an agency\u2019s decision must not be \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (6); the plaintiff has not claimed in this appeal that the commissioner\u2019s ruling was arbitrary. We note that the Old Bridge process, although similar to the plaintiffs recycling process, is not precisely the same and, therefore, may be distinguishable under the regulations. Moreover, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>declaratory ruling, the commissioner stated that the exemption granted to Old Bridge was being reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the commissioner\u2019s analysis incorrectly relied on the definition of the term \u201creclaimed\u201d in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1 (c) (4) (2000), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] material is \u2018reclaimed\u2019 if it is processed to recover a usable product, or if it is regenerated. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiff maintains that the commissioner\u2019s analysis should instead focus on the use/reuse exception found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1 (c) (5) (2000), which provides in relevant part: \u201cA material is \u2018used or reused\u2019 if it is . . .

However, a material will not satisfy this condition if distinct components of the material are recovered as separate end products . . . .\u201d The plaintiff claims that, once it is established that a spent material is being employed as an ingredient in an industrial process to make a product, it is eligible under the use/reuse exception unless material values or distinct components of that spent material are recovered as separate end products.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Although this argument finds some support in the history of the regulations, it is unavailing to the plaintiff. The use/reuse exception originally was proposed as an exception to the definition of reclamation. See Hazardous Waste Management System; Definition of Solid Waste, supra, 50 Fed. Reg. 633, 638; Hazardous Waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Management System, supra, 48 Fed. Reg. 14,487.

Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly upheld the commissioner\u2019s determination that, because the plaintiffs recycling process is not a reuse of spent etchant, that process constitutes waste management and, therefore, that the spent etchant must be managed as a hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The plaintiff also argues that the trial court improperly upheld the commissioner\u2019s determination that the spent etchant is a solid waste because it is \u201cused to produce products that are applied to the land . . . .\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (e) (2) (i) (2000).

The plaintiff presented evidence that it had sold copper oxide to a fungicide manufacturer and that it sells copper oxide to a firm that manufactures wood preservatives. The plaintiff, however, did not specify how those manufacturers use the copper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>oxide. The commissioner determined that, because the copper oxide that the plaintiff had sold potentially was being incorporated into products that are applied to the land\u2014fungicide and wood preservative\u2014the plaintiff was unable to establish that its spent etchant was exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The trial court properly noted that \u201c[p]ursuant to ... 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (e) (2) the use/reuse exemption is not applicable to materials that are applied to the land. Spent materials used to produce products that are applied to the land are solid waste even if they might otherwise have been exempted under the use/ reuse rule.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[t]here [was] sufficient evidence in the record to show that the copper oxide is incorporated in products, such as fungicide or wood preservative, [that are] applied to the land.\u201d In so concluding, the court stated that \u201c[t]he factual basis for the [commissioner\u2019s] decision that the spent etchant was used to produce products applied to the land was the [plaintiffs] petition which stated that it sold copper oxide for use as an ingredient to manufacture products such as fungicide. [The plaintiffs] further submissions<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> indicate that it no longer sold copper oxide to the fungicide manufacturer, but offered it to a manufacturer of wood preservatives. . . .

Reg. 646. The commentary to the final rule provides that \u201cproducts that contain hazardous wastes, which wastes have undergone a chemical reaction so as to become inseparable by physical means, are not presently subject to . . . regulation when they are used in a manner constituting disposal.\u201d Id. The commentary explains that \u201c[t]he waste-derived products for which we are deferring regulation are those where the hazardous wastes have undergone chemical bonding, so that they are chemically transformed.\u201d Id. The plaintiff argues that, because fungicide and wood preservatives are waste derived products (i.e., they use as an ingredient copper oxide recovered from spent etchant) that are exempt from regulation, the waste from which these products are derived, namely, spent etchant, also is exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Even if we assume that fungicide and wood preservatives are waste derived products that would be exempt from regulation, that does not mean that the <em>spent etchant </em>also is exempt. Indeed, the regulations provide that \u201c[t]he final rule . . . regulates immediately all transport and storage of these wastes [such as spent etchant] before the time they are actually processed into waste-derived products to be placed on the land. . . . For purposes of transportation and storage, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>fore, these wastes are regulated like all other hazardous wastes prior to land disposal.\u201d Id., 647. Although the plaintiffs reading of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (e) (2) (i) is plausible, the commissioner\u2019s construction is equally, if not more, plausible. Therefore, the trial court properly deferred to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 376.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Section 22a-454 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No person shall engage in the business of collecting, storing or treating . . . chemical liquids or hazardous wastes . . . nor shall any person . . . dispose of . . . chemical liquids or waste solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes without a permit from the commissioner. . .

In 1994, the commissioner issued to the plaintiff a permit pursuant to \u00a7 22a-454 that regulates its recycling of spent etchant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The plaintiff argued in its petition for a declaratory ruling that \u00a7 22a-454 (a) applies only to materials that are solid wastes under the applicable regulations and that, because its spent etchant is not a solid waste based on the provisions of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (e) (1), the plaintiff does not need a permit under \u00a7 22a-454 to dispose of spent etchant through recycling.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The commissioner rejected this argument, concluding that the spent etchant is a \u201cchemical liquid\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7\u00a7 22a-454 (a) and 22a-448 (1). The trial court agreed with the commissioner\u2019s conclusion, reasoning that \u201c[t]here is simply no basis in law for the claim that a chemical liquid such as spent etchant even if found not to be a solid waste . . . would be exempted from regulation under \u00a7 22a-454. The history of this regulation predating the [act] by years and its expansive language are inconsistent with the construction advocated by the plaintiff ....

The plaintiffs argument hinges on its inteipreta\u00fcon of \u00a7 22a-454 (a) that the legislature intended that section to apply only to \u201cwastes,\u201d and more particularly, only those materials that are defined as solid wastes under subtitle C of the act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6921 et seq. This argument is undermined by the language of \u00a7 22a-454, which lists chemical liquids as a regulated substance, the disposal of which requires a permit. The term \u201c \u2018[c]hemical liquids\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cany chemical, chemical solution or chemical mixture in liquid form . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-448 (1). \u201c[I]f the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Office of Consumer Counsel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>246 Conn. 18, 29, 716 A.2d 78 (1998). Furthermore, because \u00a7 22a-454 is an environmental statute, it must be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose. <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 382. The plaintiff does not dispute that its spent etchant is a chemical liquid as defined in \u00a7 22a-448 (1), and that it stores and then treats or disposes of spent etchant by recycling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In support of its interpretation that \u00a7 22a-454 applies only to wastes regulated under subtitle C of the act, the plaintiff relies on an informal guidance document issued by the bureau of waste management of the Connecticut department of environmental protection that defines various wastes that are regulated under \u00a7 22a-454. That document defines \u201cWaste Chemical Liquids\u201d as \u201cany wastes that are liquid, free flowing and/or contains [sic] free draining liquids <em>and </em>are toxic, hazardous to handle and/or may cause contamination of ground and/or surface water if improperly managed.

Bureau of Waste Management, Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Non-RCRA Hazardous Waste (Connecticut Regulated Wastes) (January 25, 1995) p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We fail to see how this definition of waste chemical liquids furthers the plaintiffs argument. That definition is one in a list of definitions of \u201cConnecticut Regulated Wastes\u201d that are specifically identified as typically <em>not </em>regulated under state regulations implementing subtitle C of the act. The informal guidance document provides that Connecticut regulated wastes are \u201cneither characteristically [i.e., ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic] nor listed . . . hazardous wastes [under the act] as per [part 261 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations], but a facility permit is required by [\u00a7] 22a-454 . . . for a person engaged in the business of storage, treating, disposing or transporting them.\u201d This language, instead of supporting the plaintiffs claim, is consistent with the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that, although a material is not defined as a solid waste under the regulations, it still may be regulated under \u00a7 22a-454.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Furthermore, two ingredients of spent etchant are <em>listed </em>as toxic under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 372.65, namely, ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide. Even if we assume that \u00a7 22a-454 only applies to wastes, and that the plaintiffs spent etchant is not a solid waste subject to regulation under part 261 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the spent etchant would still be regulated as a \u201cnon-RCRA\u201d hazardous waste under the definition of waste chemical liquids set forth in the informal guidance document.

The plaintiff argues that the anhydrous ammonia gas that is produced in the reactor tank is not an end product because viewing that gas as an end product severs the recycling process midstream. Instead, the plaintiff claims that an end product is identified at the end of the recycling process, which, according to the plaintiff, occurs in the scrub tank. We question the propriety of ending the analysis at that point. It seems that a conceivable end product of the plaintiffs recycling process is fresh etchant, a primary ingredient of which is the ammonium chloride generated in the scrub tank. The plaintiff has provided no information regarding this final step in its recycling process. We conclude, however, that, even if we were to assume that ammonium chloride is the relevant end product, because ammonium chloride ions are present in the spent etchant, the recycling process extracts those ammonium chloride values as an end product.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Moreover, the plaintiffs analysis is inconsistent because it looks at two different stages during the recycling process. At the same time that the plaintiff claims that the anhydrous ammonia gas is not an end product because that gas is generated <em>before </em>the stage of the process involving the scrub tank, it claims that ammonium chloride is not reclaimed because it is generated <em>after </em>that stage of the process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> The regulations use the terms \u201cdistinct components\u201d and \u201cmaterial values\u201d interchangeably.

See generally Industrial Economics, Inc., Guidance Manual on the RCRA Regulation of Recycled Hazardous Wastes (March, 1986) pp. 2-160 through 2-161. That guidance manual provides the following hypothetical: \u201cA spent hydrofluoric acid etching solution from metallurgical industries (a spent material exhibiting the characteristic of corrosivity) is reacted with potassium hydroxide to produce an impure potassium fluoride solution, which goes through filtration and evaporation to purify the potassium fluoride, which is sold for use as a preservative.\u201d Id., p. 2-160. The guidance manual then provides that \u201c[t]he etching solution is directly reused without intermediate reclamation as an ingredient in making potassium fluoride. The activity is not classified as reclamation because potassium fluoride does not exist in the original substance and thus is not recovered from the substance.\u201d Id., p. 2-161. The commissioner concluded that this example was not persuasive because it lacked specific information about the material and the process, and that the guidance manual is not binding authority. Inasmuch as the guidance manual provides that the agency \u201cretains final authority to judge the regulatory status of any recycling practice\u201d; id., p. 1-2; and in light of the unique nature of the plaintiffs recycling process, we agree with the trial court that it was within the commissioner\u2019s discretion to credit or discredit the guidance manual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\"> For example, certain \u201csham\u201drecyclingprocesses,underwhichamaterial ostensibly is used as an ingredient in an industrial process to make aproduct, nevertheless are classified as waste management. See Hazardous Waste Management System; Definition of Solid Waste, supra, 50 Fed. Reg. 638. \u201c[T]he sham versus legitimate recycling inquiry focuses on the purpose or function the [material] allegedly serves in the production process. If the [material] does not in fact serve its alleged function in the process, then sham recycling is occurring.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marine Shale Processors, </em>supra, 81 F.3d 1365.

Reg. 633. The commissioner did not pursue the issue of whether the plaintiff is regenerating its spent etchant and that issue was not raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> In addition, the regulations provide that, even if a material is used or reused, it will be deemed a solid waste when it is used in certain ways or accumulated speculatively. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (e) (2) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\"> On May 28, 1998, the commissioner requested that the plaintiff provide more information about the uses of the copper oxide and ammonium chloride that were produced during the plaintiffs recycling process. The plaintiff responded in a letter dated July 7, 1998, that it no longer sold copper oxide to a fungicide manufacturer, but, instead, sold that material to a manufacturer of wood preservatives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\"> The commissioner\u2019s interpretation is supported by the agency\u2019s guidance manual. See generally Industrial Economics, Inc., Guidance Manual on the RCRA Regulation of Recycled Hazardous Wastes (March, 1986) pp. 2-3 through 2-4; footnote 14 of this opinion. In the section addressing the uses of spent materials constituting disposal, the guidance manual provides the following hypothetical: \u201cAn acid etching solution (a spent material exhibiting the characteristic of corrosivity) is reclaimed for its zinc content. The zinc (which does not exhibit any hazardous waste characteristics) is then used in a fertilizer that also does not exhibit any hazardous waste characteristics. The recycler uses the fertilizer on his own land but does not market it to the general public.\u201d Id., p. 2-3. The guidance manual concludes that, \u201c[b]ecause material with value\u2014the zinc\u2014is recovered from the etching solution, the activity is classified as reclamation. However, the reclamation step is part of a recycling process that ends with the zinc being placed on the ground. Because the ultimate step is use constituting disposal, the etching solution is a solid waste and is subject to . . . [s]ubtitle C regulation.\u201d Id., p. 2-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> The plaintiff also argues that the commissioner improperly required it to shoulder the burden of proving that none of the buyers of its copper oxide applies it to the land alone or in other products. The plaintiff bears the burden of substantiating its claim of exemption from regulation. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2 (f) (2000). The plaintiff argues that it met its burden because it introduced evidence of the <em>intended </em>uses of the copper oxide. We disagree. The regulation applies to materials that <em>are </em>applied, as opposed to materials that are <em>intended to be </em>applied, to land. Id., \u00a7 261.2 (e) (2) (i). Substantial evidence in the record supports the commissioner\u2019s determination that copper oxide is used in products, such as fungicides, that are applied to land.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
