The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>petitioner, Bernard Gipson, who is indigent, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel because his appellate counsel failed to file a petition for certification with this court challenging the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment upholding his conviction. The habeas court dismissed the habeas petition, concluding that the defendant had not been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the habeas court on the ground that the petitioner had no right to the assistance of counsel in connection with the filing of a petition for certification to this court. We conclude that the petitioner was entitled to such assistance under General Statutes \u00a7 51-296 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, consequently, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. In 1994, a jury found the petitioner guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>134 (a) (3), and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioner appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly had denied his motion to suppress a witness\u2019 pretrial identification. The Appellate Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim without opinion and affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gipson, </em>37 Conn. App. 932, 657 A.2d 730 (1995). The petitioner did not file a petition for certification to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Thereafter, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he had been deprived of the effective assistance of appellate counsel in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. In particular, the petitioner asserted that the attorney who had been appointed to represent him in his direct appeal to the Appellate Court improperly had failed to file a petition for certification to appeal to this court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 51-197F<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Book, 1978-97, \u00a7\u00a7 4126<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 4127<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (now Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 84-1 and 84-2, respectively). On October 17, 1997, following an evidentiary hearing, the habeas court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition on the ground that the petitioner had not established that, under the circumstances, his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to file a petition for certification constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The habeas court, however, granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the habeas court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and also granted his application for a waiver of fees, costs and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>On appeal from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court, the petitioner claimed that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to file a petition for certification had deprived him of his right to the effective assistance of counsel under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and under \u00a7 51-296 (a). The Appellate Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s appeal, concluding that the petitioner could not prevail because, as a threshold matter, he has no federal constitutional or state statutory right to the assistance of counsel in connection with the filing of a petition for certification. Specifically, the Appellate Court, relying on federal precedent, concluded that the federal constitutional right to counsel in criminal cases does not extend to discretionary state appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>54 Conn. App. 400, 405-406, 735 A.2d 847 (1999). The Appellate Court further concluded that \u00a7 51-296 does not provide an indigent defendant with a right to the assistance of counsel in connection with the filing of a petition for certification. Id., 407, 413, 421. Judge Lavery<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> issued a concurring opinion in which he concluded, contrary to the holding of the Appellate Court majority, that \u00a7 51-296 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>does afford an indigent defendant the right to counsel in connection with the filing of a petition for certification.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 422 <em>(Lavery, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification limited to the issue whether a \u201ccriminal defendant [has] a [state]<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in connection with [the filing of] a petition for certification . . . .\u201d <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>251 Conn. 915, 740 A.2d 864 (1999). We thereafter expanded the certified question, however, to include a second issue, namely, whether \u201ca criminal defendant [has] a state statutory right to the assistance of counsel in connection with [the filing of] a petition for certification . . . .\u201d Id. Essentially for the reasons set forth by Judge Lavery in his concurring opinion in <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 421-34, we conclude that, under \u00a7 51-296 (a), an indigent criminal defendant has a right to the assistance of counsel for purposes of filing a petition for certification seeking this court\u2019s review of a judgment of the Appellate Court affirming a trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Appellate Court and remand the case to that court for a determination of whether the habeas court properly rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Whether \u00a7 51-296 (a) affords an indigent criminal defendant the right to the assistance of counsel in connection with the filing of a petition for certification is a question of statutory interpretation that we review according to well settled principles. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 238 n.23, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\u201cAs with all issues of statutory interpretation, we look first to the language of the statute.\u201d <em>In re Michaela Lee R, </em>253 Conn. 570, 583, 756 A.2d 214 (2000). Section 51-296 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>nal action . . . the court before which the matter is pending shall, if it determines after investigation by the public defender or his office that a defendant is indigent as defined under . . . chapter [887],<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> designate a public defender, assistant public defender or deputy assistant public defender to represent such indigent defendant . . . .\u201d Inasmuch as \u00a7 51-296 (a) contains no express reference to appellate proceedings, the focus of our inquiry necessarily involves the scope of the term \u201cany criminal action\u201d as it is used in that statutory subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">As the Appellate Court observed, \u201cthe words \u2018any criminal action\u2019 are not defined in \u00a7 51-296 or chapter 887, nor is the meaning of those words readily apparent from their context . . . .\u201d <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 409. It, therefore, \u201cis appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>253 Conn. 683, 696, 755 A.2d 850 (2000); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree with the Appellate Court that the word \u201cany,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 51-296 (a), connotes \u201call\u201d or \u201cevery.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 409 (\u201c[t]he word any in statutes is generally used in the sense of all or every and its meaning is comprehensive in scope and inclusive in range\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We, therefore, may presume that the legislature, in using the word \u201cany\u201d to modify the term \u201ccriminal action,\u201d intended that term to be broad, rather than restrictive, in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>As this court previously has stated, \u201cthe word \u2018action\u2019 has no precise meaning and the scope of proceedings which will be included within the term as used in the statutes depends upon the nature and puipose of the particular statute in question.\u201d <em>Carbone </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>126 Conn. 602, 605, 13 A.2d 462 (1940); see also <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>210 Conn. 721, 730, 557 A.2d 116 (1989) (\u201c[i]n a general sense the word action means the lawful demand of one\u2019s right in a court of justice; and in this sense it may be said to include any proceeding in such a court for the puipose of obtaining such redress as the law provides\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Dayco Corp. </em>v. <em>Fred T. Roberts &amp; Co., </em>192 Conn. 497, 502, 472 A.2d 780 (1984) (same). Because the word \u201caction\u201d may have \u201cdifferent meanings in different contexts ... we [take] a functional approach in our construction of the [word], eschewing the application of inflexible mies in favor of a contextual analysis.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>233 Conn. 460, 467-68, 659 A.2d 707 (1995) (constming meaning of term final judgment). For an understanding of that context, we turn, first, to the legislative history of \u00a7 51-296, which is contained in the majority opinion of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\u201cPrior to 1965, counsel was provided for indigent defendants under limited circumstances in trial proceedings only, despite the existence of appellate review. From 1965 to 1974, the statutory right to counsel included representation in appeals to the Appellate Session of the trial court and on certification to the Supreme Court, in addition to trial proceedings. In 1974, the legislature eliminated all reference to a statutory right to counsel in appeals of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\u201cConnecticut \u2018was the first state to adopt the public defender system.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>154 Conn. 631, 635, 228 A.2d 132 (1967). Since at least 1917, the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>has recognized an indigent\u2019s right, in limited circumstances, to the assistance of counsel. See Public Acts 1917, c. 225; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>supra, 635. Public Acts 1917, c. 225, \u00a7 1, required the judges of the Superior Court to appoint an attorney to act \u2018in the defense of all persons charged with crime in said court when such person is without funds sufficient to employ counsel for such defense.\u2019 In 1921, the legislature amended, as follows, the public defender statute to specify the courts before which [public defenders] could appear: \u2018Each such public defender shall act as attorney in the defense of any person charged with crime in either the superior court, the court of common pleas or the district court of Waterbury, in the county for which he is appointed, when such accused person is without funds sufficient to employ counsel for such defense.\u2019 Public Acts 1921, c. 129, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\u201cIn 1958, the text of General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 54-80 provided in relevant part: \u2018Each such public defender shall act as attorney in the defense of any person charged with crime in either the superior court or the court of common pleas for the county for which he has been appointed, when such person is without funds sufficient to employ counsel for such defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\u201cIn 1959, the legislature established the Circuit Court; Public Acts 1959, No. 28, \u00a7 1; and modified the scope of a public defender\u2019s representation. In Public Acts 1959, No. 28, \u00a7 13, which was codified at General Statutes (Sup. 1959) \u00a7 54-81a, the legislature first used the phrase \u2018any criminal action.\u2019 That act provided in relevant part: \u2018In any criminal action in the circuit court, the judge before whom the matter is pending shall, if he determines that the interests of justice so require, appoint an attorney to act as special public defender and represent the defendant. . . .\u2019 Public Acts 1959, No. 28, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cAlthough criminal defendants have had a statutory right to appeal since at least 1882; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>71 Conn. 457, 460, 42 A. 640 (1899); the first statutory reference to an indigent\u2019s right to appellate counsel appeared in 1965. Public Acts 1965, No. 178, \u00a7 1, which amended \u00a7 54-8 la, provided in relevant part: \u2018In any criminal action in the circuit court, the judge before whom the matter is pending shall, if he determines that the interests of justice so require, designate the public defender for such circuit or an assistant public defender to represent the defendant. . . . The public defender or assistant public defender may, in the performance of his regular duties, appeal to the appellate division of the circuit court and, if certification is sought and granted, to the supreme court of errors. . . .\u2019 In 1967, the legislature amended \u00a7 54-81a to provide for representation of indigents in proceedings under writs of habeas corpus challenging extradition under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, General Statutes (Rev. to 1966) \u00a7 54-157 et seq. Public Acts 1967, No. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\u201cIn 1972, the legislature amended \u00a7 54-81a to reflect that the Appellate Division of the Court of Common Pleas had replaced the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court. Public Acts 1972, No. 281, \u00a7 23, which amended \u00a7 54-81a, provided in relevant part: \u2018The public defender or assistant public defender may, in the performance of his regular duties, appeal to the appellate division of the court of common pleas and, if certification is sought and granted, to the supreme court. . . .\u2019In 1974, the legislature amended \u00a7 54-8 la to reflect that the Court of Common Pleas had assumed the jurisdiction and functions of the Circuit Court; Public Acts 1974, No. 74-183, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 7 [P.A. 74-183]; and that the Appellate Session of the Superior Court had replaced the Appellate Division of the Court of Common Pleas. [P.A.] 74-183, \u00a7 9. [Public Acts] 74-183, \u00a7 150, which amended \u00a7 54-81a, stated in relevant part: \u2018In any criminal action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>in the court of common pleas, the judge before whom the matter is pending shall, if he determines that the interests of justice so require, designate a public defender or an assistant public defender to represent the defendant. . . .

Public Acts 1974, No. 74-317, \u00a7 12 [P.A. 74-317]. [Public Acts 74-317, \u00a7 7] was codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 51-296, and, as enacted, provided in relevant part: \u2018(a) <em>In any criminal action, </em>in any habeas corpus proceeding arising from a criminal matter, in any extradition proceeding, or in any juvenile court matter, the court before which the matter is pending shall, if it determines, after investigation by the public defender or his office, that a defendant is indigent, as defined under this act, designate a public defender or assistant public defender to represent such indigent defendant . . . .\u2019 (Emphasis added.) As enacted, \u00a7 51-296 did not mention appellate proceedings and, despite minor amendments, which are unimportant for purposes of this discussion, the text of \u00a7 51-296 remains unchanged. The legislative history of the adoption of \u00a7 51-296 contains no discussion concerning the ehmination of the provision authorizing public defenders to pursue discretionary appeals to our Supreme Court.

App. 410-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>For several reasons, we are persuaded that this legislative genealogy, when viewed in proper context, supports the petitioner\u2019s contention that he has a statutory right to the assistance of counsel in connection with the filing of a petition for certification. First, in 1963, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 357-58, 83 S. Ct. 814, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1963), held that an indigent criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel in a first appeal as of right.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In this state, defendants have had a right of appeal from a judgment of conviction since at least 1794. See Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut in America 1784-91, An Act Concerning Delinquents, If4, p. 39 (passed 1784). Thus, in 1974, when the legislature mandated that a public defender be appointed for an indigent criminal defendant in \u201cany criminal action,\u201d it already was well established that a defendant had a federal constitutional right to the appointment of counsel in connection with his or her first appeal. This fact belies the state\u2019s construction of the word \u201caction\u201d as including only trial proceedings because it is unlikely that the legislature, having been aware of the federal constitutional entitlement to appellate counsel in connection with a defendant\u2019s first appeal as of right, would have enacted a statute mandating the appointment of trial counsel but not counsel to represent the defendant in connection with his or her first appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In other words, we perceive no rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>reason why the legislature, having made express provision for the appointment of counsel in \u00a7 51-296 (a), would have excluded a first appeal from the purview of that requirement because, in this state, as in other states, an indigent criminal defendant has a constitutional right to the appointment of not only trial counsel, but also counsel to represent him or her in connection with a first appeal as of right.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, although it lawfully could have limited the mandatory appointment of counsel to first appeals as of right, the legislature, in placing the word \u201cany\u201d before the term \u201ccriminal action,\u201d evinced its intent that the word \u201caction\u201d encompass all appeals and not merely first appeals.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>This conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that the term \u201cany criminal action\u201d is not qualified or limited in any way. In contrast, the legislature repeatedly \u201cuse[d] qualifying language to limit the scope of [the] phrase [in any criminal action] between 1959 and 1974. In 1959, when the legislature first used this phrase, it qualified it by stating \u2018[i]n any criminal action in the circuit court . . . .\u2019 Public Acts 1959, No. 28, \u00a7 13. In 1974, when the Court of Common Pleas assumed the jurisdiction and functions of the Circuit Court; see [P.A.] 74-183, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 7; the legislature once again limited the scope of this phrase by stating \u2018[i]n any criminal action in the court of common pleas . . . .\u2019 [P.A.] 74-183, \u00a7 150. In 1974, when the legislature eliminated the reference to appellate proceedings in \u00a7 51-8 la by repealing that statute and it adopted P.A. 74-317, \u00a7 7, it failed to use any qualifying language to limit the scope of \u2018[i]n any criminal action . . . .\u2019 As evidenced by its conduct between 1959 and 1974, \u2018[t]he legislature is quite aware of how to use language when it wants to express its intent to qualify or limit the operation of a statute\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>43 Conn. App. 801, 825, 687 A.2d 1279 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 908, 689 A.2d 472 (1997); and the phrases \u2018in the circuit court\u2019 and \u2018in the court of common pleas\u2019 cannot be construed as excessive verbiage because \u2018[w]e presume that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment, and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. \u2019 <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 196, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998). If the legislature had intended to limit the scope of P.A. 74-317, \u00a7 7, to encompass only the appointment of counsel in trial proceedings, it would follow, in light of its conduct between 1959 and 1974, that the legislature would have qualified [the term] \u2018[i]n any criminal action\u2019 in P.A. 74-317, \u00a7 7, by referring to the trial court.\u201d <em>Gipson v.

There is nothing in the history of P.A. 74-317 to indicate that the legislature, in establishing a public defender services commission and consolidating the provisions pertaining to the appointment of counsel under the new statutory scheme relating to that commission, intended to eliminate any rights that previously had been afforded indigent defendants. Indeed, the sparse legislative history that bears on this issue suggests a contrary conclusion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finally, we are reluctant to ascribe such an intent to the legislature in light of the fact that, as the Appellate Court recognized, discretionary review by this court \u201cplays a vital role in our judicial system . . . .\u201d <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Section 1 of P.A. 74-317 lends additional support to the statutory interpretation urged by the petitioner. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>particular, that section mandated that public defender \u201cservices . . . consist of those duties carried out by superior court, circuit court and court of common pleas public defenders prior to October 1,1975, and responsibilities provided for by this act . . . .\u201d P.A. 74-317, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 51-289 (d). Under \u00a7\u00a7 54-80 and 54-8 la,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the duties of this state\u2019s public defenders prior to October 1, 1975, included the representation of indigent defendants at all levels of appeal. Because the legislature surely was aware of that fact; see, e.g., <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, 583, 726 A.2d 502 (1999) (\u201c[w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); P.A. 74-317, \u00a7 1, is persuasive evidence that the legislature intended for public defenders to continue to represent defendants in connection with appeals to this court. Thus, an interpretation of the term \u201cany criminal action\u201d in \u00a7 51-296 as excluding discretionary appeals to this court would conflict with the express mandate of P.A. 74-317, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We are bound to avoid such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>interpretation. In a case such as this one, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201cmore than one [statutory provision] is involved, we presume that the legislature intended [those provisions] to be read together to create a harmonious body of law . . . and we construe the [provisions], if possible, to avoid conflict between them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eskin </em>v. <em>Castiglia, </em>253 Conn. 516, 527, 753 A.2d 927 (2000). In contrast, an interpretation of the term \u201cany criminal action\u201d as including appeals to this court gives full meaning to both \u00a7 51-289 and \u00a7 51-296. Se<em>e Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>supra, 583-84 (\u201c[w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . [and] we read each statute in a manner that will not thwart, its intended purpose or lead to absurd results\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Finally, it is undisputed that public defenders and special public defenders consistently have been appointed to represent indigent defendants in connection with appeals to this court since \u00a7 51-296 was enacted over twenty-five years ago. Indeed, we are informed by amicus curiae, the office of the chief public defender, that public defenders have filed over 800 petitions for certification with this court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>long and uninterrupted history of the appointment of counsel to represent indigent defendants in connection with petitions for certification, it is reasonable to presume legislative awareness of the practice; in such circumstances, it also is reasonable to treat the legislative inaction as tacit approval of the statutory interpretation upon which that practice has been predicated. See <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan Associates, </em>250 Conn. 763, 783, 739 A.2d 238 (1999) (\u201c[although we usually have given weight to legislative inaction following a <em>judicial </em>construction of a statute, on occasion we also have noted the significance of legislative inaction following an <em>administrative </em>construction of a statute\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">For these reasons, we are persuaded that \u00a7 51-296 (a) accorded the petitioner the right to representation in connection with the filing of a petition for certification following the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment upholding his robbery conviction in 1995. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court in this case. Because, however, the Appellate Court did not reach the issue whether the trial court properly concluded that the petitioner\u2019s right to counsel had not been violated notwithstanding his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to file a petition for certification, we remand the case to the Appellate Court for its resolution of that issue.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-296 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any criminal action, in any habeas corpus proceeding arising from a criminal matter, in any extradition proceeding, or in any delinquency matter, the court before which the matter is pending shall, if it determines after investigation by the public defender or his office that a defendant is indigent as defined under . . . chapter [887], designate a public defender, assistant public defender or deputy assistant public defender to represent such indigent defendant, unless, in a misdemeanor case, at the time of the application for appointment of counsel, the court decides to dispose of the pending charge without subjecting the defendant to a sentence involving immediate incarceration or a suspended sentence of incarceration with a period of probation or the court believes that the disposition of the pending case at a later date will not result in a sentence involving immediate incarceration or a suspended sentence of incarceration with a period of probation and makes a statement to that effect on the record.

If, however, a state grants a right of appeal to criminal defendants, the fourteenth amendment mandates that the state also provide counsel for those indigent defendants who wish to exercise that right. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 356-57, 83 S.

In addition, we note that, although the state disputes the petitioner\u2019s claim of a right to counsel in connection with the filing of a petition for certification, the state does not dispute the principle that the right to counsel, if such right exists, includes the right to competent counsel.

See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> We note that the Appellate Court majority stated that, based on the reasons set forth by Judge Lavery in his concurring opinion, it would have rejected the merits of the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim if it had been required to reach the merits of that claim. <em>Gipson v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 421 n.12. It does not appear, however, that the Appellate Court majority actually reviewed and rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim on its merits as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the habeas court. Consequently, it is necessary that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>case be remanded to the Appellate Court for that court\u2019s review of the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b671-7\">MCDONALD, C.

After reviewing the record, I agree with Judge Lavery that the defendant failed to establish in the habeas court that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in connection with a petition for certification. <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>54 Conn. App. 400, 436, 735 A.2d 847 (1999) <em>(Lavery, J., </em>concurring.) I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court upholding the decision of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
