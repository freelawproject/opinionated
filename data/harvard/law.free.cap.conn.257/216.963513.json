After a hearing, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motions. The state, on granting of permission by the trial court, appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment dismissing the information, and this court transferred the case to itself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On appeal, the state claims that the trial court improperly granted the motion to suppress. Because we conclude that the search was conducted under exigent circumstances and was supported by probable cause, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The trial court, in its oral decision, documented by way of the transcript, found the following facts: \u201cOfficer Larry Eisenstein, a veteran member of the Stamford police department together with some colleagues, received information from a confidential informant. Officer Eisenstein was on duty, received a call from a confidential informant who said a motor vehicle was parked at 186 Greenwich Avenue [Stamford], a public housing residential building. [The informant] said that a car was in the lot described as an Olds [mobile] Cutlass . . . bearing Connecticut registration 679 MBX. Officer Eisenstein [had] work[ed] with the confidential informant since 1990 and recently and [on] over ten occasions received reliable information leading to the successful arrest, seizure and convictions of other defendants, and in excess of thirty since 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u201cThe informant provided Officer Eisenstein with information that the said motor vehicle contained an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>unspecified quantity of contraband, specifically, crack cocaine inside of the motor vehicle. The confidential informant further stated that the vehicle was operated by a black male who was described as 6 feet, over 200 pounds, who was in the company of a female known to the confidential informant as Marlene.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201cThe officer set up a surveillance following the receipt of that information. Upon arrival at the location the [officers] confirmed the information provided by the confidential informant with respect to the location and description of the motor vehicle, and the presence of a black male fitting the description. The surveillance was conducted for a period of about fifteen minutes. During which time no drugs were seen by the police officer nor were any transactions observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u201cBut the police officer did observe a black male fitting the description later found and identified as the defendant . . . approaching the vehicle leaning down from his waist to the driver\u2019s side of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u201cThe police moved in and [the defendant] fled on foot, and he attempted to cross a bridge. He was apprehended approximately 100 feet from the location of said motor vehicle. The defendant fought the police who identified themselves as police officers with a badge plainly displayed during the pursuit and during the resistance. The defendant was wrestled down. The keys were taken from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u201cThe confidential informant has prior arrests for drug possession and in fact has a pending case in the Stamford judicial district. The confidential informant did not know the defendant but did know his companion Marlene. The confidential informant never provided information that he saw Marlene handle drugs nor did he say the defendant handled drugs. The confidential informant never . . . purchased . . . drugs from the defendant nor Marlene, however, the confidential infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>mant is in fact known at least to Officer Eisenstein to be a drug user. When the defendant was apprehended, no drugs were found on his person. The police had previously determined prior to moving in that the car was registered to someone other than the defendant and his companion. Specifically . . . Acarde Andre Dozier.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u201cThe police officer determined that the defendant was Emanuel B. Smith, Jr. after apprehending him and seizing a pager and some cash. The confidential informant never saw drugs being placed in the motor vehicle. The confidential informant did not witness nor participate in the crime. At this time of the search and subject seizure the motor vehicle was unoccupied and locked by the defendant with keys in his possession. The defendant was not in the car. There were no plain view circumstances wherein contraband was seen by the police officers in the car nor were there any [exigent] circumstances at the time of the search of the automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">On the basis of these facts, the trial court stated that the confidential informant\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d was \u201cat issue. \u201d The trial court concluded that the informant\u2019s information and the officer\u2019s observations were insufficient to establish probable cause. The court also concluded, however, that there were no exigent circumstances to justify the search.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court found that the search violated the defendant\u2019s right to be free from an unreasonable search under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>fourth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court ordered that evidence of the crack cocaine found in the vehicle by the police be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the appropriate standard pursuant to which we review a challenge to a trial court\u2019s granting of a suppression motion. This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. That is the standard and scope of this court\u2019s judicial review of decisions of the trial court. ... In other words, to the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether those findings were clearly erroneous. Where, however, the trial court has drawn conclusions of law, our review is plenary, and we must decide whether those conclusions are legally and logically correct in light of the findings of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>248 Conn. 183, 188-89, 728 A.2d 493 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The state challenges the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that the search of the vehicle was not supported by probable cause. In deciding that probable cause existed to search the car, we engage in plenary review. Id., 189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u201cProbable cause to search exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the particular items sought to be seized are connected with criminal activity or will assist in a particular apprehension or conviction . . . and (2) there is probable cause to believe that the items sought to be seized will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>229 Conn. 164, 171, 640 A.2d 94 (1994). The determination of whether probable cause exists under the fourth amendment to the federal constitution, and under article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution, is made pursuant to a \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 231-32, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 544, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). Under the <em>Gates </em>test, a court must examine all of the evidence relating to the issue of probable cause and, on the basis of that evidence, make a commonsense, practical determination of whether probable cause existed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 544. We have said that the question is whether there was a fair probability that the contraband was within the place to be searched. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>supra, 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">In <em>Gates, </em>the United States Supreme Court abandoned its previous test for probable cause based upon informant reports as set forth in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969). The <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test had two independent prongs, the \u201creliability\u201d of the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>mant and \u201cthe basis of his knowledge.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 242. This court at first refused to apply the <em>Gates </em>test to informant reports under the Connecticut constitution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 236, 496 A.2d 498 (1985). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 544-45, however, this court held that we should apply the <em>Gates </em>\u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to such reports under our state constitution. Although the \u201creliability\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prongs are now no longer independent issues, they may nevertheless \u201cilluminate the common-sense, practical question of the existence of probable cause\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 192. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Gates, </em>\u201ca deficiency in one [factor] may be compensated for, in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to the other, or by some other indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 233. The court held in <em>Gates </em>that, where confirmation from other sources such as police investigation exists, the police \u201ccould properly conclude that it was not unlikely that [the informant] also had access to rehable information of the [defendant\u2019s] alleged illegal activities.\u201d Id., 245. The court stated that \u201c[i]t is enough that there was a fair probability that the [informant] had obtained his entire story either from the [defendants] or someone they trusted.\u201d Id., 246. As Justice White observed in his <em>Gates </em>concurrence, informant reports require \u201csome showing of facts from which an inference may be drawn that the informant is credible and that his information was obtained in a reliable way.\u201d Id., 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">As to the informant\u2019s \u201creliability\u201d in this case, we have consistently held that an informant\u2019s record of providing information that led to arrests and seizures of contraband is sufficient to establish the reliability of the informant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Respass, </em>256 Conn. 164, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>175-76, 770 A.2d 471 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>223 Conn. 127, 136, 613 A.2d 211 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>205 Conn. 560, 567, 534 A.2d 1165 (1987). In the present case, the trial court found that: \u201cOfficer Eisenstein [had] work[ed] with the confidential informant since 1990 and recently and [on] over ten occasions received reliable information leading to the successful arrest, seizure and convictions of other defendants, and in excess of thirty since 1990.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that this record of past reliability was sufficient to find that the confidential informant was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court properly concluded that the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge was insufficient because neither the informant nor the officers had seen cocaine in the car or upon the defendant\u2019s person, nor had the informant bought drugs from the defendant. We conclude, however, that the trial court\u2019s requirement of firsthand visual knowledge of the presence of drugs or of buying drugs went beyond the requirements of <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 231-32, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 544. We conclude that the informant\u2019s overhearing of the defendant planning or admitting criminal activity constituted a type of firsthand knowledge formerly required under <em>Aguilar </em>and \u201chighly relevant\u201d under <em>Gates. </em>\u201cGenerally, it may be said that the surest way to establish a basis of knowledge is by a showing that the informant is passing on what is to him first-hand information . . . [as] when a person indicates he has overheard the defendant planning or admitting criminal activity . . . .\u201d 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (3d Ed. 1996) \u00a7 3.3 (d), pp. 141-42.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>We also conclude that the police investigation confirming details of the informant\u2019s report may establish that the informant obtained the information in a rehable way. In <em>Gates, </em>an anonymous letter to the police stated that after Gates flew to Florida he would be driving his family car from Florida to Bloomington, Illinois, and that he would have drugs in it. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 225. Police investigation confirmed his travel arrangements. Id., 226. A search warrant for the vehicle was obtained and Gates\u2019 car was searched as he returned to Illinois. Id. In <em>Gates, </em>the unknown informant\u2019s basis of knowledge was not spelled out and the informant\u2019s past reliability was necessarily unknown. Id., 227. Nevertheless, the court held that corroboration by the police by investigation of Gates was sufficient to establish probable cause. Id., 241-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In this case, the trial court found that the police surveillance confirmed that the vehicle was where the informant said it would be. As the trial court found, the police observed the defendant, who matched the informant\u2019s description, approach the vehicle, open it and bend at the waist into the front seat. He then fled from the vehicle when the police officers approached him. We conclude that probable cause to believe the vehicle contained the drugs was established under <em>Gates </em>and <em>Barton. </em>In the words of <em>Gates, </em>this \u201call indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>cated, albeit not with certainty, that the informant\u2019s other assertions also were true.\u201d Id., 244. Here, as in <em>Gates, </em>the police could infer that there was a fair probability that the information came, as Eisenstein testified, from the defendant or someone whom he trusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">As <em>Gates </em>points out, basis of knowledge no longer has an \u201cindependent status\u201d as to probable cause. Id., 230. Under the <em>Gates </em>definition of probable cause, self-verifying detail such as the location of the vehicle and the description of the defendant and the use of the vehicle to keep something in the vehicle may lead one to conclude that the information is not merely a \u201ccasual rumor.\u201d 2 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 3.3 (d), p. 141. Partial corroboration of the informant\u2019s report by facts developed by police also may be considered as was done in <em>Gates. </em>In this case, the police observed the defendant approach the vehicle, reach into the floorboard area and flee when he saw the officers approaching him. His flight was suggestive of criminal activity in itself and supports a finding of probable cause. Cf. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124-25, 120 S. Ct. 673, 145 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2000) (police officer justified in suspecting criminal activity when suspect fled after seeing police).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We conclude that a commonsense, practical basis for finding probable cause existed. Considering all of the circumstances leading up to the search\u2014the informant\u2019s known reliability and his detailed report as to the use of the car to store cocaine, the informant\u2019s accurate descriptions of the defendant and the car, his personal knowledge of the defendant\u2019s companion, Marlene, and the defendant\u2019s flight from the car after seeing the police\u2014a proper application of <em>Gates </em>and <em>Barton </em>would support a fair probability that contraband would be found in the defendant\u2019s car. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that probable cause was lacking to support a search of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The state also argues that the trial court improperly concluded that the search was unreasonable because it found that \u201cthere were no exigent circumstances for a warrantless search . . . .\u201d We agree. The \u201cautomobile exception\u201d is premised, in part, upon the inherent mobility of automobiles; see <em>California </em>v. <em>Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 390-91, 105 S. Ct. 2066, 85 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 155, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981); and that <em>inherent mobility itself </em>creates exigent circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kolinsky, </em>182 Conn. 533, 540, 438 A.2d 762 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973, 101 S. Ct. 2054, 68 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1981) (exigency when \u201cdefendant\u2019s car [was] inherently mobile . . . [and] it was parked on a public street where access was not meaningfully restricted\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra, 155 (\u201can automobile is, usually, inherently mobile and, thus, presents a continuing possibility of being moved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201cUnder both the federal and the state constitutions, the police must first obtain a warrant before conducting a search, unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (warrant required before every search or seizure, subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions ...)....\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>243 Conn. 732, 737, 708 A.2d 1354 (1998). One of these recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement is the so-called \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 428-29, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u201cThe justification for . . . [the] \u2018automobile exception\u2019 is twofold: (1) the inherent mobility of an automobile creates \u2018exigent circumstances\u2019; and (2) the expectation of privacy with respect to one\u2019s automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>is significantly less than that relating to one\u2019s home or office.\u201d Id., 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The United States Supreme Court has placed an increasing emphasis on the reduced expectation of privacy justification for the \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d See 3 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 7.2 (b), pp. 476-77. In <em>California </em>v. <em>Carney, </em>supra, 471 U.S. 391, the court stated that \u201c[e]ven in cases where an automobile [is] not immediately mobile, the lesser expectation of privacy resulting from its use as a readily mobile vehicle justifie[s] application of the vehicular exception.\u201d Thus, under the fourth amendment, a warrantless vehicle search does not require a showing of exigent circumstances. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>527 U.S. 465, 119 S. Ct. 2013, 144 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1999); <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Labron, </em>518 U.S. 938, 116 S. Ct. 2485, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1031 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 120, 547 A.2d 10 (1988), we noted that, under the constitution of Connecticut, \u201cthe automobile exception permits a warrantless search of an automobile whenever the police have probable cause to do so.\u201d Later, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 377, 386-87, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993), we held that a warrantless search of an impounded vehicle violated article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut. Cf. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51-52, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970) (warrantless search of impounded vehicle reasonable under fourth amendment). We stated: \u201cWe tolerate the warrantless on-the-scene automobile search <em>only </em>because obtaining a warrant would be impracticable in light of the inherent mobility of automobiles and the latent exigency that that mobility creates.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 384-85. <em>In Miller, </em>we reasoned that once a vehicle is impounded, there is no continuing possibility that it will be moved, and therefore obtaining a warrant is no longer impracticable. Id., 385 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>In the present case, there was a continuing possibility that the defendant\u2019s car, which was located in a parking lot accessible to a public housing building, would be moved. The vehicle was not impounded. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 156 (car \u201cwas parked on easily accessible property open to the public\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>170 Conn. 618, 625, 398 A.2d 140, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 865, 97 S.
