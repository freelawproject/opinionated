J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASS\">Petitioner, an incorporated law firm, contends that the respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) erred when it (1) reduced the amount of attorneys fees agreed to by the injured worker and his or her attorney, petitioner herein, when the agreed fees were within the WCAB\u2019s own guidelines for setting attorneys fees, and (2) without prior notice awarded petitioner less than the attorneys fee agreed to by petitioner and its clients.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is merit only in the second contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The issues before this court pertain to the setting of attorneys fees for the attorney for the injured worker in workers\u2019 compensation claims before the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Attorneys fees payable to the legal counsel for the injured worker are a lien on the injured\u2019s award; thus, they come out of the injured\u2019s recovery. Labor Code section 4906 provides that \u201cNo charge, claim, or agreement for... legal services or disbursements... is enforceable, valid, or binding in excess of a reasonable amount. The appeals board may determine what constitutes such reasonable amount.\u201d  The purpose of Labor Code section 4906 is to protect claimants before the appeals board from the exaction of excessive fees. <em>(Coviello </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 273, 276-277 [259 P.2d 7]; <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>v. <em>Small Claims Court </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 643, 646 [111 Cal.Rptr. 6]; <em>Koker </em>v. <em>Elk Brass Mfg. Co. </em>(appeals board en banc opinion, 1971) 36 Cal.Comp.Cases 292, 294.) Further, it constitutes professional misconduct for an attorney to secure or attempt to secure fees in excess of those allowed by the appeals board. <em>(Coviello, supra; Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>v. <em>Small Claims Court, supra; Koker, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">A. Proceedings Before the Appeals Board</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In both matters herein, petitioner represented the injured workers in the appeals board proceedings. In one matter Dennis C. Jones is the injured worker, in the other Mary Roslansky is. A settlement agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was signed by the parties and submitted to the appeals board for approval in each case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the Jones matter the gross settlement amount was $4,000; in the Roslansky matter it was $7,127.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement form has a space for the attorney for the injured to insert the attorney fee he requests. In the Jones matter (2 Civ. 54849) the requested fee was $500; in the Roslansky matter (2 Civ. 56373) the requested fee was $800. The workers\u2019 compensation judge, who was the same in both matters, approved the settlements but awarded attorneys fees of $400 and $700 in each case respectively. Thus, the judge \u201creduced\u201d the requested fees by $100 in each case. In so doing, the judge gave no prior notice to petitioner. In each \u201cOrder Approving Compromise and Release\u201d the judge stated the awarded fee was \u201creasonable\u201d but gave no explanation of his rationale for reducing the requested fee agreed to by petitioner and its client.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Petitioner sought reconsideration in each case. It alleged a denial of due process in that it was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the \u201creduction\u201d of its requested fees. It challenged the power of the judge to reduce them, and it asserted that the fees awarded were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">As required by section 10860 of the WCAB Rules of Practice and Procedure (hereinafter WCAB Rules), the judge filed a report on each petition for reconsideration wherein he responded to the contentions made by petitioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In the Jones matter, the judge, in his report rejected the allegation that petitioner was denied due process by not being given notice before the reduction of the requested fee as \u201cPetitioner did not ask for hearing\u201d and \u201csubmitted the issue of its fee with the Compromise and Release [settlement agreement] for decision without hearing.\u201d The judge also justified the amount of fee as the case was \u201cof less than average difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In the Roslansky matter the judge in his report again argued petitioner was not entitled to a hearing on his requested fee as \u201cThe submission of a Compromise and Release with request for attorneys\u2019 fees in a particular amount should be deemed a waiver of any right by [petitioner] to a hearing on reduction of their fees.\u201d The judge asserted that petitioner should have submitted the evidence supporting the requested fees at the time the settlement agreement was forwarded to the appeals board for approval.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge also maintained that the amount of the awarded fee was correct as the \u201ccase is one of no more than average difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The WCAB denied reconsideration in both cases. It affirmed the reduced fees. In Roslansky the board, in denying reconsideration, relied upon the judge\u2019s report. In Jones the WCAB \u201cconcurred] in the opinion of the workers\u2019 compensation judge that this case was at most one of average complexity.\u201d The WCAB also stated in part in its \u201cOpinion and Order Denying Reconsideration\u201d in Jones: \u201cIt is the Board\u2019s opinion that under <em>[Robert G. Beloud, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 729 (123 Cal.Rptr. 750)] the attorneys were entitled to notice and hearing (if they so requested) if the workers\u2019 compensation judge intended to reduce their attorneys\u2019 fees. However, the Board further finds that this defect was cured since petitioners were afforded the opportunity to present their arguments supporting the higher fee in their petition for reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Petitioner contends that (1) the judge had no power to reduce the fees specified in the settlement papers as the requested fees were in compliance with the WCAB\u2019s own guidelines and (2) petitioner was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the judge\u2019s reduction of the requested fees. Petitioner also questions the amounts of the awarded fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">A.  Power to Reduce Fee Agreed by Injured Worker and Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Petitioner contends that the judge erred in reducing the fee agreed to by petitioner and the injured worker in each case as the requested fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>was within the appeals board\u2019s own guidelines for attorneys fees in these types of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Section 10775 of the WCAB Rules provides: \u201c\u201cReasonable Attorneys Fee. In establishing a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge shall consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201c(a) The responsibility assumed by the attorney,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201c(b) The care exercised in developing the nature and extent of the injuries involved in the case,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201c(c) The time involved, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">\u201c(d) The results obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">\u201cReference should be made to guidelines contained in the Policy and Procedural Manual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">\u201cThrough its power to grant reconsideration on its own motion, the Board shall exercise administrative review to ascertain the extent to which these guidelines are followed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The WCAB Policy and Procedural Manual, Index number 6.8.4, effective September 11, 1975, provides: \u201cThe Labor Code imposes an obligation on the workers\u2019 compensation judges to determine what is a <em>reasonable </em>attorney\u2019s fee in cases submitted to them for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">\u201cFor these reasons, the following is promulgated as a guideline for the use of the workers\u2019 compensation judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">\u201c1. In cases of average complexity, the Board believes a reasonable fee will be in the range of 9% to 12% of the permanent disability, death benefit or compromise and release awarded. In setting the fee, due consideration should be given to the fee allowed in prior awards, if any, in the same case. Where the prior fee has been nominal or nonexistent, a fee at the upper end of the range is indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u201cFurther, in setting the fee, consideration should be given to other disputed benefits obtained (temporary disability, further medical treatment, self-procured medical treatment and life pension).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u201c2. In cases of above average complexity, a fee in excess of the normal upper limit of 12% is warranted. Such cases may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201c(a) cases establishing a new or obscure theory of injury or law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u201c(b) cases involving highly disputed factual issues, where detailed investigation, interrogation of prospective witnesses, and participation in lengthy hearings are involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u201c(c) cases involving highly disputed medical issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\u201c(d) cases involving multiple defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">\u201c3. In cases of below average complexity, the fee may range downward from the 9% - 12% range to as low as 1%. Such cases may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">\u201c(a) the uncontested death cases where nominal proof of dependency is all that is required of counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">\u201c(b) the undisputed statutory 100% permanent disability case or other undisputed presumption cases;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">\u201c(c) other essentially undisputed cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">\u201cA $500 fee in a $45,000 death benefit award provides ample compensation for the time and skill involvement of applicant\u2019s attorney, where counsel is required to do no more than provide a marriage certificate and birth certificate. The Board emphatically rejects the theory that the applicant in such a case should pay a higher fee to provide an offset for the cases which counsel handles at a loss. There is no reason for the deserving widow, the blind, the paraplegic or other employee with a major disability to underwrite the case of the employee with a minor or questionable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">\u201c4. In considering the value of counsel\u2019s services, the criteria set forth in <em>Bentley </em>v. <em>IAC, </em>11 CCC 204, and <em>Rose, Klein &amp; Marias </em>v. <em>WCAB, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>39 CCC 771, are to be given full consideration. It should be realized that the time involvement of a recognized specialist, who has demonstrated his skill in the field, is to be valued much more highly on an hourly basis than the time involvement of a person less knowledgeable and skilled in the field of workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">\u201c5. If the record does not establish, to the satisfaction of the workers\u2019 compensation judge, a sufficient basis for determining the value of counsel\u2019s services, the judge should request counsel to supply the desired information. This need not be done orally on the record or by written communication, but the workers\u2019 compensation judge should be satisfied that there is an adequate basis for justifying the fee determination if it should be made an issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Simply because a case is of average complexity and the requested agreed fee is within the 9 percent to 12 percent range specified for cases of average complexity does not mean that the fee is correct under the guidelines. It is for the WCAB to determine where within the 9 percent to 12 percent range the fee should be set. In doing so consideration should be given to the standards set forth in WCAB Rules section 10775 and in the WCAB Policy &amp; Procedure Manual. Merely because the requested agreed fee is within the proper fee range does not obviate the WCAB complying with the statutory mandate that it determine the reasonableness of fees. Thus, while the WCAB should not lightly disregard a fee agreement between the attorney and his client, such an agreement is not binding upon the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">B. Notice of Reduction of Requested Fee</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Petitioner contends it was entitled to notification prior to the reductions of its requested fees. The WCAB now appears to retreat from its prior position that the judge erred in failing to give prior notice of the reduction of the requested fees. The question is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The issue correctly stated is whether prior notice and the opportunity to be heard must be given when the fee agreement between the injured worker and his attorney is disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u201cFee agreements are not forbidden by the language of Labor Code section 4906, nor by other statutes. On the contrary, their legality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>is tacitly recognized, both by statute and by court decision.\u201d (1A Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d rev. ed. 1979) \u00a7 16.02 [3].) \u201cThe wording of Labor Code \u00a7 4906 is such as to indicate that such agreements are valid and enforceable if not in excess of a reasonable amount.\u201d (1A Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 16.02 [3], fn. 12.) Similarly, section 10776 of the WCAB Rules<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not declare attorneys fee agreements necessarily invalid, but only requires their prompt submission to the WCAB for review. \u201cHowever, the restriction of their validity to such sums as the Appeals Board may determine to be reasonable effectively eliminates such agreements as instruments of value in compensation cases. These are not improper per se, but are ordinarily futile and inadvisable in view of the Appeals Board\u2019s power to determine the value of services and to fix fee allowances.\" (1A Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 16.02 [3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The WCAB rules regarding attorneys fees are in part a response to various court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In <em>Schilling v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1920) 47 Cal.App. 190 [190 P. 373], the injured, through the efforts of his counsel, settled his claim for $650. The commission (which is now the WCAB) allowed a $45 fee without a hearing on the issue. The attorney sought reconsideration and was granted a hearing; the attorney contended he had an oral contract for a one-third fee. The commission affirmed the $45 fee. While acknowledging that the fee agreement was not enforceable in excess of what the commission determined to be a reasonable amount, the court annulled the commission\u2019s decision on the ground that the attorney had not been given a fair hearing by the commission on the requested fee which had already been contracted between the injured and the attorney. (S<em>chilling, supra, </em>at p. 193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>In <em>Bentley </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 547 [171 P.2d 532] the workers\u2019 compensation claim proceeded to findings and award, whereunder the injured\u2019s attorney was allowed a $25 fee, the minimum fee customarily awarded. The attorney sought a rehearing by the commission which was denied. The court reversed. The court first observed that the attorney \u201cis not to be regarded in default nor as consenting to the fixing of a minimum fee by reason of his failure to offer evidence as to the value of his services.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 550.) The court then held: \u201cIf an award of attorney\u2019s fees was not to be based upon the facts which were known to the referee [now called \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation judge\u201d] and the commission, <em>the attorney should have been so advised and should have been allowed an opportunity to offer evidence as to all matters properly to be considered in fixing his fee. </em>His petition for rehearing [now called \u201cpetition for reconsideration\u201d] should have been granted for that purpose.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Ibid.) </em> Pursuant to paragraph 5 of the WCAB\u2019s own guidelines <em>(ante, </em>p. 234) the workers\u2019 compensation judge \u201cshould request counsel to supply the desired information\u201d where \u201cthe record does not establish, to the satisfaction of the workers\u2019 compensation judge, a sufficient basis for determining the value of counsel\u2019s services.\u201d Further, WCAB Rules, section 10882 suggests the judge should have given prior notice to petitioner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The WCAB\u2019s own procedure manual also indicates that this procedure of requesting additional information may be done informally. Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the workers\u2019 compensation judge, giving the attorney prior notice of the reduction of his fee would not result in a massive increase in the number of WCAB hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">As the judge\u2019s failure to give notice prior to reduction of the requested fee would appear to be improper based upon the WCAB\u2019s own regulations, the case must therefore be remanded for further proceedings. (Cf. <em>Morgan, Beauzay, Hammer, Ezgar, Bledsoe &amp; Rucka </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 353 [130 Cal.Rptr. 661].) Further, pursuant to the <em>Schilling </em>case, as petitioner had in each case an agreement with its client as to the amount of its fee, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>should have given petitioner in each case prior notice that he was going to disregard the agreement and award less than the amount of fee agreed to by the injured worker and petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The WCAB contends that, by reviewing the petitioner\u2019s petitions for reconsideration, the failure by the judge to give prior notice to petitioner of reduction of the fees was thereby remedied. The WCAB points out that in both cases it reviewed the entire record in response to the petition for reconsideration and then affirmed the fees as in accord with its own guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The WCAB\u2019s action in response to the petition for reconsideration was insufficient to remedy the procedural defect. At no time was petitioner specifically given a meaningful opportunity to present documentary evidence regarding its requested fee. It was not until <em>after </em>petitioner filed its petition for reconsideration and the judge filed his report thereon that petitioner learned for the first time the basis of his reduction of the requested agreed fees. The WCAB, rather than just denying the petitions, should have given petitioner specific notice that it would accept evidence on the issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We are cognizant that the portion of our decision herein which holds the judge should have given notice to petitioner prior to reduction of the requested fees may cause severe administrative problems for the WCAB in its orderly processing of settlement agreements if immediate implementation were required. (Cf. <em>Arp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 395, 411 [138 Cal.Rptr. 293, 563 P.2d 849].) Accordingly, our decision herein shall only apply to settlements submitted (1) on or after the date this decision becomes final, and (2) prior to that date where the matter is not yet final and the notice issue was raised on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Our decision herein should, however, not be construed to prohibit the WCAB from adopting procedural rules pursuant to Labor Code section 5307, subdivision (a), covering the determination of attorneys fees when a settlement includes a fee that has been agreed to by the injured work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>er and his attorney. The WCAB may properly require by express rule that the attorney in the settlement situation must submit documentation supporting his requested fee, to which his client has already agreed, at the time the settlement is submitted for approval.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such a WCAB rule may properly further provide that the judge may then determine the reasonableness of the requested fee and disallow part of the requested fee without prior notice to the attorney; the attorney\u2019s remedy is then a petition for reconsideration. The importance of such an express rule is that the attorney will be on notice that the WCAB will decide the fee issue on the documentation presented by the attorney.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The decisions of the WCAB are annulled and the matters are remanded to the WCAB with directions to provide petitioner with the opportunity to present substantiation for its requested agreed attorneys fees and for the WCAB to then reconsider the amounts of the attorneys fees to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Petitioner has advised its clients of these appellate proceedings and advised each of them that petitioner\u2019s interest is adverse to his and that each has the right to seek independent counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The form of the settlement agreement utilized by the parties is specified by WCAB Rules of Practice and Procedure (Cal.

All evidence applicant\u2019s attorneys wished to present on their fees should have been presented before the time that the Compromise and Release was considered. If such evidence is not in file when the approval of the Compromise and Release is made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>there may be a delay in applicant [the injured worker] receiving his funds. There may be need to receive additional evidence and set the matter for hearing on attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\u201cCertainly the holding of additional hearings on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees works to the detriment of all applicants. The Board\u2019s calendar presently is overcrowded and parties may have to wait up to six months to get a hearing date. Should the Board allow for hearings on attorneys\u2019 fees whenever they are reduced from the amount requested in the Compromise and Release, the crowded calendar of the Board can only become worse. All applicant\u2019s suffer thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\u201cDue process does require that applicants\u2019 attorneys be given an opportunity to be heard on the issue of their fees. The time for that hearing is before the Compromise and Release is approved, not after. This matter was set for hearing on November 16, 1978. Applicant, his attorney and defense counsel appeared at that time.. The parties agreed to submit a Compromise and Release. Certainly, the time that this matter was set for hearing could have been used to receive evidence of both written and oral nature on attorneys\u2019 fees. No good reason is presented by applicant\u2019s attorney as to the delay in presenting evidence or argument on attorneys\u2019 fees until after the Compromise and Release was approved. To assert this right for the first time on Petition circumvents the orderly procedures of the Board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\">WCAB Rules, section 10776: \u201cApproval of Attorneys Fee.

By such request the attorney leaves determination of the fee up to the judge on the basis of the record before him. If dissatisfied with the fee awarded the attorney\u2019s recourse is to seek reconsideration by the WCAB. He should include in his petition for reconsideration documentation supporting a fee higher than the one awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">It has always been advisable that where \u201can attorney.. .has rendered <em>unusual </em>services that do not appear in the record [he] should prepare and file with the Board a detailed statement of his services.\u201d (Italics added.)

Petitioner disputed this assertion. The adoption by the WCAB of an express rule would clarify the situation for attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b184-7\">ALLPORT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-d\">I concur in the result reached by the majority that in future cases the WCAB cannot reduce an agreed fee which is within the board\u2019s established guidelines without giving the attorney an opportunity to justify same. However, in my opinion, such a fee request should be clothed with a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness and be subject to reduction only after notice to the attorney and his being given an opportunity to further satisfy the board in this respect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
