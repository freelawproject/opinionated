Emery, holding deeds to property that Emery originally named \u201cPeterloon Farm.\u201d Peterloon Farm lies in three separate jurisdictions: Symmes Township, the village of Indian Hill, and the city of Montgomery. On February 17, 1989, appellants filed the within action to delete certain restrictions from the deeds to their Peterloon property in Symmes Township. The children of appellants Melissa and Addison Lanier are the property owners in case No. L.R. 890036 (App. No. C-900146), having acquired their land by gift from their mother, Melissa Lanier, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>who was given the property by her father, John J. Emery. Melissa and Addison Lanier are the owners of the property in case No. L.R. 890037 (App. No. C-900147), by virtue of a gift from John J. Emery. The children of Irene Emery Goodale are the property owners in case No. L.R. 890038 (App. No. C-900148), acquiring their property by gift from their mother, who had been given the property by her father, John J. Emery. The village of Indian Hill corporation line runs along the western boundary of appellants\u2019 Symmes Township property. Appellants also own the Peterloon land in Indian Hill adjacent to their Symmes Township property.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Appellees own Peterloon land in Indian Hill which they acquired by gift from John J. Emery or his daughter, appellee Lela Emery Steele. Appellees\u2019 land does not touch any of appellants\u2019 Symmes Township property.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Appellants\u2019 Symmes Township property is zoned \u201cA\u201d Residence under the Zoning Resolution for the Unincorporated Territory of Hamilton County, which permits single-family residences on minimum 20,000-square-foot (half-acre) lots. Appellants filed this suit in an attempt to delete from their deeds \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which tie the permissible use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>appellants\u2019 Symmes Township property to the more restrictive zoning requirements of the Indian Hill Residence \u201cA\u201d District, which provides for single-family residences on five-acre minimum lots. Appellees opposed the deletion of the restrictions from appellants\u2019 deeds and intervened in the suit in order to enforce the restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The case was submitted to the trial court on stipulated exhibits and the arguments of counsel. The trial court, in holding the restrictions valid, found: (1) the grantor, John J. Emery, intended the restrictions to run with the land; (2) the restrictions were part of a general plan to develop Peterloon in five-acre lots; and (3) the restrictions were intended to benefit all those holding an interest in Peterloon property, and therefore appellees, as intended beneficiaries, had standing to enforce the restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Appellants timely appealed, raising one assignment of error which alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by holding that restrictive language in appellants\u2019 chain of title subjects their real estate in Symmes Township to Village of Indian Hill zoning and that appellees have standing to enforce those restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Appellants argue that the deeds do not support the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the grantor intended (1) that the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions run with the land, (2) that all holders of Peterloon property be benefitted by the restrictions, and (3) that Peterloon was to be developed in five-acre lots as part of a general plan. Appellants point out that the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions do not specifically state that they run with the land and benefit all Peterloon property holders, in contrast to the sanitary-sewer restriction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contained in each deed, which provides that the restriction \u201cis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the benefit of said Grantor, his heirs and assigns,\u201d and that \u201cthese restrictive covenants shall run with the land.\u201d Appellants argue that because the grantor used specific language in the sanitary-sewer restriction to create a covenant running with the land and benefitting all Peterloon property holders, the fact that he did not do so in the \u201czoning\" and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions shows that those restrictions were not intended to run with the land or to benefit any Peterloon property other than the parcels touching appellants\u2019 Symmes Township property.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Following a complete review of the record, we find sufficient competent credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination and, therefore, that determination will not be disturbed on appeal. See <em>Ross v. Ross </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 203, 18 O.O.3d 414, 414 N.E.2d 426; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. We note the fact that every deed subjects the Symmes Township property to Indian Hill zoning is evidence of a general plan of development from which all holders of Peterloon property were intended to benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Appellants next argue that the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions are ambiguous and therefore must be construed in the least restrictive manner. We hold the trial court did not err in finding the deeds to be unambiguous. Even though there are no parcel numbers listed for the Indian Hill reference parcels, the deeds contain enough information to locate the Indian Hill reference parcel to which the restriction on each parcel of Symmes Township property is tied.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Appellants finally argue that the trial court erred in upholding the restrictions because the circumstances of the Peterloon property have changed in that the Symmes Township property is surrounded by single-family residences built on one-half-acre lots. Further, appellants contend, in light of the changed circumstances, there is no evidence that the restrictions are of any value to appellees. We hold the record contains sufficient evidence from which the trial court could have concluded that the development of nonPeterloon property in Symmes Township does not constitute such a change in the circumstances of appellees\u2019 property that the restrictions are no longer of any benefit. The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Gorman, P.J., and Doan, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b729-5\">Utz, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\">. The \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\" restrictions are set forth in nine separate deeds which provide that appellants\u2019 Symmes Township property is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">\n<em>Deed 1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">\u201c * * * subject to zoning restrictions of the Village of Indian Hill, Ohio, which zoning restrictions are applicable to lands of the Grantor lying nearest west to the above described premises in the same manner, and with the same force and effect, as if the above described premises were a part of the Village of Indian Hill, Ohio.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">\n<em>Deed 2</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">\u201c * * * subject to zoning restrictions of the Village of Indian Hill; and that portion of the above premises not in the Village of Indian Hill, Ohio, is subject to the zoning regulations governing the adjacent portion of said premises in said Village in the same manner, and with the same force and effect, as if said portion not in said Village were in the Village of Indian Hill, Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">\n<em>Deeds 3, 4, 8, 9</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-13\"><em>\u201c * * * </em>subject to zoning restrictions of the Village of Indian Hill;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-14\">\"the above described premises will not be conveyed except by operation of law * * * [and] a building permit will not be applied for * * * unless and until the premises * * * comply with the area requirements of the zoning ordinance of the Village of Indian Hill, [Ohio,] which are applicable to the land in said Village contiguous to the above described premises[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-15\">\n<em>Deed 5</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-16\"><em>\u201c * * </em>* subject to zoning restrictions as are or may in the future be applicable to land in the Village of Indian Hill contiguous to a parcel of land of the Grantee herein, which parcel lies immediately west of the above described premises[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-17\">\n<em>Deed 6</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-18\">\u201c * * * subject to zoning restrictions of the Village of Indian Hill; and that portion of the above premises, not in the Village of Indian Hill, Ohio, is subject to the zoning regulations governing the adjacent portion of said premises in said Village in the same manner, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>with the same force and effect, as if said portion not in said Village were in the Village of Indian Hill, Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">\n<em>Deed 7</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-13\"><em>\u201c * * * </em>subject to the zoning restrictions of the Village of Indian Hill, Ohio, which are, or may in the future be, applicable to the land of the Grantor herein in said Village of Indian Hill, which land lies nearest west of the above-described premises[.]\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-14\">.

The \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions are set forth in the deeds separately from the sanitary-sewer restrictions which explicitly express the grantor\u2019s intent that the sanitary-sewer restrictions are to run with the land and to benefit all Peterloon property holders. The \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions are not set forth in such specific language. The inclusion of the explicit language in the sanitary-sewer restrictions and the exclusion of such language in the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions indicate the grantor\u2019s intent that the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions are not to run with the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">In addition, I would hold that the only parcels which the grantor intended to benefit from the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions were the easternmost parcels of Peterloon property in Indian Hill which touch appellants\u2019 Symmes Township property. By tying the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions of each Symmes township parcel to the zoning of an Indian Hill parcel, the grantor intended only to benefit those Indian Hill parcels specifically set forth in the deeds. This was clearly done to protect the easternmost Indian Hill property from neighboring development on one-half acre lots. Because appellants own all of the easternmost Indian Hill property touching the Symmes Township property in question, appellees have no standing to enforce the restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Finally, the character of the property has changed so that the restrictions are no longer of any value. The Symmes Township property is surrounded by single-family residences built on one-half-acre lots. Further, non-Peterloon property in Symmes Township which borders Indian Hill Peterloon property is developed on one-half-acre lots. There is no evidence in the record that the \u201czoning\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d restrictions are of any value to appellees\u2019 property; there being no value, there is no detriment. Therefore, I must conclude the judgment of the trial court should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
