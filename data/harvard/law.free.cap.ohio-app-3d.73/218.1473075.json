The default judgment continued the matter for a determination of damages. Thereafter, the board filed a motion for Civ.R. 60(B) relief from judgment, and the court eventually granted Civ.R. 60(B) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">From that judgment, the plaintiff appeals, claiming favor of R.C. 2505.02 and <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 87-88, 541 N.E.2d 64, 66-67, wherein the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">\u201cR.C. 2505.02 defines three types of final orders: (1) an order affecting a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment; (2) an order affecting a substantial right made in a special proceeding or made upon summary application after judgment; or (3) an order vacating or setting aside a judgment or granting a new trial. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">The genesis of this right of appeal where the work of the trial court is not completed is <em>GTE Automatic Electric v. ARC Industries </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">The unique hitch in this case is that the default judgment, from which relief was granted, was itself not a final, appealable order. <em>Chef Italiano, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Appellee persuasively argues that a default judgment as to only part of the claim is distinguishable from the default judgment reviewed and held reviewable in <em>GTE Automatic, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Appellant, by rejoinder, persuasively argues that if the original default judgment was not a final judgment, Civ.R. 60(B) relief was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">This issue engraves one more chapter onto the continuing saga frustrating Ohio lawyers as to what is, or is not, a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We conclude that because the judgment vacated was itself not a final, appealable order, the judgment vacating the partial, incomplete judgment is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The motion of appellee is sustained, and the cause is dismissed for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\n<em>Motion sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-10\">Smart and Gwin, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
