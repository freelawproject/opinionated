A point was sought to be raised which was not taken below. The Court held (Per Curiam) \u201c that the release was not an admission of liability; that on appeal the court could only examine the action of the court below upon matters actually presented on the <em>trial; </em>and affirmed the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
