That mistake arose from the omission to record or give any. notice of the papers on which Joseph J. Garvey\u2019s claim was based. The payment was made in April, 1878, and no claim was ever made until April, 1884, when the suit of Garvey <em>v. </em>Owens was begun. The alleged deed under which defendant Garvey claims was made December 14, 1869. For fifteen years he made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>no claim whatever on it, and not until nearly seven years from James Garvey\u2019s death, and more than six from the payment of this mortgage, was a claim made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">The defendant insists that he ought to have the benefit of this part of the personal estate of James Garvey, paid by mistake on what the administrator regarded as a just claim on the real estate, and the trial judge sustains this doctrine. On the contrary we submit that the principles clearly apparent from the authorities, demonstrate that, in equity, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief he asked here.

After the making of the bond and mortgage to Dyckman and in 1862 James Garvey conveyed this with other property, to one Morrison for a consideration of $40,000. The deed conveyed the property as subject to several mortgages but. covenanted that it was free and' clear of all taxes, incumbrances, etc., but the payment of none of the mortgages was assumed by Morrison. Thus Morrison\u2019s property was security for James Garvey\u2019s bond for the payment of which he was himself liable to Morrison. .Afterwards and in 1867 Morrison reconveyed this par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ticular piece of property back to James Garvey, and covenanted that it was free from all taxes, incumbrances, etc. Afterwards, and on the 14th of December, 1867, James conveyed the property to John Garvey, without mentioning any mortgage, and the next day John made the agreement with James conveying it back to James in trust to collect the rents and pay himself $3,500, and after paying taxes, repairs and insurance, to convey the property to Joseph J. Garvey on his arriving of age in 1881, and to account to him for the rents and profits. \u201c Property covered by a mortgage is worth less by the amount of the mortgage.\u201d \u201c Where defendant sold premises to plaintiff upon which there was a valid mortgage, of which fact the vendee, the plaintiff, was ignorant, <em>Held </em>the latter could maintain an action for false representations in the sale.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATp\">The question made by appellant on this appeal arises from the following facts. '</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\u25a0 The plaintiff was the administrator of James Garvey, who died intestate. The intestate, at the time of his death, was in actual possession of a house and lot, which was incumbered by a mortgage made by him to secure his bond. He appeared from the record to have title. The administrator paid the bond and a satisfaction of the mortgage was made by the mortgagee. Afterwards the administrator ascertained that James Garvey had conveyed the property to Michael Morrison, subject, as expressed in the conveyance, to certain mortgages, of which the satisfied mortgage was one. Afterwards Morrison reconveyed the premises to James Garvey, the conveyance not alluding to the mortgage. Afterwards, according to the 6th finding, James Garvey conveyed to John Garvey. Then James and John made a sealed contract in which John reconveyed to James and James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>covenanted to convey to the son of John upon the happening of certain events. Neither the last conveyance nor the agreement contained any reference to the mortgage. For the purposes of this appeal it is not necessary to give any further details, excepting that in a suit, to which the plaintiff was not a party, the contract last referred to was enforced so that conveyance was made to John Garvey as the heir of his \"son who had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">On these facts the plaintiff claims that at the time he paid, in satisfaction of the mortgage, he was entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee, as against the land, because he was a surety as to that land, the land having been conveyed by James Garvey subject to the mortgage, and that he having paid the mortgage in ignorance of the unrecorded conveyance to Morrison, his right of subrogation still exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">My opinion is, that the claim cannot be sustained. Conceding that it was apparently the duty of the plaintiff as administrator to pay the bond and mortgage if the intestate had not conveyed the land, yet the reconveyance to the intestate annulled the rights that might have existed in him had he not reconveyed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">A person buying subject to a mortgage buys an equity of redemption, and a purchaser of the equity redemption pays less, by legal intendment, than the value of the property as it would be, if unincumbered by the amount of the incumbrance. The grantee then has value reserved in his hands to be applied to the incumbrance. Cox <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 7 <em>Paige </em>257; Vanderkemp <em>v. </em>Shelton, 11 <em>Ib. </em>34. Such was the state of matters when the conveyance to Morrison was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">If Morrison had conveyed to another than James Garvey, the grantee would have held the land subject to the equitable right to have the land applied to the mortgage, although the conveyance did not convey, in words, subject to the mortgage. Jumel <em>v. </em>Jumel, 7 <em>Paige </em>594. The grantee being James Garvey, the mortgagor, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>became repossessed of the fund or value which his grantor had formerly held and which was primarily to be applied to the mortgage. Moreover, he took a covenant against incumbrances from which the mortgage was not excepted. It was not mentioned in the deed to him as it had been in the deed by him. The reconveyance put him in possession of the indemnity that was provided in the deed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The subsequent conveyances do not disclose any foundations for an equity like that claimed in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Truax and Dugro, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
