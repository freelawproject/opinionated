For the purpose of erecting a church edifice on the Twenty-third street lots a subscription was started. The subscription paper was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">\u201c We, the undersigned, hereby agree to pay on May 1, 1882, or sooner, at our option the sums severally set to our names towards a church edifice fund of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) now being raised by the Stanton Street Baptist Church of New York city, on condition that the aggregate of subscriptions herein found shall not be less than the said amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">\u201cMoneys received will be paid into the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-8\">\u201cLocation of the new building to be Twenty-third street, corner of Lexington avenue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-9\">On April 30, 1882, there was subscribed to this paper $50,145. Among these subscriptions however were one of \u201c Ladies Aid Society, Mrs. H. O.

The plaintiff then moved' for a new trial on the minutes which was denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-5\"><em>Edward 8. Clinch, </em>attorney and of counsel for appellant, on the points decided, argued :\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">The Ladies- Aid Society, the Young Men\u2019s Mission Society and the Youths\u2019 Mission Society were unincorporated bodies formed for the purpose of prosecuting the work of the church in different channels. The Ladies Aid Society has been in existence since prior to 1864, and had a special line of missionary work under its charge. During that time it had collected money for other purposes than for the church building and the amount collected rose largely into the thousands. It was shown that they overpaid their subscription by more than $1,000. The Young Men\u2019s Mission Society had been connected with the church for thirty-five or forty years, had collected large sums of money during those years, and at its twenty-fifth anniversary had collected over $30,000. There is no evidence to show the constituency of the Youths\u2019 Mission Society, but the subscription was made by E. D. Garnsey, Treasurer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">It seems to have been claimed below that <em>bona fide </em>subscriptions could not be made by an. unincorporated body, and upon that ground the motion to dismiss the complaint was made. In other words, that persons cannot associate themselves in unincorporated bodies and create obligations \u2022 binding upon them. The plaintiff insists that, <em>prima facie </em>at least, every member of these unincorporated bodies who were subscribers became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>personally liable for the amount of the.subscription, and that this liability could have been enforced by the plaintiff had the subscriptions not been paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqM\">The Code of Civil Procedure provides for actions by and against such unincorporated associations (\u00a7\u00a7 1919-1924). It provides that an action or special proceeding may be maintained against the president or treasurer of an unincorporated association upon any cause of action for or upon which the plaintiff may maintain such an action .against all the associates by reason of their liability therefor, either jointly or severally, and that any company of persons which has a president or treasurer is deemed an association within the meaning of section 1919. Section 1921 provides that a judgment against the association shall not authorize an execution against the property of the officer against whom it is brought, while section 1922 provides for the commencement of an action against the members of the association, on the return wholly or partly unsatisfied and unexecuted of an execution issued thereupon; and section 1924 provides, that section 1913, which provides for the misnomer or death or non-liability of any person who may be joined as a defendant in such an action, shall be applicable to an action brought as prescribed by section 1922. These provisions of the Code are based upon the laws of 1849, chapter 258, but are more comprehensive than that chapter and more amply protect the rights of creditors against such associations. In the face of these provisions and conditions, it cannot be successfully maintained that these societies and their members could not have been held liable for the amount of their subscriptions had they not been paid. Ebbinghousen <em>v. </em>Worth Club, 4 <em>Abb. </em>N. <em>C. </em>300 and note. Black <em>v. </em>Spaulding, 10 <em>Han, </em>128. Certainly, <em>prima facie </em>that the subscriptions made by these societies were <em>bona fide </em>was established upon the trial of this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">The defendants will probably cite in support of their contention the case of the Presbyterian Church of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Albany <em>v. </em>Cooper, 45 <em>Hun, </em>453. In that case it appears that an attempt was made to raise a fund of $45,000, upon a subscription paper, which provided that the subscriptions were made \u201c upon the express condition and not otherwise, that the sum of $45,000 in the aggregate, shall be subscribed or paid in.\u201d It appeared by the subscription paper that \u201c The Ladies Association of the First Presbyterian Church\u201d had subscribed $5,000. The \u201c Ladies Association \u201d was an unincorporated body, and it does not appear when it was formed. At a meeting of the ladies, one of their number presiding, a resolution was adopted pledging themselves to raise $5,000, the payment to be according to the terms of the subscription paper. By its opinion, the general term seems to have been led to its conclusion by this fact, for it says: \u201cThe subscription of $5,000, by the \u2018 Ladies Association \u2019 clearly was not legally binding upon the twenty-five or thirty ladies who assembled and passed a resolution to raise the money, but did not pass it to make the subscription......The entire transaction was simply a testimonial of their good will or of their willingness to try to raise the sum named.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">The \u201c Ladies Aid Society \u201d connected with the plaintiff church had been in existence about twenty years and had] collected many thousand dollars, and was a recognized agent of the church in the special lines of work which were committed to it and as such society it made a subscription and not a mere agreement to raise money, so that the case at bar is clearly distinguished from the case of the Presbyterian Church <em>v. </em>Cooper. In that case, it also appeared that a subscription was made in the name of the \u201c young men of the church,\u201d who, at a meeting, passed a resolution pledging themselves to raise \u201c by entertainment or otherwise $1,500 towards the paying of the $45,000 mortgage upon the church, and that the chairman be requested to sign and forward the resolution to the treasurer of the board of trustees; \u201d and that this was, done, but the subscription paper was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>not signed, so that, in respect to this amount, there was no valid subscription. The resolution passed by the \u201c young men of the church \u201d differs essentially from the subscription made by the \u201c Young Men\u2019s Mission Society,\u201d which has been connected with the plaintiff for thirty-five or forty years, and was also a recognized agent of the church for the collection of moneys.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-4\"><em>Van Winkle, Candler and Jay, </em>attorneys, and <em>Flamen B. Candler </em>of counsel, for respondents, on the points decided, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">I. Where a subscription is made upon condition that-a certain sum shall be subscribed within a specified time, all the subscribers must be equally liable in order to make legally binding any of the subscriptions. And the condition is not fulfilled unless the subsequent subscriptions are legally binding and made by solvent and responsible persons upon no other conditions than those limiting the liability of the first subscriber.

Subscriptions to a church edifice fund on a subscription paper similar to the one in this action, made by unincorporated bodies or associations such as the \u201cLadies Association\u201d and the like, are not binding in law; and when it is necessary to include the amount of such invalid subscriptions in order to make up the amount required, as the condition precedent to the subscribers\u2019 liability, none of the subscribers to the paper are' bound. Presbyterian Ch. v. Cooper, 45 <em>Hun, </em>453, 456. Even though the \u201cLadies\u2019 Association\u201d above referred to or any similar association which had been duly incorporated were by its president or other officer to sign a subscription paper in the corporate name, the act would not be binding upon the corporation as a corporate act.

Garnsey, Treasurer, $25,\u201d and. \u201c Mrs. McDonald and class, $500,\u201d were all, and each of them invalid, because none of those associations had any' corporate existence, and no one was bound by the action of its officers in signing the subscription paper, and none of such subscriptions are of the kind contemplated by the law.

These subscriptions above quoted were invalid at the time they were made. This invalidity could only be cured by the payment of the money under them before May 1, 1882. Any payment subsequent to that date would be ineffectual, and it appears by the evidence that all payments upon every one of them were made subsequently to May 1,1882.
