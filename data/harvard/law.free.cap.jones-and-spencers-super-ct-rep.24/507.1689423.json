In fact, there are but two exceptions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the case ; one on the admission of testimony; the other on the refusal to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The first exception was not referred to by the appellant on the argument. It was not well taken because the testimony that the question brought forth tended to show in a proper way the defendant\u2019s negligence. Nor was it error to refuse to dismiss the complaint. There was evidence that would warrant the jury in finding that the plaintiff was injured without negligence on her part through the negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">While the damages seem to. be quite large we cannot say that they are so large that the jury must have been influenced by prejudice or passion in awarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Dugro, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
