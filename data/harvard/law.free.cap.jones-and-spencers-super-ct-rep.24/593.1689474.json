Y. </em>648, whether a distinction between an action in equity and one at law should be maintained ; and that in view of the circumstances and the great importance of the question, it was in the interest of all parties to affirm the order so that the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>involved might be squarely presented to the court of appeals, and put at rest by that court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The order was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Sedgwick, Ch.
