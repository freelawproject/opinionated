The facts averred in the proposed supplemental answer must be pleaded, and cannot be proven under the general issue. Hendricks <em>v. </em>Decker, 35 <em>Barb. </em>299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-11\">II. The code expressly provides that by supplemental answer may be set up :\u2014 \u201c the judgment or decree of\" a competent court rendered after the commencement of the action determining the matters in controversy, or a part thereof.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 544.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-12\">III. The court will not deny a motion to file a supplemental answer, upon the ground that the facts sought to be set forth therein do not constitute a defence to the action unless they are clearly frivolous. Mitchell <em>v. </em>Allen, 25 <em>Hun </em>543.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-13\">IV. The rule of decision, and the discretion to be applied upon such a motion are definitely settled in Holyoke <em>v. </em>Adams, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>234. And the court distinguish Medbury <em>v. </em>Swan, 46 <em>N.

Leave to serve a supplemental answer is only to be granted in a \u201cproper case.\u201d Code, \u00a7 544; Fleischman <em>v. </em>Bennett, 79 <em>N. Y. </em>579. It will not be granted if it is clear that the new matter sought to be alleged does not constitute a defence, Jagger <em>v. </em>Littlefield, 3 <em>Week. Big. </em>316 ; Ratzer <em>v. </em>Ratzer, 2 <em>Abb. JJ. C. </em>461.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>II. In the present case the defendant asked leave to allege by supplemental answer the decree of a court of admiralty which did not determine the matter in controversy in this action, or any part thereof, but merely determined that the plaintiff here had no lien upon the yacht for the work done and materials furnished. The admiralty decree expressly declares that the libel is dismissed on the ground of no lien. The opinion also shows that such was the only ground of decision; and it may be examined for that purpose. Birckhead <em>v. </em>Brown, 5 <em>Sand. </em>134. No personal decree against the owner could be entered in the admiralty suit <em>in rem, </em>if no lien existed. The Monte A., 12 <em>Fed,. Rep. </em>331.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-5\">III. The suit in admiralty was analogous to a proceeding to enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien, in which, prior to the act of 1885, no personal judgment could be obtained unless a lien was established. Meyer v. Beach, 79 <em>N. Y. </em>409. But it would never be pretended that a mechanic who failed to establish a lien, would, by an adverse judgment on that ground in a foreclosure proceeding, be estopped to recover his .debt in another action <em>in personam </em>upon his contract. Randolph <em>v. </em>Leary, 4 <em>Abb. </em>205, 206 ; Grant <em>v. </em>Vandercook, 57 <em>Barb. </em>165.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b491-6\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch., J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8q\">The action was for work and materials furnished to defendant for a certain yacht. The defendant answered. Afterwards he made the motion below which was to allow him to serve a supplemental answer alleging that, since the former answer, judgment had been entered in favor of defendant, in a suit in the U. S. District Court, in which the plaintiff was the present plaintiff, and alleging that the suit in the District Court was brought upon the same grounds and for the same relief as claimed in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">On the motion it indubitably appeared that the suit in the District Court, was terminated in favor of this defendant without any adjudication of whether or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the plaintiff had a claim for work and materials, and that the proceeding being <em>in </em>rein, the actual adjudication was, that if the plaintiff had a personal claim he had no lien upon the vessel, and this led to a dismissal of the libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">I am of opinion, that it so certainly appeared, that the answer proposed could not sustain the defence by way of bar upon the fact, that the judge was right in not allowing an unsubstantial defence, but I also take into consideration that the defendant will have a right upon the trial to present the same record, as evidence of the facts in issue, and with conclusive effect, if the appellant should be right in his present assertion as to the effect of the record in the District Court. Marston <em>v. </em>Swett, 66 N. <em>Y. </em>206; Krekeler <em>v. </em>Ritter, 62 <em>Ib. </em>372.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The order should be affirmed with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Truax and Dugro, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
