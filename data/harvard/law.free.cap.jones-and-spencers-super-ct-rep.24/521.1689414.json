CUMMINGS, Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b545-8\">\n<em>Certificate of the trial justice that the title to real estate came in question cm the trial.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b545-10\">It was conclusive upon the taxing officer in entering the judgment so as to include costs. Such a certificate is not such an intermediate order that can be brought up for review by an appeal from a' final judgment. There can be no available exception made to such a certificate, consequently, in the case at bar, there is no ground for the reversal or modification of the judgment based upon the certificate having been improperly granted. The relief in such case is by a motion to set it aside. In the case at bar there was no order formally made or entered, granting the motion for the certificate, and, as the case stands the defendant\u2019s remedy, if aggrieved, is by motion and by appeal.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b545-11\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.

To my mind, therefore, no ground for the reversal or modification of the judgment has been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">If the certificate was improperly granted, it may be set aside on a motion made for that purpose. Barney v. Keith, 6 <em>Wend. </em>555.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">It seems that no order granting the motion for a certificate was formally made or entered, and so, as the matter stands, the defendant\u2019s remedy, if aggrieved, is by motion and not by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
