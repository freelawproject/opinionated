There is not a single exception in the case to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to any question asked of any witness; and there is not an exception to the charge of the learned judge, and no \u2022requests to charge were submitted by defendant, and no motion was made to dismiss. The appeal taken in this action is from the judgment only. No order denying motion for a new trial was made or entered by the defendant, and no appeal is taken from any such order, and there being no questions of law or exceptions, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>is nothing for this court to review. Where the judgment was rendered upon the verdict of a jury an appeal may be taken upon questions of law, but the appeal brings up questions of law only, and no questions of fact can be considered.
