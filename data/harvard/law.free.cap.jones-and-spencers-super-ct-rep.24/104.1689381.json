The judgment in this case rendered was more favorable to the plaintiffs than that demanded in the complaint. Under \u00a7 1207 Code Civil Procedure this is prohibited Some of the defendants, more particularly Mrs. Chapman, are entitled to come in and set aside the judgment, and they are not confined to moving within the year., Simonson <em>v. </em>Blake, 20 <em>How. </em>484; Andrews <em>v. </em>Moinlaus, 8 <em>Hun </em>65; Willis <em>v. </em>Fairchild, 51 <em>Super. Ct. </em>405. The case of Peck <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; N. J. Railway, is not an authority against Mr. Foley, purchaser. In that case, Levy, the petitioner, was a bondholder, and the foreclosure Avas made by his trustee, for his benefit. He could not demand as a right to have the judgment vacated. The complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>was not before the court, and the court assumed that it was all right. The Peck foreclosure was all right and under that foreclosure, a good title was made and Demurest mortgage rights extinguished. Here as purchasers, we are directly interested. The judgment under which we are to take title, is a matter of record, must be examined by us, and we are directly chargeable with notice of its contents. The rule has been repeatedly declared that \u201cthe purchaser will not be compelled to accept a doubtful title, nor one where he can only acquire possession by litigation and judicial decision.\u201d Jordan <em>v. </em>Poillon, 77 <em>N. Y. </em>518; Shriver <em>v. </em>Shriver, 36 <em>Ib. </em>575 and 584. The court of appeals merely decided that they had no jurisdiction of that case. The remarks of the court, having no jurisdiction, do not approve the course of the courts below; they say, p. 251: \u201cIt may have been improper.\u201d On page 253 : \u201c The discretion may not have been wisely exercised, and injustice may have been done,\u201d and they refer pointedly to \u201cthe petition of one situated like Levy.\u201d In this case the parties ask relief against the purchaser. He, the purchaser, is rightfully here, and entitled to be heard. He is not an outsider. The complaint is here. It alleges only $2,500 and interest due and no more was due upon the mortgage, but upon some outside matters not alleged in the complaint, not a part of the mortgage, without bringing in the parties, or affording an opportunity of being heard, they take a judgment in direct violation of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-5\"><em>Leavitt &amp; Keith, </em>attorneys, and <em>John Brooks Leavitt </em>of counsel, for respondent, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">I. The order was right. Peck <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; N. J. Ry. Co., 85 <em>N. Y., </em>246; DeForest <em>v. </em>Farley, 61 <em>Ib., </em>628 ; Blakely <em>v. </em>Calder, 15 <em>Ib., </em>617; <em>Thomas on Mortgages, </em>\u00a7 1005.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\">II. If the court will permit a stranger to the record to impeach collaterally, not its j urisdiction to render its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>decree of sale, but the correctness of its decision as to the amount to be paid to the plaintiffs out of the proceeds, it will then be time enough to discuss the question argued by the appellant, whether the court was in error in following the usual custom of allowing a second mortgagee to tack on to his security interest on a first mortgage paid by him. It does not concern Mr. Foley. He need not trouble himself about it. Nor can he be allowed to do so. Peck <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; N. J. Ry. Co., and others cases, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-5\">III. Section 1207 of the Code cannot be invoked by a stranger to the action to support a claim that a judgment is without jurisdiction. See Opinion of Earl, J., in the Peck case, at page 250. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-6\">IY. Section 1207 was not violated. The judgment granted was not more favorable than the judgment demanded. See Peck case, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">Y. Even if the court were wrong in determining the amount due, it was at most an irregularity, which can at any time, on the application of the right party, be corrected, without setting the sale aside. See Peck case, at page 251.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-8\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASd\">The action was in foreclosure of mortgage upon real estate. The judgment was taken by default against all of the defendants. It appears from the record, that the referee reported that the plaintiff had paid $507.50 as interest upon mortgages prior to the mortgage in action, and that the plaintiff was entitled to payment of the amount out of' the proceeds of sale. This conclusion of the referee was made part of the judgment. The complaint had not alluded to this claim of the plaintiff or made any demand for relief in regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The purchaser objected below, that he should not be compelled to take title because the defaulting parties could successfully object to the judgment so far as it gave plaintiff judgment for anything not demanded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the complaint, and those parties would after the purchaser had taken title have the right to have the judgment and sale under it, set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In my opinion the rights of the defaulting defendants would be to have the judgment set aside so far only as it was defective in giving judgment for the amount of interest paid upon the prior mortgages, if they had such right, which it is not necessary to determine. This would not involve setting aside the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The order is affirmed with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
