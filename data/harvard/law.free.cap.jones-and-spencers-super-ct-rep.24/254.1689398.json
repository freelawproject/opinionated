Walker Otis, </em>attorney and of counsel for appellant, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">I. The interrogatories which were stricken out were all material, and should have been allowed. (1.) Infancy in no way avoids the defence. 2 Kent, 240 ; Holmes <em>v. </em>Blogg, 8 <em>Taunton, </em>508; Medbury <em>v. </em>Watrous, 7 <em>Hill, </em>111; Bartholomew <em>v. </em>Finnemore, 17 <em>Barb. </em>428; Green <em>v. </em>Green, 69 <em>N. Y. </em>533 ; Crummey <em>v. </em>Mills, 40 <em>Hun, </em>370; Gray <em>v. </em>Lessington, 2 <em>Bos. </em>263 ; Hangen <em>v. </em>Hachmeister, 49 N. <em>Y. Super. Ct. </em>24. (2.) Plaintiff\u2019s offer to stipulate that the banking business obtained by plaintiff in Iroquois was of the value of $1,000, did not warrant the striking out of the interrogatories. Such a stipulation is of no value to defendant. As plaintiff was to put $10,000 in the bank, the \u201cbusiness\u201d was doubtless worth that sum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\">H. Even if there were doubt as to the materiality of the interrogatories, it was error for the court below to strike them out on settlement. The question should have been reserved for the trial judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-9\">The code provides that upon the settlement of the interrogatories \u201c either party must be allowed to insert therein any question pertinent to the issue which he proposes\u201d (sec. 892) and that when the depositions taken are read at the trial \u201can objection to the competency or credibility of the witness or to the relevancy or substantial competency of a question put to him\u201d.....\u201cmay be made as if the witness was then personally examined and without being noted upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>deposition \u201d (sec. 911). The judge on settlement cannot foresee what the exigencies of the trial may be, and questions which may from his standpoint seem immaterial, may become of the greatest importance when the actual trial occurs. When the question in good faith presented is whether a certain question is relevant, material or competent, the better practice is to settle the interrogatories subject to objections at the trial. Under such a practice, the questions will be passed upon by the judge who has the best opportunity for doing so, and no injustice will be done either party, for the reason that all the rulings can be reviewed on appeal from the judgment, whereas if an error be made by the judge, on settlement by disallowing an interrogatory, the aggrieved party is remediless if the cause shall come on for trial before an appeal from the order striking out the interrogatory can be heard, unless he can procure a stay of the trial pending such appeal. In a case where an appeal from an erroneous ruling on settlement of interrogatories was carried to the court of appeals, that court say that conceding the right of the judge to do so, \u201cthe power to exclude questions should be sparingly exercised.\u201d Uline <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 79 N. <em>Y. </em>175.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-5\"><em>Francis Speir, Jr., </em>attorney and of counsel, and <em>John H. Kitchen, </em>of counsel, for respondent, argued :\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A52\">I. Admitting for the sake of argument the facts set up in the answer it cannot be shown that the value of the business of the bank during the year 1885, or its prospective value, or the amount of capital contributed by the plaintiff, or what his salary was, or the plaintiff\u2019s interest, the names of its present officers, its original incorporators, or dividends paid, or its undivided profits, or its surplus, or finally that the plaintiff was dissatisfied with Irbquois, Dakota, as a place of residence and why, are material in any conceivable case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the issues raised by the pleading in this case especially in view of the stipulation tendered in open court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">II. It is undoubtedly a rule of law that an infant cannot be permitted to retain property purchased by him, and at the same time repudiate the contract by which he received it. But taking the strongest view of the case in the defendant\u2019s favor, it will be seen by the answer that he never had any interest in the Iroquois Bank, and it would be unjust to the officers and stockholders of said bank, and to this plaintiff, to force them to give a full history of the bank from its incorporation to the present time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">III. An infant has the right to repudiate a contract like the alleged contract set forth in the answer. No property was taken from the defendant and he has retained one thousand dol\u00eda,rs of the infant\u2019s property, which he admits was deposited with him as trustee for a specific purpose. His own statement is that he parted with nothing that did not belong to the infant. How then can it be material to investigate the interest of the plaintiff in this bank, in which the defendant never had an interest. The only question in this case is, did the plaintiff agree to pay the defendant one thousand dollars or did the defendant violate his trust and con- \u2022 vert the one thousand :dollars to his own use. The question as to the value of the interest of the plaintiff in the Dakota Bank, is not material, <em>non constat, </em>the history of the bank since its foundation or its officers and business condition. Besides and beyond all this, plaintiff tendered a stipulation to defendant, stating that the business was worth $1,000, but objected to the evidence of this as immaterial to the issues in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-7\">IV. This order is not appealable and could only be reviewed on appeal from the judgment entered after trial. To allow an appeal at this time from those interrogatories which are disallowed would be having this court possibly pass twice upon the same question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Uline <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 79 N. <em>Y. </em>179; MacDonald <em>v. </em>Garrison, 9 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>178.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b283-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A8u\">The disallowance was made upon the settlement of the interrogatories and an order disallowing the interrogatories was entered. Uline <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 79 N. <em>Y </em>179, determines that such an order can be reviewed upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The order did not disallow the interrogatories absolutely, as not pertinent to the issue. They appear to be pertinent to the issue. They were disallowed on the condition which was complied with, that plaintiff should file a stipulation \u201c that the banking business obtained by the plaintiff in Iroquois, Dakota, was of the value of $1,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">It does not with certainty and beyond doubt appear, that this admission would avail to support the answer as much, as would answers to the interrogatories, if they should be favorable to defendant. Assuming, but not deciding, that the defendant might be forced to take an admission of a fact instead of evidence of the fact, there should be no manner of doubt that the admission would benefit the defendant to the same extent that the evidence would.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">On the issues as made, the fact that the business was worth only $1,000, would not be as important to defendant as proof that it was worth $10,000 or more than $1,000. There might be at least, under the evidence, circumstances which could be considered by a jury, as to the probability that the plaintiff made the arrangement pleaded in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">On the settlement of interrogatories the sufficiency of the answer, as a defence, should not be considered. The pertinency of the proposed interrogatories to the issue as made, is alone to be determined. In the present case, the proposed admission did not embrace profits from the business acquired by the plaintiff. Answer to the interrogatories might have disclosed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>plaintiff did receive profits, and the answer set up as a defense the receipt of such profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The order should be reversed with $10 costs and the interrogatories excluded should be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
