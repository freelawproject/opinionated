CLEMENT, JR., J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3r\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<judges id=\"Aa9\">in which ANDY D. BENNETT and RICHARD H. DINKINS, JJ, joined.</judges>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Plaintiff filed this action to recover more than $279,000 that his nephew allegedly converted while acting as his attorney-in-fact. Plaintiff alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Defendant, his attorney-in-fact, breached his fiduciary duties by transferring Plaintiffs life-savings into Defendant\u2019s personal bank accounts. The trial court granted summary judgment for Plaintiff finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, that Defendant admitted a confidential relationship with Plaintiff, and that the depletion of Plaintiffs life-savings was unfair as a matter of law. On appeal, Defendant argues that genuine issues of material fact exist, that the claim for conversion is barred by the statute of limitations, and that the trial court failed to join an indispensable party under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 19. With the exception of the first three transfers which occurred more than three years prior to the filing of this action, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and the grant of summary judgment for Plaintiff finding that there are no genuine issues of material fact, and that Plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Defendant breached his fiduciary duty as attorney-in-fact when he converted the funds from his uncle\u2019s savings account for his own use and benefit. As for the first three transfers, each of which occurred more than three years prior to the filing of this action, we have determined there is a dispute of fact concerning whether Plaintiff could have discovered the conversion of those funds upon reasonable inquiry; therefore, summary judgment was not appropriate as to Plaintiffs claim to recover those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Thomas R. Ralston (Plaintiff), now 85 years old, was one of five children who grew up on the family farm near Eagle-ville, Tennessee. Their mother died when Plaintiff was only 9 years old. Following her death, their father raised Plaintiff, his brothers John, Andrew and David, and sister, Myrtle, on the family farm. John Ralston moved away from the farm at the age of 17. When Myrtle married, she too moved away. Plaintiff and his brothers Andrew and David Ralston remained on the family farm where they have lived or worked their entire lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">Their father, the patriarch of the family, died intestate in 1966, at which time his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>five children each inherited a share of their father\u2019s estate, including the family farm. After their father\u2019s death in 1966, Andrew and David Ralston managed the family farm while Plaintiff assisted them working primarily as a laborer. Following the untimely death of her husband, Myrtle returned to the family farm with her two-year-old child, Fred Hobbs. For the next 35 years, Myrtle maintained the family home and cooked for her brothers Tom, Andrew and David. Myrtle\u2019s son, Fred Hobbs, was raised by his mother on the family farm. John Ralston, who had moved away before his father\u2019s death and was estranged from some of the family for decades, did not return until 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In June 2000, David Ralston, Andrew Ralston, and Myrtle Hobbs had powers of attorneys prepared by Attorney Wendell Rowland. One month later, on July 13, 2000, Fred Hobbs (hereinafter \u201cDefendant\u201d) drove Plaintiff to Attorney Rowland\u2019s office to execute a will for Plaintiff. While there, Rowland prepared a power of attorney at Plaintiffs request designating Defendant as Plaintiffs attorney-in-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Within days after Plaintiff executed the power of attorney, Defendant used the power of attorney to add himself to Plaintiffs savings and checking accounts so that he would have signatory privileges. Defendant stated that he did this for \u201cconvenience,\u201d so that he could pay Plaintiffs bills without having to use the power of attorney each time he did so. The mailing address for Plaintiffs bank accounts was not changed when Defendant was added to the bank accounts and for two and one-half years thereafter the bank statements continued to be mailed to Plaintiff at his home address.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">As of January 22, 2003, Plaintiff had $303,541.00 in his savings account. Shortly after January 22, 2003, Defendant changed the mailing address on Plaintiffs bank accounts so the bank statements would no longer go to Plaintiffs address; instead, Defendant directed that the bank statements be mailed to Defendant\u2019s post office box. During the 26 months that followed, Defendant withdrew in excess of $279,000 from Plaintiffs savings account, all of which he deposited into three bank accounts, none of which Plaintiff had an interest in. As a consequence of Defendant\u2019s actions, Plaintiffs savings of $303,541.00 was reduced to $18,742.56 as of April 21, 2005. By October 17, 2005, only $10,109.04 remained. Following the payment of $8,500 for the purpose of prepaying Plaintiffs funeral expenses, only $1,599.46 remained of Plaintiffs life savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Defendant could only account for the prepaid funeral expense of $8,500, and he admitted that he could not account for $279,000 of the funds taken from Plaintiffs savings account. Defendant admitted that he made no sizable purchases for Plaintiffs benefit while acting as his attorney-in-fact, and that Plaintiff had no history of making gifts. Defendant also admitted that he used Plaintiffs checking account, into which Plaintiffs social security benefits were deposited, to pay Plaintiffs monthly expenses during the period at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Because Defendant changed the mailing address so that Plaintiff would no longer receive the bank statements, Plaintiff was unaware of the periodic withdrawals from his bank account. In the Spring of 2004, Plaintiff went to the bank to inquire why he was not receiving his bank statements. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>He was informed by a bank employee the statements were being mailed as directed to the post office box. The bank employee also told Plaintiff that the bank would send him the bank statements. Plaintiff, however, states he did not receive them. In the Summer of 2004, Plaintiff again went to the bank to inquire why he was not receiving his bank statements, and he was again informed that the statements were being mailed to the post office box. Following this visit, the bank mailed to Plaintiff copies of statements from February 2000 to the present. It was after receiving the bank statements Plaintiff realized that essentially all of his savings had been withdrawn from his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">On February 23, 2006, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant alleging in pertinent part that the Durable General Power of Attorney was invalid because it was secured by Defendant\u2019s coercion or fraudulent means; that Defendant was in a confidential and fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff; and that Defendant breached his duty as a fiduciary when he dealt in bad faith and self-dealing to the loss and detriment of Plaintiff. An answer was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Following substantial discovery, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. Defendant filed a response to the summary judgment motion and a Motion to Dismiss. In his Motion to Dismiss, Defendant claimed that Plaintiff had failed to join an indispensable party, Myrtle Hobbs, as required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 19, that Plaintiff failed to plead fraud with particularity, that the statute of limitations on the conversion claims had expired, and that Plaintiff was not the real party in interest because he was mentally incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Following a hearing, the trial court granted Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The trial court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVLf\">there were no genuine issues of disputed material fact concerning plaintiffs claims against defendant, and plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Defendant admits that he had a confidential relationship with defendant. A presumption of undue influence applies to defendant\u2019s transactions regarding plaintiffs bank accounts and the funds in those accounts. Through a series of bank transactions from 2003-2005, defendant depleted plaintiff of substantially all of his life savings, leaving plaintiff with no other significant savings or assets. Defendant\u2019s depletion of plaintiffs funds during plaintiffs lifetime cannot have been fair to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The court went on to award Plaintiff a judgment in the amount of $279,500, plus pre-judgment interest of $136,084, for a total judgment of $415,584. It is from this judgment that Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Defendant raises several issues on appeal, which challenge the propriety of the grant of summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff and the denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The various issues are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">\n<em>Real Party In Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Defendant contends that Plaintiff is not the real party in interest, as is required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 17, because he lacks the mental capacity to commence or maintain this action. We find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">A person is presumed to be competent; thus, Plaintiff is presumed to be competent, <em>see Rawlings v. The John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>78 S.W.3d 291, 297 (Tenn.Ct.App.2001), and the party asserting another\u2019s lack of mental capacity bears the burden of proof, and that proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>must be clear, cogent, and convincing. <em>Dickson v. Long, </em>No. M2008-00279-COA-R3-CV, 2009 WL 961784, at *3 (Tenn.Ct. App. April 8, 2009) (citing <em>Waller v. Evans, </em>No. M2008-00312-COA-R3-CV, 2009 WL 723519, at *3 (Tenn.Ct.App. Mar.17, 2009); <em>Estate of Dooley v. Hickman, </em>No. E2005-02322-COA-R3-CV, 2006 WL 2482967, at *6 (Tenn.Ct.App. Aug.29, 2006); <em>Knight v. Lancaster, </em>988 S.W.2d 172, 177-78 (Tenn.Ct.App.1998)). Moreover, the mere suggestion that a person is advanced in age, forgetful or has senile dementia is insufficient to prove a lack of mental capacity. <em>Rawlings, </em>78 S.W.3d at 297. As this court stated in <em>Rawlings:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">It is not enough to prove that a person was depressed or had senile dementia. To prove mental incapacity, the person with the burden of proof must establish, in light of all the surrounding facts and circumstances, that the cognitive impairment or disease rendered the contracting party incompetent to engage in the transaction at issue according to the standards set forth above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Butler v. Harrison, </em>578 A.2d 1098, 1101 (D.C.1990); <em>Weakley v. Weakley, </em>355 Mo. 882, 198 S.W.2d 699, 702-03 (Mo.1947)) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The issue of Plaintiffs incompetence was raised in Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss; however, Defendant presented no competent evidence to support this assertion. There are no medical records or expert medical testimony indicating that Plaintiff is mentally incapacitated. To the contrary, in the months prior to Defendant asserting Plaintiffs incompetence, he acknowledged that Plaintiff was in fact competent. An Agreed Order dated April 6, 2006, stated that in the event Plaintiff <em>\u201cbecomes </em>incapacitated, .either party may exercise any health care power of attorney to obtain medical attention.\u201d (Emphasis added). Additionally, in his Answers to Plaintiffs First Set of Requests to Produce, Defendant responded to a request for the health care records of Plaintiff by stating \u201c[Plaintiff], as a <em>competent </em>individual has access to his medical records.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">We have determined, as the trial court did, that Defendant failed to carry his burden of proof to establish that Plaintiff lacks the mental capacity to commence or maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\n<em>Failure to Join an Indispensable Party</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhU4\">Defendant contends that his mother, Myrtle Hobbs, is an indispensable party to this action. His contention is based on the fact that some of the funds Defendant withdrew from Plaintiffs savings accounts were deposited by Defendant into an account jointly owned by Mrs. Hobbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 19.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party if (1) in the person\u2019s absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person\u2019s absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person\u2019s ability to protect that interest, or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reasons of the claimed interest. If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person properly should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he or she may be made a defendant, or in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">Tenn. R. Civ. P. 19.01 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Defendant has failed to establish any of the requisite criteria in Rule 19.01 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to show that his mother is an indispensable pai'ty. To the contrary, the simple fact is that Plaintiff may obtain complete relief against Defendant without making Mrs. Hobbs a party. The mere fact that her name appears on one of the accounts to which Defendant transferred Plaintiffs funds is of no consequence. Plaintiff elected to bring this action solely against Defendant on the basis that Defendant violated his fiduciary duty by transferring Plaintiffs funds to Defendant\u2019s accounts, and there is no claim or assertion that Mrs. Hobbs played any role in Defendant\u2019s decision to withdraw or transfer Plaintiffs funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">This court has previously stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWF\">[o]nly a party who will be directly affected by a decree and whose interest is not represented by any other party to the litigation is an indispensable or necessary party, that is, one without which no valid decree may be entered settling the rights between the parties that are before the [e]ourt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><em>Moore v. Teddleton, </em>No. W2005-02746-COA-R3-CV, 2006 WL 3199273, at *6 (Tenn.Ct.App. Nov.7, 2006) (quoting <em>Brewer v. Lawson, </em>569 S.W.2d 856, 858 (Tenn.Ct.App.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Mrs. Hobbs will not be directly affected by any decree that may be rendered in this action. Accordingly, we find that Mrs. Hobbs is not an indispensable party and that the motion to dismiss for failure to name an indispensable party was properly denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Fiduciary Duty AS AN ATTORNEY-IN-FACT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">It is undisputed that Defendant was the attorney-in-fact for Plaintiff at all times material to this action. The execution and exercise of a power of attorney establishes a fiduciary relationship between the attorney-in-fact and the grantor of the power. <em>Martin v. Moore, </em>109 S.W.3d 305, 309 (Tenn.Ct.App.2003) (citing <em>Matlock v. Simpson, </em>902 S.W.2d 384 (Tenn.1995); <em>Mitchell v. Smith, </em>779 S.W.2d 384 (Tenn.Ct.App.1989); <em>Askew v. Askew, </em>619 S.W.2d 384 (Tenn.Ct.App.1981); <em>Black v. Pettigrew, </em>38 Tenn.App. 1, 270 S.W.2d 196 (1953)). The fiduciary is obligated to deal with the property of his principal in \u201cthe utmost good faith.\u201d <em>Id. (citing Estate of Doyle v. Hunt, </em>60 S.W.3d 838 (Tenn.Ct.App.2001); <em>Alexander v. Inman, </em>974 S.W.2d 689 (Tenn.1998); <em>McFarlin v. McFarlin, </em>785 S.W.2d 367 (Tenn.Ct.App.1989)). The duties of loyalty and honesty are also a part of a fiduciary\u2019s obligation. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Roberts v. Iddins, </em>797 S.W.2d 615 (Tenn.Ct.App.1990); <em>Knox-Tenn Rental Co. v. Jenkins Ins., Inc., </em>755 S.W.2d 33 (Tenn.1988)). Therefore, Defendant was under a fiduciary duty to take all actions on Plaintiffs behalf in the \u201cutmost good faith, loyalty, and honesty.\u201d <em>See Roberts, </em>797 S.W.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">\n<em>Conversion and When it Occurs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Conversion is the appropriation of another\u2019s property to one\u2019s own use and benefit, by the exercise of dominion over the property, in defiance of the owner\u2019s right to the property. <em>Hanna v. Sheflin, </em>275 S.W.3d 423, 427 (Tenn.Ct.App.2008); <em>Brandt v. BIB Enters., Ltd., </em>986 S.W.2d 586, 595 (Tenn.Ct.App.1998); <em>Mammoth Cave Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n v. Oldham, </em>569 S.W.2d 833, 836 (Tenn.Ct.App.1977); <em>Barger v. Webb, </em>216 Tenn. 275, 391 S.W.2d 664, 665 (1965). A cause of action for conversion occurs when the alleged wrongdoer exercises dominion over the funds in <em>\u201cdefiance of the owner\u2019s rights.\u201d Hanna, </em>275 S.W.3d at 427 (citing <em>Mammoth Cave, </em>569 S.W.2d at 836) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Using his power of attorney, Defendant added himself to Plaintiffs checking and savings accounts. This was done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>with Plaintiffs knowledge and consent as a matter of \u201cconvenience\u201d to enable Defendant to act for the benefit of Plaintiff as and when he needed funds to pay Plaintiffs bills. Therefore, Defendant did not exercise dominion over the funds in <em>defiance </em>of Plaintiffs rights when he added his name to Plaintiffs savings account. Because Defendant did not exercise dominion over the funds in defiance of Plaintiffs rights when he added his name to the accounts, Defendant did not convert Plaintiffs savings at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Thereafter, on or about January 22, 2003, Defendant changed the mailing address so that all future bank statements would be sent to Defendant\u2019s post office box. This act, without more, did not constitute a conversion of the funds because the mere fact the bank statements were to be mailed to Defendant, who continued to serve as a fiduciary for Plaintiff, did not constitute an act of defiance to the rights of Plaintiff. Moreover, the funds remained in Plaintiffs savings account. Accordingly, Defendant did not convert the funds in Plaintiffs savings account by the mere act of changing the mailing address on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Beginning on February 10, 2003, and during the next twenty-six months, Defendant transferred almost all of Plaintiffs life savings to Defendant\u2019s personal accounts. It is undisputed that Defendant withdrew in excess of $279,000 from Plaintiffs savings account and transferred the funds to two accounts solely owned by Defendant and to one account jointly owned by Defendant and his mother. Although Defendant did not exercise dominion over the funds in defiance of Plaintiffs rights prior to each transfer of funds to his own accounts, as time went by, Defendant exercised dominion over the transferred funds in defiance of Plaintiffs rights. The numerous and repeated acts of defiance occurred either at the time of transfer or at some point in time after each transfer of funds to Defendant\u2019s personal accounts. Whether Defendant \u201cconverted\u201d the funds at the time of transfer or at some time after each transfer depends on when Defendant exercised dominion over the funds \u201cin defiance of Plaintiffs rights.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Accordingly, we have determined, as a matter of law, that the conversion of Plaintiffs savings did not occur prior to the respective transfers of Plaintiffs funds to Defendant\u2019s personal accounts. Therefore, whether conversion occurred at the time of each transfer or at a point in time thereafter is dependent on when Defendant exercised dominion over the funds in defiance of Plaintiffs rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\n<em>Ti-ie Statute of Limitations Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The foregoing notwithstanding, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs conversion claims are time barred because, he contends, Plaintiff did not file this action within three years from the accrual of the cause of action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant relies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-105(2), which states that a claim for conversion of personal property shall be commenced within three years from the accrual of the cause of action. It is upon this basis that Defendant insists the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">A cause of action for conversion <em>occurs </em>when the alleged wrongdoer exercises dominion over the funds in \u201cdefiance of the owner\u2019s rights,\u201d <em>Hanna, </em>275 S.W.3d at 427 (citing <em>Mammoth Cave, </em>569 S.W.2d at 836). A cause of action <em>accrues </em>\u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that a cause of action existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson v. Craycraft, </em>914 S.W.2d 506, 511 (Tenn.Ct.App.1995) (quoting <em>Stone v. Hinds, </em>541 S.W.2d 598, 599 (Tenn.Ct.App.1976))). Therefore, two determinations must be made: (1) when did Defendant exercise dominion over the transferred funds in defiance of Plaintiffs rights, and (2) when did Plaintiff know, or reasonably should have known, that a cause of action for conversion existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">It is Defendant\u2019s contention that Plaintiffs cause of action for conversion is time barred because the claim accrued prior to February 23, 2003, more than three years prior to the commencement of this action. Of the numerous transfers by Defendant of Plaintiffs savings into Defendant\u2019s personal accounts, only three of the transfers occurred more than three years prior to the filing of this action. The first transfer of $8,500 occurred on February 10, 2003; the second transfer of $24,500 occurred on February 13, 2003; and the third transfer of $5,000 occurred on February 21, 2003. All other transfers occurred after February 23, 2003; therefore, these claims are not time barred and the trial court correctly denied Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as to these claims. Whether the claims of conversion concerning the first three transfers are time barred requires further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u201cMere ignorance and failure of a plaintiff to discover the existence of a cause of action is not sufficient to toll the running of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Hanna, </em>275 S.W.3d at 428 (citing <em>Vance v. Schulder, </em>547 S.W.2d 927, 930 (Tenn.1977); <em>Hall v. DeSaussure, </em>41 Tenn.App. 572, 297 S.W.2d 81 (1956)). Nevertheless, the accruing of a cause of action may be tolled by a defendant\u2019s fraudulent concealment of the cause of action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">To establish fraudulent concealment, a plaintiff must prove the following: (1) that the defendant took affirmative action to conceal the cause of action or remained silent and failed to disclose material facts despite a duty to do so; (2) that the plaintiff could not have discovered the cause of action despite exercising reasonable care and diligence; (3) that the defendant had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of action; and (4) that the defendant concealed material facts from the plaintiff by withholding information or making use of some device to mislead the plaintiff, or by failing to disclose information when he or she had a duty to do so. <em>Pero\u2019s Steak and Spaghetti House v. Lee, </em>90 S.W.3d 614, 625 (Tenn.2002) (citing <em>Shadrick v. Coker, </em>963 S.W.2d 726, 735-36 (Tenn.1998)). Thus, Plaintiff has the burden to prove that Defendant took affirmative action to conceal his cause of action from him. <em>Hanna, </em>275 S.W.3d at 428 (citing <em>Vance, </em>547 S.W.2d at 930; <em>Willis v. Smith, </em>683 S.W.2d 682, 688 (Tenn.Ct.App.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">When there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties, the \u201cfailure to speak where there is a duty to speak is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the equivalent of some positive act or artifice planned to prevent inquiry or escape investigation.\u201d <em>Shadrick, </em>963 S.W.2d at 735 (quoting <em>Hall, </em>297 S.W.2d at 85). As our Supreme Court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahi\">the affirmative action on the part of the defendant must be something more than mere silence or a mere failure to disclose the known facts. There must be some trick or contrivance intended to exclude suspicion and prevent inquiry, <em>or else there must be a duty resting on the party burning such facts to disclose them.... For example, such a duty arises ivhere a confidential relationship exists, as between physician and patient. </em>In such cases, there is a duty to disclose, and that duty may render silence or failure to disclose known facts fraudulent. This is the rule in Tennessee and in other jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Benton v. Snyder, </em>825 S.W.2d 409, 414 (Tenn.1992)) (emphasis in original). Defendant owed Plaintiff a fiduciary duty at all times material to this action; thus, Defendant had a duty to disclose any material fact or information pertaining to the fiduciary relationship. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, as the <em>Shadrick </em>court held, that duty <em>may </em>render silence or failure to disclose known facts fraudulent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u201cThe third essential element of fraudulent concealment is knowledge on the part of the defendant of the facts giving rise to the cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Benton, </em>825 S.W.2d at 414). \u201cIn other words, the defendant must be aware of the wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Housh v. Morris, </em>818 S.W.2d 39, 43 (Tenn.Ct.App.1991) (stating fraudulent concealment will be shown where the defendant had knowledge of the wrong done and concealed such information from the plaintiff)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The fourth essential element of fraudulent concealment is a concealment of material information from the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Benton, </em>825 S.W.2d at 414). A concealment \u201c \u2018may consist of withholding information or making use of some device to mislead\u2019 the plaintiff in order to exclude suspicion or prevent inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Benton, </em>825 S.W.2d at 414). \u201cWhen there is a relationship involving trust and confidence between the parties which would impose a duty to make a full disclosure of the material facts, mere silence or nondisclosure may constitute concealment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735-36 (citing 54 C.J.S. <em>Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a7 90 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The rationale for this element of the rule has been explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">Fiduciary relationship, confidential relationship, constructive fraud and fraudulent concealment are all parts of the same concept. The nature of the relationship which creates a duty to disclose, and a breach of [that] duty constitutes constructive fraud or fraudulent concealment, springs from the confidence and trust reposed by one in another, ... Once the relationship exists \u201cthere exists a duty to speak ... [and] mere silence constitutes fraudulent concealment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-10\"><em>Shadrick, </em>963 S.W.2d at 736 (quoting <em>Garcia v. Presbyterian Hospital Ctr., </em>92 N.M. 652, 593 P.2d 487, 489-90 (N.M.App.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Applying the four elements of fraudulent concealment to the facts of this case, we have determined the record demonstrates that Defendant Fred Hobbs owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff, and that by directing that the bank statements be mailed to Defendant instead of Plaintiff, Defendant took affirmative action to conceal his wrongdoing, i.e., the transfer of Plaintiffs funds to his personal accounts. Further, the record demonstrates that Defendant withheld material information regarding the transfers by making use of a device to mislead Plaintiff, when he changed the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>dress to which the bank statements would be mailed, and by remaining silent and failing to disclose material facts when there was a duty to speak. The record also demonstrates that Defendant knew of the facts giving rise to the cause of action, as he was the one who transferred the funds. There is no dispute of any of the foregoing material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">There is, however, a genuine dispute of fact concerning whether Plaintiff could have discovered the wrong by exercising reasonable care and diligence. Whether Plaintiff exercised reasonable care and diligence in discovering the injury or wrong is usually a question of fact for the jury to determine. <em>Shadrick, </em>963 S.W.2d at 737 (citing <em>Wyatt v. A-Best Co. et al., </em>910 S.W.2d 851, 854 (Tenn.1995)). For this reason, we find there is a material dispute of fact concerning whether Plaintiff could have discovered the fact that certain funds were converted by defendant prior to February 23, 2003. We, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment as it pertains to the statute of limitations defense and the funds transferred prior to February 23, 2003, and remand the issue to the trial court for a determination by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment contending he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it was undisputed that Defendant had converted in excess of $279,000 of his savings. As the moving party, Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment \u201conly if the pleadings, depositions, interrogatories, admissions and affidavits show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that he is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Martin v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., </em>271 S.W.3d 76, 83 (Tenn.2008) (quoting Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04; <em>accord Penley v. Honda Motor Co., </em>31 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tenn.2000)). \u201cThe moving party has the ultimate burden of persuading the court that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Byrd v. Hall, </em>847 S.W.2d 208, 215 (Tenn.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\"> If the plaintiff files a motion for summary judgment on an element of one of his claims, the plaintiff \u201cshifts the burden by alleging undisputed facts that show the existence of that element and entitle the plaintiff to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hannan v. Alltel Publ\u2019g Co., </em>270 S.W.3d 1, 9 n. 6. (Tenn.2008). If the plaintiff makes a properly supported motion, then the defendant is required to produce evidence of specific facts establishing that genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>Martin, </em>271 S.W.3d at 84 (citing <em>McCarley v. W. Quality Food Serv., </em>960 S.W.2d 585, 588 (Tenn.1998); <em>Byrd, </em>847 S.W.2d at 215).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">A defendant could satisfy his burden of production by: (1) pointing to evidence establishing material factual disputes that were over-looked or ignored by the plaintiff; (2) rehabilitating the evidence attacked by the plaintiff; (3) producing additional evidence establishing the existence of a genuine issue for trial; or (4) submitting an affidavit explaining the necessity for further discovery pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. Rule 56.06. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McCarley, </em>960 S.W.2d at 588; <em>accord Byrd, </em>847 S.W.2d at 215 n. 6). \u201cThe non-moving party\u2019s evidence must be accepted as true, and any doubts concerning the existence of a genuine issue of material fact<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> shall be resolved in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McCarley, </em>960 S.W.2d at 588).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"> A trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment enjoys no presumption of correctness on appeal. <em>Draper v. Westerfield, </em>181 S.W.3d 283, 288 (Tenn.2005); <em>BellSouth Adver. &amp; Publ\u2019g Co. v. Johnson, </em>100 S.W.3d 202, 205 (Tenn.2003). We review a summary judgment decision as a question of law, <em>Finister v. Humboldt Gen. Hasp., Inc., </em>970 S.W.2d 435, 437 (Tenn.1998); <em>Robinson v. Omer, </em>952 S.W.2d 423, 426 (Tenn.1997), and make a fresh determination of whether the requirements of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56 have been satisfied, <em>Blair v. West Town Mall, </em>130 S.W.3d 761, 763 (Tenn.2004); <em>Staples v. CBL &amp; Assoc., </em>15 S.W.3d 83, 88 (Tenn.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We find that Plaintiff demonstrated the elements required to support his claim that Defendant converted Plaintiffs savings. This was demonstrated based on the undisputed fact that Defendant transferred in excess of $279,000 of Plaintiffs savings to Defendant\u2019s personal accounts, and thereafter refused to return the funds; thereby, establishing that Defendant has exercised dominion over the transferred funds in defiance of Plaintiffs rights. As a consequence, the burden of production then shifted to Defendant to demonstrate a genuine dispute as to a material fact which would render summary judgment inappropriate. <em>See Martin, </em>271 S.W.3d at 84 (citing <em>McCarley, </em>960 S.W.2d at 588; <em>Byrd, </em>847 S.W.2d at 215).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Although the burden of production shifted to Defendant, Defendant failed to present competent evidence to create a dispute of fact on the issue of conversion. With the exception of the prepaid funeral expenses, Defendant admitted that he cannot prove that any of the transfers were made on Plaintiffs behalf or that any of the funds were expended for Plaintiffs use or benefit. He also admitted that he cannot account for the $279,000 transferred to his accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">The only fact relied upon by Defendant in his attempt to create a genuine issue of material fact pertained to a so-called \u201ccontract\u201d among Plaintiff (Thomas Ralston), Defendant (Fred Hobbs), and Defendant\u2019s mother, Myrtle Hobbs. The contract states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">We [Thomas Ralston, Fred Hobbs, and Myrtle Hobbs] have this date entered into the following agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">1. Tom R. Ralston shall have a lifetime right to reside at the home of his sister, Myrtle Hobbs at 1197 Swamp Road, Eagleville, Tennessee if he so desires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">3. Myrtle Hobbs and her son, Fred Hobbs will personally see that all of Tom R. Ralston\u2019s personal and medical needs are met as long as he resides at the home of Myrtle Hobbs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">3. Tom R. Ralston agrees to pay his share of the expenses as long as he resides at the home of Myrtle Hobbs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">4. Funds deposited in joint bank accounts at Union Planters Bank in the names of Tom R. Ralston and Fred Hobbs are to be used by either party as needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">The contract bore the signatures of Tom Ralston, Fred Hobbs, and Myrtle Hobbs, and it was dated October 1, 2001, at which time Defendant was Plaintiffs attorney-in-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">Defendant contends this contract creates a genuine dispute of fact concerning a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>material issue, which he describes as \u201cthe overall fairness of the transaction\u201d and, he therefore contends, the issue must be decided by the trier of fact, not by the judge on summary judgment. We find no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The overall fairness of a transaction is a consideration which can be material in cases wherein an attorney-in-fact receives a benefit in a transaction with his principal. The rule in Tennessee is that the existence of a fiduciary relationship, \u201cfollowed by a transaction wherein the dominant party [the attorney-in-fact] receives a benefit from the other party [the principal], a presumption of undue influence arises, that may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence of the fairness of the transaction.\u201d <em>Matlock, </em>902 S.W.2d at 386 (citing <em>Hogan v. Cooper, </em>619 S.W.2d 516 (Tenn.1981); <em>Richmond v. Christian, </em>555 S.W.2d 105 (Tenn.1977); <em>Brown v. Weik, </em>725 S.W.2d 938 (Tenn.Ct.App.1984); <em>Estate of Depriest v. Allen, </em>733 S.W.2d 74 (Tenn.Ct.App.1987); <em>Roberts v. Chase, </em>25 Tenn.App. 636, 166 S.W.2d 641 (1942); 19 A.L.R.3d 575, 596).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Defendant, as Plaintiffs attorney-in-fact who received substantial benefits resulting from the transfer of $279,000 to his personal accounts, must establish by a showing of clear and convincing evidence that the transactions were fair to Plaintiff. Defendant contends the so-called contract demonstrates the fairness of the transactions; it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In our recent opinion in <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>No. M2007-00565-COA-R3-CV, 2008 WL 1850807, at *3 (Tenn.Ct.App. April 24, 2008), a son and daughter, who were the attorneys-in-fact for their mother, were found to have breached their fiduciary duties to their mother when, acting as attorney-in-fact, the daughter conveyed her mother\u2019s real property to her brother for no consideration. The siblings attempted to justify the transfer by stating that the son \u201ccontributed to the purchase price and worked the property\u201d for their mother. <em>Id. </em>We rejected the contention finding that the fiduciary duty required that they \u201cact in her best interest, including the preservation of her assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our holding was explained, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">The Power of Attorney executed by Ms. Taylor appointed the Defendants as her attorneys-in-fact to act in her place \u201con my behalf, and for my use and benefit\u201d and granted them the power to deal with any of her real property \u201cunder such terms and conditions as said attorney of fact [sic] shall deem proper.\u201d Thus, any transaction involving the property, or any asset of Ms. Taylor, was to be for her \u201cuse and benefit\u201d and the Defendants assumed the fiduciary responsibility to so manage her assets. There is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Ms. Taylor received any benefit from the transfer of the property; to the contrary, the record shows that the property was the sole asset of Ms. Taylor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alz\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">There is no proof that Ms. Bertie Taylor received any benefit from the conveyance of her property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-11\"><em>Id. </em>at *3. Upon that finding, we determined that the transfer of Mrs. Taylor\u2019s property to her son for no consideration, other than the empty claim that the son rendered services and otherwise contributed to the property, constituted a breach of the fiduciary duty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">As in <em>Taylor, </em>Defendant Fred Hobbs, as his uncle\u2019s attorney-in-fact, had an affirmative duty to preserve his uncle\u2019s assets and not pursue his own self-interest or that of his mother. The contract upon which Defendant relies merely establishes that De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>fendant was committed to caring for Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff would pay his own expenses. As for the fourth paragraph, which states that the funds deposited in the joint accounts could be used by either Defendant or Plaintiff \u201cas needed,\u201d it clearly reflects that the funds could be used as needed by Plaintiff, for Plaintiffs benefit, not Defendant\u2019s benefit. This fact is clearly supported by Defendant\u2019s admissions that he added his name to Plaintiffs accounts for the benefit of Plaintiff in order to make it easier to pay Plaintiffs expenses. Moreover, there is no evidence whatsoever in the record to support a finding that Defendant\u2019s transfer of in' excess of $279,000 to his personal accounts was \u201cneeded\u201d for Plaintiffs use or benefit. The contract confirms the role of Defendant as Plaintiffs fiduciary. We, therefore, conclude that the contract does not demonstrate or even create a dispute of fact concerning \u201cthe overall fairness of the transaction\u201d as Defendant claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">As this Court has previously explained, the existence of a fiduciary or confidential relationship, combined with a gift or benefit to the fiduciary, creates a presumption of the invalidity of the transaction. <em>Martin v. Moore, </em>109 S.W.3d 305, 310 (Tenn.Ct.App.2003). The presumption, however, may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of the fairness of the transaction. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, proof that the donor received independent advice respecting the consequences and advisability of the gift or transaction can serve as an example of proof of fairness. <em>Richmond, </em>555 S.W.2d at 108. Independent advice is required \u201cwhere the circumstances are such that it would be difficult to show the fairness of the transaction without proof of independent advice, particularly, where the donor is impoverished by the gift in question or the gift seems to be unnatural under the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not receive independent advice concerning the contract relied on by Defendant. The mere existence of the so-called contract falls short of constituting clear and convincing evidence of the fairness of the transfers which rendered Plaintiff impoverished; moreover, as it pertains to the issue of summary judgment, it is insufficient to even create a genuine dispute of fact concerning the alleged fairness of the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the grant of summary judgment concerning Defendant\u2019s conversion of funds from Plaintiffs savings account as it pertains to all transfers that occurred on or after February 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in all respects except for the statute of limitations defense as it pertains to funds transferred to Defendant\u2019s personal accounts prior to February 23, 2003, specifically the following funds and the following dates: $8,500 on February 10, 2003; $24,500 on February 13, 2003; and $5,000 on February 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">As for the award of summary judgment in the amount of $279,500, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision in all respects except for the award of damages for the conversion of funds resulting from the following transfers: $8,500 on February 10, 2003; $24,000 on February 13, 2003; and $5,000 on February 21, 2003, which may or may not be time barred, depending on the trial court\u2019s determination as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">As for the award of pre-judgment interest, that award is also affirmed in all respects except for the amount of the award that is based on the claim that may or may not be time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"AEcd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court except as expressly modified above and remand the issue concerning the statute of limitations defense as it pertains to the $8,500 transfer on February 10, 2003; $24,500 transfer on February 13, 2003; and $5,000 transfer on February 21, 2003, and for such other proceedings as may be necessary and which are consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AeB\">Costs are assessed against Defendant Fred Hobbs and his surety for which execution may issue,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">. The disputed transactions in this case concern only Plaintiff's savings account, as the checking account records reveal expenditures properly made for Plaintiffs medical care, medicine, utilities, telephone and insurance expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\">. Defendant admitted that the funds were not used to make any large purchases for Plaintiff and he could not account for his use of the funds. Defendant also admitted that the funds in Plaintiffs checking account, where his Social Security payments were deposited monthly, were used to pay Plaintiff\u2019s living expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">. Although doubtful, Defendant may have initially planned to hold the funds in his personal accounts for the benefit of Plaintiff at the time of each transfer. If that is the case, then the mere act of transfer may not have constituted a conversion of the transferred funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\">. Defendant also contends on appeal that Plaintiff failed to state fraud with particularity as required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 9.02. We find this contention immaterial to the issue of conversion, which is the basis for Plaintiff's claims against Defendant. Moreover, Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tiff is not pursuing a claim for fraud in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">. \"A disputed fact is material if it must be decided in order to resolve the substantive claim or defense at which the motion is directed.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>271 S.W.3d at 84 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Byrd, </em>847 S.W.2d at 215). \"A disputed fact presents a genuine issue if 'a reasonable jury could legitimately resolve that fact in favor of one side or the other.' \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Byrd, </em>847 S.W.2d at 215).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
