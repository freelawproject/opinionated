They admit, that about two hundred acres of land were designated, on the plat of the town, as commons, and so recorded. That these commons have occasionally been used by the owners and inhabitants, not as a matter of right, but merely by the sufferance of the defendants. They deny that any representations were ever made, by them or their agents, to purchasers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that they should be entitled to use and enjoy said commons. And', they claim, that, upon the original plat of said town, the right was expressly reserved, of laying out lots to be leased and disposed of; and that they were expressly authorized, by law, to make this reservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">Numerous acts of the legislature, in regard to the Ohio University, and proceedings on the part of tho corporators, are made parts of, and accompany, the bill and answer These, and the material parts of the testimony, being noticed and referred to in the opinion of the court, are here omitted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-6\">John Welch, for complainants, contended\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">First: There was a grant, or dedication, of these lands as commons. This will hardly be disputed. The bare designation of them on the plat as \u201c commons,\u201d is sufficient. Brown <em>v. </em>Manering <em>et al. </em>6 Ohio, Cond., 129, 354. But here is an addition; an express enactment of the legislature, who had power to manage this fund, given to them by 98] the donor, that ^commons \u2014 spacious commons, should be laid off, granted, or dedicated. The uses of the commons might have been particularly defined by the law ; and, indeed, it seems to have been the intention of the act of 1800, that they should be further defined than by simply calling them commons ; but then the act of 1804 does not require it any more than it requires a designation of the uses of the other parts of said town ; the lots, outlots, streets, alleys, gardens, etc. At all events, no further description was made, and the designation of their use must be found in the word \u201ccommons,\u201d in connection with the context, and subject matter. Here are acts of the legislature, directing a town to be laid off, including, or consisting, in part, of college lots and college gardens, all together forming one town; and all together, to be surrounded by commons. The use arises at once, <em>ex vi termini, </em>without further designation; the commons are to be appurtenant to the town, including the college lots and gardens, etc. The parties, and the court, are bound to put some construction upon,, or attach some definite use to, the word \u201c commons ;\u201d and it is impossible to attach any other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-8\">Commons arise by grant or dedication. 11 East. 376 ; 2 Johns, 424 ; 2 Bac. Abr. 35, note 28, and cases cited ; or, by prescription, which implies a grant. 1 Bac. Abr. 617, 618 ; and the analogy of the statute of limitation will be observed. 2 Vermont, 266 ; 11 East. 376 ; 2 Johns. 424. And they are incident to, and pass by, a grant of the land. 1 Bac. Abr. 618 ; 3 Bac. Abr. 385. These are commons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>so called in the statute, and so called upon the plat. As such they are incident to something ; and what can that be, if not the town of Athens ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-5\">The claim set up by defendants, is understood to be, that, admitting that these lands were once commons, they are only to remain such during the pleasure of the University. That she reserved to herself the right to destroy or sell them, and to change their designation from commons to streets, lots, alleys, etc., and to transfer their uses from the town to the University.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-6\">*Second: But there was no power to make the reservation, [99 and it is, therefore, void. All their power is derived from the legislature. It was to lay off the town according to Putnam\u2019s plan; to alter his plan, by extending the house lots (not the outlots, streets, etc.,) into the commons and outlots, where, on actual survey, found necessary, provided it was done before sale of any lots ; to make such alterations as were found expedient, recording the plat and alterations before sale, and to designate the uses of the several parts of the town on the map or plat. Under which of these powers did the trustees act when they made the reservation of a right to dispose of the commons \u2014 the entire commons? Under whichever it may be claimed, it is a full answer to say that the time for its exercise has gone by. By both acts, of 1800 and 1804, it is expressly limited by the first sale of the lots. That sale took place in November, 1804. As soon as the first lot was sold, these powers all expired. They had then been exercised, and the trustees, <em>quoad hoc. </em>became <em>fundi officio </em>; and a further act, emanating from the same source of power, the legislature, would be necessary to enable them to alter, in the smallest degree, the streets, alleys, lots, gardens, or commons of the town. No such act has passed, and no such power, therefore, ever has existed since the first sale. The object of requiring a plat, designation, and record, before sale, was certainty; whereas, uncertainty must have been the object, if such a reservation was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\">To alter the plan upon actual survey, is a very different thing from destroying or disregarding the plan. The plan was to have 250 acres of commons, and some 200 acres of lots. The trustees undertake to obliterate the commons, or, what was worse, to reserve the power to obliterate them after the sale of the lots, at pleasure. They might as well destroy or sell the streets, alleys, etc. They had just as much power. If they can, or could, dispense with one, commons, lots, gardens, streets or alleys, they can, or could, dispense with all or any, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>say that the town shall be all commons, all streets, all alleys, or all gardens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqqD\">*A corporation has limited powers, the grant of which must be strictly construed. 6 Ohio, Cond., 129, 354; 8 Ibid. 286. The power to extend the house lots into the commons is only that of enlarging some of the lots \u2014 altering the lines \u2014 not a power of selling the commons \u2014 not of extending outlots or streets and alleys into the commons \u2014not of converting them into streets, alleys, and out or inlots. But if such is the true meaning, to lay out new lots, streets, etc., in the commons, the very expression, \u201cextending into,\u201d implies that some, if not the principal part, of the commons shall be left. One was to be enlarged, and the other diminished, but neither was to be destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMP\">There is no power to lease or sell any part of the land in the two townships, except what is contained in the twelfth and thirteenth sections of the act of 1804. The twelfth authorizes the trustees to lease all except the town of Athens. The thirteenth authorizes them to sell and lease the lots, viz: those laid out, designated, and platted and recorded before sale. Where, then, is the power to sell the commons ? It still remains in the legislature, except where, as in the case of the graveyard, and other instances, they have delegated it by subsequent acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-7\">It would be idle to pretend, or argue, that under the power, or, rather, direction, to designate the uses of the commons, or the several parts of the town, the trustees might lay off into lots, or sell the commons, or reserve the right to do so for their own benefit. The utmost that could be done, by way of designating the use of the commons, would still leave them commons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-8\">It can not be presumed that such a reservation was on the plan returned by Putnam to the legislature :</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-9\">First: Because there was no trustees to make it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-10\">Second : Because a proviso, in the act accepting the plan, that the house lots might be extended into the commons, would then have been useless, and would not have been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-11\">What right have the trustees to reserve a power or right to themselves. They never had any power or right in the ^matter, and how could they reserve such ? It belonged to the legislature, and was to be reserved, if at all, by and to the legislature. They might as well have reserved it to John Doe; and Richard Roe had as much right to make the reservation. \u201c A reservation must be of such a thing as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>that doth except may have, and that doth properly belong to him,\u201d Shep. Touch. 78, 79, otherwise it is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\">Third : The reservation is inconsistent with the grant, and, therefore, is void. Such a reservation, even if made by authority \u2014 even if made by the legislature, who granted the commons, is void, because it is a reservation of the entire thing granted. That there once was a grant of commons \u2014 of all that is fairly included in the term commons \u2014to some extent \u2014 of some quantity of land, can not be denied. This grant was accompanied with, or, rather, followed by, a reservation of a right to take them all back again. Such a reservation is void; void if made at the very time of the grant; void certainly, if made after, on the principle that the \u201c first clause in a deed, and the last in a will,\u201d shall take effect in ease of repugnancy. But admitting that this reservation and grant were simultaneous ; that there was no grant of commons till the reservation was written on the plat, (along side the word \u201c commons,\u201d) and the plat recorded, and the first lot sold; the question is, was there no repugnancy ? Can the grant and the exception, or reservation, both take effect ? They clearly can not, and, therefore, the reservation is void, in toto. Sheppard\u2019s Touch. 78, 79 ; 3 Bac. Abr. 393 ; Ibid. 89, 79, titles \u201c Repugnancy,\u201d \u201c Habendum,\u201d \u201c Saving.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-6\">This is not a reservation, but an exception, notwithstanding the word used. \u201c A reservation is of something new,\u201d to arise out of the thing granted, as rent; and is made by the word \u201c rendering,\u201d etc. Sheppard\u2019s Touch. 80. An exception may be by the word saving, and is that whereby the grantor doth except something comprised within the generality of the terms of the deed. Shep. Touch. 78. It must be of a part of the thing only, and not of all, or the whole effect of the thing granted. Ibid. 78. You can not grant twenty houses, excepting *one; for this negatives the grant. Ibid. So a grant [102 of land, reserving or excepting the profits ; or, of a house, excepting one room. These exceptions are void, both for repugnancy and uncertainty. So, if one make a lease for ten years, at the will of the lessor, this is a good lease for ten years certain; and the last words are void, for repugnancy. 3 Bac. Abr. 394. The same rule applies to the construction of statutes. A saving repugnant to the purview is void. 6 Ibid. 381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-7\">Suppose the grant had been by deed, instead of these \u2022 statutes, and this plat and designation, and that the deed was executed at the time the plat was made, and this reservation incorporated into the deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>how would it read ? and how would its parts take effect ? This will simplify the case, and present this question of repugnancy or inconsistency more distinctly, without varying the principle of the case in the least. The deed would be to this effect: <em>\u201c We </em>grant you commons, but we reserve the right to take them all back again at our pleasure.\u201d That is, <em>\u201c </em>we grant you as much commons as we please to let you have.\u201d Or, thus : \u201c We grant you just as much commons as we were bound to let you have before we made any grant.\u201d That is, \u201c we grant you nothing ; we grant, but we don\u2019t grant.\u201d Such a grant and reservation can not stand together. They are wholly and irreconcilably repugnant. One or the other must give way, in toto. And the books, as well as common sense, tell us which that must be. A reservation shall never defeat a grant, because it would thus defeat itself. The reservation stands upon the grant, as a house upon its foundation. Take away the latter, and the whole edifice will fall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">An exception (in ease of uncertainty,) shall be taken most favorably to the grantee; and if not set down with certainty, the grantee shall have the benefit arising from the defect. 3 Johns: 375 ; 8 Johns. 394.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">He also made the following points ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">Fourth : The reservation, by its own terms, only extends to part of the commons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-8\">Fifth : The public had no notice of the reservation, the plat not being recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-a\">*Sixth: The complainants have title by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-10\">A. G. Brown, (T. Ewing, was with him,) for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-11\">The two principal, and, as it is conceived, only material questions to be settled in this case, are these : Had the board authority to make the reservation inscribed on the original recorded plat ? And, if so, had they, and have they still, authority to continue to lay out and sell parts of the commons, so. long as any remain ? If the affirmative of the first of these propositions be established, the others would seem, almost, to follow of course.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-12\">The counsel for the defendants do not consider it necessary, and will not attempt to follow very minutely, and reply to every particular of the labored and ingenious argument of the counsel for the complainants. Much that he has said may be safely admitted, while much more, it is conceived, has little or no bearing upon the points at issue, and the real merits of the case. His references, for authorities on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>subject of commons, are, principally, to the ancient English books and decisions, very few of which, it is apprehended, have any direct or analogous application to the species of commons involved in the present ease. 3 Kent Com. 403, (4th edition) as to commons in the U. S. Mr. Welch does not seem very precisely to define the kind of commons which, according to the books, he apprehends the commons in the present case to be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">It is admitted, of course, that there are commons in England where no right of approvement exists, and ih this country, where no reservation has been made in the grant or dedication, by an individual or body holding the absolute fee ; but in the present instance, the grant or dedication was by trustees, having, at most, but limited powers, and, besides, having used the precaution of making an express reservation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\">By the conditions of the original compact, the lands in the two college townships, so called, were given forever, for the purposes of a university, to be applied by the state legislature. *In the word [104 \u201c applied\u201d is contained the whole power of the legislature, and that limited to the purpose named, and no other. The first movement to carry into effect the object of the donation after the survey and selection of the two townships, by the agents of the Ohio Company, was the resolution, adopted December 19, 1799, by the territorial legislature, appointing commissioners to lay off a town plat, etc., for the site of the contemplated University, within said townships. In this resolution, is sufficiently denoted the light in which the power of the legislature was then viewed. The plat was to contain, as of first importance, \u201c a square for the colleges; also, lots suitable for house lots and gardens, for a president, professors, tutors,\u201d etc., and these bordering on, or encircled by, spacious commons ; and, further, such a number of town lots adjoining the said commons and outlots, as said commissioners should think would be for the advantage of the University. Do the commons seem to have been intended to be made appendant or appurtenant to the town lots, or, are not rather both commons and town lots appurtenant to the college square, etc., the advantage of the University being the primary object. The legislature seem to have been aware of the sacred nature of the trust, and to have guarded their language accordingly. The resolution of December 6, 1800, confirms the town thus laid out, by the name of Athens,' with a proviso, that the trustees of the University, therein to be established, should have power to alter said plan in certain particulars, and, provided, also, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>such alterations should be made, and a plat, etc., with a designation oi the uses of the commons, should be recorded, etc. A second section provides that two certain lots should be designated and set apart, and reserved for the use of the town, etc. The thirteenth section of the act of 1804, contains, in substance, the same provisions for a designation of the uses of the several parts of said town. Now, if it had been intended that the commons should be designated and set apart, and reserved, for the use of the town, as in the case of said two lots, why was not similar language used ? What could have been intended 105] by the requirement that the uses of the commons *should be designated ? Had the word <em>\u201c </em>commons\u201d been used in said resolutions, and in the act of 1804, in the unlimited sense contended for by the complainants, there would neither have been any necessity, nor propriety, in requiring, or authorizing, a designation of uses. The word \u201c commons\u201d inscribed on the plat, would have constituted a dedication, carrying with it all the incidents of unrestricted commons. Had mere commons been intended, the inscription of the bare word on the plat would have vested the part designated for the use of the town ; and the board of trustees could never again have exercised any jurisdiction or control over the part so dedicated and vested. It is clear, from circumstances, that the legislature had a particular purpose in directing a designation of the uses of the commons to be made. The original plat returned by Gen. Putnam, and others, to the territorial legislature, is, unfortunately., not to be found in the archives of the state. It is probable this plat contained some note or suggestion on the subject of these commons. This supposition is strengthened and confirmed, by the expressions used in the original draft of the report to the legislature accompanying said plat, which was found among the papers of Gen. Putnam, in the hands of his son, a copy of which is inserted in the answer of the defendants. The original plat, made and recorded in 1804, was executed under the superintendence of General Putnam ; and the certificate thereon, containing said reservation, and the designation of the uses of the several parts, is signed by him; and who, with the other members of the board then acting, may be supposed to have been familiarly and well acquainted with the views and intentions of the legislature, and the original parties to the compact by which said two townships of land was given. But had not the board power to make this reservation, independent of the special direction of the legislature ? The power conferred upon the legislature was to apply the donation to the purpose intended. In the execution of this power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the legislature created a board of trustees, and, by the act of 1804, vested said two townships of *land in said board, with ample [1\u00a96 powers for executing the trust reposed therein. By this act, the power of the legislature over the subject was exhausted, and its office ceased, so far as concerned the direct control and management of the donation. Not only, then, was the right and power invested in the board, but it became their duty, as faithful trustees, to make the reservation they did. If these views be correct, the first proposition above stated is established, viz : that the board had the power to make the reservation of a right of laying out such parts of the commons as they, from time to time, might think proper, into house lots, outlots, etc., as expressed on said plat. And, this established, it is hardly necessary to state an argument to prove that the right has not since been lost, to continue to lay out and dispose of parts of said commons, in the manner prescribed, so long as any part shall remain, and the interest of the University require it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">There is nothing, it is believed, applicable to the ease, in the arguments of the complainant\u2019s counsel, drawn from the legal axiom, \u201cthat the first clause in a deed, and last clause in a will, shall Stand,\u201d and that \u201c a reservation, inconsistent with the grant, is void,\u201d etc. The distinction between a reservation and an exception is perfectly clear. The grant, in this case, is of certain grounds, as commons, during the will of the grantors ; a grant of commons for the present, with the future right of approvement. In this there is nothing inconsistent or improper. It is not like the grant of a certain number of acres, except the whole or a greater number of acres, or of a whole, except all its parts, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-6\">The inference is attempted to be raised, by the complainants, that the owners and holders of lots have acquired rights in the commons by prescription, or occupation adverse to the claims of the board.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-7\">The policy of the old law, in favor of common of pasture, and estovers, as being conducive to improvements in agriculture, has entirely changed, or become obsolete, and this incorporal right is now found to be an incumbrance, rather than an advantage. The right of common is little known or used in *this country, and probably does not [107 exist in any of the northern or western parts of the United States, which have been settled since the revolution. 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 403, last edition, where reference is also made to the opinion of the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, 12 Serg. and Rawle, 33, who declared that he knew very few instances of rights of commons, etc. It is denied, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the part of the board, that any possession or occupation, which has been had by the inhabitants, has been adverse to the claims of the board, being only of a qualified and limited kind, and that, too, by the express or implied license and permission of the board ; and with notice and knowledge of the rights claimed by the board. This the complainants are estopped from denying, since they have set up, in their bill, that the plat was shown to the public, and to purchasers, at the sales, and assurances given that it had been recorded. The board have, also, at different times, laid out and sold lots from tho commons, the inhabitants not only standing by and not objecting, but actually petitioning and requesting to have such sales made. How, then, could any limitation run against the right of the board to lay off lots, etc ? And have not the inhabitants rather lost the right, did they ever possess it, of objecting to the proceedings of the board in making further sales of such lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-5\">It may be added, that neither the legislature, nor the board of trustees by them created, could apply any portion of the land in said two townships to any purpose or object but the support of the University, nor in any manner which might not be most beneficial to the same. The laying out of a town, with proper streets and alleys, and suitable lots for public buildings, etc., was, doubtless, within the powers conferred upon the legislature and trustees ; but the permanent alienation of so large a body of land as was comprised in the plat of said town under the designation of commons, could never have been within the contemplation of those powers, unless it could be clearly shown that such would be for the interest and advantage of the University. This the complainants have not even attempted to show. 108] The language of deeds, etc., is to be *construed most strongly against the grantors ; but there is no occasion for the application of this rule in this case. The grantors here are mere trustees, and are not permitted to go beyond their powers <em>; </em>and, besides, have very prudently left nothing for construction. The language of the reservation is as clear and explicit as that of the grant or dedication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">On these grounds, it is believed, the defence of the respondents must be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b94-7\">Birchard, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AJcL\">The papers in this case are voluminous, and contain much matter that may be passed over in stating the principle upon which the decision of the case must turn. The main facts are these : Townships 8 and 9, in the 14th range, were appropriated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Congress and set apart for the purpose of endowing an University. In 1799, the territorial Legislature, by a resolution, requested Rufus Putnam and others to lay off in one of the townships a town plat, to contain a square for the colleges, lots suitable for house lots, and gardens for a President, Professors, Tutors, etc., bordering on, or encircled by, spacious commons, and such a number of town lots adjoining said commons and outlots, as they should think will be for the advantage of the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In 1803, an act confirming and establishing the town of Athens, in the county of Washington, provides that the return and report of sgid Putnam, etc., be accepted and approved, and that the said town be confirmed and established ; \u201c provided, that the trustees of the University therein to be established,, shall have power to alter the plan of said town, by extending the house lots into the commons or outlots which adjoin the town, or by altering the streets,\u201d etc..; \u201c provided, also, that such alterations be made, and a plat of the town, outlots and commons, with a designation of the uses of the commons, be recorded,\u201d prior to a lease, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The second section designates lots 55 and 56 to be set apart for the use of the town and county, to be noted on the plat, and the title to vest in the county for the uses designated thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">*An act bearing date February 21, 1805, established the Uni- [109 versity, and appointed certain persons trustees. The 13th section made it the duty of the \u201c trustees to lay off the town of Athens, conformably to the plan of Rufus Putnam and others, in pursuance of resolutions of 1799, with such variations, however, as they may find it expedient to make; and the same being thus laid off, and a plat of the same, with a designation of the uses of the several parts of being recorded,\u201d etc.; and upon certain terms to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">A plat of the town was made, on which is a certificate of the recorder, that it was recorded on the 4th October, 1804. This plat contains certain streets, squares, etc., pertinently designated, and also certain vacant or unsurveyed land, without the limits of the town proper, bearing this designation : \u201c All the lands within the aforesaid boundary lines, not included in the public squares, house lots, outlots, streets and roads, are designated for commons; provided, always, that the hoard of trustees reserve the right of laying out such parts thereof as they from time to time may think proper, into house lots, outlots,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The important questions to be settled are \u2014 Had the board of trustees authority to make this reservation upon the plat ? \u2014 and have they now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the power to lay off lots, etc., and sell the same, as in their judgment the interests of the University and public convenience may require ?</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">First: As to the power to make this reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In coming to a correct conclusion upon this question, it is of some importance to look well to the subject matter. The Legislature were intrusted with a fund for the purpose of advancing the cause of science. The main intent was to make a disposition of it in the best manner to advance the design of the donor. All of their acts should be favorably construed to effect this design. The Ohio University was the great object in view throughout. The town-of Athens was merely incident and subsidiary to that object. We are forced to this conclusion to avoid an inference of unfaithfulness in the discharge of the trust con-11\u00a9] tided to the state by the bounty of the United ^States. The resolution of 1799 speaks only of such spacious commons, lots, squares, etc., as would be of advantage to the University ; and all of the subsequent legislation must be construed with this, as a part of the whole. Hence, the intent of the power to alter the plan of Putnam and others, contained in the act of 1803, may be gathered. That, also, was for the advantage of the University. The act mentions the tract in question, as commons, or outlots, and the power is expressly given to the trustees (not then appointed) to extend the house lots into it, without restriction, as to them might seem proper. But it is thought the proviso is a limitation of this power. The object of the proviso must be looked to in determining this point. The plat was to be completed as far as necessary to advance the main object, and the designation of the uses of the commons was to be made, and the plat recorded, before sales, in order to prevent surprise upon purchasers, and to become evidence of the extent of their rights. The country was then new \u2014 a small area was then sufficient to accommodate a sparse population ; time, and an increase of inhabitants, might render a greater number of house lots matter of public convenience, as well as beneficial to the University. Its interests being regarded as the primary object, ea.n it be supposed that the Legislature, anxious faithfully to discharge the trust confided to the state, intended to force into market at once, and under the circumstances, all the lots that a great increase of population might ultimately render necessary. The supposition is not admissible. It better comports with honesty to suppose that they designed to vest a discretion, to be exercised by a board of trustworthy men, for the advancement of the main object, but so restricted that good faith must be observed as to others.</p>\n<p id=\"AI8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>This land, whether to he called commons or outlots, remained unsurveyed because it was not then needed. Its uses were so designated as to prevent deception. The uses were consistent with the primary object of the law; and we, therefore, say the reservation was legally made.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">*As there is testimony in the case, taken for the purpose of [111 proving that the purchasers of lots adjacent to this land bid higher on account of its proximity to this common than they otherwise would, it is perhaps proper to notice it. All we have to say upon the subject is, that if they were misled and deceived, it was the consequence of their own folly or neglect. The law had been published \u2014 the plat was made and recorded. It was the business of purchasers to look to them for information. These would not have misled them. If they chose to trust to the idle declarations of men unauthorized to speak upon the subject, and who gave incorrect information, chancery will not aid them.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">This seems to be nearly sufficient to dispose of this case ; for it is not readily perceived how the complainant\u2019s bill can be sustained with this one point against them. However, as other points have been argued, and the counsel of respondents wish them determined, we pass to the question, whether the trustees have now the power to lay off and sell additional lots. If they have not, I put the question, when did they lose it? The eleventh section of the act of February 21, 1805, vests the townships 8 and 9 \u201c in the corporation, in trust, for the sole use, benefit and support of the University, forever.\u201d And the thirteenth section clothes the trustees with power to \u201c proceed and sell, from time to time, at public auction, such of the house and outlots as they may think proper.\u201d The fact that the cattle and sheep of people living in Athens have depastured the grass growing on this land no more defeats this right than it defeats the title of the owners of other adjacent land that has been treated in like manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">But if at law it would defeat the title, we then say to the complainants, try the question at law ; for chancery will not take jurisdiction where the law affords a plain and adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Injunction dissolved, and bill dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-8\">Judge Read, being one of the Trustees of the Ohio University, did not sit in this ease.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
