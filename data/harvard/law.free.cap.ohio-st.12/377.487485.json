Huston, under whom defendant claims \u2022title, conveying the premises in question, and bearing date June 6, 1816. The acknowledgment of this deed was made on the day of its date, and is in these words :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">\u201c State of Ohio, Hamilton county : Before me, James Sisson, a justice of the peace within and for said county, personally appeared Abijah Meddock and Rachael, his wife, who, being examined according to law, acknowledged the above deed of conveyance to be their voluntary act and deed, for the uses and purposes therein mentioned. In testimony whereof,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">The only question is, whether this acknowledgment of the deed is sufficient, under the statute, to pass the interest of Rachael Meddock in the premises described in the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-8\">*Thompson &amp; Gwynne, and Alexander H. McGuffey, for complainant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">The deed which is pleaded and exhibited in bar of the widow\u2019s dower, was executed, as has been stated, in the year 1816 ; and the only question (if indeed there can be any question in the case) is, whether the defective certificate of acknowledgment attached to the \u2022deed, and of even date with it, does not estop the complainant\u2019s claim to be endowed of the land of which her husband was seized in fee. and which is described in said deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-10\">The statute of 1805 regulates the acknowledgment of this deed. The second section of this statute, 1 Chase\u2019s Stat. 485, provides that where any husband and wife shall incline to dispose of, and convey the estate of the wife, or her right in and to any lands, etc., it shall be lawful for the said husband and wife to execute a proper instrument of conveyance, and, after such execution, to appear before a judge of the Supreme Court or Court of Common Pleas, or a justice of the peace, and acknowledge the same ; which judge or justice of the peace is hereby authorized and required to take such acknowledgment, \u201c in doing whereof <em>he shall examine the </em>wife, <em>separate and apart from her </em>husband, <em>and shall read or otherwise malee lenown the full contents of such deed or conveyance to the said wife; </em>and if, upon such separate examination, she shall declare that she did voluntarily, and of her own free will and accord, seal, and as her act and deed deliver the said deed of conveyance, without any coercion or compulsion of her husband, such deed or conveyance shall be, and the same is hereby de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>dared to be good and valid in law,\u201d etc. etc. ; <em>\u201c </em>and the judge or justice taking such acknowledgment shall, under his hand and seal, certify the same upon the back of the deed or conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\">In the case of Connell <em>v. </em>Connell, 6 Ohio, 358, the court say : <em>\u201c A </em>construction was given to this statute, in the case of Brown <em>v. </em>Parran, 3 Ohio, 140. In that ease it was held that the certificate of acknowl379] cdgment must show, either in \u00bfexpress terms, or by implication, a compliance with every substantial requisition of the law. \u2022 Before the rights of the wife to lands are affected, the second section requires, first, a separate examination ; second, that the wife be made acquainted with the full contents of the deed ; and, third, an acknowledgment that she voluntarily sealed and delivered it.\u201d In the same case, it is decided that, because it did not appear from the certificate that the contents of the deed were made known to the wife, she was entitled to dower. The direct applicability of this decision to the case now under consideration, is destroyed by the act of 9th March, 1835 ; Swan\u2019s Stat. 269; yet the authority is relied on as settling the law to be, that every act rendered necessary to be done by the law, must be certified by the justice, and that the omission to certify any one of them vitiates the certificate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-7\">But although the act of 9th March, 1835, takes from the complainant, one ground of objection to the sufficiency of the certificate, by rendering it immaterial whether the contents of the deed had been explained to her, yet there remain two other objections to this certificate, either of which, it is claimed by complainant, must be fatal to the instrument, as a bar to complainant\u2019s claim ; for the certificate does not show, either in express terms, or by necessary implication, that there was a separate examination of the wife, or that she, individually, declared the sealing and delivery to have been her voluntary acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">The plain and only import of the language of the certificate is, that both Abijah Meddook and Rachael, his wife, appeared at the same time before the justice, and were examined together, and made the acknowledgment in the presence of each other. Indeed, it is not easy to find language which shall convey this meaning more clearly, without resorting to an accuracy and technical nicety of expression never found in such instruments, and only necessary in-pleadings at law. The names are connected in the same sentence by the copulative conjunction <em>\u201c </em>and,\u201d and, standing thus in juxtaposition, the relative \u201c who\u201d 380] immediately following, refers to them as thus \u00bfcoupled; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>according to all rules of construction, whatever it designates as being done, is the joint action of both the persons to whom it relates. And so far from the concluding language of the certificate, that \u201c they were examined according to law,\u201d being true, the language employed irresistibly brings the mind to the conclusion, that they were examined in direct violation of law, in being examined together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">But let it be conceded, for the purposes of argument, that this most obvious construction of the language of the certificate is not the true one, and that, by some ingenuity of defendant\u2019s counsel, it can be-made to appear that the wife actually was examined apart from her husband, and, upon such examination, declared that she had voluntarily executed and delivered the instrument. What then ? Is this-sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute, which directs that the separate examination, etc., \u201c shall be certified upon the back of the deed or conveyance, under the hand and seal of the officer ? \u201d Every essential act must be shown, in some manner, to have been performed ; and as the officer does not act in a judicial, but rather in a ministerial capacity, the judgment he pronounces on his own conduct, in declaring that he acted \u201c according to law,\u201d raises no presumption that he has done those things which he fails to certify. If he states facts, they can not well be contradicted ; and the statute imposes on him, for the benefit of all the privies in the deed, the duty of recording the fact that the wife was examined apart from her husband, and that, under such examination, she declared the execution and delivery to have been her voluntary acts, in order that every person who inspects the title, may, without trying the question whether the justice has, or has not, acted \u201c according to law,\u201d be able to decide that the wife has had all the protection which the law intended to afford her, and that her right of dower is unquestionably relinquished. Brown <em>v. </em>Farran, 3 Ohio, 140 ; 3 Dana\u2019s Kentucky, 118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-6\">It is deemed unnecessary to comment further upon the defects of the certificate of acknowledgment, and we dismiss it, therefore, with the remark, that it not only fails to show the *facts which the [381 statute requires should be shown by.it, but that it even furnishes strong ground for a belief that Mrs Meddock was not examined apart from her husband, and, consequently, that no legal declaration was made by her that the execution and delivery of the deed were her voluntary acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-7\">An objection to the complainant\u2019s right to dower in the lands in-question, growing out of the body of the deed to Huston, has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>intimated, and will probably be relied on by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and should be noticed in anticipation. If urged, more will be said in reply. It is, that by joining in the grant to Huston, under whom defendant derives title, the complainant had barred the claim set up in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">It is true that the wife joins in the granting part of the deed ; but she does not join in the warranty, nor can there be found in the deed any word applicable to dower, or evincing the intention on the part of Mrs. Meddock to release or convey it. Is she barred of her dower by thus joining with her husband in conveying his estate? We think not. There might be doubt as to the effect of such conveyance, if dower can be released without specifically naming that kind of estate, and if, in Ohio, as is the case in Massachusetts, the acknowledgment of the husband \u2014 for certainly the wife\u2019s acknowledgment in this case is a nullity- \u2014 could effect a transfer of the wife\u2019s estate. But the statute of 1805 expressly declares that the deed of the wife shall be good and valid in law, to all intents and purposes, as if she had been a <em>feme sole </em>at the time of the sealing and delivery, but upon the express condition that she shall have been previously examined by the justice, apart from her husband, and, on such examination, shall have declared that she voluntarily sealed and delivered the said deed, etc. etc., and that the justice shall have certified these facts on the back of the deed. Such are the requirements of the law ; and although the acknowledgment is no part of the deed, it is equally certain that a <em>feme covert </em>can not be barred of the right of dower, unless these requirements have all been complied with, and the facts specifically certified by the justice. The instrument may be a deed, as against the husband and his 382] heirs, but as against the *wife it is a nullity. If this be not the case, the wife is, by some inexplicable fiction of the law, deprived of the benefit of the privilege of a separate examination, which is her only protection against the coercion or persuasion to which she is liable during coverture. McFarland <em>v. </em>Febiger\u2019s heirs, 7 Ohio, 195 ; Lessee of Foster <em>v. </em>Dennison, 9 Ohio, 125 ; Mitchell <em>v. </em>Dunlap, 10 Ohio, 117 ; Hughes <em>v. </em>Watson, Ibid. 127 ; Carr <em>v. </em>Williams, Ibid. 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">Complainant claims to have dower assigned to her in conformity with the statute on that subject, as expounded by this court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-7\">Morris and Rairden, for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\">We suppose there can be <em>no </em>question as to the validity of the deed, \u2022to bar the dower of the petitioner, if the acknowledgment by her is \u2022sufficient under the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The law of 1805, under which this acknowledgment was taken, requires the officer taking the acknowledgment to \u201c examine the wife separate and apart from her husband, and shall read or otherwise make known the full contents of such deed or conveyance to the said wife ; and if, upon such separate examination, she shall declare that she did voluntarily,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">The simple question in this case is whether the acknowledgment is sufficient to bar the dower claimed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">This certificate is in substantial compliance with the law. The law requires a separate examination of, and explanation to, the wife. The officer certifies that he has examined the wife according to law, and that she with her husband acknowledged the deed to be their voluntary act and deed, etc. What law is here referred to ? The law prescribing the mode of taking the acknowledgment. How according to law? That he has done all that the law requires. This, then, is a substantial compliance with the statute. It conveys the information, though in terms he does not state the precise acts done, nor does he use the \u2022terms of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">*This certificate says that the parties appeared, that is the [383 husband and wife, \u201cwho, being examined according to law,\u201d acknowledged the deed to be their voluntary act and deed, for the uses and purposes, etc. Who were examined according to law ? It must have been the wife, because the law required none other to be examined. Who acknowledged ? The parties who appeared, of course, because the law required both to acknowledge. This certificate, then, shows substantially that the wife was examined separate and apart from her husband, and acknowledged the deed to be her voluntary act and deed, for the uses and purposes therein mentioned. Not in terms, we admit; but from what is stated the inference is irresistible, that the law must have been complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">In the ease of Brown <em>v. </em>Farren, 3 Ohio, 140, the acknowledgment is substantially the same as in this case, and was held good. In that case the court say \u201c that his certificate must contain the substance of every thing required by the law.\u201d This authority is sufficient to establish the principle that the substance of the law is all that can be required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-9\">In the case of Newcomb\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Smith, Wright, 208, the acknowledgment was made \u201c agreeably to the act in such ease made and pro'-vided,\u201d and the court say, \u201c The case of Brown <em>v. </em>Farran, 3 Ohio, 152, is in point. If the matter not expressed in words is fairly inferrable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>from what is expressed, that will do. Id this case the words \u2018 agreeably to the act \u2019 would seem to include all the law required.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">In the case of Martha Stall <em>v. </em>The Bank of the United States,, decided at April term, 1836, in this county, the court made the following decree:</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-6\">Martha Stall, T <em>v. </em>V Bank United States. )</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5u\">In Chancery, on appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-9\">\u201c This cause came on to be heard this day, on the bill, answer, and exhibits, and the arguments of counsel being heard, and the same fully considered, and thereupon the court do find that the complainant 384] did, on the third day of January, 1808, ^execute and deliver the deed set up by the defendants in their answer, conveying the premises in said bill named to John Cranmer, dated on that day, and acknowledged the same day before a justice of the peace of Hamilton county, who certified the same in the following words, to wit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5r\">\u201c \u2018 Before me, the undersigned, one of the justices of the peace within and for said county, came personally Edward H. Stall, and Martha Stall his wife, the within grantors, and the said Martha, being of mature age, and examined agreeably to the act in such case made- and provided, acknowledged the above instrument to be their voluntary act and deed, for the uses and purposes therein mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-11\">\u201c \u2018 In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and affixed my seal, this third day of January, A. D., 1808.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-12\">\u201c And that the defendants claim title under said deed; and the court do further find that the equity of the case is with the defendants, and that the said acknowledgment is good and valid in law to bar the said complainant of her dower in the said bill mentioned; and thereupon the court do order, adjudge, and decree, that the said bill be dismissed at the costs of the complainant, to be paid in thirty days, and in default thereof, that execution issue thorefor, and to that end this cause is remanded,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-13\">These cases, it seems to us, settle the question in this case, and since the case of Martha Stall the question of dower has been regarded as settled in all cases where the acknowledgment of the deed has been made similar to those in question. The words \u201c according to law \u201d being regarded as equivalent to the words \u201cagreeably to the act.\u201d And now to overrule the decision in the case of Stall <em>v. </em>The Bank, the consequence will be to open all the cases which, since 1836, have been regarded by all as settled by that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Eor the purpose of ascertaining what the consequences to holders of property in this county would be, to set aside the decree in that case, we have examined the records of conveyances of property in this county prior to 1820, running through about twenty-four volumes, oi from 200 to 600 pages each. *We find that about two-thirds of [385-all the deeds, where dower is released, the acknowledgments are certified in the forms of the certificate in this case, and in the ease of Stall <em>v. </em>The Bank, and many of them taken by lawyers, acting as justices of the peace, and judges of the court; showing, evidently, that these acknowledgments were considered good, by those who transacted business at the time, to bar dower. That the law was substantially complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">The certificate in this ease shows that the wife, \u201c after being examined according to law,\u201d acknowledged the deed to be her voluntary act and deed, for the uses, etc. Now what inference can be drawn from this certificate, but that the wife was examined, separate and apart from her husband, and acknowledged, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\">The above remarks are made upon the hypothesis, that the act of 9th March, 1835, Swan\u2019s Statutes, 1841, page 269, renders the acknowledgment .sufficient, without it appearing that the contents were made known.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeE\">As to the law of 1835, We deem any notice of it unnecessary, further than to refer the court to the act. It may be contended, however, by the complainant\u2019s counsel, that this law is invalid. We submit a passing remark :</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-8\">There is no question that acts of the Legislature, retrospective in their operation, are valid, where they do not conflict with the Constitution, or interfere with vested rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-9\">There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States, or of Ohio, which prohibits this law. An <em>ex post facto </em>and a retrospective law, in legal moaning, are very different. 3 Dallas, 38.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-10\">As an <em>ex post facto </em>law, it is not prohibited <em>by </em>the Constitution. Does it interfere with vested rights ? We suppose it can not be seriously contended that the complainant had any vested right in her, after the deed, in 1816, and before the death of her husband, in 1837. This law passed in 1835, and took effect on the 9th day of March, of that year, before the wife of Meddock could have a right of dower vested in her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-11\">*This law makes that good which the complainant intended, at [386-the time of her deed should be good. 3 Dallas, 38; 2 Peters, S.

The certificate of the acknowledgment must show, either in express terms or by implication, a compliance with every substantial requisition of the statute.

It is evidence of the opinion of the officer, nothing more. It is the duty of the officer to certify the things he has done, and the court will then judge whether he has pursued the law. It is not a certificate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>opinion of the officer that he has pursued the law which the statute requires, but a certificate of the acts he has pursued in obedience to the statute. The certificate itself must contain all the acts done, that it may appear upon its face that the requisitions of the statute have been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">This deed would constitute no bar, even if the curative act of 1835 had been held valid.
