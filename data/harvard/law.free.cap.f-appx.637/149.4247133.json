HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b177-22\">Ramon Octavio Jaquez Cereceres requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, in which he sought a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. By moving to proceed IFP, Cereceres challenges the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AMV\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Dmblin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision of whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-24\">On appeal, Cereceres argues that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the basis that his sentence is already below the amended guidelines range. Because his original sentence was below the guidelines range due to his substantial assistance to authorities, he argues, the district court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>have sentenced him to a comparable reduction below the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">As a general rule, a district court is prohibited from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cto a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). However, where the defendant originally receives a below-guidelines sentence, a district court may, pursuant to a \u00a7 3582 motion, impose a revised sentence comparably below the amended guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Cereceres has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although Cere-ceres is correct that the district court had the discretion to impose a revised sentence comparably below the amended guidelines range, the district court was not required to do so, and the record does not reflect that the district court believed it lacked the discretion to impose such a sentence. <em>See Cooley, </em>590'F.3d at 297. The district court recognized that it had authority to lower Cereceres\u2019s sentence, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, specifically referred to the seriousness of the crime Cer-eceres committed and the danger to society Cereceres posed, and determined that a reduction was not warranted. Thus, the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to Cereceres\u2019s motion as a whole and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995),</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Thus, Cereceres has not demonstrated that he will present a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b177-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
