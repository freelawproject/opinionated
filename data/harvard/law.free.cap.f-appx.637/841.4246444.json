In the district court, Sumner asserted a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of his procedural due process rights, and further sought a declaratory judgment that the certificate of occupancy issued by the city to his neighbor be withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">. Sumner first urges this court to find that the district court erred in ruling that he failed to state a protected property or liberty interest to support his procedural due process claim. He further contends that the district court\u2019s determination that his declaratory judgment claim was unsupported by an independent basis for federal jurisdiction was also error.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">This court has considered this appeal on the basis of the briefs, the pertinent portions of the record, and the applicable law. Having done so, the judgment is affirmed, essentially for the reasons stated in the Order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
