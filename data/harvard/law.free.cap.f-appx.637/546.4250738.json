In 2012, Keen was convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ed in the State Court of Treutlen County, Georgia, of misdemeanor driving under the influence, sentenced to twelve months of probation, and ordered to pay a $805 f\u00edne and service fees incurred for his supervision by Judicial Alternatives, a private company that contracted with the state court to supervise its probationers, <em>see </em>Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 42-8-100(g). In 2015, Keen filed a putative class action seeking a judgment declaring section 42-8-100(g) unconstitutional, under the United States and Georgia Constitutions; declaring void the service contract between the state court and Judicial Alternatives; and for compensatory damages for money had and received by Judicial Alternatives. The district court ruled that Keen lacked standing to challenge the statute under the federal Constitution and that his remaining claims failed to state a claim for relief. We affirm the dismissal of Keen\u2019s challenge to section 42 \u2014 8\u2014100(g) on federal constitutional grounds for lack of standing and the dismissal of his claims to invalidate the service contract and for money had and received for failure to state a claim. We vacate that part of the judgment that addressed the merits of Keen\u2019s challenge to section 42-8-100(g) under the Georgia Constitution, and we remand for the district court to dismiss that claim for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim for relief. <em>See Houston v. Marod Supermarkets, Inc., </em>733 F.3d 1323, 1328 (11th Cir.2013) (standing); <em>Miller v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, </em>677 F.3d 1113, 1115 (11th Cir.2012) (failure to state a claim). \u201c[B]ecause the constitutional standing doctrine stems directly from Article Ill\u2019s \u2018case or controversy\u2019 requirement, this issue implicates our subject matter jurisdiction, and accordingly must be addressed as a threshold matter regardless of whether it is raised by the parties.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>324 F.3d 1229, 1242 (11th Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The district court correctly dismissed for lack of standing Keen\u2019s challenge to section 42-8-100(g) under the U.S. Constitution. This issue is controlled by our decision in <em>McGee v. Solicitor General of Richmond County, Georgia, </em>727 F.3d 1322 (11th Cir.2013), where we dismissed for lack of standing a complaint, like Keen\u2019s, for a declaratory judgment that section 42-8-100(g) violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 1324-25. Like McGee, Keen cannot \u201cdemonstrate a sufficient likelihood of being convicted in [the state] court and being placed on probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The district court erred by reaching the merits of Keen\u2019s challenge to section 42-8-100(g) under the Georgia Constitution. Keen failed to allege that' he faced an actual, imminent injury that would confer standing to challenge the state statute. Keen \u201cshow[ed] [no] sufficient likelihood\u201d that he will be convicted in the state court of another misdemeanor offense for which he will receive a sentence of probation and supervised by Judicial Alternatives. <em>See McGee, </em>727 F.3d at 1325. Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to examine the merits of Keen\u2019s challenge to section 42-8-100(g), we vacate that portion of the judgment dismissing that claim for failure to state a. claim and remand for the district court to dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Keen argues that he stated a claim for money had and received because the service contract was invalidated when the county commission, a party to the agreement, failed to reapprove the agreement in compliance with section 36-30-3 of the Georgia Code, but we need not address that argument because Keen fails to chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>lenge an alternative ground on which the district court rejected his argument to invalidate the service contract. The district court ruled that section 36-30-3, which prohibits \u201c[o]ne council ... [from] binding] itself or its successors so as to prevent free legislation in matters of municipal government,\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 36-30-3, did not invalidate the service contract because the commission was not a party to the contract and, in the alternative, because the provision was inapplicable to a \u201ccontract ... entered into with a local government by virtue of express legislative authority to do so.\u201d We will not reverse a \u201cjudgment that is based on multiple, independent grounds, [unless] an appellant ... convinces us that every stated ground for the judgment against him is incorrect,\u201d and Keen has abandoned any challenge that he could have made to the alternative ruling. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014). \u201c[I]t follows that the judgment [dismissing Keen\u2019s claim for money had and received as failing to state a claim] is due to be affirmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Keen also argues that the contract was \u201cnot properly executed\u201d because it was not \u201cattached to the minutes or resolution of the county commission,\u201d but we will not consider a challenge to the lawfulness of the contract that Keen failed to present to the district court, <em>see Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Keen\u2019s challenge to section 42-8-100(g) under the U.S. Constitution for lack of standing and the dismissal of his claims to invalidate the service contract and for money had and received for failure to state a claim. But we VACATE that part of the judgment that addressed the merits of Keen\u2019s challenge to- section 42-8-100(g) under the Georgia Constitution, and we REMAND with instructions for the district court to dismiss that claim for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
