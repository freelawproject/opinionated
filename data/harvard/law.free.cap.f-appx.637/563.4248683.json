After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-27\">Simon pled guilty to charges of (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 and (2) illegal reentry after removal from the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Because he pled guilty to a felony controlled substance offense and had two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, Simon qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. At the time Simon entered into the plea agreement, both he and the government were aware that he qualified as a career offender under the guidelines. The parties agreed to request a' sentence in the range of 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was below the guidelines range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">At sentencing, the district court considered Simon\u2019s career offender status, calculating his guidelines range as 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court considered the parties\u2019 request for a sentence of 92 to 115 months, varied downward from the guidelines range, and imposed a sentence of 92 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Simon recently moved the district court to reduce his sentence under Amendment 782, which he argued reduced his base offense level. The district court denied his motion, concluding that it lacked authority to resentence Simon because Amendment 782 did not change Simon\u2019s guidelines range, which was calculated based on his career offender status. This is Simon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">We review <em>de riovo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">However, the grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201care quite narrow.\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). For a defendant to be eligible for such a reduction, the Sentencing Commission must have amended the guideline at issue, that amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and the amendment must also be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d), making it apply retroactively. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">The Sentencing Guidelines explain that the amendment must lower the \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d which is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of ... any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. -\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(a). Additionally, when a defendant\u2019s offense level was determined by career offender status under \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than the quantity of the drugs involved in an offense under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u00a7 2D1.1, the defendant is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on a subsequent amendment to the offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1. This is because the amendment would not lower the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The district court committed no error in denying Simon a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. Amendment 782 reduced the base offense level for most drug sentences calculated pursuant to the Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 782. Amendment 782 is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d), making it apply retroactively. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). Thus, Amendment 782 may serve, when applicable, as the basis for a sentence reduction. The problem for Simon is that Amendment 782 did not lower his applicable guidelines range, which was calculated using the offense level for career offenders set forth \u00a7 4B1.1, not the offense level for drug quantity set forth in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Simon argues that he was not sentenced as a career offender because the district court varied downward from the guidelines range the court calculated based on \u00a7 4B1.1. It is immaterial, however, that after calculating the sentencing range based on Simon\u2019s career offender status, the district court varied downward substantially in imposing Simon\u2019s sentence. The advisory guidelines range at issue in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is the range determined <em>prior to </em>any departures or variances by the district court. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(a). Accordingly, we conclude that Simon is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Because the district court lacked authority to reduce Simon\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(e)(2), we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Simon\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-10\">. In the plea agreement, Simon acknowledged that the district court was \"under no obligation to impose a sentence that is below the advisory guidelines range.\u201d Plea Agreement at 3 (Doc. 244). The citation'tO\u2019\"Doc.\u201d refers to the docket entry in the district court record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-15\">. The government asserts that if Simon did not have career offender status, his guidelines range, calculated based on the quantity of marijuana involved and his reentry offense, would have been 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
