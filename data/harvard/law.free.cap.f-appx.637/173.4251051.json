He was sentenced to life imprisonment and 10 years of supervised release. He now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Relying on, <em>inter alia, Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), and <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), Jackson contends that the district court misapplied <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001), as the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 permits challenges to erroneously applied statutory mandatory minimum sentences. The district court determined that Jackson had not met the criteria for proceeding under the savings clause which allows a federal prisoner to attack the legality of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can show that the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). A prisoner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective must make a claim (1) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d that (2) \u201cwas'foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">We are not persuaded by Jackson\u2019s contention that the savings clause permits sentencing challenges. <em>See Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir.2010). As neither <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2278-95, nor <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1680-94, has any effect on whether Jackson was convicted of nonexistent federal drug offenses, these decisions do not demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Garland, </em>615 F.3d at 394. Jackson also relies on <em>United States v. Sanchez-Espinal, </em>762 F.3d 425 (5th Cir.2014), but that is not a Supreme Court decision, so it cannot satisfy the first prong of the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Finally, even though Jackson advanced a claim based on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) in the district court, he has not briefed a contention based on <em>Al-leyne </em>on appeal and has therefore abandoned this claim. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-19\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47,5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
