Pullins contends that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over any of Pullins\u2019s claims because they were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine, that the district court erred in denying Pullins\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint, and that the district court erred in dismissing his claims because Pullins sufficiently alleged that the appellees violated his rights. After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that Pullins fails to articulate any non-frivolous basis for reversal and affirm for the reasons identified in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">Although we find this appeal to be frivolous, due to Pullins\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, we deny the pending motion for damages and costs under Rule 38, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>See Woods v. IRS, </em>3 F.3d 403,404 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-14\">. <em>Hooker v.

White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend a complaint, but review <em>de novo </em>any legal conclusion as to whether amendment would have been futile. <em>SFM Holdings, Ltd. v.
