In this appeal, Armstrong challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He asserts that he was eligible for a sentence reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tion under Amendment 782 and that the district court abused its discretion in sua sponte denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief without allowing him the opportunity to be heard. Armstrong argues that a sentence reduction was warranted in view of his post-sentencing efforts to improve his education and his good prison disciplinary record, and he contends that the district court abused its discretion.by failing to properly consider the evidence. The Government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion and that Armstrong\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Amendment 782 became retroactively applicable on November 1, 2015, to inmates, like Armstrong, who were sentenced prior to the effective date of the amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 788. Inmates, such as Armstrong, who are eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 were permitted, prior to November 1, 2015, to seek a sentence reduction that would become effective on November 1, 2015. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In determining whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted and the extent of such reduction, the district court \u201cshall consider\u201d both the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)-(ii)). The district court \u201cmay consider\u201d the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief to Armstrong, the district court expressly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the district court also stated that it had taken into account \u201cthe need to protect the community.\u201d The district court further indicated that it had \u201ctak[en] into account the policy statement set forth at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.\u00cd0,\u201d and details of Armstrong\u2019s post-sentencing conduct were included in an Addendum prepared by the probation officer, which was before the district court when it made its determination to deny \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In sum, the record shows that the district court \u201cconsidered] the factors as required by law\u201d and therefore did not abuse its discretion. <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). The district court was not required to give a detailed explanation of its decision to deny \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, and Armstrong was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) just because he was eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Armstrong also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for the appointment of counsel to assist in the filing of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. There is no general right to the appointment of counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1995). Armstrong has not shown that fundamental fairness or the interests of justice required the appointment of counsel in what was an uncomplicated matter that did not turn on unresolved or disputed issues. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
