He contends his attorney provided inadequate assistance at sentencing by failing to: object to the two-level increase in his offense level for recruitment of a minor; ask the court to recommend his placement in the 500-hour drug and alcohol program; and object to the inclusion of certain relevant conduct in the calculation of his base-offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-23\">Generally, our court does not review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). \u2018We have undertaken to resolve claims of inadequate representation on direct appeal only in rare cases where the record allowed us to evaluate fairly the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987). In most instances, a claim qualifies as a \u201crare case\u201d warranting review only when it was raised and developed in a post-trial motion to the district court. <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 245 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-25\">Because Balderrama did not raise his ineffective-assistance claims in district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>court during the trial proceedings, the court did not have evidence from trial counsel or make any findings for whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Instead, Balderrama raised ineffective-assistance claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; but, the court dismissed his claims without prejudice, and determined only that he should be permitted to file an out-of-time direct appeal. In short, although Balderrama contends otherwise, the record is not sufficiently developed to allow for fair consideration of these claims. Therefore, we decline to consider them on direct appeal, without prejudice, of course, to Balderrama\u2019s right to raise them on collateral review. <em>See Isgar, </em>739 F.3d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b872-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
