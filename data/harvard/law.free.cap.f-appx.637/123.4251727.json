Gold Star asserts that the bankruptcy court erred (1) by failing to apply the doctrines of judicial estoppel and res <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>judicata to the property valuation; (2) by finding its mechanic\u2019s lien to be invalid; and (3) by denying its motion to transfer venue. Cavu/Rock asserts that the bankruptcy court erred (1) by finding that Gold Star had an unsecured claim against Cavu/ Rock for $743,382.29; and (2) by assessing costs against each party.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Cavu/Rock owned a residential housing development in Bakersfield, California (the \u201cProperty\u201d). Gold Star entered a development agreement with Cavu/Rock to construct improvements on the Property. Gold Star commenced performance under the contract. Cavu/Rock became delinquent in its payments to Gold Star and eventually filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. Gold Star and Wells Fargo Bank filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding. Wells Fargo\u2019s claim was secured by a deed of trust on the Property, while Gold Star asserted a mechanic\u2019s lien over the improvements. Cavu/Rock then brought an adversary proceeding challenging Gold Star\u2019s lien and claim. The bankruptcy court recognized Gold Star\u2019s claim for $743,382.29 but held the mechanic\u2019s lien invalid, making Wells Fargo the superior \u2014 and only \u2014 secured creditor. Both Gold Star and Cavu/Rock appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u201c[A] bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>In re Gerhardt, </em>348 F.3d 89, 91 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous only if on the entire evidence, the court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>In re Shankle, </em>554 Fed.Appx. 264, 266 (5th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">\n<em>a. Judicial Estoppel and Res Judicata</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Gold Star first argues that the-bankruptcy court erred by failing to use the same property valuation for both the bankruptcy proceeding and the adversary proceeding. Gold Star invokes the doctrines of judicial estoppel and res judicata in support. \u201cThe doctrine of judicial estoppel is equitable in nature and can be invoked by a court to prevent a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a position taken in a previous proceeding.\u201d <em>Love v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>677 F.3d 258, 261 (5th Cir. 2012). \u201cWe review a judicial estoppel determination for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Under the doctrine of res judicata, \u201cA final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\u201d <em>Comer v. Murphy Oil USA Inc., </em>718 F.3d 460, 467 (5th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981)). \u201cThe res judicata effect of a prior judgment is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Comer, </em>718 F.3d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">In the bankruptcy proceeding, Cavu/ Rock submitted feasibility projections as part of a reorganization plan pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129. Cavu/Rock estimated a future value of $60,000 to $75,000 for each lot on the Property, for a total property value range of $8,040,000 to $10,050,000. The bankruptcy court accepted these projections and approved the plan. In the adversary proceeding, Cavu/Rock presented evidence valuing the Property between $2,100,000 and $2,600,000, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506. Cavu/Rock argued that because Wells Fargo had a superior lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>exceeding the value of the Property, any claim by Gold Star would be unsecured. Gold Star objects to these differing valuations under \u00a7\u00a7 1129 and 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">A valuation under \u00a7 1129 is \u201csimply a set of projections offered in support of the plan\u2019s feasibility.\u201d <em>In re Heritage Highgate, Inc., </em>679 F.3d 132, 142 (3d Cir.2012). A \u00a7 1129 reorganization plan \u201cprovides for a debtor to retain and use collateral to generate income with which to make payments to creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141-42. The purpose of \u00a7 506, on the other hand, is to provide for the \u201cdivision of allowed claims supported by liens into secured and unsecured portions during the reorganization,\u201d and valuations under this section \u201cmust be based upon realistic measures of present worth,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142-43. The district court correctly held that the valuations under \u00a7\u00a7 1129 and 506 are two distinct, separate valuations required for different purposes. The feasibility projections under \u00a7 1129 were based on Cavu/Rock\u2019s estimate of \u201cmonies to be realized from the sale of lots over time\u201d and anticipated continued development of the Property. <em>Id. </em>at 143. The estimate under \u00a7 506, on the other hand, was based on an appraisal of the present fair market value of the Property. As a result, Cavu/Rock did not assume inconsistent positions by presenting two .different valuations for two different purposes, nor does the bankruptcy court\u2019s acceptance of a \u00a7 1129 feasibility plan constitute a final judgment on the value of the Property under \u00a7 506. The doctrines of judicial estoppel and res judicata are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\n<em>b. Mechanic\u2019s Lien</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Gold Star argues that the bankruptcy court erred in holding its mechanic\u2019s lien invalid under California law. \u201cA \u2018mechanic\u2019 in this context is one who has supplied materials or labor for the improvement of real property (other than the property\u2019s owner), and includes a contractor.\u201d <em>Howard S. Wright Const. Co. v. BBIC Inv\u2019rs, LLC, </em>136 Cal.App.4th 228, 38 Cal.Rptr.3d 769, 776 (2006). \u201cTo secure obligations owed by the owner to the mechanic pursuant to contract, the mechanic may file a lien on the improved property, which is sometimes referred to as the work of improvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the time Gold Star recorded its lien, California law required that the lien be filed \u201cafter [the mechanic] completes his contract.\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3115, <em>repealed by </em>Stats. 2010, ch. 697 (S.B. 189), \u00a7 16, operative July 1, 2012. \u201c[A] contract is complete for purposes of commencing the recordation period under section 3115 when all work under the contract has been performed, excused, or otherwise discharged.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>38 Cal.Rptr.3d at 779. Here, the bankruptcy court found that Gold Star had not completed its obligations under the development agreement with Cavu/Rock, nor had Gold Star been otherwise discharged or excused, at the time it filed its lien. We find no clear error with this factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Because Gold Star had neither completed its obligations nor been discharged at the time of filing, the bankruptcy court determined that the mechanic\u2019s lien was premature and therefore invalid. This holding is consistent with California law. <em>See Wright, </em>38 Cal.Rptr.3d at 778 (\u201c[Re-cordation was premature, unless the contract was \u2018complete[d]\u2019 within the meaning of section 3115 in some other manner before ... recording.\u201d) (second alteration in original). Therefore, we find no error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">c. <em>Motion to Transfer Venue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Finally, Gold Star argues that the bankruptcy court erred by denying its motion to transfer venue to the Eastern Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>trict of California. Gold Star concedes that venue was proper in the Western District of Texas but argues that the case should have been transferred to the district that encompassed the Property. A bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to transfer a case is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Action Indus., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>358 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2004). Here, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion to transfer and thoroughly analyzed the relevant factors such as judicial economy and the efficient administration of the case, the proximity of creditors, debtors, and witnesses, the location of the assets, and the necessity of ancillary administration. The bankruptcy court concluded that all factors, when considered together, weighed against transferring the case. We hold the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>a. Allowed Unsecured Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Adx\">Cavu/Rock argues that the bankruptcy court erred by allowing Gold Star\u2019s unsecured claim for $743,382.29. \u201cA bankruptcy court\u2019s valuation is largely a question of fact, as to which considerable latitude must be allowed to the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>In re Positive Health Mgmt., </em>769 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the bankruptcy court relied on Gold Star\u2019s construction ledger to determine the amount of the claim. The bankruptcy court confirmed the ledger\u2019s accuracy by cross-referencing it against the invoices and checks exchanged by the parties. In contrast, the bankruptcy court was not able to confirm the accuracy of Cavu/Rock\u2019s own summary. The bankruptcy court\u2019s \u201caccount of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed as a whole.\u201d <em>In re Acosta, </em>406 F.3d 367, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that Gold Star holds an allowable, unsecured claim is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">\n<em>b. Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Cavu/Rock appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s order that each party bear its own costs and attorney\u2019s fees. We review orders regarding attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Cahill, </em>428 F.3d 536, 539 (5th Cir.2005). Here, Cavu/Rock brought an adversary proceeding to declare Gold Star\u2019s lien invalid and to disallow its claim. The bankruptcy court found the lien invalid but allowed the claim. Because the bankruptcy court found for the plaintiff in part and for the defendant in part, it acted within its discretion in its assessment of costs. <em>See In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., </em>756 F.2d 411, 418 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
