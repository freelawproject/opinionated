In challenging the denial of his motion to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>indictment, Avelar contends he was deprived of his roommate\u2019s testimony that officers entered their residence without his roommate\u2019s consent because he was deported before Avelar was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Citing <em>United States v. Roque-Villanueva, </em>the court ruled that even if, <em>ar-guendo, </em>a Fourth Amendment violation occurred, evidence establishing Avelar\u2019s guilt (evidence of his identity), is not suppressible. 175 F.3d 345, 346 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Pineda-Chinchilla, </em>712 F.2d 942, 943-44 (5th Cir.1983) (holding defendant lacked standing to challenge the admissibility of his Alien File).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Avelar maintains <em>Roque-Villanueva </em>was wrongly decided. He also asserts <em>Pineda-Chinchilla </em>violates the rule of orderliness because earlier ease law permitted defendants to challenge the admissibility of evidence despite lacking a possessory or privacy interest. One panel of this court may not overrule the decision of another panel in the absence of an intervening change in law or contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Traxler, </em>764 F.3d 486, 489 (5th Cir.2014), Therefore, <em>Roque-Villanueva </em>is binding precedent. <em>Id.; </em>175 F.3d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
