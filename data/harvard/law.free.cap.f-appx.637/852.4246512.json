California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Staton has filed a response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Staton\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir .2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-21\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Staton\u2019s response, We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw- is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, Sta-ton\u2019s motion for appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-22\">However, the judgment contains a clerical error pertaining to Staton\u2019s conviction for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance, to wit: it identifies the statutes violated as \u201c21 USC \u00a7 846 [21 USC \u00a7 846(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C)]\u201d; the bracketed portion should instead refer to 21 U.S.C \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). We therefore REMAND to the district court for correction of this clerical error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b880-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
