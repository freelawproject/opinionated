Rudzavice, federal prisoner #36844-177, appeals the dismissal of a petition he filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court construed the petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as successive and unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-23\">Rudzavice contends that the district court erred by construing the petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Because the petition sought to challenge Rudzavice\u2019s conviction by arguing that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1470 is unconstitutionally vague, it was properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Because Rudzavice has filed at least one prior \u00a7 2255 motion, and because he neither sought nor obtained this court\u2019s authorization to file another one, dismissal was proper. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452; <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Only in the limited circumstances provided by \u00a7 2255(e) may Rudzavice attack his conviction via \u00a7 2241. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452; \u00a7 2255(e). To do so, he would have to show that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901- (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. The procedural limits on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions do not render \u00a7 2255 ineffective or inadequate. <em>Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. Rudzavice fails to make th\u00e9 allegations or showing required to bring his petition within the ambit of \u00a7 2255(e). The district court correctly determined that the savings clause does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Rudzavice further asserts that the district judge was biased. His conclusional assertions are no more than a disagreement with the judge\u2019s ruling, and he does not show a due process violation. <em>See United States v. Couch, </em>896 F.2d 78, 81-82 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Rudzavice also argues that, before construing his petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court should have given him a warning under <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). <em>Castro </em>pertains to the rechar-acterization of a first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 124 S.Ct. 786. Because the petition was not Rudzavice\u2019s first, the <em>Castro </em>warnings were unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Rudzavice fails to show that the district court erred by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition as a successive and unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion. The judgment is AFFIRMED. \u2022</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
