Hill argues the defendants violated his right to procedural due process when they erroneously identified him as a sex offender, issued warrants against him under Alabama\u2019s Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, and publicized his alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>sex-offender status in a television news segment. The district court dismissed these claims on immunity grounds. Upon review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The defendants are state officials for sovereign-immunity purposes. <em>See Carr v. City of Florence, </em>916 F.2d 1521, 1525 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cA state official may not be sued in his official capacity unless the state has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity ... or Congress has abrogated the state\u2019s immunity.\u201d <em>Lancaster v. Monroe County, Ala., </em>116 F.3d 1419, 1429 (11th Cir.1997) (internal citations omitted). Neither exception applies in this case. The district court therefore did not err in dismissing suit against the defendants in their official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Moreover, qualified immunity limits suit against state officials in their individual capacities. A plaintiff alleging a constitutional violation under \u00a7 1983 can only overcome qualified immunity if \u201c(1) the defendant violated a constitutional right, and (2) this right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1264 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Here, even assuming a due process violation exists, the violation alleged is not \u201cclearly established.\u201d Reputational injury alone is insufficient to invoke the due process clause. <em>Smith ex rel. Smith v. Siegelman, </em>322 F.3d 1290, 1296 (11th Cir.2003). Plaintiffs alleging defamation must also allege a \u201cplus\u201d factor, the deprivation of a \u201cpreviously recognized property or liberty interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1297-98. Hill argues that erroneously-issued warrants establish such a \u201cplus\u201d factor, but he cites no authority for the proposition that the mere issuance of a warrant \u2014 absent arrest or prosecution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 amounts to a deprivation of property or liberty. The district court therefore did not err in dismissing suit against the defendants in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Da-vila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc,, </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1185 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. <em>See Wilson v. Russo, </em>212 F.3d 781, 786-87 (3d Cir.2000) (''[A] plaintiff may.succeed in a \u00a7 1983 action for false arrest made pursuant to a warrant if the plaintiff shows, by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that the police officer knowingly and deliberately, or with a reckless disregard for the truth, made false statements or omissions that create a falsehood in applying for a warrant; and (2) that such statements or omissions are material, or necessary, to the finding of probable cause.\u201d). Here, the warrants at issue were never enforced. The Sheriff's Department withdrew them just two weeks after they were issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
