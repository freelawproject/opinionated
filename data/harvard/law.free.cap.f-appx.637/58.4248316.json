For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">In 2013, Gibson filed an application to proceed in forma pauperis and a proposed complaint, naming as defendants J.P. Harris Associates and Susquehanna Township Taxing Office. A Magistrate Judge recommended granting Gibson\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and screened his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Although the Magistrate Judge found the allegations unclear, she discerned that Gibson sought an order from the District Court directing Susquehanna Township, Pennsylvania, to turn over information on school property taxes from 2011 and 2012. Gibson also complained that the state had no right to levy a school tax and requested an order ending school taxes in Pennsylvania and replacing them with a federal tax on oil and gas companies. In an order entered on September 9, 2014, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report, granted Gibson leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismissed his complaint with prejudice as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Gibson did not appeal this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">Instead, on July 23, 2015, Gibson filed a \u201cmotion to reopen\u201d and a second motion to proceed in forma pauperis. In his motion to reopen, Gibson alleged that a June 2014 report from the Pennsylvania \u201cState Auditor General Office\u201d purportedly found that Susquehanna Township \u201cwasted 7.2 million dollars of people tax money.\u201d Based on this report, Gibson requested that Susquehanna Township repay taxpayers $7.2 million and that a tax be levied on gas and oil companies to replace the school tax in Pennsylvania. In an order entered on July 27, 2015, the District Court summarily denied his motion to proceed in forma pauperis and his motion to reopen, noting that, as it had concluded when dismissing the complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, Gibson\u2019s claims had no basis in fact or law and were entirely frivolous. Gibson filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 -1291,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order if the appeal does not raise a substantial- question. 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. We may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>See Erie Telecomms., Inc. v. City of Erie, </em>853 F.2d 1084, 1089 n. 10 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">We construe Gibson\u2019s motion to reopen as seeking relief \u2022 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2), which allows a litigant to obtain relief from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>final judgment based <em>on </em>\u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, we review orders denying Rule 60(b) motions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jackson v, Dan-berg, </em>656 F.3d 157, 162 (3d Cir.2011). An appeal from the denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review. <em>See Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), a district court has discretion to reopen a judgment only if the newly discovered evidence is material and \u201cwould probably have changed the outcome\u201d of the proceedings. <em>See Bohus v. Beloff, </em>950 F.2d 919, 930 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The District Court initially dismissed Gibson\u2019s complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) because his request to stop Pennsylvania school taxes lacked any basis in fact or law. Gibson\u2019s claim in his motion to reopen that a June 2014 report allegedly found that Susquehanna Township somehow misused $7.2 million of taxpayer money does not change the District Court\u2019s analysis that Gibson\u2019s claims were factually and legally frivolous. Indeed, Gibson made similar claims in his objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which the District Court determined were without merit. In addition, Gibson\u2019s motion to reopen reasserts his requests to end school taxes and levy taxes against oil and gas companies. These allegations are insufficient to warrant the \u201cextraordinary relief\u2019 afforded by Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Bohus, </em>950 F.2d at 930 (\u201cWe view Rule 60(b) motions as \u2018extraordinary relief which should be granted only where extraordinary justifying circumstances are present.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted). Therefore, we conclude that the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Gibson\u2019s motion to reopen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\">. To the extent that Gibson seeks to challenge the District Court\u2019s September 9, 2014 order dismissing his complaint as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), we lack jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely with regard to that order. Pursuant to Rule 4(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a notice of appeal in a civil case in which the United States is not a party must be filed within 30 days of the date of entry of the judgment or order appealed. Gibson's notice of appeal was filed after the District Court entered its order dismissing the complaint. Although the time to appeal may be tolled if, within 28 days of entry of judgment, a party files a motion pursuant to Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App, P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi), Gibson\u2019s motion to reopen was filed well beyond that time frame.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-5\">. Although Gibson did not cite Rule 60(b)(2) in his motion to reopen, he expressly moved to reopen his case \"on the legal gro[unds] that a case m[a]y be reopened should new information to the case [be] f[ou]nd,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">. To the extent Gibson\u2019s motion to reopen could be construed as seeking relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), it similarly fails. Rule 60(b)(6) permits a litigant to move for relief from judgment for \"any other reason that justifies relief.\u201d A litigant moving under Rule 60(b)(6) must show \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify reopening of a final judgment. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 535, 125 S.Ct., 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Gibson has not presented any extraordinary reasons why his District Court proceeding should be reopened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-21\">.To the extent Gibson also appeals the denial of his July 23, 2015 motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we note that the District Court had already granted Gibson leave to proceed in forma pauperis in its order entered on September 9, 2014. Accordingly, Gibson\u2019s second motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis was unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
