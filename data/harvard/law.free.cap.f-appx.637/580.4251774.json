Gamino contends the district court failed to demonstrate that it considered all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, particularly those\u2019 that supported a sentence reduction. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> satisfied the two-step test by first determining that Gamino was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 and second declining to reduce Gamino\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780, 781 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s failure to specifically discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors upon which Gamino\u2019s motion relied is not a basis for reversal \u201cas long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). The order specifically states that the district court considered Gamino\u2019s motion, the Government\u2019s response, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that the district court denied the motion due to \u201cthe seriousness of the offense and the participation of [Gamino].\u201d Notwithstanding Gamino\u2019s desire that the district court weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors differently, the record demonstrates that the district court considered the pertinent factors. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23; <em>of. United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe do not reweigh relevant factors... -. \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-17\">.
