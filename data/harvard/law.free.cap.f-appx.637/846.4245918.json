In particular, Solorzano-Maquilon contends that the district court disregarded the guidelines range of 15 to 21 months in fashioning his sentence. He further disagrees with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Our highly deferential review of the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is limited to determining whether Solorzano-Maquilon\u2019s above-guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 475 (5th Cir.2010).. We will not presume that a sentence is unreasonable merely because it falls outside the advisory guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">The sentencing transcript reflects that the district court expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 including the circumstances of the instant offense, Solorzano-Maquilon\u2019s personal and criminal history, and the interests of public safety and deterrence \u2014 in light of the facts of the case and that, contrary to his assertion, the court utilized the Guidelines as \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d for its sentencing decision. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49, 128 S.Ct. 586. To the extent the district court elected to vary upwards .from the guidelines range, its reasons for doing so were expressly grounded in the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. To that end, Solorzano-Maquilon fails to show that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision did not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represented a clear error of judgment in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">Solorzano-Maquilon\u2019s argument otherwise amounts merely to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the sentencing factors. However, we will not. second-guess the reasonable findings of the district court, which \u201cis in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to \u00e1 particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Heard, </em>709 F.3d 413, 435 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">On the record before us, Solorzano-Maquilon fails to show that the district court abused its broad discretion in imposing a 27-month above-guidelines sentence following his guilty plea to illegal reentry. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Key, </em>599 F.3d at 475. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
