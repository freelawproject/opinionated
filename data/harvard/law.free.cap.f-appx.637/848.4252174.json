By seeking to proceed IFP, Crocker is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith \u2022because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-19\">Crocker claims the district court misapplied the amendment and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; he explains that because he received a sentence at the low end of the guideline range applicable at sentencing, he should now receive a sentence at the low end of his new guideline range and that the court ignored evidence of his rehabilitation. The court correctly recognized that Crocker was eligible for a reduction and that the sentence was within the new guideline range. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7); U.S.S.G., Ch. 5, Pt. A. The court denied Crocker\u2019s motion as a matter of discretion, referring to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in general and the seriousness of the offense and the danger posed to the community by Crocker in particular. Moreover, the court had before it Crocker\u2019s arguments in favor of a reduction and documentation regarding his efforts at rehabilitation in prison. Crocker has not demonstrated that there is a non-frivolous issue as to abuse of discretion in denying the reduction. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-24\">Referring to his original sentencing, Crocker contends that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level based on his leadership role in the offense. But \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not the appropriate vehicle to challenge purported errors at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-25\">This appeal does not present a nonfrivo-lous issue and has not been brought in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b876-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
