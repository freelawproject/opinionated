As the appeal lacks an arguable basis in law or in fact, we will dismiss it as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">Rushing is a state prisoner housed at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center (\u201cPICC\u201d). Rushing was arrested and charged in May 2014 for crimes under Pennsylvania law. While detained and awaiting trial, Rushing filed a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, President Judge Sheila Woods-Skipper and Judge Roxanne Covington of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, attorney Michael Benz of the Philadelphia Defender Association, and attorney Sean Page.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">Rushing alleged that he was being held under unjust laws, charges, and time by the Commonwealth and \u201cthe CJC judges holding [him].\u201d Dkt. # 6, pg. 3. To the extent that it is possible to make out any other cognizable claims in his complaint, Rushing also appeared to allege: that he was denied equal protection of the laws; bias by the trial judge, Judge Covington; ineffective assistance of counsel; and poor and dangerous conditions of confinement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court dismissed his complaint with prejudice as legally frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). It dismissed his claim against the Commonwealth on grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and dismissed his claims against his attorneys because they are not state actors who are subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It dismissed his claims against Judge Covington because she was entitled to \u201cabsolute judicial immunity,\u201d as Rushing\u2019s claims against her were based on acts she took in her judicial capacity. Finally, the District Court dismissed the claims against Philadelphia and President Judge Woods-Skipper for failure to state a claim. The District Court also stated that providing leave to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>would be futile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rushing appeals from this decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction- pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s sua sponte \u2019 dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) is plenary. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). When dismissing claims for failure to state a claim, this standard of review is the same as under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Where a complaint has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that is \u201cplausible on its face[,]\u201d dismissal is appropriate. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A complaint is considered frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). A claim that is based on \u201can indisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a claim that is clearly baseless is deemed frivolous. <em>Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1085 (3d Cir.1995). Examples of frivolous suits include those where defendants are \u201cimmune from suit.\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The District Court correctly dismissed all claims against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Judge Covington, and attorneys Benz and Page. First, states are not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 65, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>see also Callahan v. City of Philadelphia, </em>207 F.3d 668, 670 (3d Cir.2000). Except where states have waived their immunity, the Eleventh Amendment bars all suits against states for alleged deprivations of civil liberties. <em>Will, </em>491 U.S. at 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania did not waive immunity in this suit, and so Rushing\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims could not be brought against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Second, \u201cjudges are immune from suit under section 1983 for monetary damages arising from their judicial acts.\u201d <em>Gallas v. Supreme Ct. of Pa., </em>211 F.3d 760, 768 (3d Cir.2000). Judges are not immune, however, for any actions taken in a non-judicial capacity. <em>Id. </em>To the extent that Rushing even alleged facts against Judge Covington, those facts indicated that she was acting in a judicial capacity. Accordingly, Rushing\u2019s claims could not proceed against Judge Covington.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Finally, attorneys are not subject to \u00a7 1983 claims on the basis that they are officers of the court. This is true whether they are private attorneys or public defenders. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 324-25, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981); <em>see also Angelico </em>v. <em>Lehigh Valley Hosp., Inc., </em>184 F.3d 268, 277 (3d Cir.1999). As such, Rushing\u2019s claims could not proceed against attorneys Benz and Page under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">The District Court was also correct in its dismissal of the City of Philadelphia and President Judge Woods-Skipper for failure to state claims against them. Rushing did not allege any facts that point to the liability of either party. He merely named both parties as defendants, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>then did not state anything further. The closest Rushing comes to alleging facts stating a claim against the City of Philadelphia is on the eleventh page of his complaint. There, he states: \u201cbook library must be open;\u201d \u201cno doctor of psychiatry at mental dept, of K-Block;\u201d that inmates were showering in \u201ccold to luke cold water\u201d in the autumn and winter; and that one of the prison doctors has a \u201cpossible mental illness.\u201d Dkt. #6, pg. 11. However, he raised no basis for Philadelphia\u2019s liability on any of these issues, and claimed no injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Because the District Court dismissed Rushing\u2019s complaint without a discussion of his underlying claims, it did not discuss two of his claims that should have been brought in a habeas petition. As a rule, habeas petitions and \u00a7 1983 complaints are not \u201ccoextensive either in purpose or effect.\u201d Le<em>amer v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 540 (3d Cir.2002). Where a state prisoner seeks to attack the fact or duration of his conviction or sentence, he must seek relief through a habeas petition, not a \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489-91, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>see also Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78-79, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">First, Rushing clearly claimed that he was being held under unjust laws, charges, and time by the Commonwealth and \u201cthe CJC judges holding [him].\u201d We construe this as stating a habeas corpus claim, as he was challenging the very fact of his detention. <em>See Leamer, </em>288 F.3d at 540. Second, to the extent that Rushing was attempting to assert ineffectiveness of counsel claims against his attorneys, those should have been brought in a habeas petition. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Both of these claims also had to have been exhausted in state courts. <em>See Lambert v. Blackwell, </em>387 F.3d 210, 231-32 (3d Cir.2004). These two habeas claims were therefore improperly brought in this \u00a7 1983 action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">In light of the fact that Rushing\u2019s non-habeas claims against all parties were indisputably meritless, we find no error with the District Court\u2019s decision that allowing Rushing leave to amend would have been futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 112-13 (3d Cir.2002). Because Rushing has no arguable legal basis on which to appeal the District Court\u2019s order, we will dismiss the appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-13\">This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-14\">. Rushing\u2019s equal protection claim would have arisen, at a minimum, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. His judicial bias claim would have been based on the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. <em>See Bracy v. Gramley, </em>520 U.S. 899, 905-06, 117 S.Ct. 1793, 138 L.Ed.2d 97 (1997). His conditions of confinement claim would have proceeded under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. After filing his notice of appeal, Rushing did file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, which the district court denied for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-16\">. Since filing this appeal, Rushing has pleaded guilty and been sentenced to between eleven and a half to twenty-three months of prison time. <em>Commonwealth v. Virgil Rushing, </em>Dkt. # CP-51-CR-0006679-2014 (Ct. Common Pleas of Phila. County).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">. The District Court's dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint should not constitute a bar to any collateral attacks by Rushing against his state proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
