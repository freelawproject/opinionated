In 2014, Defendant notified Dr. Stiles that due to his failure to satisfy his payment obligations, Defendant was filing suit in the agreed-upon forum in New York State. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Stiles, along with his wife Tonya Stiles (collectively, \u201cthe Plaintiffs\u201d), filed the present lawsuit in the Middle District of Alabama, alleging that Defendant had violated various disclosure obligations imposed on a lender in a consumer loan transaction by the federal Truth-in-Lending Act and had also acted both negligently and fraudulently, in violation of state law. Plaintiffs sought damages and a declaratory judgment that would \u201cvoid\u201d the loan transaction, as well as any obligation that it imposed on Dr. Stiles to repay the money he had borrowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Based on a forum-selection clause in the agreement that did not include the Middle District of Alabama, Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion, and Dr. and Mrs. Stiles now appeal. After reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">. In 2008, after receiving Defendant\u2019s solicitations for a pre-approved loan, Dr. Stiles decided to finance the payment of substantial taxes he owed. He was told that he could obtain a commercial loan and use as collateral his Opelika, Alabama medical practice, East Alabama Ear Nose and Throat, P.C. To that end, he executed a security agreement granting Defendant, among other things, \u201ca security interest in all of the right, title and interest of Debtor in\u201d his inventory, instruments, equipment, accounts, fixtures and in \u201cAll Property of Debtor.\u201d The promissory note, personal guaranty by Dr. Stiles, and security agreement listed the medical practice\u2019s address and named the \u201cDebtor\u201d as Warren A. Stiles d/b/a Warren .A. Stiles, M.D. Dr. Stiles\u2019 wife was not a party to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">In 2012, Dr. Stiles renewed the loan on what he thought were the same terms as the 2008 loan. He was told that if he failed to sign and return the documents within 24 hours, \u201cthe. deal would fall apart.\u201d He read the documents he received by email and signed and returned them as quickly as possible because he again faced a large tax bill. Mrs. Stiles was not a party to' the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">As with the 2008 agreement, the 2012 agreement names the Debtor as \u201cWarren A. Stiles d/b/a Warren A. Stiles, M.D,\u201d and its terms, in fact, are similar to those found in the 2008 agreement. But although the address attributable to him as the debtor in the 2008 agreement was 1965 1st Avenue, the address attributed to him in the 2012 agreement was 314 Third Ave<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>nue. The \u201cFirst Avenue\u201d address is where Dr. Stiles operates his medical practice; the \u201cThird Avenue\u201d address is the residence for him and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Plaintiffs contend that the presence of Dr. Stiles\u2019 home address on the 2012 document \u201ctransform[ed] the loan from a commercial loan to a consumer loan,\u201d thereby-imposing on Defendant disclosure obligations under the Truth-in-Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601, which obligations Defendant failed to meet. They specifically contend that this transformation occurred because the use of Dr. Stiles\u2019 home address on the document meant that Defendant could now treat the family\u2019s personal residence as collateral, giving Defendant a security interest in Plaintiffs\u2019 home. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that Defendant should have known that the address it listed (on the loan agreement that Dr. Stiles signed) was actually Dr. Stiles\u2019 residential address.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">As noted, the loan agreement also includes a forum-selection clause providing, in relevant part, \u201cVenue for any action brought hereunder, shall be the choice of the Creditor, and shall be limited to either Onondaga County, New York or Broward County, Florida.\u201d So, when Dr. Stiles defaulted on the loan, Defendant informed him that it intended to file a debt-collection action against him in the state court of Onondaga County, New York, and sent him a copy of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">A few days later, Plaintiffs filed this present action against Defendant in the Middle District of Alabama, asserting claims based on Defendant\u2019s failure to comply with TILA, including its failure to accurately identify property subject to the security interest, to make required disclosures about finance charges and the amount financed, and to provide notice of the right to rescind the loan. Plaintiffs further sought a declaratory judgment that the agreement was unlawful and void, and they brought state-law claims of unjust enrichment, negligence, wantonness, fraudulent misrepresentation, and slander of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for <em>forum non conveniens </em>invoking the forum-selection clause in the loan contract, which clause applies to \u201cany action brought hereunder.\u201d The district court found the forum-selection clause enforceable and it therefore dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Plaintiffs appeal and advance three primary arguments in opposition to dismissal of their action: (1) the TILA claims are outside the scope of the forum-selection clause; (2) Mrs. Stiles is not bound by the forum-selection clause because she is not a party to the loan agreement; and (3) the district court misapplied the public-interest factors in its <em>forum, non conveniens </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">II. <em>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">We review a district court\u2019s order of dismissal based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., </em>578 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2009). In addition, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s construction of a contractual forum-selection clause. <em>Global Satellite Commc\u2019n Co. v. Starmill U.K. Ltd., </em>378 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In <em>Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. United States District Gourbfor the Western District of Texas, </em>the Supreme Court held that a motion to dismiss for <em>forum non conveniens </em>is the appropriate means to enforce, in federal litigation, a valid forum-selection clause calling for litigation of disputes in a non-federal forum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 568, 580, 187 L.Ed.2d 487 (2013). Under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>a court has discretion to dismiss a case over which it otherwise has jurisdiction in the interest of convenience, fairness, and judicial economy. <em>See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., </em>549 U.S. 422, 429, 127 S.Ct. 1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 15 (2007). To obtain dismissal based on <em>forum non conveniens, </em>\u201c[t]he moving party must demonstrate that (1) an adequate alternative forum is available, (2) public and private factors weigh in favor of dismissal, and (3) the plaintiff can reinstate his suit in the alternative forum without undue inconvenience or prejudice.\u201d <em>Leon v. Millon Air Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1305, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Here, Plaintiffs do not argue that the forum-selection clause is unenforceable or was entered into as a result of fraud or overreaching.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Lipcon v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>148 F.3d 1285, 1296 (11th Cir.1998) (describing the circumstances under which a forum-selection clause is unenforceable). Nor do they argue that an adequate alternative forum is unavailable or that reinstatement of their suit in that forum would create undue prejudice. They likewise do not challenge the clause\u2019s applicability to their state law claims based on negligence and fraud. Instead, they challenge the applicability of the clause only as to their TILA claims. In addition, they dispute its binding effect on Mrs. Stiles and disagree with the district court\u2019s analysis of the public-interest factors. We first address the scope of the clause before turning to the <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">A. Whether the TILA Claims Fall Within the Scope of the Forum\u2014 Selection Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">To determine if a forum-selection clause encompasses a particular type of claim, we look to its language. <em>Slater v. Energy Servs. Grp. Int\u2019l Inc., </em>634 F.3d 1326, 1330 (11th Cir.2011). According to Plaintiffs, the clause designating venue for \u201cany action brought hereunder\u201d applies only to claims concerning the parties\u2019 con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>tractual obligations. They further argue that because TILA claims relate to Defendant\u2019s duties under a federal statute, not the contractual obligations of the parties, these claims fall outside the scope of the loan agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">We find Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the word \u201chereunder\u201d too restrictive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Generally, \u201chereunder\u201d means \u201c[i]n accordance with this document.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). \u201cAccordance\u201d means \u201cagreement\u201d or \u201cconformity.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New Riverside University Dictionary (1988). These terms suggest that the clause covers not only breach of contract claims but all claims, including statutory claims, that arise from the contractual relationship between the parties.-</p>\n<p id=\"AlN\">Indeed, courts have typically interpreted similar language as not being limited to claims asserting only a breach of contract. <em>See, e.g., Terra Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Miss. Chem. Corp., </em>119 F.3d 688, 693-94 (8th Cir.1997) (finding that \u201chereunder\u201d means \u201cunder this agreement\u201d and encompasses tort claims that are brought parallel to a breach of contract claim);' <em>Cfirstclass Corp. v. Silverjet PLC, </em>560 F.Supp.2d 324, 329-30 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (noting that the phrase \u201call disputes arising hereunder\u201d is similar in scope to the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019); <em>Berry v. Soul Circus, Inc., </em>189 F.Supp.2d 290, 294 (D.Md.2002) (finding that tort claims were covered under a clause stating that \u201cany action hereunder shall be brought within the courts located in the State of Georgia\u201d); <em>Warnaco Inc. v. VF Corp., </em>844 F.Supp. 940, 947-49 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (finding that a clause covering \u201c[a]ny dispute or issue arising hereunder\u201d applied to statutory and tort claims because \u201cthey involved rights and duties arising out of the Termination Agreement\u201d); <em>Pichen v. Minuteman Press Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>854 F.Supp. 909, 911 (N.D.Ga.1993) (\u201cReading the word \u2018hereunder\u2019 to apply only to a pure breach of contract claim between the parties would be unduly crabbed and narrow. \u2018Hereunder\u2019 refers to the relations that have arisen as a result of this contract.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Indeed, in <em>Slater v. Energy Services Group International, Inc., </em>634 F.3d 1326, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2011), we held that plaintiff-employee\u2019s suit asserting federal statutory rights under Title VII was within the scope of a forum-selection clause in an employment contract applicable to \u201call \u2022claims or causes of actions relating to or arising from the employment agreement.\u201d In doing so, we rejected plaintiffs argument that the clause encompassed \u201conly breach-of-contract claims directly relating to the employment agreement.\u201d <em>See also Coastal Steel Corporation v. Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd., </em>709 F.2d 190, 203 (3d Cir.1983) (finding that tort claims are covered by a forum-selection clause when the claims \u201cultimately depend on the existence of a contractual relationship\u201d between the parties), <em>overruled on other grounds by Lauro Lines v. Chasser, </em>490 U.S. 495, 109 S.Ct. 1976, 104 L.Ed.2d 548 (1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>We find the above reasoning persuasive. And because Defendant\u2019s alleged obligations under TILA, if any, assume the existence of a contract that lacks the necessary disclosures mandated by that statute, we therefore interpret \u201chereunder\u201d to encompass Plaintiffs\u2019 TILA claims. Indeed, although Plaintiffs insist that their TILA claims seek to enforce a statutory duty of disclosure that is independent from any contractual obligation owed by Defendant, they implicitly acknowledge that these TILA claims are viable only if a court accepts Plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the contract: specifically, that the 2012 loan agreement created a consumer loan, not a commercial one. In short, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is appropriately considered an action brought under the loan agreement because it will require a court to construe the operation and effect of the contract\u2019s terms. <em>See Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci Am., Inc., </em>858 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir.1988) (\u2018Whether a forum selection clause applies to tort claims depends on whether resolution of the claims relates to interpretation of the contract.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Moreover, a reading of \u201chereunder\u201d to encompass Plaintiffs\u2019 TILA claims makes practical sense given that the forum-selection clause clearly applies to Plaintiffs\u2019 fraud and negligence claims, which claims are based on the same core facts and essentially the same legal argument as the TILA claims. Specifically, these fraud and negligence claims will also require a court to construe the contract to decide, as a legal matter, whether Defendant entered into a commercial or consumer loan with Dr. Stiles. Without a determination that a consumer loan resulted from the parties\u2019 dealings, Dr. Stiles\u2019 argument that he was deceived into signing a consumer loan disguised as a commercial loan will presumably go nowhere, and if that is so, any assertion that Defendant had a duty to make TILA disclosures will thereby be similarly impacted. Thus, many, if not all, of the same facts underlie both the TILA and fraud-related claims. And notably, if Plaintiffs were to succeed on their argument here, claims predicated on the same facts and legal arguments would be litigated in different forums, with the TILA claims being litigated in Alabama and all other claims by Dr. Stiles being litigated in Onondaga County, New York. Such a result would eviscerate the parties\u2019 bargained-for choice of forum to litigate any action brought under the loan agreement. <em>See Pichen, </em>854 F.Supp. at 911-12 (noting that \u201ca restrictive reading [of \u2018hereunder\u2019] would frustrate commercial reliance on such clauses which are encouraged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In short, we conclude that the forum-selection clause agreed to by both parties to the contract applies to the claims asserted in Plaintiffs\u2019 present lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">B. Whether Mrs. Stiles Is Bound by the Forum-Selection Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">We next consider whether Mrs. Stiles, who is not a party to the loan agreement, must also litigate her claims in the chosen forum. \u201cIn order to bind a non-party to a forum selection clause, the party must be closely related to the dispute such that it becomes foreseeable that it will be bound.\u201d <em>Lipcon, </em>148 F.3d at 1299 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Hugel v. Corp. of Lloyd\u2019s, </em>999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>F.2d 206, 209 (7th Cir.1993)). A third party is bound by a forum-selection clause where the party\u2019s rights are \u201ccompletely derivative of those of the [signing party]\u2014 and thus \u2018directly related to, if not predicated upon\u2019 the interests of the [signing party].\u201d <em>Lipcon, </em>148 F.3d at 1299 (quoting <em>Dayhoff Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co., </em>86 F.3d 1287,1297 (3d Cir.1996)). <em>See also Manetti-Farrow, </em>858 F.2d at 514 n. 5 (\u201c[A] range of transaction participants, parties and non-parties, should benefit from and be subject to forum selection clauses.\u201d (quoting <em>Clinton v. Janger, </em>583 F.Supp. 284, 290 (N.D.Ill.1984))).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Plaintiffs repeat them argument that Mrs. Stiles\u2019 TILA claims arise from Defendant\u2019s failure to comply with its statutory duties under that statute, not its contractual obligations to Dr. Stiles. And because Mrs. Stiles is not a, party to the loan agreement, Plaintiffs contend she cannot be bound by the forum-selection clause. But Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is circular. Defendant, the lender, presumably owed disclosure obligations only to those in a position to receive such disclosures: in other words, only to a party to the agreement, As Mrs, Stiles was not a signatory to her husband\u2019s loan agreement nor in any way a party to that contract, she would appear to face a threshold problem in pursuing remedies, statutory or otherwise, against Defendant. But assuming that Mrs. Stiles has some viable claim against Defendant under TILA, any such claim is predicated on the same facts as her husband\u2019s claims. Therefore, her claims are derivative of and directly related to her husband\u2019s, and she is bound by the forum-selection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">C. The District Court\u2019s Forum Non Conveniens Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Having decided that all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are covered by the forum-selection clause, we turn to the <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis. When there is a valid forum-selection clause in a contract, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that dismissal of the complaint is unwarranted, and a court may weigh only public interest factors in determining if a plaintiff has met this burden. <em>See Atl. Marine, </em>134 S.Ct. at 581-83. \u201cOnly under extraordinary \u2022 circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties\u201d should a court decline to enforce a forum-selection clause. <em>Id. </em>at 581; <em>see also GDG Acquisitions, LLC v. Gov\u2019t of Belize, </em>749 F.3d 1024, 1028 (11th Cir.2014) (explaining that \u201can enforceable forum-selection clause carries near-determinative weight\u201d in a <em>forum non conve-niens </em>analysis). So long as the district court considered all relevant factors, and its balancing of the factors was reasonable, we will give substantial deference to the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 257, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the district court did not summarily conclude that the public-interest factors required dismissal. The court correctly noted that. the public factors relevant to this action include \u201cthe administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion [and] the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\u201d <em>Atl. Marine, </em>134 S.Ct. at 581 n. 6. In short, the court weighed these factors, and ultimately found that the interest of justice would be best served by holding the parties to their bargain. Moreover, as the district court noted, Plaintiffs\u2019 present claims could be asserted as counterclaims in the pending New York suit. The court therefore correctly identified no extraordinary circumstance that should override the valid forum-selection clause. For all the above reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s ruling that the clause should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>IV. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. Defendant notes the absence of any evidence that it ever recorded a mortgage or otherwise obtained a security interest on Dr. Stiles\u2019 residence. Defendant further avers that Dr. Stiles was the source of the address that was placed on the 2012 agreement. Ultimately, any dispute about the actual existence of a security interest or Dr. Stiles\u2019 role in supplying this address to Defendant is not material to the narrow issue before us on appeal: whether the forum-selection clause in the agreement may be enforced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\"><em>. </em>Although the Supreme Court decided <em>Atlantic Marine </em>in the context of a transfer motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), the Court noted that \"the same standards should apply to motions to dismiss for <em>fonim non conveniens </em>in cases involving valid forum-selection clauses pointing to state or foreign forums.\u201d 134 S.Ct. at 583 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The parties do not dispute that the forum-selection clause here calls for litigation in a non-federal forum. We therefore proceed on that assumption and do not consider whether the clause laying venue in \"either Onondaga County, New York or Broward County, Florida\u201d could also be read to encompass federal courts in those counties. <em>Cf. Global Satellite, </em>378 F.3d at 1272-74 (finding a forum-selection clause laying venue in Broward County, Florida, ambiguous \"because it name[d] only a geographical unit, host to several forums,\u201d without specifying a particular court in that county).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-15\">. While Plaintiffs contend that the loan agreement itself is void due to Defendant\u2019s allegedly fraudulent conduct, they do not argue that these general allegations of fraud render the forum-selection clause unenforceable. Nor would they fare well if they did. Our precedent provides that a plaintiff seeking to avoid enforcement of a forum-selection clause based on fraud must show that \"the choice clause itself was included in the contract due to fraud,\u201d not simply that there is a dispute regarding fraud arising from the transaction. <em>See Lipcon, </em>148 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b588-5\">. Although, the contract provides that Florida law governs, we have been unable to find a Florida case that construes the term \"hereunder\u201d as it is used in the contract in this case. For this reason, we turn to other sources.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\">. Plaintiffs rely on <em>Bahamas Sales Associate, LLC v. Byers, </em>701 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.2012), but that case is factually and legally distinguishable. In <em>Byers, </em>the defendant-debtor was sued on a note he executed pursuant to a real estate purchase contract that contained a forum-selection clause designating venue in the Bahamas for any legal action related to the lot-purchase contract. The defendant-debtor filed a counterclaim against entities that were not parties to the lot purchase contract, alleging their commission of fraud in connection with appraisal of the property. On these facts, we concluded that the forum-selection clause did not apply to the counterclaim, given the fact that the entities sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>under the counterclaim (and who were seeking enforcement of the clause) were not parties to the lot purchase contract giving rise to the clause and the fact that the claimed appraisal fraud had no direct relationship with the purchase contract. <em>Id. </em>at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Here, by contrast, Defendant is clearly a party to the agreement containing the forum-selection clause and, as we have explained <em>infra, </em>any disclosure obligations imposed by TILA necessarily presume the existence of an agreement that omitted the specified disclosures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
