In the brief filed in support of his petition, petitioner argues that the BIA and IJ erred in finding he did not establish a nexus between his asserted persecution and a statutorily protected ground, \u201cmembership in a particular social group.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA) \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). He also argues that the IJ erred in finding that his testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2006). This Court \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as a matter of right.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1249-50. This is true even where the BIA has elected to address an issue <em>sua sponte. Id. </em>at 1250-51. The petitioner must have argued \u201cthe core issue on appeal\u201d before the BIA, and although the exhaustion requirement does not mandate well-developed arguments and precise legal terminology, it requires the petitioner \u201cprovide information sufficient to enable the BIA to review and correct any errors below.\u201d <em>Indrawati v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>779 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir.2015). \u201cUnadorned, conclusory statements do not satisfy this requirement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">However, we do not have jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s argument that the agency erred in finding he had not established a nexus between his fear of persecution and the statutory grounds of his membership in a particular social group. In both his notice of appeal and his brief to the BIA, petitioner only argued that the IJ incorrectly made an adverse credibility ruling. Because he did not argue the core issue of nexus on appeal to the BIA, and only made a conclusory statement that was insufficient to allow the BIA to review and correct any errors as to the issue of nexus, he did not exhaust the argument, and this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>finding that he had not, in fact, met the nexus requirement. <em>Indrawati, </em>779 F.3d at 1297; <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">When the BIA issues a separate decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, <em>1284 (11th </em>Cir. 2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court, however, will not review the IJ\u2019s decision as to an issue not addressed by the BIA. <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355-56, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Here, the BIA did not address IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Instead, the BIA assumed, for purposes of its decision, that petitioner\u2019s testimony was credible. Because the BIA did not address or expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, we cannot review the IJ\u2019s decision on that issue. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Accordingly, we deny the petition as that claim. <em>Lopez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\">. The particular group appears to be petitioner's family. His father owned a business in Guerrero, Mexico, and a criminal group, known as Los Zetas, insisted that his father pay them law large sums of money. His father refused, and criminals kidnapped him. Petitioner and his siblings paid the criminals the ransom they demanded for their father's return, but after accepting the money, they killed him,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
