Martinez contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying the motion for a sentence reduction. Specifically, he asserts that the district court incorrectly assessed the facts of his case, namely, that he had been in and out of prison since the age of 17, that he had been involved in gang activity, and that he had continually returned to drug crimes upon release from prison. Martinez further argues that the district court overstated the seriousness of his offense, his criminal history, and his potential to reof-fend. Finally, he contends that the district court failed to adequately consider mitigating facts, including, his personal history, his cooperation with the Government, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-22\">The district court is under no obligation to reduce a sentence in response to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). Our review of the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). If the record reflects that the district court gave due consideration to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a whole and considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, even implicitly, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-23\">The record shows that the district court considered the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and the motion for reconsideration, Martinez\u2019s original and reduced guidelines ranges, and the information from Martinez\u2019s original sentencing, including, his criminal history and the details of the instant drug offense. Nevertheless, the district court determined that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and relevant public safety concerns under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(ii)), p.s. weighed against exercising its discretion to reduce Martinez\u2019s sentence. This determination is supported by the record. Accordingly, Martinez has failed to demon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>state that the district court abused its discretion by denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717; <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
