For the reasons stated below, we dismiss Brenham\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">The noncompliance determinations at issue in this appeal arise from Brenham\u2019s response to the following incident. On April 12, 2013, two certified nurse assistants (CNA Q and CNA R) discovered that a cognitively impaired 101-year-old resident (Resident 4) had extensive bruising covering much of her body, as .well as swelling in some areas. The CNAs reported the bruising to a charge nurse (LVN B), who was \u201cstunned\u201d and immediately informed Brenham\u2019s Director of Nursing (DON); LVN B subsequently completed an incident report. The DON told surveyors he initially thought that the bruising was caused by a hematological disorder, but ruled out the possibility after reviewing Resident 4\u2019s laboratory results, ordered four days after the bruising was discovered. He then surmised that the bruising was caused by a Hoyer Lift, a device used to transfer debilitated pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>tients. Resting on this causation theory, Brenham\u2019s management did not report the bruising to state officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">State surveyors, inspecting Brenham on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), discovered Resident 4\u2019s bruising and the aftermath during a survey that began on April 22, 2013. They reported that Brenham was noncom-pliant, at an \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d level, with the following regulations: (1) 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(c), requiring Brenham to \u201cdevelop and implement\u201d policies to prevent \u201cmistreatment, neglect, and abuse of residents\u201d; (2) 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(c)(2)-(4), requiring Brenham to report and thoroughly investigate suspicions of abuse and neglect; and (3) 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.75, requiring Brenham to \u201ceffectively and efficiently\u201d administer the facility to promote resident well-being. Acting on the surveyors\u2019 findings, CMS initially imposed per instance civil monetary penalties (CMPs) totaling $8,500. Five days later, however, CMS rescinded the per instance penalties and replaced them with per-day penalties totaling $84,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Brenham filed an administrative appeal challenging both the noncompliance determinations and the resulting CMPs. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld CMS\u2019s enforcement actions. DHHS\u2019s Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) affirmed. Having exhausted its administrative remedies, Brenham timely appealed to this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">This court has jurisdiction to review the imposition of civil monetary penalties pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conduct our review according to the deferential standards of the Administrative Procedure Act and will uphold \u201cagency actions, findings, and conclusions\u201d unless they are \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law' or \u2018unsupported by substantial evidence.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the Secretary\u2019s factual findings, \u201cif supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Brenham challenges the violations as unsupported by substantial evidence. Alternatively, Brenham contends that CMS\u2019s immediate jeopardy findings are clearly erroneous, and further, that the penalty amounts selected within the applicable ranges are unreasonable. Finally, Bren-ham claims that the increased, per-day penalties arising from CMS\u2019s revision of the CMPs violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">Substantial evidence exists on the record as a whole to support the Secretary\u2019s determination that Brenham was not in substantial compliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(c), \u00a7 483.13(c)(2)-(4), and \u00a7 483.75. Substantial compliance is \u201ca level of compliance with the requirements of participation such that any identified defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ciencies pose no greater risk to resident health or safety than the potential for causing minimal harm.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We address each noncompliance determination separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">1. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Federal law requires skilled nursing facilities to \u201cdevelop and implement written policies and procedures that prohibit mistreatment, neglect, and abuse of residents.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Brenham insists on appeal that it substantially complied with \u00a7 483.13(c) because there is no evidence of abuse or neglect and it had anti-abuse policies in place, which it implemented through training.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Whether Resident 4\u2019s bruising was potentially linked to abuse or neglect is at the heart of this appeal. Brenham claims that it is \u201cuncontested\u201d that Resident 4\u2019s bruising was due either to a hematological disorder or pressure from a Hoyer Lift. But Brenham mischaracterizes the record; the surveyor testimony Brenham references only notes that Brenham asserted these theories. Brenham also cites a surveyor worksheet that states \u201cthere are no identified concerns\u201d regarding the requirement that residents be \u201cfree from unexplained physical injuries\u201d and \u201cresident abuse.\u201d But Brenham omits surveyor testimony explaining that the worksheet is prepared on initial rounds and does not represent complete review. As the DAB stated, copious survey notes \u201cevidence[] .., clear concern about the unexplained source of the bruising and the potential for abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">The ALJ ultimately rejected Brenham\u2019s causation theories, deeming them \u201chypotheses\u201d that were \u201cnot grounded in fact.\u201d The DAB affirmed, citing the following undisputed evidence: (1) though Resident 4\u2019s Woodwork indicated her Wood cell counts were slightly low, Brenham\u2019s management ruled out a hematological disorder as a possible cause; (2) CNA Q told surveyors that Brenham\u2019s DON instructed her to corroborate the Hoyer Lift causation theory, but CNA Q and CNA R nevertheless denied transferring Resident' 4 with a Hoyer Lift; (3) LVN B told surveyors that Hoyer Lift equipment was not present in Resident 4\u2019s room; (4) Resident 4\u2019s care plan did \u201cnot address transfers at all, much less call for use of a Hoyer Lift\u201d; and (5) both Resident 4\u2019s physician and Brenham\u2019s medical director opined that the bruising should have been reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">Brenham nevertheless contends that the ALJ and DAB improperly discounted its expert testimony supporting Brenham\u2019s causation theories. But as the DAB noted, the expert testimony fails to address undisputed record evidence and is, as both the ALJ and DAB noted, often inconsistent with such evidence. We cannot say that the DAB\u2019s affirmance of the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount the expert testimony was improper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, Brenham\u2019s Hoyer Lift theory, even if accepted, does not rule out the possibility that staff improperly used the device in an abusive or neglectful manner. We accordingly affirm the DAB\u2019s conclusion that Brenham was obligated to treat Resident 4\u2019s bruising as potentially linked to abuse or neglect; substantial evidence indicates the bruising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>was, at the least, an injury of unknown origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">This leads us to the further determination that Brenham was not in substantial compliance with \u00a7 483.13(c)\u2019s requirement to implement policies to protect residents from abuse and neglect. In its argument to the contrary, Brenham fails to recognize that \u201cimplement\u201d is not limited to training<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and indeed, as the DAB noted, the cited deficiency was largely grounded in Brenham\u2019s failure to effectuate its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Brenham\u2019s \u201cAccidents and Incidents\u201d policy, which incorporates state standards regarding suspicions of abuse, requires Brenham to immediately report and investigate suspected neglect or abuse, including \u201cinjuries of an unknown source.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the DAB noted, Brenham\u2019s \u201cFacility Abuse Prohibition\u201d policy similarly requires Brenham \u201cto develop and implement a systematic process to investigate allegations of abuse, neglect and/or exploitation so that such events can be accurately and timely investigated and reported to the proper authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">It is uncontested that Brenham did not immediately report the injury. Moreover, as explained in further detail \u2022 in the \u00a7 483.13(c)(3) analysis below, the DAB\u2019s conclusion that Brenham\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d was cursory and thus far from a \u201csystematic process\u201d is supported by the record, as is the overall conclusion that Brenham failed to protect its residents from possible neglect or abuse. Brenham\u2019s only response is that the policies were not triggered insofar as Brenham \u201cmade the -reasonable business and professional conclusion\u201d that Resident 4\u2019s bruising was not attributable to abuse or neglect or an \u201cinjury of unknown origin[].\u201d Because we reject that premise, we affirm the DAB\u2019s noncompliance determinations respecting \u00a7 483.13(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">2. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(c)(2)-(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">[2] Substantial evidence also supports the Secretary\u2019s noncompliance findings regarding \u00a7 483.13(c)(2)-(4). These provisions provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-13\">(2) The facility must ensure that all alleged violations involving mistreatment, neglect, or abuse, including injuries of unknown source ... are reported immediately to the administrator of the facility and to other officials in accordance with State law____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-15\">(3) The facility must have evidence that all alleged violations are thoroughly investigated, and must prevent further potential abuse while the investigation is in progress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-16\">(4) The results of all investigations must be reported to the administrator or his designated representative and to other officials in accordance with State law (including to the State survey and certification agency) within 5 working days of the incident....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">Given our conclusion that Resident 4\u2019s bruising was, at minimum, an injury of unknown source, and the undisputed fact that Brenham did not timely report the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>incident or the results of its preliminary investigation, we affirm the DAB\u2019s noncompliance determination regarding \u00a7\u00a7 483.13(c)(2) and (c)(4)\u2019s reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Regarding \u00a7 483.13(c)(3), the ALJ found that \u201c[t]here is no evidence showing\u201d that Brenham \u201cinitiate[d] an extensive investigation into the causes of Resident # 4\u2019s bruising or even into the extent and seriousness of the resident\u2019s injuries.\u201d Brenham claims that it \u201cdid investigate and take appropriate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The evidence is largely undisputed; the parties only dispute whether Brenham\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d satisfied \u00a7 483.13(c)(3). The record evidence shows that Brenham prepared a two-page incident report, indicating no suspicion of abuse or neglect, and obtained a one-paragraph statement from CNA Q recounting her discovery of the bruising and subsequent report to LVN B. The record does not show, as the ALJ and DAB noted, that Brenham coordinated an investigation, interviewed its staff, identified persons with access to Resident 4, or followed up on the possibility of abuse or neglect once its causation theories proved baseless. Brenham\u2019s expert testimony, concluding that Brenham complied with \u00a7 483.13(c)(3), does not undercut the DAB\u2019s conclusion; it contains only the eonclusory assertion that \u201c[a]n investigation was completed and the outcome of that internal investigation indicated the cause of Resident #4\u2019s bruising was from the Hoyer Lift sling, not from any \u2018unknown origins\u2019 or from abuse or neglect.\u201d We note further that a state surveyor did not concede compliance with \u00a7 483.13(c)(3) as Brenham claims; rather, the surveyor merely acknowledged Bren-ham\u2019s incident report and the CNA\u2019s statement, but noted that she would \u201chave expected them to take it further than that____You know, do a much [sic] thorough investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">We conclude that the DAB\u2019s conclusion affirming the ALJ\u2019s \u00a7 483.13(c)(3) noncompliance determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">3. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.75</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Finally, Brenham was cited for violating 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.75, which requires any skilled nursing facility to \u201cbe administered in a manner that enables it to use its resources effectively and efficiently to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial w\u00e9ll-being of each resident.\u201d The ALJ found this deficiency was supported by the lack of reporting and adequate investigation, as well as Brenham\u2019s failure to timely notify Resident 4\u2019s treating physician or the facility\u2019s medical director of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">As discussed above, there was evidence that the investigation was inadequate. We note that there is some dispute regarding when Resident 4\u2019s physician was notified. The incident report prepared on April 12, 2013 states \u201cphysician notified,\u201d though Resident 4\u2019s physician told surveyors he was informed of the bruising eleven days after the bruising\u2019s discovery, while the survey was ongoing. Absent evidence to corroborate the incident report, the ALJ found the \u201cphysician\u2019s own recollection\u201d the \u201cbest and most credible evidence.\u201d Brenham does not challenge ALJ\u2019s determination in this regard and in any event, substantial evidence supports the \u00a7 483.75 deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">Brenham further challenges the resulting CMPs. CMS assessed a $6,600 per-day immediate jeopardy level penalty for the period from April 22, 2013 through April 25, 2013, and a $2,000 per-day non-immediate jeopardy level penalty for the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>from April 26, 2013 through May 24, 2013, when CMS concluded that Brenham remedied the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Brenham first argues that the immediate jeopardy findings are clearly erroneous because Resident 4\u2019s bruises had begun to heal by the time of the survey. \u201cImmediate jeopardy\u201d is defined as \u201ca situation in which the provider\u2019s noncompliance with one or more requirements of participation has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a resident.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The DAB rejected Brenham\u2019s argument, concurring in the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the immediate jeopardy determination was not premised on Resident 4\u2019s bruising, but rather on Bren-ham\u2019s deficient response to the incident and the resulting risk of future abuse or neglect to Resident 4 and Brenham\u2019s other residents. Brenham does not challenge this reasoning and we find no clear error regarding the DAB\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">We further affirm the DAB\u2019s conclusion that the penalties selected from the applicable penalty ranges are reasonable. The regulations permit penalties in a range of $3,050 to $10,000 per day for immediate jeopardy level noncompliance and $50 to $3,000 per day for \u201cdeficiencies that do not constitute immediate jeopardy, but either caused actual harm, or caused no actual harm, but have the potential for more than minimal harm.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In determining the appropriate penalty, CMS considered, as it must: (1) the facility\u2019s history of noncompliance, (2) the facility\u2019s financial condition, (3) the factors specified in \u00a7 488.404, and (4) the facility\u2019s degree of culpability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The factors in \u00a7 488.404 address the scope and severity of the deficiencies and the interrelationship among cited deficiencies.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Relying on the \u201cextremely serious\u201d nature of Brenham\u2019s noncompliance as well as its culpability, the ALJ concluded that the CMPs were reasonable under the statutory factors. The ALJ highlighted that Brenham\u2019s failures jeopardized not only Resident 4, but also Brenham\u2019s other residents. Further, the ALJ noted that Bren-ham \u201cignored the possibility of abuse,\u201d instead relying on unsupported hypotheses, and cited the undisputed fact that Brenham\u2019s DON requested CNA Q to support the Hoyer Lift theory, despite her denial regarding its use. The ALJ concluded that these facts justified the penalties, even crediting Brenham\u2019s history of compliance. It further noted that Bren-ham provided no evidence regarding its financial condition, though CMS provided an opportunity for it to do so. The DAB adopted the ALJ\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">We conclude that the DAB\u2019s determination as to the reasonableness of the CMPs is not arbitrary or capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence. Brenham\u2019s response, coupled with the effect of that response\u2014the possibility that Brenham residents were exposed to future abuse or neglect with little protection from management\u2014renders the DAB\u2019s weighing of the statutory factors reasonable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">In passing, Brenham contends that DHHS\u2019s revision of CMPs, increasing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>penalties from per-instance fines to per-day fines, violates due process. That DHHS initially imposed a lower, per-instance penalty does not by itself amount to a due process violation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor is it the case that DHHS committed a \u201ctaking\u201d merely by its letter notifying Brenham of the increased penalties. That letter did not purport to immediately collect the penalty before a hearing, as Brenham seemingly implies. Rather, it apprised Bren-ham of its rights to challenge the CMPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Insofar as Brenham claims it was not given adequate notice of the final penalties, CMS\u2019s statement of deficiencies provided Brenham with ample notice of the claimed violations, the facts supporting the violations, and the immediate jeopardy findings. Brenham\u2019s due process argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">For the foregoing reasons, w\u00e9 DISMISS Brenham\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
