He was sentenced within the guidelines range to 84 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Koss raises two issues on appeal. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because there was no direct proof that he voluntarily agreed to participate in the drug conspiracy. Additionally, he argues that the district court proeedurally erred by failing to explain why it imposed a two-level adjustment, as opposed to a four-level adjustment, based on his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Ordinarily, we review sufficiency of the evidence by considering \u201cwhether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir.2007). However, because Koss did not preserve his sufficiency challenge, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>690 F.3d 330, 336 and n. 6 (5th Cir.2012). Under plain error review, we will reverse for insufficient evidence only if there is a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe record is <em>devoid of evidence </em>pointing to guilt or ... the evidence is so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 331 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">We find no manifest miscarriage of justice in this case. <em>Id. </em>Considering the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, giving the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences and credibility choices,\u201d <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>498 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Koss knowingly participated in furthering the objectives of the conspiracy by providing, inter alia, financial assistance to his family\u2019s marijuana distribution scheme, <em>see United States v. Wallace, </em>759 F.3d 486, 491 (5th Cir.2014).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">As for Koss\u2019s challenge to his sentence, it is unavailing; the district court did not commit procedural error. Not only is the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a reduction for minimal participant status entitled to great deference, <em>United States v. Devine, </em>934 F.2d 1325, 1340 (5th Cir.1991), but also Koss has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he lacked an understanding of the structure of the enterprise and the activities of others in the enterprise, such that a four-level, minimal participant would have applied, <em>see United States v. Fernandez, </em>770 F.3d 340, 344 (5th Cir.2014); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.4). Moreover, Koss requested a two-level, minor role adjustment as an alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>tive to a four-level, minimal participant adjustment. Thus, he received the relief he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\">. Koss also argues that he cannot be guilty because the evidence supporting guilt is equal te) the evidence negating guilt. This argument is meritless as it rests upon the since-abandoned \"equipoise rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d 299, 301-02 (5th Cir.)(en banc)(rejecting the \"equipoise rule\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 170, 190 L.Ed.2d 121 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
