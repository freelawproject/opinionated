In this appeal, Pulido challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He asserts that he was eligible for a reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines and that the district court abused its discretion by sua sponte denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief without allowing him the opportunity to be heard. In particular, Pulido argues that a reduction was warranted because of his post-sentencing rehabilitation efforts and his good prison disciplinary record. The Government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-22\">When determining whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted and the extent of such reduction, the district court \u201cshall consider\u201d both the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)-(ii)). The district court also \u201cmay consider\u201d the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-23\">In its order denying relief, the district court expressly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthe further need to protect the community.\u201d It also indicated that it had \u201ctak[en] into account the policy statement set forth at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10,\u201d which provides that a district court may, but is not required to, consider a defendant\u2019s post-conviction conduct. In sum, the record shows that the' district court considered the factors as required by law and therefore it did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v.
