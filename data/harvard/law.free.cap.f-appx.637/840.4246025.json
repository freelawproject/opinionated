By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Gutierrez Guajardo is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-23\">On appeal, Gutierrez Guajardo argues that Amendment 782 lowered his offense level by two. He contends that the district court erred by finding otherwise and denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-24\">At the original sentencing, the distinct court found that Gutierrez Guajardo was responsible for 4.92 kilograms of ice and that his base offense level was 38 because the offense involved more than 1.5 kilograms of ice. While Amendment 782 raised the amount of ice required- for a base offense level of 38 to 4.5 kilograms, Gutierrez Guajardo was responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of ice. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). Accordingly, Amendment 782 did not reduce his base offense level or his guidelines sentence range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). As Amendment 782 did \u201cnot have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range,\u201d Gutierrez Guajardo was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see United States v. Bowman, </em>632 F.3d 906, 910-11 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>As Gutierrez Guajardo was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), his appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
