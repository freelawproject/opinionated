Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Hector Rengifo pleaded guilty to one count of possession of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The District Court determined that Rengifo was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(3) with an applicable guideline range of 151 to 188 months. However, the District Court granted a variance from the Guideline range because his criminal history was overstated and sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Rengifo appealed, and his appeal of his sentence is currently pending before this Court. <em>United States v. Rengifo </em>(C.A. No. 15-1779).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Rengifo then sought a reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782 to the Guidelines, which reduced the offense levels assigned to most drug quantities under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl,l(c) by two levels. The District Court denied the motion, explaining that, despite the variance he received, Rengifo\u2019s Guidelines range was based on the career-offender guidelines and that Amendment 782 did not affect the applicable career-offender guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">Rengifo appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In considering the denial of Rengifo\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion, we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and otherwise review the denial of relief for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mateo, </em>560 F.3d 152, 154 (3d Cir.2009). We may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling if there is no substantial question presented on appeal. 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-17\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rengifo \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 728 does not lower his sentencing range. A district court generally cannot \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed\u201d unless a defendant is eligible for a reduction of sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Section 3582(c)(2) allows for a reduction if (1) the sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and (2) \u201ca reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Flemming, </em>723 F.3d 407, 410 (3d Cir.2013). A reduction in sentence is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>consistent with the relevant policy statement unless the amendment has \u201cthe effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines define \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to IB 1.1(a), which is determined <em>before </em>consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (emphasis added). Here, the applicable guideline range is \u201cthe range calculated pursuant to the career offender designation of \u00a7 4B1.1, and not the range calculated after applying any departure or variance.\u201d <em>Flemming, </em>723 F.3d at 412. As the District Court noted, the fact that Ren-gifo received a downward variance does not change the applicable Guideline range under which his sentence was calculated. Amendment 782, which alters the offense levels for drug crimes but does not affect the offense levels for career offenders, would not lower Rengifo\u2019s applicable Guidelines range, and it would thus be contrary to the applicable policy statement to reduce Rengifo\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Rengifo\u2019s motion pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">. For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-13\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\">. The District Court granted Rengifo's motion for an extension of time to file an appeal under Rule 4(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and deemed his notice of appeal timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
