Sentenced within the advisory sentencing range for the Sentencing Guidelines to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, Underwood asserts: his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (sentencing factors), particularly the need to provide adequate deterrence and to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Athough post <em>-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). But, because Underwood did not raise in district court the issue presented here, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir.2012). Under that standard, Underwood must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">At sentencing, after considering Underwood\u2019s mitigation contentions and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court concluded a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines sentencing range was appropriate. Underwood has not shown the court: failed to give proper weight to any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor; gave significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor; or otherwise committed a \u201cclear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Aong that line,, the record does not support Underwood\u2019s assertion that the court was influenced by his association with the Aryan Brotherhood. His contentions amount to an impermissible request to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In short, he fails to show the requisite clear- or-obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b183-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
