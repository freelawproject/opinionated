Briefly stated, Smith challenges the constitutionality of the Florida Vexatious Litigant statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 68.093. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">As an initial matter, the district court committed no error when it twice ordered Smith to amend his complaint. Both Smith\u2019s original complaint and his first amended complaint were illegible and failed to comply with federal pleading requirements. The district court had the inherent authority, even without a request from a party, to order Smith to file a more definite statement in compliance with Fed. R.Civ.P. 8. <em>See Fikes v. City of Daphne, </em>79 F.3d 1079, 1083 n. 6 (11th Cir.1996). And, the district court committed no error in discarding the extra service copies of Smith\u2019s amended complaint. The district court had notified Smith already that service copies were not required and that the court would not keep extra service copies. Moreover, that the court discarded the service copies had no impact on the outcome of Smith\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under section 1915(e)(2), accepting the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">A court \u201cshall dismiss\u201d a case filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>if the court determines that the complaint \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). A complaint fails to state a claim if it fails to plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The complaint need not include detailed factual allegations, but it must set forth \u201cmore than labels and conclusions [or] a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1964-65. \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-20\">To the extent that Smith challenges the state court\u2019s determination \u2014 in an earlier-filed lawsuit against the same defendants \u2014 that Smith was a \u201cvexatious litigant,\u201d his claim is barred under the <em>Rook-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>er-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine. For background, see <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201clower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments\u201d in \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d). Thus, the district court concluded properly that it lacked jurisdiction to consider that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">About Smith\u2019s constitutional argument, Smith has failed to demonstrate that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 68.093 is unconstitutional on its face. The state has a compelling interest in preventing \u201cvexatious litigation from interfering with the business of the court system;\u201d and the statute \u201cdoes not restrict the vexatious litigant\u2019s rights more than absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Smith v. Fisher, </em>965 So.2d 205, 209 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007) (upholding the constitutionality of the Florida Vexatious Litigant statute). Smith has also failed to demonstrate that the statutory language is unconstitutionally vague; the complained-of terms Smith identifies either have well-understood meanings or are defined expressly in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Smith has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a plausible claim for relief. The district court dismissed correctly Smith\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">. <em>Rooker </em>v. <em>Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C.
