California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Smith has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The \u201cfugitive disentitlement doctrine\u201d is an equitable doctrine that \u201climits a criminal defendant\u2019s access to the judicial system whose authority he evades.\u201d <em>Bagwell v. Dretke, </em>376 F.3d 408, 410-13 (5th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted). Smith failed to report to begin serying his sentence on January 2, 2015, and has not returned to custody since he became a fugitive. It is unlikely that Smith will return, under his own volition or otherwise, in the foreseeable future. Under the circumstances, dismissal of Smith\u2019s appeal is appropriate. Dismissal' of the appeal is further supported by enforceability concerns, serves an important deterrent function, and \u201cadvances an interest in efficient, dignified appellate practice.\u201d <em>Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 234, 240-42, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993); <em>Bagwell, </em>376 F.3d at 410-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
