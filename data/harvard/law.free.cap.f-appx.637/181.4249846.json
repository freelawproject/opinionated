Almonte argued in the district court that the sentencing court erred in finding that his statutory-mandatory minimum sentence for the subject offense was enhanced from 10 to 20 years pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. Specifically, Almonte averred that his prior conviction was a misdemeanor and, as such, \u00a7 851 \u2014 which only applies to prior <em>felony </em>convictions \u2014 could not have been the basis for an increase in his statutory mandatory minimum sentence from 10 to 20 years. As a result, Almonte argued that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of his 20-year sentence and that relief was appropriate under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). In support, Almonte relied on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), wherein the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence must be presented to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 2158. According to Al-monte, because the fact of his prior conviction was never adjudicated beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, the sentencing court\u2019s application of \u00a7 851 to his sentence was unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Alleyne.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-23\">The district court denied relief, concluding that Almonte failed to meet the requirements of the savings clause under \u00a7 2255(e), which allows a federal prisoner to challenge his conviction under \u00a7 2241 if the remedies provided by \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d When addressing the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">A petitioner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective must make a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-25\">Almonte fails to make the required showing for relief under \u00a7 2255(e) for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>following reasons. First, prior to <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court stated in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States </em>that, for the purposes of sentencing enhancements, a prior conviction is not a fact that must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court explained that its holding did not disturb the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1. <em>A fortiori, </em>this court has held that, for the purpose of applying the \u00a7 851 sentencing enhancement, the question of whether a defendant had a prior felony conviction is not required to be submitted to a jury. <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>759 F,3d 486, 497 (5th Cir.2014). Second, this court has specifically held that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactive. <em>In re Kemper, </em>735 F.3d 211, 212 (5th Cir. 2013). Finally, Almonte\u2019s actual innocence claim is unavailing. <em>See McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1928, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013); <em>Foster v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 367-68 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The motion to supplement the brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b209-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
