Griggs contends that he meant to file a civil complaint requesting a default judgment, and the district court erroneously construed his petition as a collateral attack on his conviction. He also has moved for a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The district court reasonably could have concluded that Griggs\u2019s petition arose under \u00a7 2241. Griggs\u2019s expressly raised claims that attacked the legality of his conviction (e.g., whether his indictment should be dismissed as invalid, whether the court of conviction had jurisdiction, whether he should be released from prison because he was wrongly convicted) and, therefore, were cognizable in a federal ha-beas petition. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). The district court could not construe the petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion because Griggs filed prior \u00a7 2255 motions attacking his conviction, and a \u00a7 2255 motion can be reviewed only in the sentencing court, i.e., the Northern District of Indiana. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 895 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001); \u00a7 2255(a), (h). The district court properly considered whether Griggs could assert his claims under \u00a7 2241 by satisfying the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), <em>see Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904, and found that he had not made the required showing. Griggs has not asserted that he can satisfy the savings clause or otherwise addressed the district court\u2019s reasoning and, thus, he has not shown that the district court\u2019s conclusion was incorrect. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). His characterization of his filing as a civil complaint is irrelevant and, based upon the nature of the claims raised, inaccurate. <em>See Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 877-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Griggs\u2019s motion for a default judgment is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
