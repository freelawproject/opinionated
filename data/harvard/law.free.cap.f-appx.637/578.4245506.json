On August 18, 2015, after Turner repeatedly violated the conditions of supervised release by refusing to sign a drug treatment referral and, consequently, for failing to obtain treatment for his drug abuse, the District Court, following a hearing, granted the Probation Office\u2019s petition to revoke his supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The court then sentenced Turner to a term of four months\u2019 imprisonment, a term below the applicable sentence range under the Sentencing Guidelines. Turner appeals the District Court\u2019s decision, arguing that the sentence is substantively unreasonable when one considers his financial obligations, successful employment, and his reasons for failing drug tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The revocation of supervised release is committed to the district court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008). To revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve time in prison, the court must consider the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6) and (a)(7). These factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed to deter criminal conduct, the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D). In the end, the court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">In reviewing a sentence imposed following the revocation of supervised release, we consider the totality of the circumstances and evaluate whether the sentence achieves the sentencing purposes stated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). We ordinarily consider reasonable a sentence within the Guidelines sentence range. <em>Id. </em>575 F.3d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">The four months\u2019 sentence imposed here is substantively reasonable. The record establishes that the properly court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors. In doing so, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to give more weight to Turner\u2019s failed drug tests and refusal to obtain drug treatment than to his financial obligations and successful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-16\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
