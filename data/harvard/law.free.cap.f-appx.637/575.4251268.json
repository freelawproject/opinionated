Bennett\u2019s supervised release was revoked because of his arrest for domestic battery. He argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by not inquiring into his mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>health when accepting his guilty plea and waiver of the revocation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We review a district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>order a competency hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>468 F.2d 819, 820 (5th Cir.1972) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If, at any time after the defendant begins supervised release but before he completes his sentence, \u201cthere is reasonable cause to believe that [he] may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him ... unable to understand th\u00e9 nature and consequences of the proceedings against him,\u201d then the district court must <em>sua sponte </em>conduct a competency hearing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a). The information the district court has must be \u201csufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d <em>Tiller v. Esposito, </em>911 F.2d 575, 576 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The test for determining competence to plead guilty is \u201cwhether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether the defendant has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alterations omitted). To determine whether the district .court violated the defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights by failing to hold a competency hearing, we consider evidence of: (1) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s irrational behavior\u201d; (2) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s demeanor\u201d during the proceeding; and (3) \u201cany prior medical opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Bennett argues that the district court should have held a competency hearing because the court had evidence that family members believed he had a mental illness and that his probation officer had requested that he be put in a mental health program. Despite this information, there was no evidence that Bennett behaved irrationally around the time of the revocation hearing and his demeanor was unexceptional. The district court repeatedly asked Bennett if he understood the charges against him and Bennett confirmed that he did. Beyond that, there was no earlier medical opinion regarding his mental competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>conduct a competency hearing because the information known to it did not raise a bona fide doubt regarding Bennett\u2019s competence. Accordingly, upon careful review, we affirm the revocation of Bennett\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">.
