He also appeals his sentence of 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-22\">Our review of the factors in <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), and of the district court\u2019s findings establishes that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Thompson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>See United States v. McKnight, 570 </em>F.3d 641, 645 (5th Cir.2009). Our rule of orderliness prevents us from overruling prior decisions rejecting Thompson\u2019s contention that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) require proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the firearm\u2019s interstate nexus. <em>See United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143, 145-46 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Rose, </em>587 F.3d 695, 706 n. 9 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The district court committed no error in considering Thompson\u2019s unadjudicated 2014 arrest in imposing the challenged sentence, assuming arguendo that it actually did so. <em>See United States v. Fuentes, 775 </em>F.3d 213, 218, 220 (5th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>702 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2012). As Thompson concedes, his argument that the district court denied him his right to confrontation by considering the 2014 arrest without giving him an opportunity to cross-examine his accusers is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 776 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Beydoun, </em>469 F.3d 102, 108 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
