Qua-dri\u2019s form complaint indicated that he sought relief for employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17, and in subsequent pleadings he also appeared to seek relief under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(\"ADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 626-634, and the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). The district court dismissed on the recommendation of the magistrate judge (\u201cMJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Quadri appears to argue that the MJ\u2019s recommendation of dismissal violated 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 and constitutional due-process and Article III requirements, because Quadri did not consent and the issue was a dispositive motion. The statute provides, however, for MJs to issue proposed findings and recommendations without consent on Rule 12(b)(6) motions, <em>see </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1)(B); see <em>also </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), and the procedure in \u00a7 636(b) does not violate due process or Article III even when it involves dispositive motions, <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 677-84, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980). No hearing was required. <em>Brand Coupon Network, L.L.C. v. Catalina Mktg. Corp., </em>748 F.3d 631, 635 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Quadri also complains about the MJ\u2019s reference to information in a separate lawsuit he had filed, but that had no impact on the MJ\u2019s recommendation, which expressly-recognized that the facts in the other dispute were \u201cnot in issue in this lawsuit.\u201d Any error was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. Quadri\u2019s claims do not involve legal points arguable on their merits under, any standard of review. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">In addition, Quadri seems to challenge the finding that his allegations fell short of stating a claim under Title VII. Quadri has likely failed to brief this claim, <em>see Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008), but even assuming for the sake of argument that the issue is adequately briefed, it is frivolous. We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal <em>de novo. Carder v. Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>636 F.3d 172, 174 (5th Cir. 2011). The district court properly dismissed given Quadri\u2019s threadbare factual allegations. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Quadri failed to state a claim of discrimination because he did not identify any adverse employment action. <em>See McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 559 (5th Cir.2007). Nor did he state a claim of hostile work environment. <em>See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993); <em>Ramsey v. Henderson, </em>286 F.3d 264, 268 (5th Cir. 2002). Also, despite that Quadri\u2019s pleadings alleged retaliation, he never explained the nature of the mismanagement he allegedly reported, so the complaint fell short of stating a claim for retaliation under Title VIL <em>See Evans v. City of Hous., </em>246 F.3d 344, 351 (5th Cir.2001). Again, Qua-dri fails to present an appellate claim with arguable merit. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Quadri has not briefed any theory that his pleadings stated claims under the ADEA, the Rehabilitation Act, or federal whistleblower law. <em>See Mapes, </em>541 F.3d at 584. He has \u201ceffectively abandoned\u201d any such claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Because the appeal does not involve any legal points arguable on their merits, see <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220, it is DISMISSED as frivolous, <em>see </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. We DENY as moot the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
