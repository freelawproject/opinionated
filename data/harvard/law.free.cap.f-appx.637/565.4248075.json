Hoever contends the district court erred in determining he was not entitled to mandamus relief. He asserts he had no adequate remedy at law because the IJ ignored and ruled <em>ex parte </em>on his motions and granted the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s motion to reopen without providing him an opportunity for opposition. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, the district court has original jurisdiction over any mandamus action to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. The test for jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 is \u201cwhether mandamus would be an appropriate means of relief.\u201d <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cMandamus relief is only appropriate when: (1) the plaintiff has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) no other adequate remedy is available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party seeking mandamus has the burden of demonstrating that his right to the writ is clear and indisputable. <em>In re BellSouth Corp., </em>334 F.3d 941, 953 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, a'plaintiff cannot resort to the extraordinary remedy of mandamus where there is an adequate alternative \u201cavenue for relief,\u201d such as where a statutory method of appeal has been prescribed. <em>Lifestar Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">A writ of prohibition, under the All Writs Act, requires a showing of \u201cexceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power\u201d and is reserved for extraordinary cases in which \u201cthe right to relief is clear and undisputable\u201d and the regular judicial-review process is inadequate to address the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See In re Wainwright, </em>678 F.2d 951, 953 (11th Cir.1982). The All Writs Act does not provide an independent basis for federal jurisdiction. <em>Henson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>261 F.3d 1065, 1070 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section. Exeept as otherwise provided in this section, no court shall have jurisdiction ... by [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651] ... to review such an order or such questions of law or fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(9). In addition, section (g) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law ... including [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651] ... no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ders against any alien under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). Decisions of IJs in removal proceedings are subject to review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b)(3). This Court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The district court did not have jurisdiction over Hoever\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus because he had an adequate alternative remedy for obtaining relief, as the IJ scheduled a hearing with regard to his CAT claim and he could pursue administrative appellate review with the BIA and then-judicial review in this Court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b); <em>Lifestar Ambulance, </em>365 F.3d at 1295. The district court also lacked jurisdiction over his petition for a writ of prohibition because the All Writs Act does not provide an independent basis for jurisdiction and the INA strips jurisdiction from the district court with regard to issues arising from the proposed removal of an alien. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(b)(9) and (g); <em>Henson, </em>261 F.3d at 1070. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-5\">. We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction <em>de novo. Hempel v. United States, </em>14 F.3d 572, 575 (11th Cir.1994). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus or of a petition brought pursuant to the All Writs Act for abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Stewart, </em>641 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2011) (mandamus); <em>Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1092, 1096 (11th Cir.2004) (All Writs Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
