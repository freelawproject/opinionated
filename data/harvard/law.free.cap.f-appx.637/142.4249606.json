California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ulloa-Osorio has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-24\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>fleeted therein. Although counsel addresses the validity of Ulloa-Osorio\u2019s appeal waiver, counsel does not discuss the district court\u2019s compliance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. An appeal waiver in the plea agreement does not waive the district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 11 or the need to brief this issue adequately in an <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>See United States v. Carreon-Ibarra, </em>673 F.3d 358, 362 n. 3 (5th Cir.2012); <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 787, 789-90 (5th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, our independent review confirms that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. We therefore concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We note, however, that there is a clerical error in the written judgment. The Government agreed to dismiss any remaining counts of the indictment in exchange for Ulloa-Osorio\u2019s plea to Count One. At the sentencing hearing, the Government moved to dismiss Count Two, and the district court granted the dismissal. However, the judgment does not include the dismissal of Count Two, an apparent clerical error. Accordingly, we REMAND for correction of the clerical error in the written judgment in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. <em>See United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733, 739 n. 16 (5th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Rosales, </em>448 Fed.Appx. 466, 466-67 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
