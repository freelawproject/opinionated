We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-19\">Patino asserts that the district court committed reversible plain error by denying his constitutional right to testify, thus depriving him of a fair trial. To prevail on plain error review, Patino must show (1) a forfeited error (2) that is clear or obvious and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). A claim \u201csubject to reasonable dispute\u201d cannot constitute plain error. <em>Id.; see United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009). Ordinarily, an error affects substantial rights if \u201cit affect[s] the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If Patino makes the required showing, we may exercise our discretion \u201cto remedy the error ... if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We evaluate Patino\u2019s claim by \u201cviewing [it] against the entire record.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 16, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-20\">Patino offers a conclusory contention that the district court prejudiced the defense by precluding testimony about his prior removal. Arguments must be briefed adequately. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(8)(A). Patino does not specify ydiat his testimony about his removal proceedings \u2014 or more testimony about his mother\u2019s cancer or his unemployment \u2014 would have been, much less that it would have been admissible or would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>swayed the jury to disbelieve the Government\u2019s evidence and acquit him. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 873-74, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982). Indeed, Patino has not even shown that a mistaken removal is a defense to an illegal reentry charge. Given the record as a whole, Patino does not satisfy the materiality requirement of his claim that the loss of his own testimony prejudiced his case. <em>See Young, </em>470 U.S. at 16, 105 S.Ct. 1038; <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. at 867-68, 873-74, 102 S.Ct. 3440.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Also, whether continued violations of the in limine order could have been effectively controlled by a course of repeated Government objections and district court admonishments to the jury, as Patino suggests, is a question that is at least subject to reasonable dispute. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. at 16, 105 S.Ct. 1038; <em>Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377-78. Given that the question whether the district court acted arbitrarily is reasonably debatable, there can be no plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); <em>Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Because he does not satisfy the materiality requirement to warrant a finding of error, Patino additionally cannot show that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Consequently, he does not satisfy the third prong of the plain error standard. <em>See id. </em>Patino therefore fails to show reversible plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
