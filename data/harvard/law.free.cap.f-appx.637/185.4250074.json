Triana contends that the district court abused its discretion in overruling his objection to the substantive reasonableness of the above-guidelines sentence. He asserts that the district court gave too much weight to remote and un-scored prior convictions and inadequate consideration to his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">The district court\u2019s sentence did not unreasonably fail to reflect the statutory sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). We will defer to the district court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b213-15\"> Pursuant to 5m Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5m Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
