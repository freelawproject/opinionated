Russell Steen, appointed counsel for Ericson Snow in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of Snow and prepared a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Snow\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-15\">. We acknowledge that Snow expressed dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s performance leading up to his guilty plea and sentencing and that he might wish to argue that counsel was ineffective in that respect. Such claims, however, generally \u201care not considered for the first time on direct appeal,\u201d but rather are best reserved for postconviction proceedings. <em>United States v. Tyndale, </em>209 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
