The defendant, further, on cross-examination, admitted his applying the money to the account of Mrs. Ballew; and that she had contacted him about making other deliveries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\u201cUpon this evidence, the defendant was convicted as charged, and was sentenced to pay a $50.00 fine and to serve ten days\u2019 sentence in the workhouse. A stay of execution was granted defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">\u201cA motion for a new trial was heard on January 23, 1969. Numerous grounds were presented, and argument had. The court overruled the said motion, to all of which the defendant excepted.\u201d The defendant, appellant herein and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>hereinafter referred to as defendant, presents the following assignments of error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">\u201c1. Refusal of the court to allow certain testimony and evidence to be admitted into evidence, at the hearing on a motion for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201c2. The court\u2019s refusal to allow additional time to secure witnesses \u2014 officers of the court \u2014 who were not present until the motion for a new trial was heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">\u201c3. The judgment is against the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\"><em>\u201c4. </em>The judgment is contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201c5. Bias and prejudice of the court toward this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201c6. Abuse of discretion of the court in the conduct of the trial and the subsequent hearings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The court will consider the assigned errors in the order of their listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">With reference to assignment No. 1, there is no record in the narrative bill of exceptions of any exhibits having been received or offered in evidence. The defendant\u2019s brief devotes much space to the fact the court refused to admit certain exhibits, but the record does not support such conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">In considering assignment of error No. 2, it was within the discretion of the prosecution to call or not call any witness to testify. The fact that the prosecution did not call the arresting officer did not prevent the defendant from calling him as a witness for the defendant. Since the defendant did not call the arresting officer to testify, he cannot be heard to complain about what that officer\u2019s testimony would or would not have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">The assignment of errors No. 3 and No. 4 are so closely related they will be considered together. Section 2907.39, Revised Code, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">\u201cNo person, with intent to defraud, shall sell, secret, destroy, convert to his own use, or otherwise dispose of chattels, goods, merchandise, or personal property, the possession of which has been given to him in trust, pledge, .bailment, or on deposit, or .under an agreement to pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>chase it on installment payments or otherwise, and no person so holding snch property, shall with intent to defraud, remove it beyond the county wherein it was stipulated such property should be kept.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-3\">\u2018 \u2018 Whoever violates this section shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than three months, or both. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The elements to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt under conversion by a bailee are: (1) the selling, converting to his own use, destroying or otherwise disposing of; (2) the personal property of another; (3) coming into his possession by pledge, bailment, deposit, or purchase on installment payments or otherwise; (4) with intent to defraud; and (5) venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Although the narrative bill of exceptions is very brief, it is sufficient to conclude that a business relation had existed between Janet Ballew and the defendant for a period of time before the mattress was purchased; that she was indebted to the defendant at the time she purchased the mattress; that there was conversation between Janet Ballew and the defendant concerning the purchase of the mattress, when it should be delivered, the accounts in reference to other purchases; and that the defendant did not apply the money received from Janet Ballew to her disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Certainly, the whole record fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt there was any intention on behalf of the (defendant to defraud Janet Ballew.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">There is nothing in the narrative bill of exceptions to support assignments of error No. 5 and No. 6 in which it is claimed the trial judge was biased and prejudiced or abused his discretion in the trial of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">For the reasons presented, the judgment of conviction and sentence of the defendant is reversed, and the defendant is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-10\">Shannon, P. J., and Hildebbant, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
