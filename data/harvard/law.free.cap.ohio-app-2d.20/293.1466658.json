The advice shall be in a written form prescribed by the registrar of motor vehicles and shall be read to such person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest and read to him in the presence of the arresting officer and one other police officer or civilian police employee. Such witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Courts have power to correct errors or mistakes in statutes in order that the manifest reason and intention thereof shall obtain, and it was error for the Municipal Court to declare the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The reference to Section (B) herein is manifestly nonsensical, while reference to Section (C) was obviously the intent of the Legislature. <em>Stanton, Pros. Atty., </em>v. <em>Frankel Brothers Realty Co., </em>117 Ohio St. 345, is decisive of this question. Paragraph one of the syllabus states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cSection 5610 * * # before the amendment * * * provided: \u2018An appeal from the decision of a county board of revision may be taken to the Tax Comission of Ohio * <em>* * </em>by the county auditor or any complainant * # V In amending that section the General Assembly changed the word \u2018or\u2019 to \u2018of\u2019 without intending so to do. In construing the statute as amended, in order to effect the obvious intent of the Legislature and to avoid inconsistency, the court will substitute the word \u2018or\u2019 for the word \u2018of\u2019 thereby giving to \u2018any complainant\u2019 the right to appeal from the board of revision to the tax commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">At page 350, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201c # # * It ig a well-settled rule that courts will not permit a statute to be defeated on account of a mistake or error, where the intention of the Legislature can be collected from the whole statute, or where one word has been erroneously used for another, and where the context affords means of correction. The strict letter of a statute must yield to the obvious intent. The use of the word \u2018of\u2019 results in giving the county auditor a right to appeal, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the same time denying one who complains of the action of the auditor an equal right of appeal. To thus interpret the statute would cast a grave doubt upon its validity. It would operate as a clear denial of the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">See citations therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">From the authority quoted above, we find the courts do have authority to correct the obvious typographical error herein to give effect to the obvious intent of the statute, and that it was error prejudicial to the defendant to hold the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Since the lower court decision herein, the Legislature has amended the statute to make reference to Section (C) instead of (B), thereby correcting the obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The judgment of the Municipal Court is reversed and this court coming now to render the judgment that should have been rendered, the suspension of plaintiff\u2019s license and permit to drive is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-9\">Shannon, P.
