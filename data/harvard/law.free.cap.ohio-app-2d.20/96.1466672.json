Breuer Transportation Co., </em>156 Ohio St. 430. In paragraph one of the syllabus, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cThe question of whether the operator of a motor vehicle was negligent in failing to comply with the \u2018assured-clear-distance-ahead\u2019 rule contained in Section 63-07-21, General Code, is not presented to the trier of the facts where there is no substantial evidence (1) that the object with which such operator collided was located ahead of him in his lane of travel, and (2) that such object was reasonably discernible, and (3) that the object was (a) static or stationary, or (b) moving ahead of him in the same direction as such operator, or (c) came into his lane of travel within the assured clear distance ahead at a point sufficiently distant ahead of him to have made it possible, in the exercise of ordinary care, to bring his vehicle to a stop and avoid a collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Looking to the facts in this case, the appellant\u2019s evidence was that the appellee was heading north on State Route 306 at the time the appellant collided with him while driving in a southerly direction on said route in the same northbound lane of traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The appellee\u2019s evidence was that he never was on State Route 306 but at the time of the accident was stopped off State Route 306 waiting for the appellant to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Under the appellant\u2019s version of the facts the appellee was not \u201cstatic or stationary\u201d nor \u201cmoving ahead of him in the same direction as such operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Under the appellee\u2019s version of the facts, it was not true \u201cthat the object with which such operator collided was located ahead of him <em>in his lane of travel\u201d </em>(Italics ours).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Accordingly, there were no facts before the jury to require the court to charge on any possible violation of the assured-clear-distance rule by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Second, the trial court was in error to charge the jury on Section 4511.30 of the Revised Code which prohibits passing another vehicle within 100 feet of an intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">Section 4511.30 of the Revised Code reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj\">\u201cNo vehicle or trackless trolley shall, in overtaking and passing traffic, or at any other time, be driven to the left of the center or center line of the roadway under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201c(A) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201c (B) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201c(C) When approaching within one hundred feet of or traversing any intersection or railroad grade crossing, unless compliance with this section is impossible because of insufficient roadway space. * # * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Although there are apparently no Ohio cases squarely on point, this court is of the opinion that the statute was intended to prohibit one driving his automobile from the right side of the center or center line of the roadway to the left of the center or center line of the roadway within one hundred feet of an intersection to pass another vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">In other words, the statute prohibits one from crossing the center line to overtake or to pass another vehicle when within one hundred feet of an intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">This court is of the opinion that the Seventh Appellate District Court of Appeals, this court\u2019s predecessor, was correct in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Shackleford, </em>100 Ohio App. 487, when it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">\u201cWhen a motorist enters the left side of a highway, before reaching the point where a yellow line begins, in order to pass a truck, and, while passing such truck, continues on the left side of the highway beyond the point where a yellow line begins on the right side of the center thereof, such motorist does not violate Section 4511.31, Revised Code, in continuing in such left lane until he can safely cross back into the right lane,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>We are of the opinion that the same reasoning would apply where the act of passing begins prior to reaching a point one hundred feet from an intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We find no evidence in the record of the appellant beginning to pass less than one hundred feet from the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Therefore, in our opinion, the trial court should not have charged the jury as to any possible negligence on the part of the appellant by reason of being left of center within one hundred feet of an intersection where the evidence is uncontradicted that at the time of the accident he was in the process of completing a passing action which began more than one hundred feet from the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Therefore, this court finds prejudicial error in the trial court\u2019s charge but not in the form and manner set forth in the appellant\u2019s assignment of errors one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Accordingly, the court reverses on the ground the trial court gave two erroneous charges and therefore should have granted the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-9\">Hofstetter, P. J., and Jones, J. concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
