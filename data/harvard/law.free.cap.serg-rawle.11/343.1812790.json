Well </em>meaning,) are a bastard; (thereby insinuating and intending to have it understood and believed by all the good citizens so hearing him, the said <em>John Mlison, </em>proclaim and speak the said false, feigned, and scandalous words, th\u2019at,the said <em>Nancy Maxwell </em>was a bastard, and that the aforesaid <em>Mary, </em>the wife of the said <em>John Maxwell, </em>had committed the crime of adultery and incontinence).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-12\">The second count laid the words thus: \u201cShe, (the said <em>Nancy Maxwell, </em>the legitimate daughter of the said <em>John Maxwell </em>meaning,) is a bastard; (thereby insinuating, and intending to have it understood, by all persons hearing the same, that the said <em>Nancy Maxwell </em>was a bastard, and not. the legitimate daughter of the said <em>Mary, </em>and that the said <em>Mary </em>had been- guilty of the crime of incontinence and adultery).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-13\">In the third count the words were laid as spok\u00e9n, \u201c'of, and concerning <em>Nancy Maxwell, </em>the legitimate daughter of the said <em>John Maxwell, </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife,\u201d thus: \u201cI, (the said <em>John Mlison </em>meaning,) have called her, (the said <em>Nancy </em>meaning,) a bastard, and she is a bastard, and I have said nothing but what I can maintain; (meaning thereby, that the said <em>Nancy Maxwell </em>was a bastard, and that the said <em>Mary Maxwell, </em>the mother of the said <em>Nancy, </em>had been guilty of the crime of incontinence and adultery, and that the said <em>John Mlison </em>could maintain the same).\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-14\">On the trial of the cause, several bills of exceptions were taken by the plaintiffs counsel to the opinion of the court below, in the admission and rejection <em>of </em>evidence, which were returned with the record to this court, and argued by <em>Carothers </em>and <em>Hale, </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and by <em>Burnside, </em>for the defendant in error;</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUbT\">but as *the cause was decided on grounds wholly independent of them, they are not here stated.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The opinion of the court was delivered <em>by</em></p>\n<author id=\"b344-6\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4u\">Whatever may have been the errors of the court in the admission and rejection of evidence, still, if the plaintiffs, in their declaration, have set out no legal cause of action, if the words laid are not actionable, if they never could obtain a judgment against the defendant, the judgment must stand affirmed. The words laid in this declaration, are clearly not actionable. They were not spoken of the plaintiffs; to the person to whom they were addressed, they imputed no crime, they exposed her to no punishment. It might be considered a misfortune to her to be esteemed a bastard, but it did not impute to her any moral turpitude, nor any crime subjecting her to indictment or punishment. If any temporal damage had been stated to have been occasioned by speaking the words, as the danger of losing a situation, the action might have been sustained. The mother of <em>Nancy, </em>to whom want of chastity was imputed, might be said to be charged with adultery or fornication. But the words were not spoken of her. If this meaning could be rendered certain, it could not be by means of an <em>innuendo, </em>but must have been by way of averment or <em>colloquium. </em>If the person to whom the words relate, be'not described with certainty, but require some extrinsic fact'to render them so, this is not the office of an <em>innuendo. </em>The intention to have it understood, that <em>Mary Maxwell, </em>the plaintiff, liad been guilty of the crime of incontinence and adultery, because the defendant said <em>Nancy, </em>her daughter, was a bastard, is not an averment of a fact, on which issue could be taken, nor is it susceptible of proof; and there was no <em>colloquium </em>at the time of publishing the words, that they were spoken of her. Where a person is so ambiguously alluded to, as that without the aid of extrinsic facts, the identity is not ascertained there by the introduction of proper averments and a <em>colloquium, </em>the words may, notwithstanding be rendered sufficiently certain to maintain an action. <em>Van Vechten </em>v. <em>Hopkins, 5 Johns. 223. Cheetham </em>v. <em>Tillotson, Id. </em>430. An <em>innuendo </em>cannot supply the place of a <em>colloquium; </em>nor is an <em>innuendo </em>capable of proof. But where an <em>innuendo </em>and <em>colloquium </em>introduce extrinsic matter, that is a proper subject of proof. The true rule is, that where words do not in themselves virtually convey the meaning imputed to them, or where they refer to some extrinsic matter, to make them actionable, it must not only be predicated, that the said matter exists, but that the words were spoken of and concerning that matter, and this is matter of fact, to be decided by a jury. 1 <em>Saund, 243. Innuendo, </em>means nothing more than <em>id </em>est, <em>scilicet, or meaning as aforesaid; </em>explanatory of a subject matter sufficiently expressed before; as, such a one, meaning the defendant; or, such a subject, meaning the subject in question. But as it is only received as a word of explanation, it cannot extend to the sense of the words, beyond their own meaning. Unless something is put in the record for it to explain, there is nothing to throw light on the innuendo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>nor has it connection with any part of the declaration. It stands alone, without any support, and implies no charge to. the plaintiff, <em>Mary, </em>personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
