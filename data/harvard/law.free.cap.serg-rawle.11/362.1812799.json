This testimony was objected to, as inadmissible, until the plaintiff had proved a partnership between the defendants in the business of freighting and transporting goods, or some other authority in <em>Allen </em>to bind <em>Grant. </em>The court sustained the objection, and over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ruled the evidence. The. plaintiff, for the purpose of laying a foundation for the introduction of evidence of <em>Mien\u2019s </em>undertaking, produced the following testimony. <em>John Darragh </em>swore, that he had dealt for some years with the defendants, under the name of <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant, </em>and considered them as commission merchants of capital and standing: That he had sold them a great deal of merchandize, to fill orders for their correspondents, and had also sold to them on their own account: <em>That he knew of their buying and selling merchandize on their oion account frequently, such as iron, sugar, salt, &amp;?c., and that this practice was customary among all the commission merchants of Pittsburg: </em>That the defendants were reputed among the merchants of the place, to be commission merchants, and that their business consisted in buying and forwarding goods: That their sign was <em>Mien </em>and Grant: That in the Bank of <em>Pittsburg, </em>they had an account opened in the name of the firm, and signed and endorsed notes under that name, and that the witness never knew or heard of their having freighted goods, until the present dispute arose. The following question was then put to the witness by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cWas it the general reputation, that the defendants dealt as partners in any business or speculation, in which capital might be advantageously employed ?\u201d This question was objected to on the part of the defendants, but the court overruled the objection, and the defendants tendered a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">The plaintiffi after having proved, by the testimony of <em>William Hill, </em>two specifications of the firm of the defendants, taken from the banks in the city of <em>Pittsburg, </em>offered in evidence the signature of the defendants\u2019 firm, written by <em>George Grant, </em>to a subscription paper, for fifty shares in the <em>Pittsburg </em>Navigation and Insurance Company. This evidence was objected to by the defendants, but admitted by the court, whose opinion was again excepted to. The witness then proceeded to state, that the company to which the subscription paper referred, was formed for the purpose of lowering the price of freight, which the freighters were at that time in the habit of charging, but the company did not continue in operation more, than two or three months: That the defendants were engaged in the commission business, and also in <em>the </em>general purchase and sale of all articles that might offer in the market: That there were very few commission houses in <em>Pittsburg that did </em>not extend their business, beyond mere commission business: That the notes of the defendants were good in the market, and their credit undoubted: That he never knew or heard of a note of their\u2019s except for purchases, and never knew or heard of their being concerned in freighting except once, when it was understood, that the steam-boat <em>Dolphin </em>was chartered by them, and loaded principally with their own goods; and that he never knew them to be engaged in taking goods on freight or for hire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\"><em>David Logan, </em>another witness on the part of the plaintiff stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>that some time before the boat on board of which the plaintiff\u2019s goods were shipped arrived at <em>Pitlsburg, </em>Mr. <em>Grant, </em>one of the defendants, called on the witness, and said he would have a boat to load for <em>Nashville, </em>and inquired if the witness had any goods for freight: <em>That the witness asked him, who would sign the receipt, to which he replied, </em>\u201c we will :\u201d That Mr. <em>Allen, </em>the other defendant, afterwards spoke to the witness, and said, that the boat belonged to a gentleman in <em>Nashville, </em>and that they were loading her: That when the witness got the goods, he sent them on board, and did not inquire who were the owners of the boat, as he was satisfied when Mr. <em>Grant </em>said they would sign the receipt: That the conversation with Mr <em>Grant, </em>was a good while before the witness sent the goods, and before the boat came down the river, and Mr. <em>Grant </em>also said, that the boat belonged to persons in <em>Nashville: </em>That when he put the goods on board, he did not get any receipt, and when the boat sunk he got his goods back: That <em>Grant </em>might have mentioned the names of <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker: </em>That he never knew <em>Allen and Grant </em>as freighters, and never brought a suit against <em>Allen </em>and <em>Grant. Allen </em>offered to sign the receipts as <em>agent, </em>after the accident happened, which the witness declined. He did not say any thing to <em>Allen </em>about relying on the responsibility of the defendants, though that was what he did rely upon, and not upon <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">After the above-mentioned witnesses had been examined, and others, whose testimony tended to establish nearly the same facts, the plaintiff again offered to prove, by the oath of <em>Heiram Bonnett, </em>the special undertaking laid in the declaration, made by <em>Allen </em>alone, in the absence of <em>Grant. </em>This evidence was objected to by the defendants on the same ground as before; but the court admitted the evidence, and a bill of exceptions to their opinion was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">The witness, who was the agent of the plaintiff, proved, that he contracted with <em>Allen </em>for the transportation of the goods of the plaintiff, as he understood, for the house of <em>Allen </em>and <em>Grant, </em>on their own account, trusting to them only, and not considering them as agents of the house of <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker. </em>The goods were consigned to one <em>Latapie, </em>of <em>Nashville, </em>another agent of the plaintiff, who was in <em>Pittsburg </em>at the time they were shipped, and who, it appeared, knew that the boat belonged to <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">The defendants examined several witnesses, to prove that they were never concerned in the business of carrying goods on freight on their own account, and that they acted in this business as the agents of the house of <em>Gordon and Walker.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-9\">The President of the Court of Common Pleas, delivered to the jury an elaborate charge, embracing a view both of the facts given in evidence, and of the law arising upon them. So far as it is now material, it was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-10\">\u201cThree points have been made during the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>&lt;f 1. Was the disaster by which the loss happened of that kind, and did it occur in such a manner, as to render the freighters liable?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Was there any personal responsibility created by what passed between Mr. <em>Bonnett </em>and Mr. <em>Mien ?</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\"><em>\u201c 3. </em>If there was a personal liability, does it fall on <em>Mien </em>alone, or on <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant?</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">\u201c I think the testimony is strong, and probably satisfactory to your minds, that in this unlucky business, <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant, </em>did act as the agents of <em>Gordon </em>and Walker; and in solving the second question, I am willing to consider them as agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">\u201c An agent, general or special, may render himself personally responsible for a contract made for his principal. He must take care that in his contract and undertakings, he represents himself and deals as an agent. It is his duty to be cautious how he executes his agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\">\u201cThe person who makes a contract, or comes under any obligation, is to be considered as contracting for himself. And in order to avoid <em>this </em>inference, and' that he may not encounter the hazard of being personally responsible, he himself should draw the distinction, and let it be known, whether he acts for himself or for another. A contrary doctrine would be most dangerous and unjust ; because, after a contract is made, and the question of liability or payment for a serious loss arises, the person who made the contract ought not to be permitted to come out and say, \u2018 Why, I have nothing to do with this, I was a mere agent, my principal is A. B. or C., and lives in <em>Nashville, Orleans, </em>or London.\u2019 Although the agent may render himself personally liable, by his manner of dealing, yet the principal would still be answerable to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-10\">\u201cNow, my mind being satisfied, that <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant </em>were the agents of <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker </em>in this transaction, let us examine what the facts are, which bear upon this particular pofnt, and ascertain whether the language and conduct of Mr. <em>Mien </em>to Mr. <em>Bonnett, </em>were those of an agent, and such upon the legal principles I have mentioned, as will avoid all personal liability? And to these principles I will leave it to you to apply the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-11\">\u201cThe circumstances are these: (His honour here stated what took place between <em>Mien </em>and <em>Bonnett.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-13\">\u201c Then it appears that nothing very formal took place between <em>Mien and-Bonnett; </em>what did occur, however, appears to be \"usual when our merchants ship goods \u2014 for, sometimes, the receipt is not signed until after the boat sails. To make an undertaking of this kind binding, no precise form of words or writing is necessary. What was the intent and undertaking of the parties ? One man asks another for freight to a particular place; the freight is' promised, sent to the boat, received and stowed away. Do not these facts .satisfy your minds, that there was an undertaking to carry and deliver? An undertaking for which some one ought to be responsible? Who is that person? Can there be a disposition any where: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to disbelieve Mr. <em>Bonnett, </em>when he tells us, \u2018he never heard who owned the boat, (he appears to have been confined by lameness,) he never heard of the names of <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker, </em>until after the disaster; that he intended to deal, and did deal with <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant; </em>that to him Mr. <em>Mien </em>did not represent himself as an agent \u2014 spoke of no agency \u2014 gave no name of principal \u2014 and finally, that he did <em>give the goods </em>on account of <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant.\u2019 </em>If these impressions were erroneous, or if he was deceived,nothing was done to undeceive him, or correct the error. Now, it is very true, as contended for by the counsel for the defendants, that Mr. <em>Bonnett </em>draws his inferences at his own peril; and it is his own look out and his care, whether or not, the conduct and language of Mr. Jifera justified him in his impressions, and reasonably induced him to believe and say, that the goods were given on account of <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant. </em>, What was the plain import and meaning of the request by <em>Mien, </em>the answer of <em>Bonnett, </em>and the conversation of the parties? Were the final decision of this question left to us, we would say, that such was the language, and such was the manner in which <em>Mien </em>represented himself to <em>Bonnett; </em>and such was the personal ignorance of <em>Bonnett, </em>as to agency and ownership of the boat, that out of this transaction, a personal responsibility does arise. If <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant </em>had gone round the town and said, we want freight, and will give <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker\u2019s, </em>of <em>Nashville, </em>receipt, would they have succeeded ? Would they have been likely to have got freight upon their responsibility? The third and last question then is, on whom does this personal responsibility fall? The defendants answer, \u2018certainly not upon <em>ns jointly; </em>not upon the firm of <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant. </em>Because, if <em>Mien </em>did incur personal responsibility in this case, he had no right to bind his partner, Mr. <em>Grant.\u2019 </em>Now, this seems to us to be the most dif-, ficult and serious point of the case; indeed, to my mind, the <em>only </em>difficult question. By the course of the arguments, too, we would suppose it was considered by the counsel, as the most material and important position. Its decision will depend, principally, upon the point of light in which the facts may strike you; upon the inference whieh you may draw from all the circumstances in evidence, as to the <em>power </em>of the one party to bind the other in a transaction like the present. We will give you the law bearing upon this point of the case; the law as to the express or <em>implied </em>power of the partner to bind the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">\u201c It is often difficult (particularly in this country, where the various business and occupations of men are in many cases not very well defined,) to get at, and discover the nature, limits, and extent or business of a firm. Those who deal with a firm, have often times to run the risk, in cases of dispute, of being able to prove the members of it, or the nature and extent of their association. I do not mention this because I believe any difficulty has been thrown in the way here by the defendants; but for the purpose of showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the reason of the course of evidenc upon the trial of the cause, as well as the reason for the rule of law I shall lay down to you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">\u201cNow, where in the agreement of the firm, or their articles of partnership, an authority is given to any one of the partners, to bind the firm, then it may be said, there is an express power given to one partner to bind his colleague. He becomes, unequivocally, the agent of all, and in such ease, no difficulty could easily occur. But in other cases, where the precise terms of the association are not known, where the limits and nature of their business, and the power of each partner is not definitely ascertained, a court and jury are obliged.to resort to inference and implicataion, arising from the declarations, acts, conduct, and manner of doing business by the firm, in order to ascertain the power of one partner to bind the firrq*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">\u201cPartnerships may be of two kinds: general and special.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">[Here his honour explained the nature of a general and special partnership.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">\u201c In both these kinds of partnerships, there is an implied power, in the absence\u2019 of an express one, in one partner to bind the others in the business which they pursue. One partner is the agent of the firm, within the scope of business which they follow. But he cannot bind the firm to engagements unconnected with, or foreign to the affairs in which they are engaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">\u201cThus I would say, that one commission merchant, even in <em>Pittsburg, </em>where the business is not strictly confined to that pursuit, would not have the power, without the consent of bis colleagues, to convert the firm into freighters or common carriers. And an engagement without that consent, in a transaction thus foreign to then- association, would be without authority; good to be- sure against the particular partner who made it, but void against the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-10\">\u201cLet me lay down to you another principle of laiv, materially connected with the present inquiry. It is this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-11\">\u201cA partnership, as it proceeds, or grows older, or as capital increases, business multiplies, or commerce changes, may be greatly extended, as to its objects and the manner of conducting it. A limited partnership may become general; and a general one more general or more extensive. This happens by the acts and conduct of the parties, by their branching out and making their business more diffusive. This extension of the business of a firm, may be discovered by the <em>assent, </em>the <em>acquiescence, </em>as well as the positive acts of the partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-12\">\u201c Upon this branch of the case, my last legal position is this. Although the particular undertaking in dispute may be unconnected with the usual line of the business of the firm, and may have been entered into by but one partner, yet if the others <em>consented, or knowingly acquiesced, </em>the whole firm would be answerable. In such case the one may bind the\u2019 other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201cNow, to ascertain by the application of these legal principles to the facts in evidence, whether the undertaking made Mr. <em>Bonnett, </em>should fall upon the firm of <em>Mien </em>and <em>Grant, </em>let us see what the circumstances are, showing the extent and nature of the business of the firm, and whether they indicate an <em>assent </em>or <em>sanction, </em>on the part of <em>Grant ?\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">[Here the President stated and commented upon the facts connected with this part of the case.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">\u201c <em>Now, if you believe these facts, that this firm, had so extended its business, had rendered it so diffuse and multifarious, that such toas the manner of conducting its affairs, that this transaction fairly and reasonably fell within the compass of their business, the undertaking would not be fraudulent and void as relates to Grant, but would be binding on the firm. </em>If you think otherwise\", the responsibility/would not fall on the partnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-9\">\u201cWhen one partner contracts in the name of the firm in a transaction connected with the objects of the partnership, he is said to act as the <em>agent </em>of the other partners. From the evidence you have heard, do you feel justified in believing, that such an agency existed in the transaction? Do you believe, that from an extension of their business, that such were the many and multiplied objects of their partnership connexion, that <em>Mien </em>had the right and agency to bind his partner, whether he was dealing as the agent of <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker, </em>or whether he was dealing for the firm ? But more particularly, that he had the power to bind the firm, personally, in an agency business?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">\u201c Again. In pursuing this inquiry, and whilst upon the facts connected with it: Although you may think the general nature and objects of the partnership would not justify the exercise of this right by Mr. <em>Mien, </em>to bind the firm, (and if you believe it was merely an agency business, you ought to ask very strong evidence to induce you to believe there was a power in one partner to bind the firm personally,) and if it was foreign to the nature of their partnership business, did <em>Grant acquiesce </em>or <em>assent </em>to the course that was pursued <em>?\u2019i</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-12\">' With the record was returned a certificate, in these words, signed by the presiding judge. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-13\">\u201c What follows <em>I have no recollection of delivering, </em>nor it it on my notes. But Mr. <em>Baldwin </em>having it upon his notes, I am willing to adopt it upon his word. I think it all correct, and it is very probable I may have used the language.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-14\">\u201c Wh.

Latapie appears to us to have had nothing to do with the contract for transportation, and therefore, I do not see how his knowledge of the ownership of the boat could have any effect on what Bonnett had done. The responsibility arose out of the conversation with Bonnett; and Bend\u2019s telling Latapie, that Gordon </em>and <em>Walker owned the boat, could not change the na~ lure of the engagement.\u201d</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-4\"><em>Baldwin </em>and <em>Boss, </em>for the plaintiffs in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">1. That in permitting the question relative to the reputation of a general partnership between Messrs. <em>Allen </em>and <em>Grant, </em>to be put to <em>John Darragh, </em>the Court of Common Pleas had erred. General reputation may be received as corroborating evidence of a partnership, but, not to prove its extent, which can only be established fay acts. If the question was inadmissible, the manner in which it was answered cannot cure the defect. The answer was not a positive negative, but merely a declaration by the witness, that he could not answer in the affirmative, and the court, by permitting the question to be put, having laid down the law to the jury, that the extent of the partnership might be proved by general reputation, the want of the witness might have been supplied by the private information of the jury themselves; and thus the plaintiffs in error sustained a serious injury. If improper evidence be admitted, the error is not cured by subsequent evidence sufficient to establish the same fact. <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>16 <em>Johns. 89. </em>Wherever an erroneous opinion of the court is calculated to influence the jury, it may be assigned as error. <em>Deihl </em>v. <em>M\u2018Cormick, </em>8 <em>Serg. Bawle, 345. Snyder </em>v. <em>Snyder, 6 Binn. </em>499. <em>Bidgly \\. Spencer, 2 Binn. </em>70. <em>Shoffer </em>v. <em>Kritzer, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>433.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\"><em>2. </em>The subscription of Messrs. <em>Allen </em>and <em>Grant, </em>for stock in the <em>Pittsburg Navigation Company, </em>ought not to have been admitted in evidence, because it was a fact not conducing to prove, that one of the defendants had a right to bind the other as a common carrier or a freighter of goods. It was altogether irrelevant, and might have been demurred to. <em>Lickbarrow </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>1 <em>H. Bl. </em>357,8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">3. The testimony of <em>Bonnet, </em>to prove the assumption by one partner for both, was improperly admitted, because the right of one to bind the other had not been previously proved. The evidence of <em>Logan </em>did not prove it, and there was nothing else. A single instance is not sufficient to establish a general authority. 4 <em>Johns. </em>377, 379, 3S0. <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Sims, 2 Dali. </em>223.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">4. In saying that an agent is personally liable, unless his agency is declared, the court laid down the law too broadly for the circumstances of this case. It should have been left to the jury to decide from the circumstances, whether the defendants had jiot contracted .merely as agents. It is not necessary for the agent to disclose his character, where it is known to the person with whom he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>deals. The defendants were notoriously agents, which is sufficient to bring the knowledge of their character to the plaintiff1. In <em>Miles </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>1 <em>Serg. Rawle, 32, </em>it was held, that evidence might be given of the general understanding, that the drawer of a bill was merely an agent, and not to be held responsible. In the case of a public agent,\" the intent to bind him personally, must distinctly appear, or he is not personally answerable. 12 <em>Johns. </em>387, 444. 1 <em>Crunch, </em>365. And there is no difference between government agents and other agents. 15 <em>Johns. </em>1. Besides, the general notoriety of the defendants character as agents, there was much evidence in the case, from which it might have been inferred.

The vessel was known to every one to be the property of <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker, </em>and the fact of the agency was well known to <em>Latapie, </em>one of the plaintiff\u2019s agents, to whom the goods were consigned. The plaintiff, therefore, could not have been ignorant of the fact. Notwithstanding all this, however, the court laid it down as law, that unless the agency was expressly disclosed, the defendants were liable personally. They cited in the course of argument on this point, 7 <em>T. R. </em>359. 2 <em>Esp., N. P. </em>568. 4 <em>Serg. 8? Rawle, </em>331. 12 <em>Mass.

What is imputed to the court below, with respect to Lata<em>pie\u2019s </em>knowledge of the nature of the contract, was no part of the charge. The judge does not say that it was, but takes it on the word of counsel. It, therefore, is not the subject of review by this court. Admitting it to have been part of the charge it was right. If <em>Bonnet </em>made the contract, as it appears he did, it could not be affected by notice to <em>Latapie. </em>The goods belonged to <em>Rostain. </em>They were sent to <em>Bonnet </em>in order to be forwarded to <em>Nashville, </em>where they were to be delivered to Latapie. <em>Bonnet </em>made the contract of freight, with which <em>Latapie </em>had nothing to do. Even if <em>Latapie </em>had been the owner of the goods, it'would not have affected the contract made by his agent, because although the defendants did not own the vessel, they might contract for the freight.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b372-8\">Tirghman, C J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJX\">This is an a'ction brought by <em>Rostain, </em>the plaintiff below, against <em>Allen </em>and <em>Grant, </em>the plaintiffs in error, to recover damages for the loss of the plaintiff^ goods, shipped at <em>Pittsburg, </em>to be carried in a boat freighted by the defendants, to <em>Nashville, </em>in the state of <em>Tennessee. </em>The boat sunk in the <em>Monongahela </em>river, off the city of <em>Pittsburg, </em>soon after the goods were laden, in consequence of which, they were greatly damaged. The declaration contains two counts; one in which the defendants are charged as common carriers; the other, on their special assumption. The plaintiff obtained a verdict; but the counsel for the defendants took several exceptions, on points of evidence, and to the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The first exception was to the admission of the evidence, <em>c( </em>that <em>Grant </em>had subscribed in the name of <em>Allen </em>and <em>Grant, </em>for fifty shares in the <em>Pittsburg Navigation and Insurance Company.\u201d </em>In order to recover, it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove, in the first place, that <em>Allen </em>and <em>Grant </em>were partners. The defendants confessed a partnership in the <em>commission business, </em>but denied that it extended further. The plaintiff contended, that although the partnership might, in its origin, have been limited to the commission business, yet it was afterwards extended to every kind of concern in which merchants are engaged, including the carriage of goods and merchandize, from <em>Pittsburg, </em>down the river <em>Ohio. </em>Now, this might be shown, by proving that they had transacted various kinds of business out of the line of commission merchants. A single transaction of this kind, might not have been sufficient to satisfy the jury; nevertheless, the plaintiff had a right to prove one thing at a time, and thus by adding fact to fact, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>mass of testimony might have been produced, sufficient to warrant an inference of <em>general </em>partnership. The evidence offered, was an advance of one step; because it proved one transaction by the defendants, as partners, beyond the commission line. A subscription to a Navigation and Insurance Company, is certainly not commission business. The evidence, therefore, was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">2. The plaintiff having proved, that the defendants did business in partnership as commission merchants, and also bought and sold goods on their own account, (a general practice with the commission merchants of <em>Pittsburg;) </em>that they had an account opened in bank, in the name of the firm, and signed and indorsed notes in the same name, proposed to ask the following question of one of his witnesses: \u201cWas it the <em>general </em>reputation,-that the defendants dealt as partners in any business or speculation, in which capital might be advantageously employed ? To this question the defendants objected, but the court permitted it to be put to the witness, who answered, \u201c <em>that he could not answer the question in the </em>affirmative.\u201d The defendants counsel tendered an exception, which was allowed by the court. General reputation of a partnership, or of the extent of a partnership, is not evidence, except in corroboration of previous testimony. Whether a sufficient foundation had been-laid by the previous evidence in this case, it is unnecessary to decide, because, even if there had been error in admitting the question, it appears by the record, that the defendants suffered no injury from it, <em>the witness having given no evidence of general reputation. </em>I have never known a case circumstanced exactly like the present. Yet I think, principles have been established, upon which the'point before us may be safely rested. It is a general and well known principle, that a person shall not assign that for error, from which he has suffered no injury. The reason is uncontrovertible. The administration of justice is not promoted, by reversing a judgment for-an error by which no injury has been sustained. But, to bring this general rule to the point. If the party by whom evidence is offered, having obtained the court\u2019s decision in his favour, think proper to waive the evidence, the judgment shall not be reversed, though the decision was erroneous. Now, what difference does it make to the adverse party, whether the evidence is waived, or no evidence given, because the witness knew nothing? In the <em>Bank of Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Leggit, </em>7 <em>Serg. 8? JRawle, </em>2IS, a witness produced by the defendant, was rejected by the court. The plaintiff then waived his objection, and consented that the witness should be examined; but the defendant thinking that he had gained an advantage by the error of the court, refused to examine the witness, and tendered a bill of exceptions. The case having been brought before this court by writ of error, it was decided, that as it was the defendants own choice not to examine his witness, the judgment should not be reversed. The cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, support his position, that there shall be no reversal of a judgment, where no injury has been sustained. 5 <em>Co. </em>39. <em>2 Saund. </em>46. 7 <em>Johns. 182. 13 Johns. </em>517. <em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>67. 4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>498. 7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>185. But the defendant\u2019s counsel contend, that there probably was an injury sustained in this instance, because, the jury having heard the court\u2019s opinion, that general reputation was evidence, might have been influenced by <em>their own knowledge, </em>of a general reputation in <em>Pittsburg, </em>that the defendants were engaged in a <em>general part- ' nership. </em>But we must not suppose that the jury acted illegally. They were sworn to determine <em>according to the evidence; </em>that is, <em>the evidence as given upon oath, in open court. </em>Although it was once held, that a juror might determine upon facts within his own knowledge, not proved by his oath, yet that opinion has been long reprobated, in consequence of the confusion and injustice which would result from it. The parties have a right to hear the evidence, that they may have an opportunity of cross examining the witness, and contradicting him, if necessary, by other evidence. It has also been contended, on the part of the defendants, that the plaintiff had no right to have the answer of the witness inserted in the record, and consequently, this court should pay no regard to it. It is true, that our bills of exceptions, which are often drawn very inaccurately, do not usually insert the eviden.ce which has been excepted to. But on examining precedents drawn with great care, it will be found, that the most perfect form is, first to set forth the evidence which is offered, then the court\u2019s opinion in favour of its admission; and afterwards to aver, <em>that the evidence was given. </em>1 <em>Went. </em>172. 6 <em>Went. </em>131. To say, that the plaintiff had no right to place the answer of the witness on the record, is begging the question. I think he had the right, in order that it might appear, that the defendants had suffered no injury. And on full consideration, I am perfectly satisfied, that considering the whole record, it appears, that no evidence of general reputation was given, and therefore, the judgment should not be reversed, on this exception, whether the opinion of the court was right or wrong. If the slightest evidence had been given, the judgment must have been reversed; because, it is not for a court of error to weigh the evidence, or determine what influence it had on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">I come now to consider the exceptions to the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">1. The first error is, that the jury were instructed, <em>\u201c </em>that a mart who contracts with another in his own name, is personally liable, though he be an agent, unless he discloses that fact at the time of the contract.\u201d The objection is, that .the law was laid down too generally. It must be recollected, that the judge first laid down the general law of principal and agent, and then applied it to the evidence. And in order to do justice to the charge, we must take it altogether. It cannot be denied, that the general principle is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>what the court declared it to be. The agent is personally liable, unless he gives notice that he contracts as an agent, and names his principal. That the law must be so, is self evident; because, the other party may have confidence in the agent, but no confidence in the principal; he ought, therefore, to be informed of the principal, that he may elect whether he will trust him or not. There may be cases, where the general law admits of distinction, but it does not appear that it was necessary to notice them in this charge. It cannot be expected that a judge should write a complete treatise on the law of agency. It is enough, if he instructs the jury in such a manner as not to mislead them. <em>Bonnett, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s agent, swore that he contracted with <em>Allen, </em>as he understood, for the house of <em>Grant </em>and <em>Allen, </em>personally; that he knew them not as <em>agents, </em>but trusted to <em>them, alone. </em>If the defendants\u2019 counsel supposed, that their case might be distinguished by any particular circumstances, they had a right to propose those circumstances hypothetically, and ask the court\u2019s opinion of the law. And on one point they did ask it, and received an answer, which will be considered hereafter. But in the general instruction on the law of principal and agent, there certainly was no error, and therefore, the first exception has not been supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">2. The second error'is, in charging, \u201c that a personal liability arose from the conversation between <em>Bonnett </em>and <em>Allen.\" </em>This is pretty much the same as the first. When <em>Bonnett </em>made the contract with <em>Allen, </em>there was no mention of an agency. The liability, therefore, was personal. But whether the liability was confined to <em>Allen, </em>or included his partner, <em>Grant, </em>was another question which does not fall within the scope of their objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">3. \u201c The court left it to the jury, to say, from all the evidence, whether <em>Allen </em>had a right to bind his partner.\u201d I confess, I do not see how the court could have done otherwise. For, whether <em>Allen </em>had that right, depended on facts, which the jury alone could determine. They were instructed as to the nature of partnership, and told, that a bare partnership in the commission business, would not authorize one partner to bind the other in a contract of affreightment. But whether the original partnership between the defendants as commission merchants, had been extended so far as to embrace the contract in question, or supposing it had not, whether <em>Grant </em>had not consented to this particular contract, were facts which the court could not decide. The evidence on both sides was summed up by the court, and the case fairly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">4. \u201cThe court left it to the jury to presume the <em>acquiescence </em>of <em>Grant, </em>when there was no evidence to justify such inference.\u201d This exception is founded on a distinction, rather hypercritical; a distinction between <em>consent </em>and <em>acquiescence. Acquiescence, </em>it is said, must be <em>subsequent </em>to the contract, and there was no evidence of any act, or declaration of <em>Grant subsequent </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>contract, in this instance; although there was evidence, and strong evidence <em>o\u00ed precedent </em>consent. To judge fairly of the charge, we must attend to the judge\u2019s expressions. \u201cAlthough the particular undertaking in dispute may be unconnected with the usual line of the business of the firm, and may have been entered into by but one partner, yet if the other <em>consented, or knowingly acquiesced, </em>the whole firm would be answerable. And again, \u201cIf you believe it was merely an <em>agency business, </em>you ought to ask very strong evidence, to induce you to believe there was a power in one partner to bind the firm personally; and, if it was foreign to the nature of their partnership business, did <em>Grant acquiesce </em>in, or <em>assent </em>to the course that was pursued?\u201d Surely the defendants have no right to complain of this part of the charge, considering the evidence which had been given. It had been proved by <em>David Logan, </em>that some time previous to the contract with the defendants, <em>Grant </em>called on him, and. said, he should have a boat to load for <em>Nashville, </em>and asked whether the witness had any goods for freight; <em>Lagan </em>then asked him, <em>who would sign the receipt, </em>to which <em>Grant </em>answered, <em>11 we wiV.\u201d </em>This looked very much like an assurance that both partners should be personally bound, and if the \u25a0jury should so construe it, they would be authorized in inferring a consent to a contract to bind the-firm, to be made by <em>Mien </em>with the plaintiff. Now, whether you call it <em>consent </em>or <em>acquiescence, </em>is not material. Surely a judgment should not be reversed, on a verbal criticism of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">5. The last exception, is to the opinion of the court, \u201c that although <em>Latapie, </em>an agent of the plaintiff, to whom the goods were to be consigned on their arrival at <em>Nashville, </em>knew that the boat which carried them, belonged to the house of <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Walker, </em>at <em>Nashville, </em>it could have no effect on the contract made by <em>Bonnett </em>with the defendants.\u201d It is to be observed, that whatever the contract between <em>Boiinett </em>and the defendants was, <em>Latapie </em>never interfered in it. There was no evidence whatever, of his having taken any part in it. Then, how could that contract be affected by <em>Latapie\u2019s </em>knowledge of the persons to whom the boat belonged ? Might not the defendants bind themselves personally, although they acted as agents for <em>Gordon </em>and- <em>Walker? </em>And if they did so bind themselves, was the contract tobo dissolved, by <em>Latapie\u2019s </em>knowledge of the owners of the boat ? <em>Bonnett </em>and <em>Latapie </em>were both agents of the plaintiff; but for different purposes. <em>Bon-</em>Mfiii received the goods at <em>Pittsburg, </em>and contracted for their carriage to <em>Nashville Latapie </em>was the consignee, to receive, and sell them at <em>Nashville. Latapie\u2019s </em>knowledge, therefore, of the owners of the boat, would have been perfectly consistent with the contract of the defendants; whereby they were personally bound for the carriage. Although I have given my opinion on this last exception, yet I must remark, that I do not consider it as being properly on the record. The judge certifies, \u201c that he has no recollection of having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>given such matter in charge, but as it is in Mr. <em>Baldwin\u2019s </em>notes, he is willing to adopt it, on his word; that he thinks it all correct, and very probably he may have used the language.\u201d If the point of law had been doubtful, this court would have been bound to. send the record back, to give the Court of Common Pleas an opportunity of certifying <em>positively </em>whether the matter excepted to, was given in charge or not. On the whole, I perceive no error, and am of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. '</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
