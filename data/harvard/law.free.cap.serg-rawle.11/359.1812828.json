On the 21st of May, notice of the taxation of additional costs was given to the defendant, and on the same day, they were taxed in the presence of both parties, but the defendant did not pay them.

That would be a fraud on the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">The judgment in this case is to be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
