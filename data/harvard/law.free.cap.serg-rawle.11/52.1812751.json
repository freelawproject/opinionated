It was also a subject of inquiry for the jury, whether the defendant was privy to the giving up of the bond for 1000 dollars by B-, and assented to it; for if he did assent to it, he was not discharged from his responsibility, though it seems, he would have been discharged if the first bond had been given up, and the second taken without his knowledge.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-9\">Error to the Common Pleas of <em>Chester </em>county, in an action brought by the executors of <em>Ephraim Mien, </em>deceased, against <em>Thomas Bull, </em>orr an assumption made by the said <em>Thomas </em>to the said <em>Ephraim, </em>to indemnify him against a bond in which the said <em>Ephraim </em>became bound to a certain <em>Joseph ff.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjE\">The first error assigned is, that the two first counts in the declaration, are bad, because no consideration is shown for the defendant\u2019s assumption. The first count states, that <em>Bull, </em>hi consideration that <em>Mien, </em>at his special instance and request, would become bound to <em>Brinton </em>by his writing obligatory, in the sum of 2000 dollars, conditioned for the payment of 1000 dollars, on the 2d of <em>February, </em>1816, assumed upon himself, and promised the said <em>Mien, </em>to indemnify and save him harmless from all loss by the said writing obligatory. It is then averred, that <em>Mien, </em>giving credit to the said assumption, did become bound to the said <em>Brinton, </em>in the bond above.described, and that <em>Bull </em>had failed in the performance of his promise, suit having been brought on it&gt; 'and'the executors of \u00ab#//ew having been compelled to pay the money mentioned in the condition. It is objected by the defendant, that it does not appear on'what accoifnt the bond was given, and perhaps it might have been-for money borrowed by <em>Mien </em>of <em>Brinton, </em>on his own account.- This, to be sure, is a most extraordinary conjecture. That <em>Bull </em>should have requested <em>Mien </em>to give his bond for money borrowed <em>by Mien himself </em>is against all reason and probability. The presumption is, especially after verdict, that the money went to the use of <em>Bull, </em>or some friend of- his. There is nothing in the objection. The second count differs from the first in some respects. It states, that <em>Bull, </em>being a Manager and President of <em>\u201c The Little Conestogoe Turnpike Company,\u201d </em>and <em>Mien </em>being the agent of the Company, a loan of money, 1000 dollars, having been negotiated with <em>Brinton, </em>for the use of the Company, <em>Bull, </em>in consideration that <em>Mien </em>would become bound to <em>Brinton </em>in a writing obligatory, (such as is described in the first count,) promised to indemnify him; and that <em>Mien, </em>trusting to his promise, did become bound, &amp;c. A breach is then set forth, as in the first count. Now, here is a plain consideration. <em>Bull </em>was President, and consequently, a stockholder in the Company, and the money was borrowed for the use of the Company. <em>Bull, </em>therefore, had an interest in the loan. <em>Mien\u2019s </em>being an agent, was no reason why he should become personally responsible for the debt of the Company. It was prudent to require indemnity, and the benefit which <em>Bull </em>received from the loan was a sufficient cause for his giving an indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The other errors assigned are to the charge of the court, which renders it necessary that I should state the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The.plaintiff gave parol evidence, which in the opinion of his counsel, was sufficient to prove the assumption laid in the declaration. This was denied by the counsel for the defendant;-and whether it was proved or not, was a question for the jury. It was proved, that the sum of 1000 dollars, for which <em>Mien </em>gave his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>bond to <em>Brinton, </em>was paid by <em>Brinton </em>to <em>Allen, </em>and by <em>Allen </em>to the treasurer of the Turnpike Company, for which he received the bond of the Company, payable to himself. This bond was after-wards given up by <em>Allen, </em>and the debt of 1000 dollars, as well as other debts, to other persons, were included in another bona for J0,000 dollars, given by the Turnpike Company to <em>Josiah Kirk </em>and <em>Randolph Harley. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel alleged, that this bond for 10,000 dollars, was given to <em>Kirk </em>and Harley, in trust for the several persons whose debts were included in it. But there was no express proof of that. Neither was it proved, that <em>Alien </em>transferred the Company\u2019s bo.nd for 1000 dollars to <em>Kirk </em>and <em>Harley, </em>or that he received any other consideration for giving it up, than the bond to <em>Kirk </em>and <em>Harley, </em>in which it was included. The defendants counsel prayed the court to charge the jury, <em>First, </em>\u201c That the loaning the 1000 dollars, by <em>Allen </em>to' the Company, instead of applying it to the Company\u2019s purposes, was an appropriation thereof to his own use, and discharged the defendant from his assumption.\u201d Th&lt;? court decided this point in the negative, and undoubtedly they were right. The money was borrowed of <em>Brinton </em>for the use of the Company, and <em>Allen </em>paid it to their treasurer. This was exactly according to the intent of all parties. When it was in the treasury, the managers might place it in the hands of their agent, or make whatever use of it they pleased. But it was necessary, for the defendant\u2019s sake, that the Company should give bond for it; and as they received it from <em>Alien, </em>it was <em>very </em>proper that the bond should be given to him. <em>Brinton </em>would not lake their bond. He preferred the bond of <em>Allen, </em>and as the defendant was to indemnify <em>Allen, </em>he would be entitled to the benefit of the Company\u2019s bond, in case he should have to pay the money, in consequence of his assumption to <em>Allen. </em>To say then, that the defendant was discharged from his assumption, by <em>Allen\u2019s </em>act, in receiving a bond from the Company, is in contradiction to the intent of the parties, manifested by all the circumstances of the transaction. The second point on which the defendant\u2019s counsel prayed the court\u2019s direction to the jury, was the same, in substance, as the first, though a little varied in form. It is unnecessary, therefore, to take further notice of it. In the third place, the court was requested to instruct the jury, \u201cthat putting the amount of the 1000 dollar bond, into the bond for 10,000 dollars, and giving up the former, and amalgamating that moneyj with the money of other persons, is a discharge of the defendant from all liability for any promise to indemnify, that has been proved.\u201d The court refused to give this instruction to the jury, because the law was not so. The defendant\u2019s counsel asked too much of the court. They asked the court to decide all the facts in the cause. As to the supposed amalgamation, by joining several debts in one bond, there is nothing in it. Each person whose debt was included, might know his own share; and it was a matter susceptible of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>proof. Whether the large bond was taken in trust for <em>Mien, </em>and other persons whose debts were covered by it, was a fair subject of inquiry, and the jury alone could decide it. There was another very material circumstance too : was the defendant privy to the giving up of the 1000 dollar bond, by <em>Mien, </em>and did he assent to it? If lie did, there is no pretence for saying that he was discharged from his responsibility by that circumstance. That he was privy to it, is probable, because he was President of the Turnpike Company. I agree, that if <em>Mien, </em>without consulting the defendant, and without his knowledge,- had given up the first bond, and taken a second, by which the time of payment was prolonged, the de-fendant would have been discharged, because he was, in substance, <em>Security for the Company. </em>But this also was a matter for the juryl and the defendant\u2019s counsel were wrong in requesting the court'to charge peremptorily, that the defendant was discharged from his assumption. The point should have been proposed hypothetically. \u201cIf the jury should be of opinion, that the first bond was given up, and the second taken, without the knowledge of the defendant, then the defendant was discharged.\u201d The second bond was putjn suit, and judgment obtained against the Turnpike Company, .very soon after its date. So that it may well be, that it was' intended for the benefit of the defendant,- as well as of all the other persons whose debts were included in it. I am of opinion, on the whole, that the plaintiff in error has not supported any of his ex^ ceptions, and therefore, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AuU\"><em>Edwards </em>and <em>Kittera </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6S\"><em>Dillingham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Judgment affirmed\u00bb-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
