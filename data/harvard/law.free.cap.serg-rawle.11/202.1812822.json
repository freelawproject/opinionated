The case was summitted to the court below, on the facts proved; and it must be presumed that the verdict was so taken by consent. Where the parties agree to submit a matter to the court, their decision upon it is not subject to review on writ of error. <em>3 El.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoWm\">In this case the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 517 dollars damages, and six cents costs, <em>&lt;\u00a3subject to the opinion of the court on the facts proved. </em>\u201d What these facts were, we know not; so that it is impossible for us to say, whether the judgment, was right or wrong. If such a verdict could be supported, the party against whom judgment was given, would be cut off from the benefit of a writ of error. The jury have no right to throw the facts and the law, on the court, though they may find the facts and submit the law. \u2022 But in such case, the facts appearing of record, either party may have a writ of error. In the present case, nothing is found absolutely. The damages are not assessed absolutely, but subject to the court\u2019s opinion on facis which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>do not appear. It is an imperfect verdict. The <em>parties </em>may submit their cause to the court, in vvhat manner they please, <em>by consent; </em>and if they think proper to submit it, so as to preclude each other from a writ of error, it is all very well. But nothing of that kind appears here. We find nothing on the record but the verdict and judgment. In the case of <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>at <em>May </em>Term, 1822, there was a verdict for the plaintiff in an ejectment, <em>\u201c subject to the opinion of the court,\u201d </em>without any mention of facts. We reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. The. case before us falls within the same principle. A reference to <em>facts proved, </em>without stating these facts, is no better than if facts had not been mentioned at all. It is the opinion of the court, that the Judgment should be reversed and <em>a venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Judgment.reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
