They also offered to prove, that <em>Myers, </em>at the time he subscribed for the stock, was intoxicated, 'and not <em>in </em>a fit situation to enter into a contract. This evidence was likewise objected to, but admitted by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-12\">To meet the plea of the pendency of another suit, the plaintiffs produced the record, by which it appeared, that that suit had been terminated by the agreement of the parties. The defendants\u2019 counsel, tq rebut this evidence, offered to prove, that the entry on the docket, stating that the. suit had been settled by agreement, had been made by order of the court, against the consent of the defendant and his counsel. This evidence, being objected to by the counsel for the plaintiffs, the court overruled the objection, and seale,d another bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Five errors were assigned on the argument in this court, which, however, may be resolved into two. ^</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-5\">^ <em>Norris </em>and <em>Weidman, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-6\">1. The evidence admitted by the court below, had no relation to the issue then trying on the article of agreement, but to <em>Myers\u2019 </em>original subscription. It was not evidence under the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>because it did not tend to show, that the deed was void <em>ab initio. </em>Nor was it evidence under the plea of covenants performed, or <em>non infregit conventiones; </em>under which the defendant is confined to proof, that he has performed the covenants, or never broken them. The evidence given by the defendant, went to open the dispute about his original subscription, which had been closed by the agreement, on which suit was brought. <em>Peake\u2019s Evid. </em>264, 265. 1 <em>Mass. Rep. 5. Bender </em>v. <em>Fromberger, </em>4 <em>Dali. </em>439. 1 <em>Chilly on PI. </em>482. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>3 <em>Serg. 8? Ra\u00edale, 332.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-7\"><em>2. </em>The agreement filed of record, was binding on the plaintiffs, and should be equally so on the defendant. It admitted of no parol explanation, and it was clearly error to permit evidence to go to the jury, which went to contradict the record.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-8\"><em>Wright </em>and <em>Fisher, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-9\">1. Under the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>the defendants had a right to avoid the deed, by showing that the recitals it contained were false, and that the defendant never did subscribe for the twenty-five shares of stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-10\">2. The evidence given in relation to the docket entry, was not offered to contradict the judgment of the court, but to show the inaccuracy of a memorandum of the clerk, which formed no part of the record. The plaintiffs having produced the record, the object of the defendants, was to explain the entry so far as to show that their testator did not assent to it. Parol evidence was necessary, to show what paper was referred to by the entry, <em>\u201c as per agreement filed. \u201d</em></summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b124-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b124-12\">Gtbson, J,</author>\n<p id=\"ASFM\">In the five errors assigned in this cause, there <em>are, in </em>reality, but two points. <em>Meyers, </em>the testator of the defendant, when intoxicated, as it is supposed, had subscribed twenty-five shares of the stock of the corporation that prosecutes this action; and for which, supposing himself to have been imposed on, he refused to pay. An action was commenced against him, pending which, a compromise was effected, and articles of agreement were-executed; by which it was covenanted, that <em>Meyers </em>should retain and pay for the shares subscribed by him, and that the parties should each pay a moiety of the costs incurred in the action then pending; and on these articles the present action is brought. The defendants pleaded <em>non est factum, </em>covenants performed, and the pendency of another action for the same <em>cause; </em>and at the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>offered evidence of circumstances relating exclusively to the original subscription; which, after objection by the plaintiffs, was permitted to go to the jury. Nothing can be clearer, than that this evidence, having no rel\u00e1tion to the issues, was incompetent. What operation'a recurrence to the original grounds of controversy, which had been compromised, could have on the technical question of the articles, to which the defendants\u2019 pleas had regard, except to mislead the jury by their prejudices, I am at a loss to discover. If there were fraud or unfair practice, <em>at the execution of the articles, </em>that would be material; and evidence of it, competent at least, if it were specially pleaded. But the evidence related to a period long anterior to the compromise; and there is error in. the admission of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Then, as to the other point. The defendants, having pleaded the pendency of the suit founded on the original subscription, in abatement, the plaintiffs produced the record; by which it appeared, that suit had been ended by the agreement of the parties; and, to rebut this, the defendants offered to prove, that neither <em>Meyers </em>nor his counsel had assented to the entry, but that it had been made by direction of the court, and against their will, as openly expressed at the time. This' evidence was objected to, but admitted. Now, beside the consideration that the record imported absolute verity, and was not to be explained away by extrinsic proof, the evidence offered, proved nothing. Take it that the defendant did object to the entry, still it was made, and, in fact, put an end to the suit. But the plaintiffs had a right to end their suit without the consent of the defendant; and this particular entry, no matter whether it were made with a fraudulent intent or not, would have the effect of precluding the plaintiffs from ever prosecuting it afterwards. Now, this was the only material fact connected with the record; and the court, after ascertaining that the former suit was at an end, should have gone no farther: for it was altogether immaterial to inquire, <em>how </em>it came to be at an end, or whether by the consent of the defendant or not. For these reasons, the judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
