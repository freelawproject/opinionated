On the 17th of <em>March, 1795, </em>C., by deed, conveyed part of these lands to D., with covenants of special warranty, and for further assurance. On the 12th of <em>July, </em>1795, E., who was interested in the concern with A. and B., and who had taken out the warrants and patents in his own name, conveyed the legal title to C., who, on the 14th of <em>November, </em>following, executed bonds to A., B., and E., and a mortgage to A. and B., to secure these bonds, and other debts. When the articles of agreement, and the conveyance to D. were executed, the lands \u2022were situated in the county of <em>JY., </em>but whe the conveyance from E. to C., and the bonds and mortgage were executed, they were situated in the county of A., which was taken from <em>JY., </em>and erected into a county, 13th of <em>April, </em>1795. The deed from C. to D. was recorded in the county of <em>JY., </em>17th of <em>September, </em>1795. The deed from C. to E. was recorded in the county of A., 18th of <em>Octn. her, </em>1795, and the mortgage from C. to A. and B. on the 20th of the same month. A judgment was afterwards obtained on the mortgage, and the lands was* sold under a <em>levari facias </em>to B. and E. <em>Held, </em>'that the conveyance from C. to 15., and the subsequent conveyance of the legal title from E. to C. did not vest in 15. a title clear of the incumbrance of the mortgage, and that therefore C. was not entitled to recover in ejectment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-18\">On th\u00e9 return of a writ of error to the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Indiana </em>county, in an ejectment brought by the plaintiff in error, against the defendant in error, many exceptions were taken to the opinion of the court, as well on questions of evidence, as in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>instructions to the jury, on points submitted by the counsel of the plaintiff in error. To understand, however, the point upon which the judgment of this court <em>turns, </em>it is only necessary to state the following facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">By articles of agreement, dated <em>7th </em>of <em>September, </em>1794, <em>William Parker, </em>and <em>Moore Wharton, </em>of the city of <em>Philadelphia, </em>sold to the late <em>James Wilson, </em>107,400 <em>acres of </em>land, in diffe-* rent parts of the state, and covenanted that they would have the patents taken out in his name; in consideration of which, he covenanted to pay them at the rate of seven shillings and sixpence an acre, with interest, from the 14th of <em>May, then </em>past, and to execute other bonds for the purchase-money, and a mortgage on these lands, or others of equal value, as a security. On the 17th of <em>March, </em>1795, Judge <em>Wilson, </em>in consideration of the sum of five pounds, as recited in the deed; but in reality of a large sum in shares of the stock of the Bank of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>which were transferred to him; conveyed thirty-six tracts of these lands, containing 37,122 acres, and including the land in dispute, to <em>Benjamin Chew, </em>the plaintiff, with covenants of special wari\u2019anty, and for further assurance. On this title the plaintiff\u2019s claim was founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">On the 12th of <em>July, </em>1795, <em>J\u00e9remiah Parker, </em>one of the defendants below, who was concerned with <em>William Parker </em>and <em>Moore Wharton, </em>and who took out the warrants and patents in his own name, conveyed to Judge <em>Wilson </em>the legal title to th\u00e9 lands, which <em>Wilson </em>had previously conveyed to Mr. <em>Chew; </em>and on the 14th of <em>October, </em>1795, Judge <em>Wilson </em>executed bonds to <em>Jeremiah Par-Jeer </em>for 25,122 dollars; and <em>William Parker </em>and <em>Moore Wharton </em>for 12,000 dollars; and a mortgage to the two latter, of these and other lands, to secure the payment of the above-mentioned lands, and other debts to a large amount. The bonds bore date the 13th of the preceding <em>July, </em>but there was evidence of their having been executed at the same time as the mortgage. At the time of the execution of the articles of agreement, and of the conveyance to Mr. <em>Chew, </em>the land lay in <em>Northumberland </em>county; but when the conveyance by <em>Jeremiah Parker </em>to Judge <em>Wilson, </em>and the lands and mortgage were executed, it was situated in <em>Lycoming </em>county; which was separated from <em>Northumberland, </em>and erected into a eounty on the 13th of <em>Jlpril, </em>1795. Upon a subsequent division of the county of <em>Lycoming, </em>the land in dispute fell within the new county of <em>Indiana. </em>The deed from Judge <em>Wilson </em>to Mr. <em>Chew </em>was recorded in <em>Northumberland </em>county, the 7th of <em>September, 1795. </em>The deed from <em>Jeremiah Parker </em>to Judge <em>Wilson </em>was recorded in <em>Lycoming </em>county, on the 18th of <em>October, </em>1795; and the mortgage from the latter to Messrs. <em>Parker </em>and <em>Wilson </em>was recorded in the same county, on the 20th of the same month, in the same year. In <em>November </em>Term, 1801, <em>&amp; scire facias </em>issued on the mortgage, and judgment was obtained at <em>August </em>Term, 1803. A <em>levari facias </em>issued in course, and the land was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>sold on the 20th of the following <em>October, </em>for 3,500 dollars, to <em>Jeremiah Parker, </em>and <em>Moore Wharton, </em>on which title the defendants rested their defence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-5\">The cause was argued in this court by <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Ross </em>for the plaintiff in error, and by <em>Foster </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">Tilg-hman, C.

His deed, therefore, passed to Mr- <em>Chew </em>only an equitable title. But it is said the subsequent conveyance from <em>Jeremiah Parker </em>to Judge <em>Wilson </em>enured to the benefit of Mr. <em>Chew. </em>It did so; but only in equity, and to entitle him to call for a conveyance from Judge <em>Wilson ; </em>and not as vesting the title in him of itself, as contended, <em>by </em>estoppel. The facts presented constitute the ordinary case of a conveyance before the grantor has acquired the title; in which the conveyance operates as <em>an agreement </em>to convey, which, when the title has been subsequently acquired, may be enforced in chancery. But Judge <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>act could not prejudice the original vendors, who had a title under the articles to call on him for a mortgage to secure the purchase-money. In equity, whatever ought to be done is considered as actually done; and this maxim is of_ peculiar force, and the foundation of all equitable practice, in this state, where we have no court of chancery to compel performance of what a party ought in conscience to perform; but it is so, only for the purpose of giving parties a common law remedy on an equitable title, and not of affecting their rights; for in every other respect the distinction between legal and equitable titles is as accurately marked, and as carefully preserved, here as in <em>England. </em>For the purpose of maintaining an ejectment, therefore, Mr. <em>Chew </em>is to be considered as having got in the legal title but for no other purpose whatever! But it is argued, that as the deed to Mr. <em>Chew </em>contains a covenant for further assurance, it is to be considered as a covenant to stand seised to the use of the grantee; and consequently, that the estate was executed in him as soon as the seisin arose out of which the use was to be served. It is true, that no particular form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of words is essential to a conveyance to uses; but the deed, if it cannot operate in one way, may in another, to effectuate the manifest intention of the grantor. But here there is not a single feature of a covenant to stand seized, the consideration of which is always blood or marriage; nor is there any of a bargain and sale, where the consideration is valuable; for in every conveyance to uses the covenantor or bargainor <em>must be seised of the legal estate at the time; </em>as the use must arise out of such seisin. In the case of a conveyance before the grantor has acquired the title, the legal estate is not transferred by the statute of uses; but the conveyance operates, as I have said, as an agreement, which the grantee is entitled to have executed in chancery: as was decided in <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Fausset, </em>1 Ves. <em>Rep. </em>391. Mr <em>.Chew, </em>therefore, never acquired any thing but Judge <em>VFilson\u2019s </em>equitable title; and he held it subject to the countervailing equities to which it was subject in' the hands of Judge <em>Wilson </em>himself. When the mortgage was executed, the legal title was in the mortgagor; and even if the equity between Mr. <em>Cheto </em>and the mortgagees were equal, the mortgage, being a legal incumbrance, would prevail. But, that the equity between them was equal, cannot be admitted. The conveyance of the legal title to the mortgagor, was made expressly with a view to receive a mortgage from Judge <em>Wilson, </em>in pursuance of his covenant entered into previously to his conveyance to Mr. <em>Chew; </em>and with respect to equitable rights, the maxim of <em>prior in tempore, potior in jure, </em>is always decisive where neither of the parties has a better right than the other to call for the legal estate <em>Brace </em>v. <em>The Duchess of Marlborough, </em>2 <em>P. Wms. </em>495. <em>Tourville </em>v. <em>Naish, </em>3 <em>P. Wms. </em>307. <em>Earl of Pomfret v. Lord Windsor, </em>2 <em>Nes. Rep. </em>486. Nothing could postpone the mortgagees but actual or legal fraud; such as any act on their part to induce Mr. <em>Chew </em>to think he was buying a clear title. But even had Judge <em>Wilson </em>conveyed the legal title to Mr. <em>Chew </em>immediately after he received it from <em>Jeremiah Parker, </em>and before he executed the mortgage, Mr. <em>Chew </em>would still have stood in Judge <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>place, and have been subject to the coercion of a chancellor, who would have compelled him to execute the mortgage in his stead. The reason is, that when he paid his money, he was the purchaser of an inchoate title; and there is no rule in equity more firmly established, than that such purchaser must stand or fall by the case of the person from whom he purchased. This was held in <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Fausset, before </em>cited; a leading case, which has never <em>been </em>denied. When we hear, therefore, of a purchaser for a valuable consideration, taking the title free of every trust or equity of which he had not notice, it is intended that he is the purchaser of a title perfect on its face; for every purchaser of an imperfect title takes it with all its imperfections on its head. It is his own fault that he confides in a title which appears defective to his own eyes; and he does so at his peril. Now, every equitable title is incomplete on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>its face; it is in truth nothing more than a title to go into chancery, to have the legal estate conveyed; and, therefore, every purchaser of a mere equity takes it subject to every , clog that may lie on it, whether he has had notice of it or not. But the purchaser of a legal title, takes it discharged of every trust or equity which does not appear oh the face of the conveyance, and of which he has not had notice, either actual or constructive,</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">These few elementary principles go to the marrow of the cause,' and serve to decide every question which necessarily arises in it. The deed from Judge <em>Wilson </em>did not pass a title to Mr. <em>Chew </em>free of the covenants in the articles, and the mortgage consequently was a lien. The effect of recording this deed in <em>Northumberland, </em>and of recording that from <em>Jeremiah Parker </em>to Judge <em>Wilson </em>in <em>Lycoming, </em>was altogether immaterial. Notice, or the want of it, after the parties had respectively closed their contracts, and Mr. <em>Chew </em>had paid his money, would be attended with no consequences. So, the inquiry, whether Mr. <em>Chew </em>was apprized of the existence of the articles, was entirely irrelevant. He was bound to examine the title which he purchased; instead of doing which, he relied on representations, which turn out to have been without foundation in fact. An inquiry into the title would have led to a knowledge that it was merely equitable, and subject to the covenants in favour of the original vendors. It was also immaterial whether the bonds and mortgage were executed at the date of the conveyance from <em>Jeremiah Parker, </em>or at any indefinite period afterwards. A purchaser from Judge <em>Wilson </em>for a valuable consideration, and without notice, between the time the legal title was vested in him, and the date of the mortgage, would, perhaps, have not been affected; but this was not Mr. <em>Chew\u2019s </em>case. He had paid his money long before for the title which Judge <em>Wilson </em>then had, and so far stood in his place, that a conveyance of the legal title, when acquired by the deed from <em>Jeremiah Parker, </em>would have made him a trustee, and subject him in chancery to Judge <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>covenants. Had the two <em>Parkers, </em>and <em>Moore Wharton </em>stood by, while Judge <em>Wilson </em>was selling his title as perfect and complete, whether their\" object were to obtain payment from the funds advanced by Mr. <em>Chew </em>or not, it would have made a very different ease; but as the matter appears on the facts in evidence, it is clear the sale on the mortgage vested in the purchasers all the interest which at any time was in Judge <em>Wilson. </em>Their title is in every respect paramount to that of Mr. <em>Chew.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em>\u25a0 </em>What I have said embraces every matter of substance in the long and complicated assignment of error in respect of the charge. There were, beside, bills of exceptions to evidence, which have either not been pressed, or not sustained. It is, therefore, the opinion of the court, that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Judgment affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
