That decision covers the present case; for by the proviso contained in the warrant of attorney, which, according to the usual practice, was filed and formed part of the record, and of which all persons were bound to fake notice, execution was to be staid until the 1st of <em>December, </em>1819,. within five years from which time, the <em>scire facias </em>was sued out. It was the business of the clerk to enter particularly on his docket the date and tenor of the instrument, on which .the judgment was founded, together with such stay of execution as may be. therein mentioned.

If he has omitted to perform his duty in this respect, it ought not to prejudice the.plaintiff, who fias done all the law required of him. It is at most a mere clerical error, the amendment of which can injure no one, since the stay of execution being upon the record, there was as full constructive notice of its existence, as if if had been spread upon the docket. Amendments, analagous,to th\u00e1t now asked for, have often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>been m\u00e1de, and sometimes even where third persons were affected by them. 1 <em>Caines </em>9, <em>Close </em>v, <em>Gillespey. </em>3 <em>John. </em>526, <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Shirtliffe. </em>1 <em>Dali. </em>227, <em>Shorty.

This application is made more than five years after the entry of the judgment, and the court has no power to amend it, in favour of a plaintiff who has been guilty of such laches. The judgment was entered on the 5th <em>December, </em>1818, and by the express terms of the act of 4th <em>Jlpril, </em>1798, sec. 2. 3 <em>Sm. L. </em>331, constitutes a lien on the defendant\u2019s real estate, during five years from the firstday of the preceding <em>March </em>Term, unless there was something on the face of it to take it out of the general rule. A <em>cesset exeevtio, </em>it has been decided, will postpone the commencement of the five years, until execution can issue, but in such a case the <em>cesset </em>must distinctly appear upon the record, so that none may be deceived. It is not enough that it be filed among the papers of the prothonotary\u2019s office, which being a voluntary act, not required by law, makes it no part of the record. The docliet is our record, and if it be not found there, it does not exist as regards subsequent purchasers and incumbrancers. On the docket there was nothing to show what was the day of payment. Suppose a person about to purchase should examine the record, and finding the lien of this judgment expired, should take a deed and pay the purchase money, would the court afterwards permit the judgment to be amended and strip him of his property? This would hardly be contended. In <em>England </em>a judgment cannot be amended, even by the alteration of a single letter, so as to prejudice a purchaser. <em>Salev.

But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>clearly we cannot deprive subsequent judgment creditors or mortgagees, of any legal advantage which they may have obtained. It is settled, that a judgment creditor can avail himself of the expiration of the lien, whenever the land would be discharged in the hands of the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Now, what information of the duration of the lien beyond the five years from the date of the judgment, could be obtained by a purchaser from the face of the docket, I am at a loss to discover.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The warrant of attorney, which contains the stipulation for a stay of execution, was filed in the-office, but there is neither a direct reference to it, nor any thing else to put a party on inquiry, or to induce him to search further. The act does not require, either the bond or warrant to be filed, and a purchaser is, therefore, not bound to suppose, that either is actually filed. But I am not prepared t\u00f3 say, he would be prejudiced, even if there was a reference to a paper containing the terms on which the judgment was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">It is going far enough for the creditor to decide, that his judgment may be extended beyond the time limited by the letter of the act, where the <em>cesset </em>appears palpably plain on the record, and where there can be no possibility of danger to a purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">In <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>we carried the construction thus far, to fulfil what we were persuaded was the actual intention of the legislature^ although not expressed in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">There the terms of the <em>cesset </em>were spread on the docket, and it was impossible that a purchaser, or any one else, could be injured or deceived by supposing that the judgment was discharged. Further than this I am not disposed to go, as it would lead to injustice. <em>Helvete </em>and <em>Rapp </em>is entirely consistent with this doctrine ; for there the judgment was not held good by relation to the bond, which was filed, but the entry on, the record itself, contained the substance of the bond, as well as the substantial requisites of a judgment. The dispute was, as to the effect of the entry as it stood, and as t^e defect was entirely in- matter of form, it was held, that it should not prejudice the judgment creditor; the entry being sufficient to put a purchaser on his guard. We are of opinion that the amendment be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Motions denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
