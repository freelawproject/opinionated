Two of these tracts, one in \u25a0 the name of <em>Jones, the </em>other in the name of <em>Catharall, </em>were purchased by the defendant, <em>Hauser, </em>of <em>Matlock, </em>who executed a deed of conveyance to him, dated 2d of <em>March, </em>1795. The plaintiff, <em>Benner, </em>purchased also of <em>Matlock, </em>part-of the said five tracts, and received a deed of conveyance, dated 2d of <em>May, </em>1792. It turned out, that according to the lines marked upon the, ground, the five surveys contained several hundred acres more than the returns called for, and both the plaintiff and defendants had considerably more land, than was supposed when they purchased of <em>Matlock. </em>Their dispute was concerning their boundaries, and particularly as to the situation of a <em>corner pine tr'ee. </em>The defendants offered to prove, by the oath of <em>Robert Moore, </em>that in the year 1788, .at the request of <em>Matlock, </em>(who was in search of'the line between the land he had sold to <em>Hauser, </em>and his other land,) he showed him this corner pine, and that <em>Matlock </em>said, <em>that would do, </em>and ran from it, on an eastern course. They also offered to prove, by the same witness, that at the time he showed the pine to <em>Matlack, Hauser </em>was in possession of theftracts in the name of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Catharall, </em>which he had purchased of <em>Mat-lock, </em>and had made valuable improvements on them.' To this evidence the plaintiff objected, and the court having admitted it, he excepted to their opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">The defendants offered in evidence, the deposition of <em>Joshua Elder, </em>which stated, that the deponent was appointed a deputy surveyor in the then county of <em>Cumberland, </em>now <em>Indiana </em>county, in the'beginning of the year 1769, and acted in that capacity until the revolution, after which, he was appointed deputy surveyor of the same district, and continued in that office until the year 1790: That during the time he acted as deputy surveyor, it was customary to include much larger quantities of land in surveys, than were mentioned in the warrants: That he frequently surveyed two hundred acres on a warrant for one hundred acres, and never had any difficulty in having the return received in the surveyor general\u2019s office, provided the land was vacant, and there were no interfering claims, and that he never had occasion to throw off any part of a survey, when making his return, although he often included in it double the quantity mentioned in the warrant. The admission of this deposition in evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, but the court permitted it to be read, and an exception was taken to their opinion. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-7\"><em>Potter </em>and <em>Burnside, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-A\">argued, that the testimony of <em>Robert Moore, </em>ought not to have-been received, because it contradicted a deed. He swore that <em>Hauser </em>purchased the tracts in the name of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Catharall, </em>before the year 1788, in the face of <em>Matlock\u2019s </em>deed, which bore date 2d of <em>March, </em>1795. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Besides, the boundary, proved by <em>Moore </em>to have been recognized by Matlock, contradicted the deeds made by him to Hauser, and to Benner, the latter of whom purchased of <em>Matlock </em>in 1792. Matlock, moreover, did not point out the pine as a boundary, either to <em>Hauser </em>or to <em>Benner, </em>neither of whom was present, nor indeed to any one else. <em>Moore </em>showed it to him, and he merely said, it was very well, and ran a course from it. Such an observation, under such circumstances, is no evidence of boundary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-6\">The deposition of <em>Joshua Elder </em>was not relevant. If it proves any custom of the land office, it is a custom to receive returns of survey of more land than is included in the warrants. But here the return was not of more land than the warrant called for, with the usual allowance, but the lines marked on the ground, embraced five hundred acres more than the returns called for, and it was the defendants\u2019 object to show, that a survey, containing within the marked lines, more land than appeared by the draft returned, would have been accepted; a position, which the evidence did not tend to establish. This deposition was liable to another objection. It did not prove a general custom of the land office, but only what was done in respect to the particular surveys, made by the deponent himself. Nor was it the best, evidence even of this, which the nature of the case admitted of. The surveys returned by the deponent into the land office, might have been had, and should have been produced.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-7\"><em>Hale, Blanchard </em>and <em>Carothers, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">The plaintiff claimed part of the surplus land included in the five surveys belonging to <em>Matlock, </em>from whom both parties derived title. The question was one of boundary. We contended, that the land in dispute, was not within the marked lines of the plaintiff\u2019s survey, and that it was within those of the defendant\u2019s survey on <em>CatharalVs </em>warrant. The situation of the pine tree was the material question. The plaintiff\u2019s deed from <em>Matlock, </em>of 22d of <em>May, 1792, </em>calls for the <em>Jones </em>tract as belonging to <em>Jacob Hauser, </em>beginning at a <em>marked pine, </em>and running due* east; and we offered to prove, that <em>Hauser </em>was living on the <em>Jones </em>tract in 1788, having purchased it of Matlock: That <em>Matlock </em>was shown the p&gt;ne tree, the beginning of the <em>Jones </em>tract, and that he expressed himself satisfied, and ran a due east course from it. We had a right to prove by parol, that <em>Hauser </em>was in possession of the land in dispute, had made improvements on it, and had purchased it. He might have purchased of <em>Matlock </em>before 1788, by parol, and taken possession, or have held by articles of agreement, though he did not receive a deed until 1795. The confession of <em>Matlock, </em>therefore, under whom the plaintiff claimed by deed subsequent to that confession, was clearly evidence of boundary. It admitted the situation of the pine tree, upon which the whole controversy depended. <em>Caufman </em>v. <em>The Congregation of Cedar Spring, </em>6 <em>Binn. 59. Hamilton </em>v. <em>Menor, 2 Serg. fy Rawle, 70.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>There was a mistake in the returns of the five surveys belonging to <em>Matlock, </em>there being five or six hundred acres embraced by the lines on the ground, more than appeared by the returns. Of this surplus, the plaintiff has one hundred and fifty-nine acres, but is dissatisfied because <em>Hauser </em>has more. His object is to get half of the surplus. But there was a surplus of seventy-four acres in one survey, as returned, and it was to show the defendants\u2019 right to this, and not to the large surplus, on the whole return, that the deposition of Mr. <em>Elder </em>was offered. The object of it was, to show the custom of the land office, to accept surveys containing a surplus, provided there was no intervening right. It has long been the practice of the courts of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>to receive evidence of the custom of the .land office. <em>Lessee of Forbes </em>v. <em>Caruthers, 3 Yeates, </em>527. <em>Merchant </em>v. <em>Millison, </em>2 <em>Sm. L. </em>165. <em>Peakes Ev. </em>190, 191.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b355-6\">Tiighman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4B\">I think the evidence of <em>Robert Moore </em>was properly admitted. The plaintiff claims under <em>Matlock </em>by purchase since the year 1788. The admission of the pine tree by <em>Matlock, </em>as <em>Hauser\u2019s </em>boundary, in 1788, was evidence, therefore, against the plaintiff, <em>Matlock </em>being dead at the time the evidence was given. It is objected, that <em>Matlock </em>knew nothing of tlye tree himself, but took his information from <em>Moore, </em>the witness. The evidence was not <em>conclusive, </em>but as every man is supposed to know something of his own affairs, it was of some weight, that <em>Matlock </em>acquiesced in <em>Moore\u2019s </em>intimation, and ran from the pine which was shown him, considering it as a boundary. Another objection to the <em>testimoney </em>of <em>Moore </em>was, that it contradicted the deed from <em>Matlock </em>1,0 <em>Hauser. Moore </em>swore, that <em>Hauser </em>was in possession, and had purchased from <em>Matlock, </em>prior to the year 1788; whereas, the deed bears date in 1795, But there is no contradiction in this. Nothing is more common, than a contract for sale of lands, many years before a conveyance is executed. The purchaser is let into possession, improves the land, and gets his deed when he has paid the purchase money, or given good security for it. <em>Moore </em>proves, that the possession was in <em>Hauser. </em>That was a notorious fact, in which he could not be mistaken, and the subsequent conveyance from <em>Matlock, </em>makes it highly probable, that the contract of sale was made before <em>Hauser </em>went to the expense of making improvements. Valuable improvements in tracts of vacant land, in an unsettled country, are not commonly the work of tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The plaintiff took another exception to the admission of the deposition of <em>Joshua Elder. </em>This deposition proved, that <em>Elder </em>was appointed a deputy surveyor under the proprietaries, in 1769, and served in that office until the revolution, when he was again appointed under the state government, and remained in office, until <em>the </em>year 1790; and that during that time, he frequently returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>surveys containing much more than the warrants called for, and there never was any difficulty, as to the acceptance of them, where there was no interference with the claim of any other person. Parol evidence of the custom of the proprietary land office, has been often admitted ; and this custom is made up of a number of particular facts. To be sure, the surveys of which <em>Elder </em>speaks, might have been procured from the land office. But the great trouble and expense of making out a custom in that way, has induced the courts to make a small relaxation in the strict law of evidence. It is not much longer, that evidence of customs prior to the revolution, will be had, from the mouths of living witnesses. No ill consequence can result, therefore, from continuing the practice which certainly has prevailed, of permitting testimony of this bind to go <em>to </em>the jury, who will give it such weight as they think it is worth. But there was one particular objection urged against <em>Elder\u2019s </em>testimony, viz: that although, in general, parol evidence of custom has been admitted, yet it ought not to be suffered in this case, where the quantity of surplus land was so great, and so contrary to the written orders of the board of property. To this objection the defendants\u2019 counsel answered, that it was material for them to prove title to the tract in the name of <em>Isaac Catharall, </em>which contains a surplus of only seventy-four acres; so that the evidence would be good for that purpose, without applying it to the larger quantity of surplus contained in the exterior lines of the five contiguous surveys, owned by <em>Matlock. </em>This answer meets the objection. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel might have asked <em>the </em>defendant for what purpose he offered the evidence, and then he would have been held to the point for which it was offered. But, having objected to the evidence generally, all that is incumbent on the defendant is, to show that it was proper for <em>some purpose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">I am of opinion, on the whole, that there is no error in the record, and therefore, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-7\">Duncan, J, gave no opinion, having been counsel for the plaintiff in error.</judges>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
