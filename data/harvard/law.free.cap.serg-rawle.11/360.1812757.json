But, if the evidence leave that fact in doubt, the registry is not good.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-12\">This was a <em>habeas corpus </em>to produce the body of <em>Frank, </em>a mulatto boy, whom the defendant, <em>Barker, </em>claimed as his servant till the age of twenty-eight years, being the son of his slave Milla, duly registered, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-13\">The boy was registered on the 9th of <em>April, </em>1812, in these words: \u00abTo the clerk of the peace of <em>Allegheny </em>county,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aib\"><em>ilAbner Barker, </em>of the borough of <em>Pittsburgh, </em>returns to the said clerk a male mulatto child, called <em>Frank, </em>born on or about the 12th day of <em>November, </em>1811, of a negro woman, called <em>Milla, </em>the property of the said <em>Barker, </em>and liable to serve until the age of twenty-eight years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-14\">On the argument, the following points were made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-15\">1. That it did not appear by the return, that <em>Frank </em>had been registered within six months after his birth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-16\">2. That his age was not stated with sufficient certainty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-17\">3.

That <em>Milla, </em>the mother of <em>Frank, having been </em>born on the 18th of <em>April, </em>1789, one year after the passage of the act of 1788, her offspring was free; that act referring only to those who were then slaves, and their children.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-20\">These points were argued by <em>Wilkins, </em>for the boy,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aiq\">who referred to the act of 29th of <em>March, </em>1788, 2 <em>Sm.

But there is another point decisive of this case. The occupation of the master is not' mentioned in the register. Bdt inasmuch as it would be impossible to mention the occupation of a man'who has no occupation, We have admitted parol evidence for the .purpose of proving that Mr. <em>Barker </em>had no occupation at the time of entering this boy. On this subject it is incumbent on the master to remove all doubt, and we cannot say that the evidence has been sufficient for that purpose. We think it very doubtful from the evidence, whether Mr. <em>Barker </em>was not a partner of a manufacturing company at the date of this resister. For that reason we are of opinion, that the register is not according to law, and <em>Frank </em>is entitled to his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Prisoner discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
