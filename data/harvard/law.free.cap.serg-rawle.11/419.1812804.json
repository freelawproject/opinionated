A writ of error having been sued out thereon, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed in the Supreme Court on the seventh day of <em>September, </em>1818, and an <em>habere facias posseSsionem </em>and a <em>fi. fa. </em>for costs issued in the Court of Common Pleas, to <em>November </em>term, 1818.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">The bond taken on the last mentioned writ of execution, was assigned by the sheriff to <em>George Armfriedt, </em>the plaintiff therein named, and judgment entered thereon at <em>November </em>term, 1818, against <em>Bauders </em>and <em>Fletcher, </em>the obligors. A <em>fi. fa. </em>issued to <em>February </em>term, 1819, and a levy was made by virtue thereof on the property of <em>James Fletcher, </em>an inquisition held, and the property condemned. A <em>Fend.

Our act of assembly giving the landlord a summary relief, is founded on this, and will not suffer the tenant to set up an' out-standing title, or one which he has acquired since his lease, unless it is under the lessor. Here certainly the conti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>nuance in possession by <em>Banders </em>after the expiration of his term, was a tacit renovation of his contract, and he became tenant from year to year, on the terms of the indenture. <em>Fletcher </em>might have maintained an action for the use and occupation, and given the lease in evidence, to ascertain the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">But this ejectment was brought to <em>May </em>1814, and to the same term, another action for rent was brought, and a recovery of the rent had, up to that time. In an ejectment by landlord against the tenant, the tenant may show that the landlord\u2019s .title has terminated. Does the purchase by <em>Banders </em>of <em>Mmfriedfs </em>title, alter the state of the parties with regard to the rent? For though h\u00a9 acquired that title, still he would be accountable in an action for the mesne profits, and the verdict and judgment in ejectment, would be conclusive from the time the writ issued. <em>Banders </em>called in his landlord to defend, and the landlord has defended. During the pendency of this ejectment, <em>Mmfriedt\u2019s </em>right to mesne profits is conclusively established by the verdict. The obligation of landlord and tenant, and their relative duties correspond. The stipulation is mutual. The tenant, that he will pay the rent during the term, the landlord, that he still make good the premises, or be liable to make satisfaction, if he do not. It is a contract between them for the possession and profits of land, on the on\u00a9 side, and a recompence by rent on the other. 4 <em>Bac. Mr. </em>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Now as it is clear, that <em>Mmfriedt </em>has conclusively established his right to the mesne profits, and as clear, that if they were recovered, <em>Fletcher </em>would be responsible <em>to Baude?'S, </em>it would be an idle circuity of action to require the actual commencement of the suit, and recovery by <em>Mmfriedt, </em>to enable him to recoup. The judgment and verdict in the ejectment, I would consider to operate asan eviction from the time of the commencement of the ejectment. <em>Banders; </em>as the fact showed, was justifiable in retaining the rent, as the eviction established, that- <em>Fletcher </em>had no right to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">I distinguish this from the case of a lease for a certain time, where it would seem, that notwithstanding an eviction by title paramount, the tenant should pay the rent that became due before the recovery, because of his express covenants ; but here the renovaion is only an implied contract; the action would be <em>assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
