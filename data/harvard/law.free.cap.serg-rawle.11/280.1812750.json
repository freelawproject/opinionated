In consequence of certain transactions, which subsequently took place between the parties, the execution was staid, and on the 20th <em>Jlugust, </em>1820, on an affidavit filed by the defendant, the court below opened-the judgment, for the purpose of letting him show what deductions he was entitled to claim from the amount of the judgment. The cause went to trial on the plea of payment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">The defendant, in support of his plea, offered to prove the following facts, viz: That in <em>November, </em>1819, he had in the store of <em>John.

If you say so, please to write per first mail, and you shall have an order on <em>John Singer 8? Co. </em>for the leather. There are yet 7000 pounds in sole leather in their store house. If you do not take the leather, I cannot see how I can pay you, for there is no money in this country. If you would sell all I have, it would not pay the half of the debt you have against me. Please to write at all events, what you will do, so that I may know how it will be.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-9\">That to this letter, the plaintiffs oh the,6th of <em>December, </em>1819, wrote to the defendant the following answer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-10\">\u201cYour letter, of the 29th ultimo is before us, and note the contents. We wrote to our friends in <em>Pittsburg, </em>concerning your sole leather, who informed uS* by letter of the 23d of <em>November, </em>that if of good quality, it would sell at 30 to 31 cents per pound, par money. They further state, that a sale of 7000 or 8000 pounds, could not be relied upon this season, as the article is dull. We have a letter from Mr. <em>Blanchard, </em>desiring further instructions respecting the sale of your property. Our notes here must be paid, no matter whatthe sacrifice. We do not wish to injure you, although we know you have treated us ill in not paying the money. We shall therefore request that the execution may bo staid for a lime, pro-' vided you \"send us an order for the leather by the return of mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>We will either sell it here, or send it on to <em>Pittsburg. John Singer </em>&lt;$\u2022 <em>Co. </em>say, it will not bring sixteen cents in this market at present. We will endeavour to do the best with it for your interest. Do not delay the order as the season is passing away, and we aro determined to have our account settled with you somehow or other.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\">That to this letter the defendant replied in another, dated <em>December </em>20th 181\u00cd), of which the following is an extract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">\u201cYou state the price of leather in your city at 16 cents per pound. The raw hides cost seventeen and a half cents in your city when bought; and in <em>Pittsburg, </em>thirty to thirty-one cents per pound par money. <em>I should think it would be better in Pitts-burg, for it would be very hard to lose so much on it; although I shall trust to your honour to be doing for the best with the sole leather for both parties. </em>I understand that the price of hauling to Pittsburg, is from 4 dollars '50 cents to 5 dollars per ewt. and if it shoidd be six or seven dollars, it wguki be much better to send it to Pittsburg, than to sell it in your city. It would make a much readier sale in <em>Pittsburg, </em>for sole leather in the state of <em>Ohio </em>is a scarce article, and it would sell there at almost any thing. Enclosed you have an order on Messrs. <em>John Singer </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Co. </em>for all my sole leather in their care, to be delivered on demand to your or-' der. You will be so good as to inform me in the course of some time, what is doing with the leather.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">That after the order for. the leather was forwarded, the defendant made frequent applications to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, <em>John Blanchard, </em>Esq. to know the result of the sale in <em>Pittsburg, </em>and that the defendant did not hear from the plaintiffs on the subject, until their attorney produced a letter from them, addressed to himself, dated 20th <em>May, </em>1S20, exhibiting a sacrifice of the leather.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">To the admission of the whole of this testimony, the counsel for the plaintiffs objected, but the court overruled the objection, and a bill of exceptions was tendered and sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\">From the plaintiffs\u2019 letter to Mr. <em>Blanchard, </em>above referred to, it appeared that they had on the 25th <em>May, </em>1820, sold 6641 pounds of the defendant\u2019s leather, at auction, in <em>Philadelphia, </em>where it brought twelve and a half cents per pound, making the gross amount of sales, 830 dollars and 12 cents; of which, after deducting charges, &amp;c. there remained the sum of 774 dollars and 26 cents, which the plaintiffs credited on their execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\"><em>George Wasson </em>having been sworn as a witness on the part of the defendant, stated; that on 13th <em>November 1819, </em>he called on <em>John Singer 8f Co. </em>with a letter from <em>the </em>defendant, requesting them to send his leather \u00a1to <em>Pittsburg, </em>which they refused to do, because they knew no mercantile house in that place in whom they could confide: That he then called on the plaintiffs, and informed them of the defendant\u2019s wish to have the leathersent to Pittsburg, and of <em>John Singer fy Co\u2019s, </em>refusal, upon which they told him, that they knew a house in Pittsburg, and that if Mr. <em>Kean </em>would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>give them an order for the leather, they would send it there, adding, that they would write to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and ascertain the price of leather at that place. On his cross-examination, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, proposed to ask the witness, wh\u00e1t <em>John Singer </em>said to <em>Kean </em>about the quality of the leather? The counsel for the defendant objected to the question. The court sustained the objection, and an exception was taken to their opinion. In the course of the trial, the defendant offered in evidence, the deposition of <em>George Jlnshuts, </em>the object of which was to show the price of leather in Pitts-<em>burg; </em>bqt the witness spoke only of his own sales. The counsel for the plaintiffs objected to its being read, but the. court admitted it and sealed another bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">After, the evidence was closed, the court delivered to the jury a charge to the'following effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">Huston, <em>President. </em>The law as to a general agent is, that he is bound to a due diligence and attention, adequate to the trust reposed in him \u2014 to perform what he undertakes with good faith\u2014 not to do any thing inconsistent with his trust, nor omit to do what it requires. If he acts with these intentions, and with good faith, he is not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">A special agent is bound to act according to his undertaking and instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-8\">On the one side it is insisted in this cause, that the nature and limits of the undertaking, are to be collected from the testimony and letters, taken together. On the other, that it is to be sought for in the letters, and in them only, and that the court are bound to tell you, whether it is a general or special agency. Without deciding whether the court is always bound' to, do so when the evidence consists of several letters and answers \u2014 it is sufficient to s.ay, that in this case, the relative situation of the parties, the application to <em>Singer </em>to send the leather to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and his refusal, the offer of the plaintiffs to <em>Kean, </em>through <em>Wasson, </em>and the several letters, have been given in evidence, and relied on too, in argument by the counsel on both sides, as tending to show what might have been the understanding, and intention .of. the parties. When two parties write their agreement, the exposition of that agreement is with the court; perhaps in some cases, the exercise of a particular business or'some extrinsic matters, which .must be resorted to, and proved by parol, may form exceptions; but where part of the transaction is proved by parol, and this may or may not be believed by the jury, it necessarily draws the whole matter to them. (The President here N read the record, the testimony of <em>Wasson </em>and the letters.) From this it would seem, that <em>Kean </em>knew he could not. sell in <em>Philadelphia </em>at a price he approved. He contemplated to procure <em>Singer </em>to send the leather' to\" <em>Pittsburg. Singer </em>declined. The plaintiffs hearing of this, undertook to make inquiries for him, and to find a safe house. <em>Kean </em>agrees to this, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>proceeds are to be for the plaintiffs use. He writes, <em>\u201c </em>if you say so, write, and I will send an order.\u201d They write; they order their execution to be stayed; they inform him of the price in <em>Pitts-</em>burg, and what <em>Singer </em>says of the price in <em>Philadelphia; </em>and they say, we will either sell here or send it to <em>Pittsburg; </em>and request: him to send the order by next mail, as the time for selling was passing away. <em>Kean </em>sends the order, says he would greatly prefer sending to Pittsburg, even if carriage was six or seven dollars a hundred, and directs them to write what is doing. If the court were bound to give an opinion on these letters, we would say, that <em>Kean </em>never contemplated selling in <em>Philadelphia, </em>unless sixteen cents would be got, that he preferred sending the leather to <em>Pitts-burg, </em>and that the plaintiffs must have so understood him. But we have told you before, and tell jmu again, that it is with you to ascertain from all the evidence, what was the engagement, and not with the court. But it is said, that <em>Kean </em>does not positively command them to send it to <em>Pittsburg, </em>but only says, that he would prefer their doing so. The expression of a wish to a factor, provided that wish is distinctly expressed, or a request distinctly set down, is equivalent to a command. It is the usual mode of writing from equal to equal. Nothing was done for some time; if they discovered the quality of the leather to be inferior, and doubted of the propriety of sending it to <em>Pittsburg, </em>ought they not to have written to <em>Kean, </em>especially, as he had expressly requested them to do so, and would not this be an omission ? It continues in <em>Philadelphia </em>five months, and when he applies through Mr. <em>Blan</em>chard. instead of answering him, and asking his advice, it is sent to auct\u2019on and sold in one lot; and the account of this sale is the first he hears from them after sending the order in <em>December. </em>Even supposing their agency general, was this doing what was right towards <em>Kean? </em>If it was not, they are as much liable as if they were only special agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">The one side say, that the plaintiffs were greatly indulgent in agreeing to take property instead of selling on their execution ; and that <em>Kean </em>is behaving ungratefully to them. The others say, the plaintiffs got property worth their debt; that they did not comply with the terms on which it was given; that they have sacrificed it experimentally, or wickedly, and now want to sweep away more. You will judge coolly. If you think the \u00e1gency special, and the terms not complied with, or if you think the agency general, and 'that even then the plaintiffs have not acted fairly, and for the best advantage of the defendant, but negligently, and contrary to their duty, then you will make <em>Kean </em>an allowance in damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">But if you think the agency, if special, was consonant to the terms of agreement, or if general, that the plaintiffs did their duty and acted with good faith, then there is to be a verdict for the plaintiffs, and no damages to <em>Kean </em>to be deducted. But if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>plaintiffs are liable beyond the proceeds of the leather at auction, for vvhat are they liable? The value of the leather. To ascertain this, would be no easy task; it will require your diligent consideration. (His honour here read the testimony given in the cause,relative to the quality and value of the leather, which, it was not deemed necessary to introduce into the report). There is much evidence that it was not good, and 'much that is was. You must decide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\">I-repeat, if you think the agreement was only to take it and do the best, and that the plaintiffs intended to do the best, and thought they were doing so, and that there was no material omission, and nothing wrong in the time;, or mode of selling, <em>Kean must be </em>satisfied with the price it brought, for which they have given him eredit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">But if you think the plaintiffs did not act according to the agreement and understanding under which they received the leather, or did not act with the prudence and good faith which are required from a general agent, you will allow <em>Kean </em>in damages, such sum as on mature deliberation, yovi think justice requires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">The counsel for the plaintiffs excepted to the charge of the court, and the jury having returned a verdict in favour of the defendant, finding a balance of <em>S3 </em>dollars and 85 cents, to be due <em>to </em>him from the plaintiffs, the record was returned to this court on a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-7\"><em>,ft.nderson </em>and <em>Blanchard, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">1. It was error to admit on the-jury, a man who had given material evidence for the defendant, before arbitrators. He had formed ' an opinion on the quality of the' leather, which was very important to the defendant, and could not therefore be free from bias. 2 <em>Caines Rep. </em>133.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-9\">2. A very important question arises upon the admission by the court below, of evidence to show an alleged sacrifice of the leather put into the plaintiffs\u2019 hands, by the defendant. The error of the court consisted, not only in the admission of the evidence itself, but in the manner in which it was introduced. The court had no right to\\ open the judgment for the purpose of inquiring into matters which had arisen subsequent to it. Where the defendant has a good matter of discharge, arising after the judgment, the proper remedy is by <em>audita querela. 3 Bl. Con. </em>405. But entitle the plaintiff to this species of relief, the claim of the defendant must be for something certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-10\">Waving, however, what we contend was an improper exercise of power,, the evidence was inadmissible, supposing it to have been offered under the plea of payment, with leave, &amp;c. to a <em>scire facias </em>on the judgment. It is not denied <em>that </em>all the money for which the leather actually sold was fairly credited, but the defendant alleges that the plaintiffs sacrificed his property by misconduct. His claim, therefore, is for unliquidated damages, arising from misfea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>sanee, non-feasance, or negilence, which cannot be set off under our defalcation act, (1 <em>8m. L. </em>49,) which authorises, where there have been <em>mutual dealings, </em>between two or more persons, who are <em>indebted </em>to each other, the demand of one, to be set off against that of the other. The defalcation is confined to cases in which there is some standard, by which the amount of the claim may be ascertained. A man cannot be said to be indebted, against whom a demand for damages only exists. Conformable to this position, has been the uniform course of decision. <em>Kacklin </em>v. <em>Mulhalldn, </em>2 <em>Dali. </em>237. <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Speer, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>169. This doctrine remains unshaken by any subsequent decision. <em>Steigleman </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>1 <em>Serg. Sf Rawle, </em>477, was decided upon the circumstance of the defence growing out of the same transaction on which the plaintiffs\u2019 demand was founded. In <em>Heck </em>v. <em>Shener, </em>4 <em>Serg. </em># <em>Rawle, </em>249, the ground of decision was, that the defence destroyed in part, the consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action. That the Supreme Court consider the doctrine of set off as still resting upon the foundation on which it had been put prior to those two cases, is evident, since they refused, in the case of <em>Gogel </em>v. <em>Jacoby, 5 Serg. Sf Rawle, 117, </em>to permit a set off of damages, arising from acts of a tortious nature. It is not pretended, that the plaintiffs received the leather as a payment; nor do they ask a set off of the amount for which it sold, but something in the nature of damages, for neglect of duty or breach of orders, on the part of the plaintiffs, which has never yet been permitted. 2 <em>Caines Rep. </em>33. <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Hackley, </em>2 <em>Crunch, </em>342.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-4\">3. The conversation between <em>Wasson </em>and <em>Singer, </em>communicated by the former to the plaintiffs, was not evidence, because it was unconnected with the subsequent contract between the parties, which was reduced to writing. The written contract, contained in the correspondence, could not be contradicted by parol evidence. 1 <em>Phill. Ev. </em>441.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">4. The quality of the leather was material, and therefore the plaintiffs ought to have been permitted to prove, that <em>Singer\u2019s </em>opinion of it was communicated to the defendant. It was of importance to the plaintiffs to show, that the defendant did not intend to have it sent to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and with a view to that object, we expected to prove, that <em>Singer </em>had said, that it would injure the credit of the defendant to send it to that market, and that it was of very bad quality, and would not pay costs. It was error, therefore, to reject the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">5. In admitting the deposition of <em>George JLnshuts, </em>there was error. The object of this deposition was to show the price of leather at <em>Pittsburg, </em>but the witness spoke only of his own sales, which afforded no criterion as to the market price. He was a man of large property, and could afford to wait for the best prices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-8\">6. The question of general or special agency, which arose en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tircly out of tire written correspondence, was matter of law, and the court erred in submitting it to the jury. The construction of writings belongs to the court. 3 <em>Binn. </em>339.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">7. It was error to permit the jury to judge of the contract, both from the letters and the parol evidence. A policy of insurance cannot be varied by conversations, which passed at the time it was effected. 2 <em>Phill. Ev. </em>45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">8. There was error in charging the jury, that the agency was a limited one. The letters expressly show that it was a general agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\">9. It was error to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs had violated the -defendant\u2019s orders, by selling in Philadelphia, without previously writing to him. There was no order on the subject, but merely a wish, slightly expressed at the conclusion of a letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-8\">10. It was also error to instruct the jury, that it was a violation of the orders of the defendant, to keep the leather five months in <em>Philadelphia, </em>and then sell it at auction. It was kept for the benefit of the defendant, in the hope of a better price, and brought more at auction, than could have been obtained for it at private sale, as was proved by several witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-9\">11. The. court erred in saying, the expression of a wish by the defendant relative to the sale ofhis leather, amounted to acommand. Besides, the defendant\u2019s letter, after expressing his opinion rather than his wishes on the subject, expressly leaves the whole business to the honour, and consequently the discretion of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-10\">12. There was error in rendering judgment for the defendant for the balance found by the jury. It was not a case of <em>set off, </em>and this the court seemed to recognize. But this verdict and judgment can be supported, only in a case of set off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-11\"><em>Burnside </em>and <em>Potter, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-12\">1. It is no objection to a juror, that he is a witness in the cause. <em>Trials for Pais, </em>258. The only objection stated to the court was, that he had given evidence before arbitrators, on a point material to the issue, from which it was impossible to infer that he had formed an opinion on the merits of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-13\">2. This is the point on which the cause turns. It is important, but clear. Transactions had taken place between the parties subsequent to the judgment, which gave the defendant a right to make a deduction from the amount of the judgment. He put property into the hands of the plaintiffs, to be sold and applied to the discharge of the judgment, and he now merely demands the fair value of that property. Whether general or special agents, they were equally bound,to do their duty. If they neglected or mismanaged the trust,' they made the property their own, and were liable for the value of it, not in the shape of damages, but for having received so much inpayment of their judgment. An agent who neglects to effect insurance, agreebly to orders, stands himself in the place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the insurer, and is liable as such. <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Tagerl, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>204. And a person who becomes agent gratuitously, is answerable for misconduct. <em>French </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>6 Binn. 311. <em>Walker </em>v. Smith, 4 <em>Dali. </em>389. By departing from their- instructions, the plaintiffs became liable for the value of the leather, which was capable of being set, off. It was a contract. The damages were the fair value of the article, which was as easily ascertained in this action, as in an action for goods sold. The damages are not claimed for tortious acts of the plaintiffs, which circumstance distinguishes this case from that of <em>Gogel </em>v. <em>Jacoby, </em>in which there was no contract between the parties, but <em>Jacoby </em>claimed damages from <em>Gogel, </em>because he had not sent to him the goods which had,been consigned to <em>Gogel, </em>by a third person to be forwarded to <em>Jacoby. </em>The ease of <em>Steigleman </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>1 <em>Serg. 4\" Rawle, </em>477, and <em>Ileck </em>v. <em>Shener, </em>4 <em>Serg. 4' Rawle, </em>249, fully support this species of defence.

In a case like this, equity would grant an injunction, to prevent any proceeding on this judgment, until it was ascertained at law, what should be allowed to the defendant on account of the leather; and the only mode by which justice can be done in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>is that which was adopted. <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 <em>Yeates, </em>104. <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>2 <em>Dali. </em>264. \u25a0 3 <em>Yeates, 9, </em>267. 3 <em>Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3dY\">The plaintiffs, obtained a judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the defendant by confession, in the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Centre </em>county, on which an execution was issued, by virtue of which, a levy was made on the defendant\u2019s property. Before there was any sale of the property, certain transactions took place between the plaintiffs and defendant, in cousequence of which, the execution was suspended, and afterwards, on the application of the defendant, the Court of Common Pleas opened the judgment for the purpose of giving the defendant an opportunity of showing what sum should be.deducted from the judgment, by reason of payments made by him, or claims against the plaintiffs, which had arisen posterior to the judgment. The parties went to trial, on the. plea of payment, with leave to give the special matter in evidence. Several exceptions were taken to the opinion of the court, by the counsel for the plaintiffs, as well on points of evidence, as in the charge to the jury. But the principal contest -was, whether the defendant should be permitted to give evidence to the following effect. The defendant offered to prove, that he had a quantity of leather in the city of Philadelphia, which he proposed to deliver to tbe plaintiffs, to be sold by them, and the proceeds of sale applied to 'the payment of their judgment, to which proposal the plaintiffs acceded, as appeared by several letters which passed between the parties; and that this leather, in consequence of the misconduct of the plaintiffs, sold for less than its value. The defendant, therefore, claimed an allowance, equal to the real value of the leather. The plaintiffs -gave credit to the defendant for the nett proceeds of the sale, but refused to allow any thing beyond that. And their counsel contend, that even supposing the defendant may have suffered, by the plaintiffs misconduct, he is not entitled to any deduction from the judgment, on that account, but must take his remedy in an action for damages. In support of this position, many cases have been cited, which prove, that <em>unliquidated damages </em>are not the subject of a <em>set off. </em>The law is certainly'so, and if the defendant rested'his case on a <em>set off, </em>he could not be allowed more than the net proceeds of sale. But he founds his pretensions on a different principle. He sets up an equitable defence, by which he claims the right of an allowance of every thing to which he is entitled, on accotmt of the leather which the plaintiffs-agreed to sell for the purpose of satisfying their judgment. And I confess there appears great justice in this pretension, and great injustice in denying it. Consider the defendant\u2019s situation. Under the pressure of an execution, he puts his property in the hands of the plaintiffs, in trust, that it shall be sold for the purpose of satisfying the execution. We must assume, (because the plaintiffs offered to prove it,) that in consequence of the plaintiffs mismanagement, or breach of orders, the property was sacrificed, so that the defendant has a just demand against them for the difference between the actual proceeds of sale, and \u25a0 what they ought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>been. Is it right that the plaintiffs should be permitted to credit the defendant for no more than the actual proceeds, and go on with their execution for the balance of their judgment, leaving the defendant to seek his remedy in another action, for the damages he has sustained from this very transaction ? That is really the only question. And to answer it in the affirmative, is so repugnant to my ideas of equity, that my mind revolts from it. I cannot sec the propriety of splitting up a transaction, which in its nature is indivisible. The defendant is entitled to a full account of his property from the plaintiffs. He entrusted it to them for the purpose of satisfying their demand against him ; and until the account is completely settled, the plaintiffs ought not to bo permitted to proceed with their execution. On the trial in the court below, the plaintiffs had notice of the evidence intended to be offered, and they never could have a more convenient opportunity of settling the whole dispute. It has some weight with me, that the Court of Common Pleas, in staying the plaintiffs execution, and letting the defendant in to this trial, assumed a kind of equity jurisdiction, which seems absolutely necessary to us, who have no Chancery, as the writ of <em>audita </em>querela, has fallen into disuse. To give a trial, in which the defendant would be cut off from a great part of his merits, would be relieving him by halves; and even considering the interest of the plaintiffs, it would be better for them to have the whole matter settled at once, than be delayed as to part of it, until a new action could be brought by the defendant, in order to ascertain what might be strictly called his damages, and that action brought to trial after running the usual course. I am of opinion, therefore, that there was no error in admitting the defendant\u2019s evidence. At the same time, it will be understood, that I pass no opinion on the merits of the case, that being a matter solely for the consideration of the jury. I only say, that it-was proper the evidence should be heard. I will now proceed to the other exceptions taken by the plaintiffs, which, although numerous, are not difficult; and I will take them up in the order in which they were spoken to by the counsel. The one on which I have given my opinion, is marked No. \u00a3, in the assignment of errors. .No. <em>3, </em>comes next. It is this, \u201cthat the court erred in admitting the testimony of <em>George Wasson, </em>as to the request made by the defendant, to <em>John Singer, </em>to send the leather to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and the communication of <em>that fact by Wasson to </em>the plaintiffs.\u201d This evidence was proper, because it was the origin of the transaction, with respect to the leather. The defendant had a quantity of leather in <em>Singer\u2019s </em>hands; which he wished <em>Singer </em>to send to <em>Pittsburg </em>to be sold, on the defendant\u2019s account. This request was communicated to <em>Singer, </em>verbally, through <em>Wasson. Singer </em>declined sending the leather, because he had no correspondents in <em>Pittsburg. Wasson </em>then mentioned to the plaintiffs, that the defendant wished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>to send his leather to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and the plaintiffs said, they would undertake it. This having been made known to the defendant, he wrote to the plaintiffs, and a correspondence took place,; which ended in the defendant\u2019s sending an order on <em>Singer </em>to deliver the leather to the plaintiffs. To come to a full understanding of the matter, it was proper that the jury should be informed of all that had passed between the plaintiffs and defendant, and <em>Wasson\u2019s </em>testimony was introductory and explanatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">4th error. \u201cThe court overruled the testimony of <em>George Was-son, </em>as to what <em>John Singer </em>said, about the quality of the leather, which <em>Wasson </em>afterwards communicated to the defendant. \u201d This testimony was rightly overruled. . What <em>Singer said, </em>was not evidence; he was a competent witness, and was actually examined as a witness, and gave his opinion of the quality of the leather, on his <em>oath.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">5th error. \u201cAdmitting the deposition of <em>George Jinshuts.\u201d </em>This exception has been abandoned, and very properly. The deposition was certainly evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">6th and 7th errors. These may be considered as one. \u201c The court left it to the jury to decide what was the contract between the parties,' and whether the plaintiffs were entrusted with a general or special agency.\u201d Where a contract is wholly in writing, it is the office of the court, and not of the jury, to expound it. But where it is part written and part verbal, the whole may be left to the jury. This is frequently the case in mercantile transactions, consisting of letters, accounts, and verbal communications, where the written and parol evidence throw light on each other. And I think it was the case here. The origin of the dealing about the leather was, a verbal communication to the plaintiffs, that the defendant had leather in <em>Philadelphia, </em>which he wished to be sent and disposed of in <em>Pittsburg, </em>and a verbal declaration by the plaintiffs, that they were willing to undertake the business. I do not think, therefore, that the coui't was bound to separate the letters from the other evidence, and give their opinion ori them to thejury. This might not have been the proper way of coming at the intent of the parties. It was a case, on which the jury might be permitted to judge, on the whole evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The 8th 9th and 10th errors, are in opinions of the court, expressed in their charge, concerning certain parts of the plaintiffs conduct, which were insisted on by the defendant\u2019s counsel to be a breach of orders; and in an opinion on the question of <em>general or special.agency. </em>These opinions cannot be assigned as error, because, although the court did throw out some sentiments on the points I have just mentioned, yet immediately afterwards they told the jury expressly, and positively, <em>that it toas for them, and not for the court to decide, from the whole evidence, what was the </em>contract.. The jury could not suppose after this, that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>had given a direction, which they were bound to regard as matter of law. But in a subsequent part of the charge, there does appear to me, to be a matter, (assigned as the 11th error,) in which the court gave an opinion an the law, and I think, erroneously. (The Chief Justice here read the 11th error). Now, without stopping to inquire whether a <em>wish, </em>distinctly expressed, in a letter from a principal to his factor, is equivalent to a command, where nothing more is said on the subject, yet it never can be, that a wish amounts to a command, where it is directly afterwards said, that the matter is submitted to the factor\u2019s discretion. In the case before us, the defendant writes to the plaintiffs, that he thinks it would be better to send the leather to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and immediately adds, \u201calthough I shall trust to your honour to be doing for the best with the sole leather, for both parties.\u201d Taking the whole together, it certainly was not a command, and in this respect, I am of opinion, the jury were misdirected.</p>\n<p id=\"Am8\">The 12th error is, \u201cthat the jury having found a balance due to the defendant after satisfying the plaintiffs judgment, the court rendered judgment for the defendant against the plaintiffs, for that balance.\u201d This was a palpable error. In no case is the defendant entitled to a judgment for a sum of money to be recovered of the plaintiff, except where he has given matter of <em>defalcation </em>in evidence, and a balance is found in his favour. And even then, judgment is not entered in the first instance. The verdict is recorded, and then the defendant may have a <em>scire facias </em>to recover the balance. But the present, is not a case of defalcation. Matter arose, after the judgment, which entitled the defendant to a deduction from the judgment. And the utmost he could ask, on his application to the court for relief was, that he should be discharged from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">One more error, the first in number, remains to be adverted to, viz. that the court erred, in not sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge of <em>John Rule, </em>one of the jurors. The cause of challenge was, \u201c that he had been examined before arbitrators, as a witness for the defendant in this cause, and given testimony on a point material to the issue.\u201d A juror is a competent witness, and therefore it cannot be a rule, that one cannot be a juror, because he has given testimony in the same cause, before another tribunal. It may be however, that he may have given testimony of such a nature, as ought to exclude him from the jury, because it may show that he has formed an opinion in favour of one of the parties. In the present case, it does not appear what his testimony before the arbitrators was, and therefore it would be going too far to say, that there was error in overruling the challenge. Upon the whole, it is my opinon, that the judgment should be reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<author id=\"b292-6\">Gibson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APd1\">A judgment, while unaffected by any order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>same or a superior court,\u2019 is conclusive, and no matter, which might originally have been set up as a defence, can be pleaded to a <em>scire facias post annum et diem; </em>and our practice of opening judgments to let defendants into a defence, on original grounds, is founded in necessity to prevent a failure of justice. But where, as in this case, the matter of defence has arisen subsequently, no necessity requires the judgment to be disturbed, and the proper course in the court below was, to stay the execution in the meantime, and order the parties to go to issue on the plea of payment in an amicable <em>scire facias. </em>The form of the issue however, is not very material, and I am disposed to consider the matter, rather than the manner of the defence. This is said to have been put to the jury, not as set-off, but as direct payment. If the leather was received by the plaintiffs as the agents of the defendant, with an agreement that only the proceeds should be credited, I cannot see how the transaction can be used as a defence, otherwise than as affording matter of set-off, and without overturning all the decisions on the defalcation act. How is the fact? The plaintiffs have obtained judgment against the defendant for a debt, and are pressing him for payment. The defendant has a quantity of leather in the possession of <em>Singer </em>&lt;\u00a7* <em>Co. </em>of <em>Philadelphia, </em>which he wishes to turn into cash, to meet his engagements, and for that purpose requests1 <em>Singer fy Co. </em>to send it to <em>Pittsburg, </em>where the article is supposed to be in demand. <em>Singer </em>&lt;$\u2022 <em>Co. </em>refuse; on which <em>Wasson, </em>an agent of the defendant, calls on the plaintiffs, who inform him they know of a safe house in <em>Pittsburg, </em>and offer to have the leather disposed of there, if the defendant will send them an order for its delivery, by <em>Singer </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>Co.; </em>and agree to write to their correspondents in <em>Pittsburg, </em>in the mean time, to ascertain the state of the market. <em>Wasson </em>communicates this to the defendant, who writes to the plaintiffs, offers to send the order, and urges them to undertake the business, as he has no other means of paying them. The plaintiffs reply, that they have written to their friends, in <em>Pittsburg, </em>and inform the defendant of the state of the market, and reproaching him with want of punctuality, insist on being immediately paid; but agree to have their execution staid for a time, provided he will send them an order for the leather, in which event, they say they will sell it, either in <em>Philadelphia, </em>where the current price is sixteen cents the pound, or in <em>Pittsburg, </em>where prime quality brings from thirty to thirty one; and conclude with a promise, <em>\u201cto do the best with the article for the defendant\u2019s interest.\u201d </em>In reply, the defendant, after excuses for the delay of payment, agrees to send the order, and encloses it; saying, that he trusts to the honour of the plaintiffs, <em>to do the best with the article for the benefit of both parties, </em>and intimates a wish that it may be sent to <em>Pittsburg. </em>Itishowever sold at auction in <em>Philadelphia, </em>at a reduced price: and the defendant sets the transaction up asa defence to the judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>insisting, that he is entitled to a credit over and above the proceeds of the sale, for whatever he could recover from the plaintiffs for having sacrificed his property. This is a concise, but accurate statement of the case: and I am at a loss to discover in it a single feature of a sale to the plaintiffs, or a circumstance to show that the leather vyas received by them in payment for as much as it was worth, taking into view the relative advantages of the <em>Pittsburg </em>and <em>Philadelphia </em>markets It seems clear'to me, that the plaintiffs were not purchasers, but factors, with an agreement to place the proceeds of the property to the defendant\u2019s credit, and-of that he had the benefit. What further can he have but unliquidated damages for a real or supposed misfeasance of the plaintiffs in their office of agents? Put the ease of their having sold at a credit \u2014 undoubtedly the defendant, in case reasonable circumspection had been used, would have had to stand to the risque of the purchaser\u2019s solvency. Take it that they had been able to sell for a sum beyond the current price \u2014 the defendant would have been entitled to the profit. Suppose the leather had been destroyed by fire, he would have had to bear the loss. In every point of view1, therefore, it remained the property of the defendant, and at his risque, the plaintiffs being liable only for their conduct in the character of agents: and indeed, the claim against them was put on that ground by the court below, and is avowedly advocated on the same ground here. Now we know very well, in what way an agent is answerable for misconduct in the discharge of his trust. Suppose the defendant had not been indebted to the plaintiffs, but had entrusted them with this property to make the best of it for him: nothing but the price actually received, could have been recovered by him on a count for money had and received to his use; and if there had in fact been misfeasance, satisfaction for it could have been recovered only in damages on a special count on the implied <em>assumpsit </em>to act with due diligence, skill, and fidelity. Can the. implied understanding, (for there is no exprees agreement,) that the plaintiffs were to retain the proceeds of the sale in satisfaction of their debt, vary the nature of the defendant\u2019s remedy? We should make a contract for the parties were we to say, that misfeasance should have the effect of turning the plaintiffs into purchasers of the goods at the market price: that would be putting them in a worse situation than factors under a <em>del credere </em>commission, who, where they sell at a credit, only guarrantee payment of the price. Yet this impli\u00e9d undei\u2019standing, that the proceeds were to be retained in satisfaction, is the only link of connection between the transaction set up, and the judgment. It certainly is not a fair construction of the intention of the parties to compel the plaintiffs to allow a credit for what the leather might by possibility sell for; or for any thing beyond the actual nett proceeds. They had the defendant in their power: he acknowledged he was in default, and begged for indulgence: on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>which, and on condition that he wbuld put this leather into their hands as a means of raising money to answer the exigencies of their business,' they consented to stay the execution which they had against his property in <em>Centre </em>county, and which, had it been pursued, would have led to a sacrifice of his property there. Under these circumstances, they were not bound to wait till they had made an experiment to ascertain the highest penny that could possibly be obtained in PittsburgThis seems clear, from the defendants letter, enclosing the order on <em>Singer S,- Co., </em>in which he says, \u201cI shall trust to your honour to be doing the best with the sole leather for <em>both </em>parties.\u201d From this it is fair to infer, that his interest was not to be exclusively consulted without regard to the plaintiffs necessities. However, for fraud, or what is the same thing, a wanton sacrifice of the property, I admit, the plaintiffs would be answerable. But how answerable? Unquestionably in an action for damages. As regards convenience, there can be no doubt that the case falls within the reason of the rule which prevents the setting off of unliquidated damages. The claim of the defendant arose <em>quasi ex delicto, </em>and out of a transaction altogether distinct from the debt sought to bo recovered, which differs the ease from <em>Heck </em>v. <em>Shener, </em>and brings it within the reason of <em>Gogel </em>v. <em>Jacoby; </em>and in fact, within the letter of <em>Gorbier v. Emery, Whart. Dig. </em>530, <em>No. 29, </em>which is directly in point. I am. of .opinion then, that the court erred in admitting evidence of misfeasance, on the part of the plaintiffs, and in directing the jury, that such misfeasance would afford an available ground of defence. As to the other points, it is necessary only to say, that I fully concur in what has already been advanced.</p>\n<author id=\"b295-4\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4S\">As there is no difference of opinion on the minor points, it is only necessary to express my opinion on the general defence of the defendant. Was it competent to him to ask relief from the judgment and execution, from the subsequent acts of the plaintiffs respecting them, or must he resort to an action against the plaintiffs for their alleged misconduct in disposing of the leather received by them to be sold, and the amount credited on the execution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">If there was any breach of duty, any improper and injurious exercise of the plaintiffs authority, whereby the leather was sold for less than could have been procured for it, if due prudence had not been exercised, it is agreed on all hands, the defendant should have redress somewhere. My opinion is, that he was entitled to relief in. the form in which it has been administered in this action, not by way of set off, but either as an equitable defence, or frbm the superintending power of common law courts to prevent oppression, and their process from being used to unjustifiable ends. Whether the authority was general or special, an authority confined to a sale at <em>Pittsburg, </em>and an undertaking to send the leather to that mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ket, or it was left to the discretion of the plaintiffs to sell, either at <em>Philadelphia </em>or <em>Pittsburg, </em>still' if the discretion was improperly used, to the injury of the defendant, the plaintiffs would be responsible to the amount of that injury. On the whole testimony, I incline to think, the defendant threw himself on the honour of the plaintiffs, trusting to their judgment, as to the place of sale. The expression of a preference of the <em>Pittsburg </em>market, and the reason given for that preference, would not amount to a mandate or a restriction, but was rather a recommendation; for the defendant concludes with a strong appeal to the plaintiffs, and relies on their judgment and integrity. <em>\u201c </em>I shall trust to your honour, to be doing the best with the leather for both parties.\u201d If there was an abuse of the general authority, this would not be an unimportant consideration; and if the difference between a sale at <em>Pitts-burg, </em>and an auction sale at <em>Philadelphia </em>was considerable, it would have a bearing on the question, as to the amount of credit which the defendant ought to have on account of the leather. The defendant was in the power of the plaintiffs, they were urging a sale of his property on their execution; a negociation takes place, and they agree to stay the sale for a time, provided the defendant sent an order for the leather to be delivered to them by the return mail. They state the difference between the <em>Philadelphia </em>and <em>Pittsburg </em>prices ; <em>and say they will either send it to Pittsburg, or sell it at Philadelphia; they will endeavour to do the best with it for the defendant\u2019s interest. </em>Certainly justice would demand from them a fair endeavour: and if the leather would have brought a reasonable price at <em>Pittsburg, it </em>ought not to have been sacrificed at <em>Philadelphia; </em>and if it has, (of which I say nothing, for that was for the jury,) the plaintiffs should give credit for it at the <em>Pittsburg </em>prices, deducting all reasonable expenses and charges. The leather was received as'part payment of the judgment and execution, to be credited for the sum it would have produced on a fair sale; the plaintiffs consider it received as part payment, and credit it for the amount of sale, so that the only question was a matter capable of liquidation, which in equity and good conscience, ought- to be the amount of satisfaction. This is the simple and obvious question, considering the plaintiffs in the most favourable view as consignees; and this is a consignment for payment of this debt, with instructions to sell at <em>Philadelphia </em>or <em>Pittsburg, </em>as they thought best, preferring <em>Pittsburg, </em>but trusting they would do for the best for his interest. Did the difference between the prices at these two places demonstrate to these consignees, that a regard to the interest of the consignor, required that the sale should be made at <em>Pittsburg, </em>and not at <em>Philadelphia, </em>and it was sold at a very inferior price at <em>Philadelphia, </em>this would be a violation of the duty of a consignee, and he should be chai\u2019ged with the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The question would be, would a reasonable man act thus with his own property? Not where it is a, matter in which1 prudent men might differ in opinion, but where no prudent man could hesitate as to the line of conduct duty prescribed. A general agent is to use his discretion in a reasonable manner; not an arbitratry discretion, but <em>arbitratrmm boni viri; </em>applying all his understanding and information for the benefit of his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">This is a case in which a court of common law, by their inherent powers to prevent the abuse of their process, ought to grant relief in a summary way, by motion. Formerly the party was driven to his <em>audita qui\u00e9rela, </em>a dilatory and expensive course. <em>\u201c </em>An <em>audita querela </em>lies where a defendant against whom judgment is recovered, and who is in danger of execution, or perhaps in execution, may be relieved upon good matter of discharge, since the judgment, as if the plaintiff hath given him a general release, or he hath paid the debt without procuring satisfaction on the judgment; in these and the like cases, an <em>audita querela </em>lies in the nature of a bill in equity, to be relieved against the oppression of the plaintiff. It is a writ of a most remedial nature, and seems to have been invented lest there should have been an oppressive defect of justice.\u201d 3 <em>Bl. </em>Co?\u00bb.406. But the indulgence now shown by courts of justice, in granting summary relief on motion, in cases of evident oppression has almost rendered useless this writ, and driven it quite out of practice, <em>lb. </em>1. <em>Ld. Raym. </em>439. It has been long disused, and is expensive, and courts will grant the same relief on motion by a special rule, particularizing the circumstances of the case. 4 <em>Burr. </em>2287. So here on motion, stating the facts, and directing an inquiry into the truth of the facts, trying the question on the plea of payment with leave, &amp;e; for the notice of special matter states the facts as particularly as an <em>audita querela </em>would; and this statement of facts serves all the purposes of the <em>audita querela, </em>without the delay and expense. A bill in chancery would accomplish the same end. Chancery would enjoin the proceeding, until the question was tried, and the damages ascertained, and on payment of the balance, if any, would grant a perpetual injunction. And here our courts, from necessity, must exercise this chancery power; for they are justly and equitably to try the issues between the parties. The trial proceeds, as if a <em>scire facias quare cxecutionem non </em>had issued, where, on the plea of payment, &amp;c. or accord and satisfaction since the judgment, the merits may be decided as advantageously for the plaintiff as in an original action against him. This is not in the nature 'of- a tort which would die with the person. It arises <em>ex contractu, </em>and not <em>ex delecto. </em>If in this case, the plaintiffs had so carelessly kept the leather, that it had rotted, become greatly deteriorated, and had sold it as damaged leather, could it be doubted, but that they would be chargeable with it, at the selling price of good leather? What difference can it make, whether the diminu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>tion of price is occasioned by deterioration of theleather, from careless keeping, or arises from sending it to a bad market, when there was a good one within reach? The case of <em>Dunlop\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Speer, 3 Binn. </em>169, which was an ejectment, with an agreement to release on payment of certain sums, by instalments, and the judgment in ejectment was assigned to <em>Shelter, </em>to secure the payment of a certain sum L uied to <em>Dunlop </em>and <em>Speer, </em>by <em>Shelter, </em>and where there were articles of agreement between <em>Dun-lop </em>and <em>Speer </em>and <em>Shelter, </em>with covenants for payment of the money to <em>Skelter, </em>and other convenants by <em>Shelter </em>with them, on motion to set aside the <em>habere facias possessionem </em>the court refused to give time to <em>Speer </em>ta obtain a judgment against Shelter, on the covenants, in consequence of <em>tortious </em>acts done by him in breach of his covenants in the same articles. But that refusal was on the ground that these acts were merely torts; such as decoying the servants of <em>Speer </em>employed in his iron works, to leave him. But the court said, had the defendant alleged payment of money, <em>or any thing which in its nature admitted of liquidation, </em>there would be strong grounds\u2019for the motion, which they refused, because the damages were not susceptible of liquidation, proceeding from acts <em>ex delicto. </em>There the payment of money was not alleged, nor any <em>thing performed eo intentione, or directly with a view to satisfaction, </em>and received as such. But here the agreement was to accept leather in satisfaction of the judgment, as far as the amount would go; to stay the execution, until the leather was sold, and when <em>sold </em>the amount to be credited. A sale was made, and a certain sum credited. But the defendant says, there was not a full credit given to him. That the plaintiffs sold in bad faith; that if they had acted as faithful agents \u2014 sold as they promised to do \u2014 either at <em>Philadelphia </em>or <em>Pittsburg </em>\u2014 whatever was the best for both parties \u2014 that a fair sale would have satisfied and extinguished the debt. In my opinion, natural justice required the inquiry to be made in this action. When I speak of bad faith, I do not mean intentional fraud, but <em>crassa negligentia, </em>a disregard of the defendant\u2019s interest, to suit the plaintiffs\u2019 convenience; a sacrifice, and not a fair sale of his property. Whether the evidence made out such case, was for the jury. But the defendant was entitled to bring his cause before a jury, and the court took what I consider as the just, if not the only course. To turn the defendant round to a tedious action against the plaintiffs, and in the mean time, another sacrifice to be made of his property, by a sheriff\u2019s sale, to discharge that execution on which the leather had been received, to be sold fairly, and accounted for fairly on that execution, would be contrary to all my sense of equity; would be an oppressive defect of justice, and an evident oppression by the instrumentality of the law. Now this is just that which the <em>audita querela </em>was intended to redress, and which in modern times courts of justice accomplish by staying the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>until justice can be done; and which in this state, where we have ho Court of Chancery, is always done by directing an issue in the action, to decide on this new matter, and where the issue, on the plea of payment with leave, &amp;e. puts it on the power of the court <em>justly </em>and equitably to try and decide on this new matter, arising subsequent to the judgment, without the expense, delay and vexation of a new action, when, if the defendant did recover, his recovery would be too late, as the execution might ruin him inevitably, and'put him beyond the power of redemption. I do not speak of the merits in this cause. I do not pretend to form any opinion on them. But I am most clearly of opinion, that the defendant had a right on this issue, to have his defence, and the evidence to support it, before a jury. It could be more properly tried in that court where the judgment was; and it is for this reason that <em>audita querela </em>lies only .in the court where the judgment is given, they having the best knowledge of all the proceedings in the same cause.. 2 <em>Bulst. </em>10.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
