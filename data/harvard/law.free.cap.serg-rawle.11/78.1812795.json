In the commission <em>John Hall </em>was the sole commissioner named by the parties. The alderman gave judgment in favour of <em>Hall, </em>from which <em>Ingraham </em>appealed; and, upon the trial in the court below, <em>Hall </em>gave in evidence, a letter addressed by himself to <em>Ingraham </em>and <em>Wilmer\u2019s </em>counsel, dated the 1st of <em>August, </em>1819, stating the manner in-which he should execute the commission, and <em>Ingraham\u2019s </em>answer to that letter, dated <em>August </em>14th, 1819; in which he gave <em>Hall </em>notice, that he would not. deem himself responsible for any expenses incurred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Hall </em>in .executing the commission in the manner pointed out by him in his letter of the 1st of <em>August, </em>1819. <em>Hall </em>also gave in evidence a draft, drawn by himself upon <em>Ingraham, </em>payable at sight, for fifty dollars, in favour of <em>Harrison Hall, </em>and part of a letter from himself to <em>Harrison Hull, </em>enclosing the draft, and referring to a former letter of <em>Ingraham\u2019s, </em>which he alleged authorized him to draw for fifty dollars, and stating to <em>Harrison Hall </em>that.he should use money of his, which he had collected, to that amount. Payment of the draft, it was proved, was refused by <em>Ingraham </em>when it was presented. He then gave in evidence the commission, as executed by himself, in the case of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Wilmer, </em>and rested his case. The plaintiff in error, after opening his case to -the jury, gave in evidence his check, dated the 9th of <em>November, </em>Y819, in favour of <em>John Hall, </em>which was paid at bank; and it was proved, or admitted, that when he gave the check to <em>Hall, </em>he said, \u201c it was in full of the draftbut that <em>Hall </em>said, \u201che would not receive it as such,\u201d or that \u201cit was not,\u201d or words to that effect. He further gave in evidence a bill, rendered to him <em>by John Hall, </em>in the following words and figures:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">\u201c <em>Francis Ingraham, </em>Esq. to <em>John Hall, </em>Dr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">For his services, including his disbursements in taking depositions under -a commission from the Supreme Court, in the case of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Wilmer, </em>- <em>$ </em>125,00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">Cr.

That as <em>Harrison H&amp;ll </em>had been discharged as an insolvent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>debtor while the action was pending, it could not be supported in its present form; but the Court permitted the action to be marked, during the trial, to the use of the assignee of <em>Harrison Hall, </em>and instructed the jury that the action so marked might well be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">2. That the suit should have been brought upon the draft drawn by <em>John Hall </em>upon <em>Ingraham, </em>there being an express undertaking by <em>Ingraham </em>before the draft was drawn to accept it; but the court charged the jury that the action might be sustained (as it was brought) in the name of <em>John Hall </em>for the use of <em>Harrison Hall, </em>for the balance of account claimed, notwithstanding the drawing of (he bill, and the correspondence relating to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">3. That the check of the 9 th of <em>November, </em>1819, for fifty dollars, having been appropriated by <em>Ingraham </em>to the payment of the draft, was a full payment of the sum for which this action was brought. But the court charged, that as at the time <em>John Hall </em>refused so to receive it, or appropriate it, especially as he was not the owner or possessor of the draft, he had a right to credit it to the general account for services performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">4. That the plaintiff, <em>John Hall, </em>by assigning a part of his claim, could not subject the defendant to more than one action for what was at first an entire claim. The court agreed with the defendant\u2019s counsel, that a cause of action could not be split up or divided; but charged that the facts gave rise to no such question: but that it might arise, if the subsequent action for twenty-five dollars, brought before the same alderman should be carried on, and could only come in question in that suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">The jury found a verdict in favour of the defendant in error for fifty dollars!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-10\">The charge of the court was reduced to writing at the request of the plaintiff in error, and came up with the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-11\">The plaintiff in error assigned general errors, and the following specific errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-12\">1. That the court charged the jury that the action might be sustained (as it was brought) in the name of <em>John Hall </em>for the use of <em>Harrison Hall, </em>for the balance of account claimed, notwithstanding the drawing of the draft, and the correspondence relating to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-13\">2. That the court charged the jury, that the check of the 9th of <em>November, </em>1819, though appropriated by <em>Ingraham </em>to the payment of the draft drawn by <em>John Hall </em>in favour of <em>Harrison Hall, </em>was not a full payment of the sum for which the action was brought in the Common Pleas, because <em>John Hall </em>refused so- to receive it, or appropriate it, \u2019especially as he was not the owner or possessor of the draft, and that <em>John Hall </em>had a right to credit it to his general account for services performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-14\">3. That the court charged the jury, that the facts gave rise to no such question, as that <em>John Hall, </em>by assigning part of his claim, could not subject the defendant to niorS than one action for what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>was at first an entire claim; but that it might arise if the subsequent action for twenty-five dollars, brought before the same alderman, should be carried on, and could only come in question in that suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-6\"><em>Ingraham, </em>for the plaintiff in' error,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARE\">declined arguing the first specific error assigned: as to the second error, he contended, 1. That there could be no doubt as to the right of the <em>debtor </em>to appropriate money that he pays, when he is indebted upon two accounts, or is liable to several claims, to the extinguishment of any one that he pleases; and that\" the .right of appropriation devolved upon the <em>creditor, </em>only in cases where' the debtor refused or neglected to make it himself. <em>(Mayor of Alexandria </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>4 <em>branch, </em>317. <em>bremer </em>v. <em>Higginson, </em>1 <em>Mason\u2019s Rep. </em>324.) Here the payment was made to <em>John Hall, who </em>thereby became th^agent of the plaintiff in error, for the purpose of paying over the money to <em>Harrison Hall, </em>for whose benefit a <em>trust </em>was raised, and it was a breach of good faith on the part of <em>John Hall, </em>to refuse to apply the money to meet that trust. Suppose <em>Ingraham </em>had been the inhabitant of another state, and had remitted this money to <em>Hall, </em>directing him to pay <em>Harrison Hall; </em>could any other creditor have attached it? Could <em>Hall </em>have attached in his own hands? The cases are express that he could not. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>394. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Pemberton, </em>1 <em>Dali. </em>3. <em>Sharpless </em>v. <em>Welsh, 4 Dali. </em>279.) Suppose it had been <em>remitted </em>to him, would his having a-claim on <em>another </em>account, enable him to divert the remittance from its destination ? <em>Ingraham </em>had no intention, and did <em>no: </em>act to place this money in <em>John Hall\u2019s </em>hands, unclothed with a trust; it was <em>Harrison Hall\u2019s </em>the moment it left <em>Ingraham\u2019s </em>possession, accompanied by the declaration that he made a particular appropriation of it; and even bankruptcy would not have defeated the right of the creditor to whose use it was destined. <em>Hassall </em>v. <em>Smithers, </em>(12 <em>Ves. jun. </em>119.) is this very ease. Sir William Grant puts the decision on the principle contended for. Besides, <em>Hall </em>was responsible to <em>Harrison Hall </em>as the drawer of the draft, and because he took his money <em>after </em>he drew it; and <em>Ingraham </em>was responsible to <em>Harrison Hall before </em>the payment, because he had undertaken to accept the draft <em>before </em>it was drawn, and that amounted to an acceptance. (boolidgev. <em>Pay son, </em>2 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>66.) But there was more than an appropriation by <em>Ingraham; </em>for <em>Hall </em>in his bill says, <em>\u201c </em>by cash received on account from <em>Harrison Hall\u201d </em>\u2014 and that amount, if he appropriated the check to his own-use, as well as <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>money, would reduce his demand to <em>twenty-five </em>dollars; so that upon the whole case he could not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">2- There was error in the charge, as assigned in the third specific error; ^or it is not very intelligible to say, where the plaintiff has divided his avowed claim of seventy-five dollars, and brought <em>two </em>actions for it, one to recover <em>fifty, </em>and the other <em>twenty-five </em>dollars, that a question cannot arise in either action, as to the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of the plaintiff to split up an entire cause of action, because it is directly in contradiction to the facts of the case. And why is the principle conceded by the court below, to apply only to the last action ? Clearly the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>would be as much at variance in the first action as the last, and a plaintiff might recover a sum of thirty dollars upon a note for three hundred dollars, without showing any payments, if such be the law. Suppose <em>In-graham </em>had suffered a judgment by default in both actions, and had then taken a <em>certiorari; </em>both judgments must have been re, versed. The case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>(15 <em>Johns. Ilep. </em>329.) decides the very point.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AW-\"><em>Ewing, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aay\">The plaintiff in error has changed his ground in this court: in the court below, he contended that he owed nothing to the plaintiff upon a <em>quantum meruit, </em>(\u00a1\u00a1fire court informed Mr. <em>Ewing, </em>that they were confined to the record in the case before them.) When <em>John Hall </em>refused to make the appropriation, <em>Ingraham </em>should have demanded his money back again. This is in reality but one claim, and credit is given for fifty dollars paid, and the plaintiff has by his own act reduced the demand to one hundred dollars, fie must therefore lose the twenty-five dollars for which the second action was brought before the magistrate, which is what the court below meant when they said, that they agreed with the counsel for <em>Ingraham </em>as to the division of an entire claim, but that the principle could not be applied to this case.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The opinion ,of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AXs\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqX\">This was an action brought before Alderman <em>Kep'pele </em>by the defendant in error, <em>John Hall, </em>to recover a balance of fifty dollars, alleged to be- due to <em>John Hall </em>from <em>Ingraham </em>for services rendered. The alderman gave judgment for the plaintiff, and this appeal was then entered. One short view of this case disposes of all the objections. During the performance of these services, <em>John Hall </em>applied 1o his expenses fifty dollars of money collected by him for his son <em>Harrison. Ingraham </em>authorized <em>John Hall </em>to draw on him for this amount, which he did in favour of <em>Harrrison Hall. </em>This draft <em>Ingraham </em>refused to accept. He afterwards drew his check in favour of <em>John Hall; </em>and when he 'delivered it to him, he said it was in full of the draft. <em>John Hall </em>said he would not receive it as such, or that it was not, or words to that effect. By the transcript filed, it appears to have been a suit in the name of <em>John Hall </em>for the use of <em>II. Hall </em>for fifty dollars; less by twenty-five dollars, after deducting this check of fifty dollars, than <em>John Hall\u2019s </em>demand. <em>John Hall </em>brought an action some time after on the same account for twenty-five dollars, but which, it appeared, never had been proceeded on. On the trial, <em>Ingraham </em>gave in evidence an account rendered by <em>John Hall, </em>dated <em>January </em>3d, 1820; in which he charges him for services, including disbursements, with one hundred and twenty-five dollars; and ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dits him with cash received on account from <em>Harrison Hall </em>fifty dollars, and strikes a balance of seventy-five dollars. The objections are, that this was one contract, entire,- and' could not be split; two actions could not be supported for the same demand. All this is most true, and would have been an answer to the second action. The first action for the whole balance, though it was only for fifty dollars, would have been a complete bar to any other action brought for the same demand. There was nothing forbidden in the deduction. He could not recover more than fifty dollars. He' has received less by twenty-five dollars than his real debt. Where a recovery has been had in a suit in which the plaintiff counted for an entire sum, e. <em>g. </em>a balance, the record of such recovery is a conclusive bar to any other action brought, on the same contract. <em>Kess </em>v. <em>Heeble, </em>6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 57. </em>This was not an action by <em>Harrison Hall, </em>or for money advanced by him, or on the draft which <em>Ingraham </em>promised in writing to accept, but did not. And admitting the right of <em>Harrison Hall </em>to sue in his own name for the fifty dollars,- he'was not bound so to do\u2018. He might return it to' the drawer, and so he did; and so the plaintiff in error understood, or why draw the check in <em>John\u2019s </em>name ? Why pay it to- him in discharge of the draft ? It is very reasonable to1 suppose that <em>In-graham </em>intended this as a payment in full, arid very natural for <em>John Hall </em>to say,- \u201cI do' not take this, or account it to be, in full of -the.draft; because, not being accepted, and being returned to me, it became ar nullity; it neveaSad life; and I will credit it in your account:\u201d which he did, am which <em>Harrison Hall </em>ratified by this action, which was for a balance. There could be no balance' without\u2018deducting this; for nothing else had been paid. For what purpose was this evidence given ? It could only be as proof of payment, and for that payment he is credited. He could not say, \u201cI paid that on the draft, and you misapplied it by passing it to my general credit.\u201d It just amounts to the same thing;, if it was applied, as he said it ought to be applied, to pay the draft,- the balance would be recoverable in this action. It could not first be' applied to pay the draft, and then deducted from the balance. That would be having credit for one hundred, instead of fifty dollars and he has, in fact, credit for it jn the account produced by himself, as for so much advanced by <em>Harrison Hall. </em>The argument is founded, on the assumption, that <em>Ingraham </em>owed <em>John Hall </em>money on two distinct contracts. This was not so. The unaccepted draftof <em>John Hall </em>did not make him his debtor for that fifty dollars. Whatever debt he owed <em>John Hall </em>was one entire debt; therefore the rule <em>quicquid solvi\u00edur, solvitur ad modum solventis </em>can have no application. <em>John Hall </em>had no claim on <em>Ingraham, </em>but for these services; therefore there was nothing else to which to apply th\u00e9 payment. The drawer and the payee, the bill not being accepted, pould cancel it, and restore things to their first state. Indeed they never were altered: the unaccepted bill was no payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to <em>John Hall. It </em>gave him no cause of action. <em>Harrison Hall </em>was not bound to pursue <em>Ingraham </em>on this bill; he might return it to <em>Hall. </em>He did return it ;\u2022 and <em>Ingraham </em>has got credit for the fifty dollars on the proper account. It operates as payment of fifty dollars in his favour; and the very party who, he says, ought to have got it, has got it; for <em>Harrison Hall </em>acknowledges by this action for the balance, that there has been this payment, and never could trouble <em>Ingraham </em>on account of this bill; this action would show payment and be a bar. <em>Harrison Hall, </em>on <em>Ingraham\u2019s </em>re-fusal to accept the bill, could have sued <em>John Hail </em>immediately for \u2022the money he had applied in these expenses. As soon as the drawee refused for one moment to accept the bill, his right of action was well vested, and that without returning the bill. <em>Mussen </em>v. <em>Price, </em>4 <em>East, </em>147. <em>Aukley </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>7 <em>Taunt. 312. </em>If so, <em>John Hall\u2019s </em>right of action for his- whole amount was at the same moment vested in him..</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
