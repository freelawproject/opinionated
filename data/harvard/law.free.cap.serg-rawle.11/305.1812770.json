By reason whereof, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">The defendants pleaded <em>non assumpserunt </em>and payment; and on behalf of <em>Samuel Patton, </em>a plea of infancy was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-7\">After evidence had been given in support of the plea of infancy, from which it appeared, that <em>Samuel Patton </em>arrived at full age on the 26th of <em>May, </em>1814, the plaintiffs offered to prove, that before and at the date of the agreement declared on', <em>Samuel Pat-ion </em>was, and had been in business, dealing for himself to a large amount, and receiving conveyances of land in his own name, and for his own use. This evidence was objected to by the defendants counsel, and rejected by the court, to whose opinion an exception was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-8\">The plaintiffs then offered in evidence a deed, dated 3d of <em>Jlpril, </em>1814, from <em>William Patton </em>to <em>Edward B. </em>and <em>Samuel Patton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>conveying a large estate, the consideration for whieh was stated to be 30,000 dollars. They further offered to show,, that <em>Samuel </em>was doing business in bank before that time, by endorsing notes, &amp;c. which were discounted. The court rejected the evidence, and their opinion was again excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">The plaintiffs offered in evidence a note, dated the 25th of <em>August, </em>1814, drawn by <em>William </em>and <em>Samuel Patton, </em>and indorsed by <em>Robert J. Stewart, </em>for the accommodation of the drawers, which it was admitted had been discounted in bank. An objection was made to this testimony, and it was overruled by the court, who sealed another bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">They then offered a bond, dated <em>May </em>14th, 1814, given by <em>William, Edward, B. </em>and <em>Samuel Patton </em>to <em>James Maxwell, </em>conditioned to make him a good title to a certain tract of land. The execution of the bond was admitted, but the counsel for the defendant <em>objected to its being </em>read in evidence, and the court sustained <em>the objection. </em>Their opinion was excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-8\">The depositions of <em>Edward B. Patton </em>and <em>John Anderson </em>were then offered in evidence by the counsel for the plaintiffs; parts of them objected to, and the objection sustained by the court, whose opinion was excepted to. But the reporters have no means of knowing what.were the contents of these depositions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-9\">The plaintiffs having proved, that <em>Samuel Patton, </em>in the' year 1810 or 1811, did business in the store of <em>Patton </em>and <em>Davis, </em>offered to prove, that he was at that time a partner in the concern, and that he had declared that <em>he was </em>interested in it. The evidence was <em>objected to, and </em>rejected. A bill of exceptions was, thereupon, tendered by the counsel for the plaintiffs, and sealed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-10\">The counsel for the plaintiffs asked the witness who had proved that <em>Samuel Patton </em>did business in the store of <em>Patton </em>and <em>Davis, </em>whether it was mentioned at that time, that he was of age ? The question was objected to, and overruled, and an exception taken to the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-11\">The plaintiffs proposed to prove, that on the trial of .this cause before arbitrators, <em>Samuel Patton </em>did not allege infancy in his defence. It seemed, that the arbitrators had filed no award, nor did it appear that they had acted in the business. The admission of the evidence was opposed, the court rejected it, and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-12\">The counsel for the plaintiffs then offered in evidence an agreement,! dated 25th of <em>October, </em>1814, between <em>William Patton </em>and <em>Samuel Patton, </em>which recited, that whereas, <em>William Patton </em>did, on.the.--day of-, A, D. convey unto <em>Samuel Patton </em>certain portions of <em>Tussey Furnace, </em>together with the lands, ore banks, &amp;c. thereto belonging, and also certain parts or portions of <em>Sligo </em>Forge,lands, &amp;c. and also certain parts or portions of a farm, known <em>by </em>the name of the <em>Wallace Farm, in </em>consideration' of which, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>said <em>Samuel Patton </em>was to have become bound, together with the said William, in all the said <em>William\u2019s </em>debts, and <em>by his signature or indorsement, on certain notes discounted in bank, did become bound; </em>therefore, the said <em>Samuel </em>did, for himself, Lis heirs, and assigns, release, and forever quit claim, and gj^\u2019e up all right, title, and claim, whatsoever, of him the said <em>Samuel, </em>of, in, and to the above-mentioned property, lands, ore banks, furnaces, forge, &amp;c., provided the said <em>William </em>should release him from his indorsements aforesaid; and when he should be so released, the said <em>Samuel </em>bound himself to make a deed of conveyance to the said <em>William, </em>of all the above described property, &amp;c. To the admission of this agreement in evidence, the counsel for the defendant objected, and the court refused to admit it; upon which, an exception was taken to their opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">Conformably to their agreement, <em>Samuel Patton </em>executed a release to <em>William Patton, </em>on the 1st of <em>March, </em>1815.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">The plaintiffs proposed to prove, by the testimony of <em>JR. T. Stewart, </em>what <em>Sligo Forge </em>was sold for to <em>Patton </em>and <em>Porter. </em>The evidence was objected to on the ground, that as it was conveyed by deed, the deed ought to be produced and proved. The evidence was rejected by the court, and their opinion excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-7\">Lastly, the plaintiffs proposed to give evidence, that many years ago, <em>Samuel Patton </em>acknowledged, that a partnership sub-. sisted between himself and <em>William Patton. </em>The evidence being objected to, it was overruled by the court, who sealed another bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-8\">The court were requested by the counsel for the defendant, to charge the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-9\">1., That if the jury believe, that on the 3d of <em>March, </em>1814, when the contract on which this suit is brought was executed, <em>Samuel Patton </em>was a minor, and that he did not, after his arrival at full age, ratify and confirm the said contract, their verdict should be' for the said <em>Samuel.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-10\"><em>2. </em>That nothing short of an express promise, with full knowledge of his rights and privileges, after his arrival at full age,would amount in law to a ratification of a contract made by a minor, which was not binding during his minority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-11\">3. That there is nothing in the deed from <em>William Patton to Edward B. </em>and <em>Samuel Patton, </em>of the 3d of <em>April, </em>1814, the agreement between <em>William </em>and <em>Samuel Patton </em>of the 25th of <em>October, </em>1814, and the deed of release from <em>Samuel </em>to <em>William, Patton </em>of the 1st of <em>March, </em>1815, which afford \u00e1ny <em>essential </em>evidence, that the premises mentioned in the deed of the Sd of <em>April, </em>1814, were conveyed to the said <em>Samuel Patton, </em>to indemnify him against his liability on the agreement on which this suit is brought, and that there is nothing in the said deed and agreements which can make the said <em>Samuel </em>liable on the contract on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>this suit is brought, provided the jury believe, that the said <em>Samuel </em>was a minor when he executed the said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">The opinion of the court being in favour of the defendant on all these points, it was excepted to by the counsel for the plaintiffs, who removed the record to this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-6\">Errors were assigned in the opinion of the court below, in rejecting the evidence offered by the plaintiffs, and in their instructions to the jury, which were argued by <em>Burnside </em>and <em>Hale, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae\">who cited <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>4 <em>Ball. </em>130. 3 <em>Ba.

The counsel for the plaintiffs in error, have abandoned the first, which was the entry of judgment on the demurrer. The eleven bills of exceptions to the rejection of evidence, are nearly of the same complexion; a rejection of evidence to show a dealing by the defendant, while a minor, his entering into a number of contracts, and transacting business as an adult. The objection to the charge of the court, was to the instruction given to the jury, that there was no evidence of any confirmation of the contract by <em>Samuel Patton, after his arrival at fall </em>age. The declaration states, that <em>Samuel Patton </em>was the security of his brother <em>William, </em>for his performance of certain.articles of agreement, entered into <em>between the </em>plaintiffs and him.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">To admit evidence of a partnership between the brothers, and charge <em>Samuel </em>as a principal, would be repugnant to the contract declared on, which if it can be supported, must be by rejecting as surplusage, every word in the declaration, in which the stipulation is declared on as a promissory note. It was not for any sum certain; the sum was to depend on a future appraisement.' The declaration is on a special contract, in which the plaintiffs would be bound to prove the case as they , stated it. The evidence, therefore, was properly rejected. The case must be considered as a contract, in which <em>Samuel Patton, </em>a minor, had bound himself as security for his brother, in an amount afterwards to he ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The plaintiffs say, the evidence was to prove a fraud in <em>Samuel, </em>in holding himself out to the world as a man of full age; and therefore, his contracts, though an infant, should bind him. It was not offered to prove, that <em>Samuel </em>represented himself as of full <em>age; </em>but if he had, the evidence was most properly rejected, for, as the action arose out of the contract, and as the plaintiffs had declared on the contract, the false representations, and deceit <em>of Samuel, </em>could not be admitted; and I do not think, that it was possible to support an action for deceit, on the contract of an infant) for that would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to deprive the infant of the protection given to him by the law. Now, the law has very wisely protected infants against their liability on contracts, except for necessaries, and if it were, in the power of a plaintiff to convert that which arises out of a contract, into a tort, there is an end of the protection. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Pye, </em>1 <em>Sid. </em>358. Lord Chief Justice Keeling, expressed great indignation at the attempt to charge an infant in tort, upon that which was the foundation of an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>and said, \u201cWe will stay the judgment for ever, else the whole foundation of the common law will be at stake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In <em>Groves </em>v. <em>Neville, </em>1 <em>Keb. </em>778, 913, 914, in an action on the casej in the nature of deceit, a sale by the defendant of goods as his own, when in truth, they belonged to another, the court said, this is no actual tort, nor any thing <em>ex delicto, </em>but only <em>ex contractu. </em>And in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Pye, </em>1 <em>Keb. </em>905, 913, and 1 <em>Lev. </em>169, where the defendant had falsely and fraudulently asserted himself to be of full age, and had, as such, executed a mortgage to the plaintiff, it was holden, that the defendant, an infant, was not answerable, because the action was founded on the very contract in which ihe defendant had cheated the plaintiff. Even if the infant had borrowed the money himself, affirming, that he was of age, and given bond for it, and being sued on the bond, avoids it by reason of mon-age, yet no action lies against him for the deceit. <em>Bingham on Infancy, </em>111. 3 <em>Ba. Ab. 591. </em>The principle is as well es-</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">tablished as any rule of the common law, that a plaintiff cannot convert an action, founded on a contract, into a tort, to deprive an infant of the benefit of a plea of infancy. A case, I think, may be found, where the plaintiff declared, that at the defendant\u2019s request, he had delivered a mare to the defendant, to be moderately ridden, and the defendant inhumanly intending, &amp;e., wrongfully, and injuriously rode the mare, so that she was damaged ; and it was held, that the defendant might plead his infancy in bar; the action being founded on a contract. It is said in some books, that an infant running about town, taking up goods on credit, on his assertion that he was of full age, may be indicted as a common cheat. <em>Barlow\u2019s Justice of Peace, </em>100. 1 <em>Burns, </em>278. The trading contracts of an infant are void. He may enforce them at his own election, but he is not liable for goods delivered to him to trade with. 2 <em>Str. </em>939. An infant cannot be a bankrupt. 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>443.1 <em>Atk. </em>146. Nor can a debt, contracted during infancy be the ground of a commission, though the act of bankruptcy be committed after he came of age. 12 Mod. 443. In this contract, there was no possibility, or appearance of benefit to the infant; it is, therefore, not voidable only, but absolutely void. <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Ward, Fitzgib, </em>278. All this evidence was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">On the confirmation: I am not able to discover any thing like this, either in the deed of the 3d of <em>Jlpril, </em>1814, from <em>William Patton </em>to <em>Edward </em>and <em>Samuel </em>Patton; -in the agreement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>William </em>and <em>Samuel Patton, </em>of the 25th of <em>October, </em>1814, or the release of <em>Samuel Patton </em>to <em>William Patton </em>of the 1st of <em>March, </em>1815. The agreement of the 25th of <em>October, </em>1814, so much relied on, has no relation to this contract. It recites, that <em>Samuel </em>was to have become bound with <em>William, </em>in all the said <em>William\u2019s </em>debts. This is but part of the sentence. The subsequent part explains what was intended by all the said <em>William\u2019s </em>debts, viz. \u201c <em>by his signature, or. indorsement on certain notes discounted in bank.\u201d </em>He states how far he was bound; by certain notes discounted in bank. The three agreements of the infant, after he became of age, would not amount to a confirmation. There must be some distinct act, by which he either receives a benefit from the contract after he arrives at full age, or does some_ act of express ratification. All the cases cited are, where the contract was voidable, and might probably be of benefit to the infant; and in all of them it appears, that some act was done by the infant, evincing his assent, as purchases made, or leases given, rendering a rent, by which, either the continuance in possession, or the receipt of the rent received, showed his direct assent and ratification. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>11 <em>Johns. </em>542. If a partition is unequal, and the infant takes the profits, after his arrival at full age, it bars him for ever. In the case of an infant, who was merely security, where the contract is absolutely void, it would appear to me to require a confirmation, when of full age, with an intent of confirming, and with the knowledge that the act would be void, uAless he confirmed it. There shoudl be evidence of a distinct act of confirmation. None such was offered. The written evidence was not of that nature, nor had it any relation to this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
