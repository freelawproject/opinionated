It is sufficient, for the purpose of introducing the points decided to state, that the plaintiffs below-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>claimed the land in dispute as the heirs of <em>John Snyder, </em>deceased. It was sold as a part of his estate by order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and purchased by <em>Anthony Selin, </em>deceased, under whom the defendants claimed. The sale was conducted by <em>John Miller, </em>one of the administrators of <em>John Snyder, </em>and the great question in the cause was, whether the sale was fair ; it being alleged by the plaintiffs, that in consequence of the violence and threats of <em>Anthony Selin, </em>persons who attended \u25a0 the sale with an intention to purchase, were deterred from bidding, and thus the land went off below its value. It was contended by the plaintiffs, and evidence was given in support of the fact, that <em>Simon Snyder, </em>the brother of <em>John Snyder, </em>and one of his administrators, was a secret partner of <em>Anthony Selin, </em>in his purchase of the land. This was denied by the defendants, who produced evidence to sustain their denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\">In the course of the trial, the deposition of <em>Michael Brown </em>was read by the plaintiffs, which stated, that in the fall of the year 1790, he attended a vendue held at <em>Sunbury, </em>for the sale of the lands of <em>John Snyder, </em>and made a bid, upon which <em>Anthony Selin </em>became very angry, and said, \u201cyou bid because yoii want to make the land high; you do riot want it.\u201d The deponent replied, that he did want it, if it did not come too high, and then bid again. Upon this, <em>Selin lifted up a stick, and said, if you bid again I will knock you down. The deponent was then afraid, and said he would bid no more. </em>He then said to Mr. <em>Kendig^ </em>who was married to <em>Snyder\u2019s </em>widow, that he should bid for him. <em>Kendig </em>bid twice for the deponent, upon which <em>Selin </em>became so angry, that the deponent said to <em>Kendig, </em>you shall bid no more for me. If <em>Selin </em>had not behaved himself so, the deponent said, he would have given four or five hundred pounds more for the land. Many-other facts, some of them of the same tendency, were testified by the deponent, who, on his cross examination, was asked by the counsel for the defendants, <em>whether he had ever said, that he stopt Ken-dig from bidding, not because Selin had threatened, but because he thought he would be a bad neighbour ? </em>To this question the deponent answered, \u201c <em>I did say it, and that is true.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">The defendants offered to prove, that on various occasions, within six years, <em>Daniel Rhoad </em>and <em>Anthony Snyder, </em>two of the plaintiffs, had declared, that as soon as this action was ended, if they gained it, they would proceed to recover the town itself. The court, on an objection being made to the evidence, rejected it, and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">The defendants also offered to prove, that <em>Anthony Selin </em>had declared, that he only meant to bid eight dollars per acre, for the land of <em>John Snyder: </em>That this took place <em>at, and just before </em>the sale: That he offered to several persons, immediately after he purchased, to become partners with him, at the same rate at which he had bought, among whom, he said, was <em>Simon </em>Snyder, who would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>have nothing to do with it. The counsel for the plaintiffs objected to the testimony offered, except that part of it which related to the declarations and conduct of <em>Jlnthony Selin at the </em>sale. The court sustained the objection, and the counsel for the defendants excepted to their opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">Among the questions submitted by the counsel for the defendants to the court below, were the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">1. Whether or not, it is a sufficient ground to set aside the sale to <em>Selin, </em>that there was no necessity to sell the premises ; that is, if the debts could have been paid otherwise, by the sale of other property, or by the rents ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">To this question the court answered: \u201cIf you believe there was no necessity for the sale, and that the law was not complied with, the sale is void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">At another time the court said: \u201cWhether there was or was not a necessity for the sale, is of no consequence, nor whether the debts might have been paid otherwise than by sale of the property or by rents.\u201d ; .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-10\">2. Whether the sale to <em>Selin </em>ought to be set aside on the ground, that <em>Bower </em>would have given more, but for the reason stated in his deposition, viz: that he prevented <em>'Kendig </em>from bidding further, not because <em>Selin </em>threatened, but because he would be a bad neighbour?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-11\">The answer of the court was as follows: \u00a3\u00a3 If the jury believe, that the conduct of <em>Jlnthony Selin </em>at the sale, was such as to deter others from purchasing, the sale is void, and as to w hat reason is stated in -SoMiers\u2019deposition, the court do not know what it is.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-12\">In this court, errors were assigned in the rejection by the Court of Common Pleas, of the evidence stated in the two bills of exceptions, and in their instructions to the jury on the two points above stated.1</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-13\">On the argument, <em>Bellas </em>and <em>Greenough, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apu\">abandoned the first bill of exceptions. With respect to the second, they contended, that the declarations of <em>Selin, </em>made just before the sale, were part of the <em>res gesta, </em>and ought to have been, given in evidence. They were peculiarly proper, because the. plaintiffs had given in evidence his declarations, <em>before, </em>as well as <em>at </em>the sale. His offer, immediately after the sale, to admit others into a partnership with him in his purchase, was clearly evidence. This was a <em>fact, </em>which went to rebut the charge, that he had purchased at an under price, and also to rebut the charge of collusion with <em>Simon Snyder, </em>who was alleged to have been secretly concerned with <em>Selin </em>in the purchase. All his declarations should be taken together. 1 <em>Phill. Ev. </em>76,202. <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>3 <em>Dali </em>19. <em>Turnbull v. O\u2019Hara, 1 Yeates, 446, 452. Drum </em>v. <em>The Lessee of Simpson, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>478. <em>Lightner </em>v. <em>Wike, </em>4 <em>Serg. fyBawle, </em>203.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-14\">The different parts of the charge of the court were contradictory to each other, , and left the jury in absolute plerplexity as to the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>involved in the case. This court has once already reversed the judgment of the court below, in this very ease, on this ground. <em>Lessee of Snyder </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>490. <em>Work </em>v. <em>The Lessee of M\u2018Clay, 2Serg. </em>\u00a7\u25a0 Rawle, 417. <em>Sampson </em>v. Sampson, 4 <em>Serg. fy Rawle, 333.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">The court, upon being requested to charge the jury, whether the matter set forth in <em>Bowers\u2019 </em>deposition, viz: <em>that he was afraid of a bad neighbour in Selin, would render the sale void, </em>instructed them, that if <em>Selin\u2019s conduct deterred purchasers, </em>the sale was void. This was no answer to the question, and not to answer it, was error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-7\">It was also assigned for error, that the original paper containing the answers and instructions of the court to the jury, was drawn up by the counsel of the plaintiffs below, and adopted by the court in giving their instructions to the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-8\"><em>Lachells </em>and <em>Hepburn, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_1\">The declarations of a party are not evidence in his favour. The plaintiffs below had not given in evidence any declarations of <em>Se~ lin, </em>and if they had, they would only have let the defendants in to prove the whole of these declarations. The declarations offered to be proved by the defendants, had no connection with those proved by the plaintiffs. Declarations by a man against himself, at one time, cannot be rebutted, by counter declarations made at another time. <em>Blight </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>1 <em>Peters Rep. </em>15. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Be Klyne, </em>1 <em>Peters Rep. </em>203. <em>M\u2018Peake </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>5 <em>Serg. </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>Rawle, </em>295. 4 <em>Binn. </em>334. These declarations may have been made, with a view of taking off the effect of his conduct, in purchasing at an' under price, by means of threats, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-11\">The written opinion was the only one intended by the court, although it is true, the court have since returned something more, which they say, they told the jury. This is not the case of a contradictory charge. An answer was given to a specific question proposed by the defendants\u2019 counsel, by which the verbal answer first given, was retracted. The written answer was the only instruction the jury could regard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-12\">The court had a right to adopt the opinion of counsel, and they have done so. The only question is, whether there be .error in that opinion?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-13\">As to <em>Bower\u2019s </em>deposition, the court instructed the jury rightly. The counsel should have stated what part of the deposition they referred to, when they asked the court to give an opinion on it.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b322-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b322-15\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXl\">Two bills of exceptions were taken by the counsel of the defendants, to the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas, on points of evidence; besides which, several exceptions were taken to the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">The first bill of exceptions was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The second, was to the opinion of the court, in rejecting evidence offered by the defendants, of certain declarations of <em>Anthony Selin, </em>viz. that he had said, at, and just before the sale, \u201cthat he intended to bid but eight dollars an acre,\u201d and that immediately after the sale, \u201che offered to several persons, to take them as partners in his purchase, at the same rato at which he bought.\u201d The court decided, that no declarations of <em>Selin, </em>except those <em>at the sale, </em>should be given in evidence. It would have been very proper, to exclude all declarations before the sale; neither do I think, that any thing said by <em>Athony Selin, </em>as to what he intended to bid, was evidence. But his offer, after the sale, to take a partner, at the same rate at which he purchased, certainly was evidence. One of the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments against the sale, was, that the price Was far below the value of the land. Now had this been the ease, it could hardly be supposed, that the purchaser would have given away half his profit, by taking in a partner. Neither can it be denied, that a public offer, made and not accepted, to sell one half the land, at the price at which it was struck off, is some evidence, that if was not much below its value. But this evidence was proper for another reason. The plaintiffs suggested, that <em>Anthony Selin </em>made the purchase, in collusion and in secret partnership with <em>Simon Snyder, </em>one of the administrators of his brother <em>John. </em>If so, the sale ought not to have stood; for although it was ostensibly conducted by <em>John Miller, </em>yet it might well be supposed that <em>Simon Snyder </em>had some influence over him. And at all events, it was against law, that one of the administrators, entrusted with the sale by the Orphans Court, should be concerned in the purchase. It was natural for the defendants therefore, to disprove that fact, and for that purpose the evidence was important; for, if <em>Simon Snyder </em>was a partner, <em>Selin </em>would have had no right to take another person in. I am of opinion, therefore, that there was error in rejecting the evidence of these offers made by <em>Anthony Selin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The first exception to the charge of the court was this: The court was requested to instruct the jury, whether the matter set forth in this deposition <em>o\u00ed Michael Bower, </em>viz. \u201cthat he was afraid of a bad neighbour in <em>Selin,\u201d </em>would make the sale void. To which the court answered, <em>\u201c </em>that if <em>Selin\u2019s </em>conduct deterred purchasers, the sale was void.\u201d When we consider the whole of <em>Bower\u2019s </em>deposition, this answer is not to be found fault with. <em>Bower </em>swore, that he attended the sale for the purpose of bidding, and would have given the sum of five hundred pounds more than the land went off at, but for the behaviour of <em>Selin, </em>who threatened to knock him down when he made a bid himself, and got into a passion, afterwards, when Mr. <em>Kendig, </em>at his request, made a bid for him. It was prudent, in the court, when charging the jury on the subject of <em>Bowers\u2019 </em>testimony, to take the whole into view, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>not confine themselves to the particular part selected by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The next objection to the charge, is, that it was contradictory. That the court first told the jury, <em>\u201c </em>that if they believed there was no necessity for a sale of <em>John Snyder\u2019s </em>land, in order to pay his debts, &amp;c. and that the administrators had not complied with the law, the order of sale made by the Orphans\u2019 Court was void;\u201d and afterwards instructed them,1 <em>\u201c </em>that it was of no consequence whether there was a necessity or not, or whether the debts might have been paid out of other funds.\u201d With all due allowance for the associate Justices, who delivered this charge in the absence of the President, there does appear to be a contradiction which must have left the jury at a loss what to think of the law. When that is the case, there must be error. It has been so decided on several occasif'- -</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The last exception to the charge is, that some material parts of it, were dictated, and drawn up, by the counsel for the plaintiffs. That is a matter with which this court has nothing to do, nor can we know, by the record, in whose handwriting the original charge was, or who dictated it. The only question for us, is, whether there be error. If the law was properly declared by the court, it is of no importance from whom they derived their information; if improperly, the party injured may have redress by writ of error. The judgment is to be reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
