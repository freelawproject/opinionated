The defendants claimed under two locations of the 3d <em>April, </em>1679; one of them, No 1347, in the name of <em>George Knight, </em>and the other No. 1796, in the name of <em>George Wilson, </em>both the property of <em>Samuel Wallis, </em>from whom the defendants derived their title. On the trial of the cause, the defendants took nine bills of exceptions to evidence. The' 2d and 9th of these exceptions have been abandoned. The other seven have been argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>1. The plaintiffs alleged, that <em>Charles Lukens, </em>deputy survey- or, had made a survey on <em>Brown\u2019s </em>location, which ought to have been returned for <em>Brown, </em>but that it was improperly returned for <em>Samuel Wallis. </em>And to prove this, they offered in evidence, a draft found among the official papers in the office of the deputy surveyor of the district. This draft was not signed by any officer, nor returned to the surveyor general, neither did it purport to have be^n made for <em>Brown, </em>or any other particular person; but it was proved to be the hand writing of either <em>Jesse </em>or <em>Charles Lu-kens, </em>both of whom were deputy surveyors. The defendants objected to this evidence, but the court admitted it. No doubt, this draft was evidence. If the survey was made for <em>Brown, </em>he would have title to the land, though the return was made for <em>Wallis. </em>Now a draft made by the deputy surveyor was certainly some evidence, although it might not be sufficient for the plaintiffs\u2019 purpose, unless corroborated by circumstances. Such cases have occurred before, and such evidence has always been admitted. In the <em>Lessee of Adams </em>v. <em>Goodlander, </em>&amp;c. <em>2 Yeates, </em>313, it was decided, that papers found in the office of the deputy surveyor, in his handwriting, were evidence, to impeach his return of the survey. In <em>Bayles, in error, </em>v. <em>Johnson\u2019s Executors, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>125, papers were admitted in evidence, which had been found in the office of the deputy surveyor, and had a tendency to show that a survey had been made for one person and not returned, and afterwards the same land had been surveyed and returned for another. The same principle was recognized, in <em>Hubley </em>v. <em>White, 2 Yeates, </em>133, and in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>which, I believe, has not been reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">3. The defendants offered to prove, by <em>David Evans, what was the value of the landin dispute, in the year, </em>1784; but the court refused the evidence. The decision of the court was right The matter to be tried was, whether the plaintiffs had good title, not whether they had purchased the land below its value. They did not purchase of the defendants, or of any person under whom the defandants claimed. It was nothing to them, therefore, what was the value of the land when the plaintiffs purchased, or at what price they purchased. Evidence of this kind serves but to excite the <em>prejudice </em>of the jury, and leads to a verdict founded on passion, rather than on reason, There was no point of law, or equity,' bearing on the cause, to which the evidence was applicable. It was, therefore, properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">4. The defendants offered, a deed from <em>Jonathan Walker, </em>one of the plaintiffs, to <em>Thomas Burnside, </em>for his interest in the land in dispute, executed since the commencement of this suit. The plaintiffs objected to the evidence, and the court rejected it. Had it been simply a deed of conveyance of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>part of the land, it would have been evidence; because, after such a conveyance, <em>Walker </em>would not have been entitled to a recovery. But it was not so. It is a deed of a singular nature. After reciting, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Walker </em>was indebted to <em>Philip Benner </em>in the sum of 600 dollars, or thereabouts, and wished to secure the payment of the same as soon as possible, it goes on to the granting part, viz. \u201che the said <em>Walker </em>did, in consideration of the premises, <em>assign, transfer, and set over, to the said Burnside, all the interest he had in the survey of Benjamin Brown, on which Richard G\u00f3malas resided, upon the special trust, and confidence, to sell and dispose of the same, and to pay the said Brown, the said debt.\u201d </em>The words of conveyance vest no inheritance in <em>Burnside, </em>but it was clearly the intent that he should have power to sell, and convey, in fee simple. It is clear also, that <em>Walker </em>retained an interest in the premises, in case his share of the land should be more than sufficient to pay <em>Benner\u2019s </em>debt. For the surplus, there was a resulting trust for Walker. And if he had borrowed money, and paid <em>Benner\u2019s </em>debt himself, he would have had complete equity, in the whole which he had conveyed to <em>Burnside. </em>It could hardly have been intended, that a sale should be made, pending this suit; for who could be expected to purchase a law suit? It looks more like a mortgage, with power irrevocable to sell, than an absolute conveyance. And if such was its nature, there could be no objection to <em>Walker\u2019s </em>proceeding in this suit, and in case he recovers, retaining the possession until a sale is called for by <em>Benner, </em>or the trustee, <em>Burnside. </em>Indeed, a construction which would prevent a recovery in this action, would serve to defeat the intent of the parties. The case of <em>Goodtitle on </em>the demise of <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Knot, Cowp. </em>43, may throw some light .on this subject. There was a devise of land, to trustees, for payment of debts and legacies, in case the testator\u2019s personal estate was insufficient. Lord Mans* field, said, \u201c that it was, in substance, and equity, a devise <em>of a charge on the estate, </em>which may be discharged on payment of the debts and legacies.\u201d In the case before us, if <em>Benner </em>was satisfied, that <em>Walker </em>should proceed in the action, and retain the possession, when recovered, until he <em>{Benner) </em>should call for a sale, the object of the deed would be answered. I am, therefore of opinion, that the defendant cannot set it up, against the will of the parties, in order to defeat the suit; consequently it was not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">5. The next exception was to part of certain proceedings of the board of property, given in evidence by the plaintiffs. On the I5th <em>March, </em>1771, <em>Benjamin Brown </em>entered a <em>caveat </em>against a survey made for <em>George Frey, </em>on the <em>Bald Eagle Creek, </em>alleging that <em>Frey\u2019s </em>order was not laid on the land intended, but on the land applied for by the said <em>Brown. </em>On the 8th of <em>November, </em>1788, a certain <em>Benjamin Bioren, </em>appeared before the board, and produced a power of attorney from <em>George Frey, </em>authorizing him to act for him in that case, and <em>Bioren </em>also produced a writing, signed by himself as attorney for <em>Frey, </em>and by <em>Richard Gomalus, </em>by which it was agreed, that the <em>caveat </em>of <em>Brown </em>(under whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Gonzalus </em>claimed,) against <em>Frey, </em>should be withdrawn; that <em>Gonzalus </em>should release to <em>Frey, </em>a certain tract of land particularly described, and that <em>Frey </em>should release to <em>Gonzalus </em>the tract now in dispute, on which the said <em>Gonzalus </em>then lived, and on which the said <em>Brown </em>had made an improvement, which he sold to <em>Gonzalus. </em>The part of these proceedings to which the defendant objected, was that which m\u00e9ntioned the power of attorney from <em>Frey </em>to <em>Bioren, </em>and the releases between <em>Gonzalus </em>and <em>Frey, </em>If these proceedings had been offered in evidence, in order to show, that a power of attorney had actually been given, and releases executed, the objection would have been good, because the proceedings of the board, are not evidence to prove particular facts. But the purpose of their being offered, was only to prove, that both <em>Brown </em>and <em>Gonzalus </em>had been vigilant in presenting their claims. It is to be observed also, that along with these proceedings of the board of property, the plaintiff offered in evidence, the application of <em>George Frey, </em>of the 3d of <em>Jlpril, </em>1769, with the draft of a survey, to which was attached a rider, in the hand writing of <em>Charles LuJeens, </em>(deputy surveyor,) by which it appeared, that <em>Lukens </em>had, by mistake, given <em>Frey </em>the draft of a survey in the wrong place. In consequence of this mistake, <em>Frey </em>claimed the land now in dispute, which <em>Brown </em>also claimed, as having been surveyed for him; and, therefore, it was, that the <em>caveat </em>was entered by <em>Brown </em>against <em>Frey. </em>Npw, this last evidence, together with the proceedings before the board, would account for <em>Brown\u2019s </em>mistake in supposing that <em>Frey </em>had a survey for the land in dispute; and for <em>Frey\u2019s </em>mistake in thinking, that his survey was actually on that land, until <em>Charles Lukens </em>explained the error which he had committed in giving him the wrong draft. It appears, by the record, that the defendants excepted also to the evidence of the rider, attached to the draft, because it was not certified to be a true copy; but this objection was fully obviated, by the oath of Mr. <em>Potter, </em>who swore, that it was a true copy, compared by himself with the original, in the land office, in the hand writing of <em>Charles Lukens. </em>I am of'opinion, therefore, that the rider was evidence, and also the proceedings of the board of property, for the purpose for which they were offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">6. The plaintiffs offered in evidence, certain other proceedings of the board of property, viz: a <em>caveat </em>entered, 6th of <em>May, </em>1783, by <em>Richard Gonzalus </em>against <em>James Packer, </em>for the tract in dispute; an order of the board dated 6th of <em>November, </em>1788, directing the deputy surveyor to make such surveys as were necessary,to show the pretensions of the parties, and the interferences of their surveys; the decision of the board of property, 4th of <em>May, </em>1789, by which the <em>caveat </em>of <em>Gonzalus </em>was dismissed; and the deposition of <em>Samuel Wallis, </em>referred to in the said decision, and on' which it appears to have b'een founded. To all this evidence the defendant-objected, but it was admitted by the court. This evidence was of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>fered, for the same purpose that the other proceedings before the same board were, viz: to show, that <em>Gonzalus </em>had persevered in prosecuting his claim. It was objected, that <em>Packer </em>not being party to this suit, the proceedings between him and <em>Gonzalus, </em>could not be evidence. But there is no weight in this objection; because it was proved, that <em>Packer </em>had claimed the land in dispute, and therefore, it was necesssary for <em>Gonzalus </em>to <em>caveat </em>against him. It was objected also, that the deposition of <em>Samuel Wallis </em>was <em>ex-parte, </em>and therefore, not evidence. A moment\u2019s consideration will be sufficient to show, that it was evidence for the purpose for which it was offered. Both the deposition of <em>Wallis, </em>and the order of the board founded on it, were directly adverse to the title of <em>Gonzalus ; </em>but he offered them both in evidence, to prove, 1st, That he did prosecute his claim before the board of property, and 2d, That although the decision was against him, it ought not to be regarded, because it appeared on its face, to be founded on an <em>ex parte </em>deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">7. The plaintiffs offered in evidence the deposition of <em>Daniel Turner, </em>taken under a rule of court, with two drafts annexed to it. <em>Turner </em>swears, that he was an assistant to <em>Joseph J. Wallis, </em>deputy surveyor; that about the year 1792, the said <em>J. J. Wallis </em>requested him to examine the lines of interference, between a tract or two of land of his brother <em>Samuel Wallis, </em>in the name of <em>Wilson, </em>on <em>Bald Eagle, </em>and a certain claim of <em>Benjamin Brown; </em>the said <em>J. J. Wallis </em>informed him, that <em>Richard Gonzalus </em>had obtained an order from the board of property, to have the said interferences examined, and also gave the deponent the copy, or note, of <em>Brown\u2019s </em>draft: <em>\u201c That the deponent did run the lines of Brown\u2019s draft, and found them on the ground according to the draft </em>\u2014 that <em>he blocked the trees, and found them answer exactly to the date of Brown\u2019s survey.\u201d </em>The defendant objected to that part of the deposition \u2022 which speaks of <em>running the lines, </em>and <em>blocking the trees, fyc., </em>because the witness does not mention <em>fads, </em>but <em>his own conclusions. </em>I cannot perceive the force of this objection. When a man says, that he ran the lines described in a draft, which is annexed to his deposition, and found them marked on the ground, that surely is a <em>fact; </em>and when he says, he blocked the trees, and found them answer the date of the survey, that is a <em>fact, according to the common understanding of the courts, </em>which is, that a ring appears oh the block for each year. The jury could not mistake his meaning, and if they thought, that there was no truth in the notion of a ring for each year, they would pay no regard to it. An objection \"\"as also taken to that part of the deposition which speaks of the draft of <em>Brown\u2019s </em>land, because the draft alluded to- was not produced. But this objection was answered, by proof made to the court, that the draft was lost. With this proof the court below was satisfied, aud it must b\u00e9 a very strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>case indeed, to induce a court of error, to say, that the proof on that point was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">8. The last exception was to a survey, offered in evidence by the plaintiffs, for <em>Griffith Evans, </em>made by <em>Charles Lukens, </em>deputy surveyor, the 20th of <em>July, </em>1769. The objection is, that this survey was <em>irrelevant, </em>having no connexion with the land in dispute. But this survey included what is now the town of <em>Belle font, </em>which is in the neighbourhood of the land in dispute \u2014 it was relevant, therefore, inasmuch as it proved, that <em>Charles Lukens </em>was in that neighbourhood, about the time when the plaintiffs allege he made the survey on <em>Brown's </em>location. It was relevant also, because the defendants had put a question to one of the witnesses, in order to ascertain at what time <em>Charles Lukens </em>had been in that part of the country. _ _ .</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">_ _ I have gone through all the exceptions, and am of opinion, that none of them have been supported. The judgment is, therefore, to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-9\">Duncan, J. being interested in the cause, gave no opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
