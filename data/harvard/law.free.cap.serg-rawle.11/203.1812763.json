This deposition was taken by consent, when the cause was depending before arbitrators, from whose award the defendant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. The witness was living, and supposed to be somewhere in <em>York </em>county, when his deposition was offered in evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-15\"><em>Porter </em>and <em>Hopkins, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-16\"><em>Wright </em>and <em>Buchanan, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b203-17\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b203-18\">Tirghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atyy\">When a cause is brought into the Common Pleas, by an appeal from the award of arbitrators, the proceedings are <em>de novo. </em>This deposition, therefore, is to be considered, as if taken in another suit, between the same parties, for the same cause of action. This is putting it in as strong a point of light for the plaintiff, as it will bear, for the consent of the plaintiff was only, that the deposition should be taken in the cause then depending, viz: before the arbitrators, and in-such case, the general rule is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>that the deposition would he evidence, if the witness were dead. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>4 <em>Binn. </em>111. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Stewartson\u2019s Lessee, </em>2 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>84. <em>Lightner </em>v. <em>Wike, </em>4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>205. In the case of <em>Magill </em>v. <em>Kauffman, 4 S. &amp; R. </em>319, this court went one step further, and decided, that the deposition was evidence, though the witness were living, provided he was not within the state. But there was no ground for admiiting the deposition in the case before us, because the witness was living within the state, and within the jurisdiction of the court. I am, therefore, of opinion,' that it was properly rejected, and the judgment should be affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
