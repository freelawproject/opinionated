The defendant, he contended, was not in court, when he entered the rule. The writ was returnable to <em>December </em>Term, 1823: the rule for arbitration was entered on the 4th of <em>February </em>last, and the award filed in the present 'month. The plaintiff appeared before the arbitrators, and objected to their proceeding, but they went on, and awarded, no cause of action. If the plaintiff had gone into his case before them, he would have waived the bail.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b9-12\"><em>D. P.
