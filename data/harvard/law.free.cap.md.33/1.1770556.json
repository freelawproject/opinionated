To the declaration the appellees filed seven pleas, the fifth, sixth and seventh being pleas of the Statute of Limitations. The appellant joined issue on the first, second, third and fourth pleas, and replied to the fifth, sixth and seventh pleas, asserting in the very language of the pleas respectively, what was denied in the pleas; and in its fifth replication, replied specially to the said fifth, sixth and seventh pleas, setting forth that the action was brought on December 3d, 1859, with intent thereby to implead and declare against the defendants in said cause; that on said day a writ of summons issued against the defendants, and was returned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>sheriff, \u201ccannot be found;\u201d and that afterwards successive renewed writs of summons to each succeeding term of the Court were issued in said cause, so as aforesaid brought, and directed to the sheriff of said county, and were by him returned \u201c tardy,\u201d and that said cause was regularly carried forward, and to the several terms of the said Court intervening between the issuing of the first writ aforesaid, and the July Term, 1865, to which term a renewed writ of summons was issued on the 18th of July, 1865, which was duly served on the appellees, and that the bond bears date and was passed within five years next before this action was brought as aforesaid, and the issuing of the first writ aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">The appellees rejoined to the appellant\u2019s fifth replication:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">First.

The first writ of summons did not state the cause of action \u2014 the subsequent writs did. The Court was of opinion that said writs of summons did not constitute a sufficient record of proceedings under the pleadings to avoid the Statute of Limitations, and so ruled. To this ruling, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Second Exception: </em>The plaintiff then presented to the Court the docket entries of the case, from the 3d of December, 1859, until the 18th of July, 1865, and moved the Court that the entries on the appearance dockets of March Term, 1863, and to and inclusive of March Term, 1865, be so corrected, completed and brought up, as to conform to the real facts, as disclosed by the several writs of summons; but the Court refused the motion, and to this refusal, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\"><em>Third Exception: </em>The plaintiff then offered to the Court, upon the plea of <em>mil tiel record, </em>the several writs of summons mentioned in the first exception, in connection with the docket entries set out in the second exception; but the Court ruled that they did not constitute a record sufficient to avoid the plea of limitations, and to maintain the issue joined by the plaintiff to the plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>and that they W'ere not proper to be given in evidence to the jury. To this ruling, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\"><em>Fourth Exception: </em>The plaintiff then offered as evidence to the jury the several writs of summons and docket entries aforesaid; but the Court ruled that the same were inadmissible for any purpose disclosed by the pleadings and issues in the cause, and refused the offer. To this ruling, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">The verdict and judgment being for the defendant, the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b18-8\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C. J., Stewart, Brent, Grason, Miller, Alvey and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-9\"><em>A. K. Syester, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-10\">The writs of summons were regularly renewed from term to term, until the defendants were taken, and the renewal, without any omission, kept the action alive, and prevented the bar of limitations. <em>Hazlehurst vs. </em>Morris, <em>et al., </em>28 <em>Md., </em>75; 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead., </em>583; <em>Beekman vs. Satterlee, </em>5 <em>Cowen, 519; Harris vs. Woolford, </em>6 <em>Term, </em>617.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>But without reference to the special matter set up in the fifth replication, the proffered evidences were admissible under the common or general replications to the plea of limitations. <em>Dickinson vs. </em>Tagne, 1 <em>Exch., </em>241; <em>Beardmore vs. Rattenbury, </em>5 <em>B. &amp; Ad., </em>452, (7 <em>Eng. Com. </em>Law;) <em>Williams vs. Roberts, 1 Exch., 676.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">The evidences tendered, in the first exception, having been rejected, because the Court thought they were \u201cnot sufficient in themselves,\u201d to gratify the averments in the replication, the plaintiff presented to the Court the docket entries of this case, from the March Term, 1860, to which the first writ was returnable, to the July Term, 1865, when the effective writ wras issued, and then moved the Court that certain omissions in particular entries, be supplied, so as to make the entries conform precisely with the real facts and truth, as disclosed by the writs of summons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-6\">The object of the motion was simply, out of abundant caution, to supply whatever omissions in this regard, were apparent on the.docket. The Court refused the motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">It was believed in the Circuit Court, that the writs did not constitute a <em>\u201crecord,\u201d </em>and that the record was something like the technical roll or record, as it is known in England. In Maryland, such a conception of a record does not prevail. Here the \u201c record\u201d is something to' be ascertained by reference to original papers, processes of the Court, minutes of the Court, and docket entries. <em>Boteler vs. State, </em>8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">It was not only competent, and within the power of the Court, to direct that the docket entries should conform to the actual verities and truths of the case, but it was its duty to have done so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-9\">The case was still open and undetermined. And the right and duty of the Court to direct that a conformity between the entries on the docket and the papers in the case, should be made on the docket, can scarcely be questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-10\">The power of the Court to go beyond even docket entries, and correct misprisions even in original writs and papers, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>been well and repeatedly sustained. <em>Prather vs. Manro, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., 261; Byrne vs. McPherson, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>157; <em>Bank of U. S. vs. Lyles, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>331; <em>McCoy vs. Boyle, </em>10 <em>Md., </em>390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">After the Court had refused the evidence of the rvrits of summons as \u201cnot sufficient in themselves,\u201d and to allow the motion to amend the docket entries, the plaintiff then offered the writs and the docket entries together. But the Court rejected them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">The fifth replication alleged that the writs did issue; were returned by the sheriff, and that the cause was continued from term to term, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">The rejoinder says there was no <em>\u201csuch record </em>\u201d of the writs, returns and other proceedings, as is alleged in the replication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-8\">The second rejoinder denies that the <em>writs issued, &amp;c. </em>But it was in reference to the view of the case enforced upon the Circuit Court from the first rejoinder, that these evidences were rejected. There was \u201c no such record\u201d in the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-9\">Under the issues joined, (which were the only proper and true ones,) no technical record or roll was necessary to be shown. The production of the writs gratified \u201c all that the law required,\u201d on that part of the case. And if anything more, were required, the docket entries, showing the regular and uninterrupted continuances of the case, gratified the spirit arid very letter of the <em>replication.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-10\">And further, the docket entries, no more than the writs, were required to be <em>\u201cenrolled,\u201d </em>in order to constitute them part of the \u201crecord,\u201d in the sense in which that term is understood and applied in Maryland.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-11\"><em>D. Weisel </em>and <em>George Schley, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-12\">The several rulings of the Circuit Court were correct, and should be affirmed, because the recoi\u2019d does not disclose such continuance of the original suit as the law, applicable in such cases, requires, to avoid the plea of the Statute of Limitations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Code of Pub.

It was contended by the counsel for the appellees, that the first summons issued in the cause, differed from all those subsequently issued in this, that, whereas the first did not state the cause of action sued on, all the others did; and that it did not therefore appear upon their face that they had all been issued in the same cause. It was also urged, that as the first summons issued under the Act of 1856, ch. 112, and the first section of the first Article of the Code, provided that all suits and actions, pending at the time of its adoption, should be proceeded with to final determination, and judgment entered therein, as if the Code had not been adopted, the summonses subsequently issued would also have conformed to the requirements of the Act of 1856, if they had been intended to be renewals of the first summons; but as they were in conformity with the provisions of the Code, they could not be considered renewals in the original cause. We do not concur in these views. The parties, plaintiff and defendants, arc the same in all the summonses, and those, issued subsequently to the first, differed from it only in stating the cause of action and the amount claimed, so as to conform to the requirements of the 84th section of the 75th Article of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">The 1st section of the 1st Article of the Code was intended to prevent suits and prosecutions, pending at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of the adoption of the Code, from abating or being put an end to by its adoption. The mere change in the form of process, so as to. make it conform to the requirements of the Code, would not have the effect either of putting an end to the suit, which had been instituted prior to the adoption of the Code, or of making it a new and different action. \"We think that it became necessary, after the adoption of the Code, that all renewals of process in cases then pending should conform to its requirements, and that a change in the form of the process in accordance therewith, furnishes no ground for the objection to its admissibility in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">But it was also contended that the renewals of the writs of summons could only be proved by the <em>record </em>of the case, and that the renewals did not constitute such record. It is perfectly clear that all the proceedings in a cause, including the summons, returns, pleadings and all other proceedings, constitute the <em>record, </em>and are admissible to prove what has been done during the progress of the cause. <em>Boteler &amp; Belt vs. The State, use of Chew, </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>381; <em>Phila., Wilm. and Balto. R. R. Co. vs. Howard, </em>13 <em>Howard\u2019s Reps., </em>331. The issue to be tried was whether there was or not such a record as was alleged in the pleading; and all the proceedings which had been had in the cause up to that time, were admissible in evidence upon it, and if it appeared from an inspection of them by the Court that the first summons had been issued on the third day of December, 1859, and had been returned by the sheriff to the succeeding term, and that regular renewals had taken place to each succeeding term thereafter, then the issue must have been found for the plaintiff. <em>Hazlehurst vs. Morris, </em>28 <em>Md., </em>75. The counsel for the appellees seem to have supposed that a <em>record </em>is nothing more nor less than a copy of the proceedings in a cause, certified under the hand of the clerk and the seal of the Court. But we have shown that all the proceedings in a cause constitute the record, and are admissible upon the plea of <em>nul tiel record. </em>A <em>transcript </em>of the record only becomes necessary when it is to be used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>another Court than that in which the suit has been brought, and because the Court in which the proceedings have taken place will not part with the custody of its papers, and that the other Court may bo certified of the verity of the proceedings. But a transcript is never necessary in the Court in whieh the suit is brought, but the original papers are used as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The plaintiff below also made a motion to amend the docket entries in the case, so as to make them conform to its real facts and proceedings, coupled with an offer of them as evidence when so amended. This was refused by the Coxxrt below, and its refusal forms tlie ground of the second exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">It was contended by the counsel for the appellees that, after the expiration of a term, the docket entries could not be altered or amended. To this proposition we cannot give our assent. Luring the progress of a cause, a Court has control of its proceedings therein, and not only has the right, but it is its duty, to have the entries of the proceedings correctly made. The clerk is but the hand of the Court in making the entries, and where mistakes or omissions occur it is its duty to correct and amend them, so as to mako them show what has actually been done in the canse. The 16th section of the 18th Article of the Code does not apply to any case which has not terminated by \u201ctrial, judgment, decree, agreement, <em>non </em>pros, or abatement,\u201d and, therefore, the proceedings in the ease before us were not required to be entered by the clerk in a bound book, as it had not then terminated. Some of the docket entries set out in the record, arc, upon their face, defective, and others were alleged to be so, and it was clearly within the power and duty of the Court below, upon discovering such defects, by an examination of the docket entries themselves, as well as the papers and proceedings in the cause, to so amend them as to make them show what had actually been done during the progress of the cause. <em>Prather vs. Manro, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>261; <em>Byrne vs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>McPherson, Adm\u2019r of Brien, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>157. And it is the duty of the Court to correct clerical errors even in the original papers in a cause. <em>McCoy vs. Boyle, </em>10 <em>Md., </em>392. The docket entries should have been amended, upon the motion of the plaintiff below, and would then have been admissible upon the issue then before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">What we have already said upon the first and second exceptions applies with equal force to the third, which was taken to the ruling of the Court below, that the writs of summons and docket entries offered together, did not constitute a record of the case then before the Court. We have shown that the docket entries should have been amended, upon the motion of the plaintiff, and after such amendment it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to produce any other record than the proceedings and docket entries, for they constituted .the only record which could have been produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The plaintiff then offered as evidence to <em>the jury </em>the writs of summons and docket entries, and they were objected to and ruled out by the Court, and this ruling forms the ground of the fourth exception. The second rejoinder of the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s fifth replication was in substance a rejoinder of <em>nul tiel record, </em>and amounted, in fact, to the same thing as the first rejoinder, and therefore the proceedings and docket entries could be offered to the Court alone as the record of the cause, and were not admissible as evidence to the jury. There was therefore no error in the ruling of the Court below as contained in the fourth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">As no notice was taken in the rejoinder of the second, third and fourth replications, and as there was a difference ' of opinion between the counsel of the respective parties as to what course the counsel of the defendants below should have taken in regard to them, and as the cause will have to bo remanded for a new trial, we deem it necessary to say that a replication, which asserts what is denied in the plea, in the very language of the plea, is bad. The plaintiff could have either joined issue upon the defendants\u2019 pleas of limitation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>and upon those issues given in evidence the record of the proceedings in the cause to show that the suit had been instituted in time, or he might have replied to all the pleas of limitation, as he did in his fifth replication, that being a proper and formal replication, in such case, to these pleas.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b25-8\">(Decided 5th March, 1870.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The judgment of the Court below will be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\n<em>new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
