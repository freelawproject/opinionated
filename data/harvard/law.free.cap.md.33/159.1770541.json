The declaration stated that by an order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery county, in Equity, the injunction issued in a cause therein, wherein Samuel C. Yeirs, was complainant, and John T. Gray, defendant, had been dissolved, and that upon appeal taken by the said Samuel C. Yeirs, the judgment of said Circuit Court was affirmed with costs to the appellee, and <em>the cause remanded for further proceedings. </em>To this declaration, the defendants demurred generally. The Court ruled the demurrer good and judgment being against the plaintiff he appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">The cause was submitted to Bartol, C. J., Stewart, Brent, Mattlsby, Grason, Miller, Alvey and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-7\"><em>Samuel </em>Tyler, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-8\"><em>Thomas Anderson </em>and <em>William IT.

Such cannot be the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The appellant might have contented himself with the averment that the injunction had not been prosecuted with effect, which would have rendered necessary an affirmative plea on the part of the appellee. But ho undertook to show what had become of the equity case and how the injunction had been dissolved, and in doing this he disclosed a state of things, to wit, the pendency of the case, which if true, also indicated that there had not been such a breach of the bond as entitled the plaintiff to sue at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We think therefore the Court was right in sustaining the demurrer, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
