Hoffman of said city would put in a like amount; that a partnership could be formed be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tween the complainant, the said Samuel and the said Hoffman, \u2019and the said business be thus largely increased; that said proposal was acceded to and an agreement of partnership accordingly entered into. That after the business had been carried on under said agreement for about twenty months, a serious disagreement arose between the partners as to the proper construction of the agreement of co-partnership, that litigation resulted, and finally by agreement a dissolution of the co-partnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-4\">The bill further showed that by the terms of the agreement of dissolution, the said Samuel Stonebraker and H. K. Hoffman became entitled, among other things, to certain wi\u2019appers and labels of the assets of the said firm of Stonebraker, Hoffman <em>&amp; </em>Company, which they were entitled to use only <em>\u201c </em>for re-wrapping medicines coming back in bad order,\u201d and that the said Samuel Stonebraker and H. K. Hoffman bound themselves \u201c not to manufacture or imitate Stonebraker\u2019s medicines or preparations, or sell any medicines under their names or titles respectively, except stock on hand or in the hands of agents; \u201d and also bound themselves <em>\u201c </em>not to take any interest in or have any interest in the manufacture of said medicines or preparations, or be in any way interested in the manufacture of them, or in the sale of any medicines under their names or titles or in imitation of them.\u201d The bill then charged, that at the time of the said dissolution there were on hand, large quantities of the said wrappers and labels, and that the said Samuel Stonebraker and H. K. Hoffman sold or pretended to sell and dispose of the stock on hand, including said wrappers, etc., to Vm, P. Clotworthy and Leonard Passano, with the full knowledge that said Clotworthy and Passano would, and with the fraudulent design and intention that they should, use the said wrappers, &amp;c., for purposes for which, by force of said agreement, the said Stonebraker and Hoffman were not permitted to use them, to wit, upon articles to be manufactured by Clotworthy and Passano in imitation of the preparations of the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ant; that the said Clotworthy and Passano and the firm of Clotworthy &amp; Company, consisting of said William P. and Charles A. Clotworthy, had since said sale, with the full knowledge, approbation, participation and encouragement of the said Stonebraker and Hoffman, manufactured large quantities of articles in imitation of and counterfeiting some of the preparations of the complainant, and used upon the same the said wrappers and labels, and had offered the said imitations for sale as and for the genuine preparations of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">The bill further charged that the said Clotworthy and Passano, not content with imitating the complainant\u2019s preparations for the purpose of exhausting the wrappers aforesaid, had fraudulently confederated with Abraham S. Stonebraker, a brother of the complainant, to manufacture and sell upon an immense scale imitations and counterfeits of the complainant\u2019s medicines and preparations; that in pursuance of said fraud the said Clotworthy &amp; Company and Passano, had manufactured immense quantities of said imitations, and had had printed and placed upon said imitations and counterfeits the said labels or trade-marks of the complainant, or counterfeits thereof, so slightly and eolorably varied from those of the complainant as to give evidence of the most deliberate design to defraud the complainant, and to impose upon and deceive the trade and consumers, by inducing them to purchase the said imitations as and for the genuine preparations of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">The bill further charged, that the said W. P. Clotworthy and Passano had employed the complainant\u2019s brother in the business for no other reason than that his name was \u201cStonebraker,\u201d and because they believed that by employing a person of the same name as that of the complainant they could with impunity consummate their intended frauds against the complainant and the public; that the said Samuel Stonebraker and H. K. Hoffman had knowingly and wilfully aided and abefted the said Clotworthy &amp; Company and A. S. Stonebraker in all the frauds charged; and that having reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>believe the same, the complainant charged and averred that the said Samuel Stonebraker and H. K. Hoffman were secretly interested with the said Clotworthy &amp; Company in the manufacture and sale of the said imitations, and the use of the said counterfeits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">The bill prayed that the defendants and each of them might be restrained by injunction from counterfeiting or imitating the trade-marks or labels used by the complainant in and about the sale of \u201cStonebraker\u2019s\u201d medicines and preparations, and from using or issuing any such counterfeited or imitated trade-marks or labels, and from selling or delivering any medicines or preparations whatever with the labels or trade-marks of the complainant in any wise imitated or counterfeited thereupon; and further that W. P. Clotworthy, Charles A. Clotworthy, Leonard Passano and Abraham S.\u00ab Stonebraker, might discover what quantity of medicines or other preparations had been manufactured and sold by them or either of them, with labels or wrappers containing the name of \u201c Stonebraker,\u201d in conjunction with the descriptive name of each of said medicine or preparation, and the prices obtained therefor. The injunction was issued as prayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">The answer of Abraham S. Stonebraker denied that the complainant was the original maker of the preparations mentioned in the bill, and claimed that he (A. S. Stonebraker) was the original compounder of <em>the </em>same, and <em>that the </em>labels and directions for the said medicines and preparations were written by him and given to the complainant, as then used by him, with only slight verbal alterations from the original form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">The answer of <em>W. </em>P. and Charles A. Clotworthy, trading as Clotworthy &amp; Co., admitted that they had made an agreement with W. P. Clotworthy, Leonard Passano and A. S. Stonebraker, for the manufacture and sale of certain medicines and preparations, known and sold as \u201cDr. Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations;\u201d which they averred the said parties had the lawful right to make; they denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>all unlawful interference with the rights of the complainant, and all improper use of the labels of the late firm of Stonebraker, Hoffman &amp; Co.; for the rest they adopted the answers of their co-defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">The answer of Samuel Stonebraker and PI. K. Hoffman, admitted the sale to William P. Clotworthy and Leonard Passano, but denied that they had any interest in the remains of stock or in the business of the late firm of Stonebraker, Hoffman &amp; Co., and denied that they had connived at any fraudulent or improper use of any part of the said remains of stock, or in any imitation or counterfeiting by any person whomsoever of any preparations or medicines, which the said persons had not the right to make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">The answer of Wm. P. Clotworthy and Passano, admitted the agreement with A. S. Stonebraker, to manufacture and sell for their joint account and profit, the medicines and preparations known as \u201cDr. Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations,\u201d and the purchase of the remaining stock in trade of the late firm of Stonebraker, Hoffman <em>&amp; </em>Co.; they adopted the answer of Dr. A. S. Stonebraker, as part of their own. They denied all improper use of the labels of Stonebraker, Hoffman &amp; Co., or that they had imitated or counterfeited (or intended to do so) the preparations of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">A vast amount of testimony was taken, and after hearing, the following opinion was delivered by Judge Pint\u00f3te Y:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-8\">The bill in this case is for an injunction and for an account, &amp;c. A preliminary injunction was granted. And the case now comes before the Court for final hearing upon bill, answers and testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-9\">The facts of the ease are these: The complainant in the year 1856, was keeping store at Funkstown, in Washington county, in this State, Avith one J. Calvin Hoffman. In 1857, Iloffman sold out his interest in the store to the complainant, Avho about that time commenced the manufacture of patent medicines. The evidence shows that he then made and sold a medicine called \u201c Sloan\u2019s Liniment.\u201d The year following, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>(1858,) it seems he failed in keeping store and began to manufacture \u201c Patent \u201d medicines and other preparations, as his sole business; he peddled them through the neighboring country, and from time to time added <em>new </em>medicines and preparations. It appears from the evidence that in the year 1860, he was compounding and selling three or four different sorts, viz: \u201cStonebraker\u2019s Pain Killer,\u201d \u201cStonebraker\u2019s Nerve and Bone Liniment,\u201d \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Hair Restorative,\u201d and perhaps \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Horse and Cattle Powders,\u201d which preparations at that time he also consigned to agents in different parts of the neighboring country, as well in Virginia as in Maryland, and they became known to the trade and the public as \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines.\u201d It also appears by the evidence that he made great exertions to extend the reputation and sale of his medicines and other preparations, and was very successful in those respects, but in his money matters he does not seem to have got ahead. In 1864, he was obliged to seek assistance from his uncle, the defendant, Sami. Stonebraker, who appears to be a man of some means, he put $10,000 into the business, and the complainant carried it on for several years as his agent. The business became profitable, and the complainant extricated himself from his pecuniary embarrassments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">In the spring of the year 1866, he removed to Baltimore and formed a partnership with his uncle, Samuel, and the defendant, Henry K. Hoffman, under the firm name of <em>Stonebraker, Hoffman &amp; Co.; </em>they entered extensively into the manufacture and sale of \u201cPatent\u201d medicines and other preparations, which were compounded by the complainant and sold as before, under the name of \u201cStonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations.\u201d Towards the close of the year a misunderstanding arose between the complainant and his co-partners. They claiming a right to the recipes which were used in compounding the medicines and preparations, and he insisting that they were his secrets which he was not bound to communicate to his eo-partners. Legal proceedings were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>instituted, but the difficulty was amicably arranged and the partnership dissolved by agreement under seal. By the terms of this agreement, his co-partners, Messrs. Hoffman and Sami. Stonebraker, released him from all claims for copies of recipes for the manufacture of \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations,\u201d agreed to take all manufactured medicines, &amp;c., wrappers, &amp;e., for wrapping medicines, &amp;c., &amp;c., bound themselves \u201cnot to manufacture or imitate \u2018Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines or Preparations,\u2019 or sell any medicines under their names or titles respectively, except such stock on hand or in the hands of agents,\u201d and also bound themselves \u201c not to take any interest or have any interest in the manufacture of them or in the sale of any medicines under their names or titles, or in imitation of them.\u201d The complainant on his part, bound himself and his sons not to manufacture said medicines or to suffer his recipes to be used for the manufacture of said medicines within three months from the date of the agreement, and also bound himself and his sons not to sell said medicines Avithin six months, except by or Avith the written consent of his late partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">Several months after entering into the agreement, Messrs. Hoffman and S. Stonebraker, sold out all their interest under the same to their co-defendants, Messrs. L. Passano and \u00a5m. P. ClotAvorthy, Avho it appears from the evidence soon after entered into an arrangement Avith the defendant, Dr. Abraham S. Stonebraker, (a brother of the complainant, and just previously a resident of the State of Illinois, Avhere he had been a practising physician since the war,) to manufacture \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations,\u201d for the sale of Avhich compounds they appointed the firm of ClotAvorthy &amp; Co., who are also defendants in this Court, their general agents; Messrs. ClotAvorthy <em>&amp; </em>Co., so appointed agents of Messrs. Passano and W. P. ClotAvorthy, addressed a circular notice to the local agents of \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations,\u201d thereby informing them that H. Stonebraker had no longer any interest whatever in those medicines and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>parations, that the old agents would be supplied by wagon as heretofore, that applications for agencies would receive prompt attention and medicines be forwarded free of expense. \u2022This circular was signed Clotworthy <em>&amp; </em>Co., agents for proprietor. By another notice they informed dealers that it was their intention as agents of the proprietors, Messrs. Passauo and <em>W. </em>P. Clotworthy, to advertise the articles (Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations) extensively, and to make them standard and reliable preparations. In accordance with which notice they proceeded to enter extensively into the manufacture and sale of medicines and preparations under the name of \u201cDr. Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations,\u201d using upon the wrappers of certain of their \u201cMedicines and Preparations,\u201d certificates given to complainant in recommendation of <em>his </em>medicines and preparations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">Here let us pause. Can there be the slightest doubt, that had the defendants, Hoffman and Samuel Stonebraker, after their agreement with the complainant, by which they released him from all claim to the recipes for the manufacture of \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations,\u201d and bound themselves not to manufacture or imitate them, or sell medicines under their names respectively, except stock on hand, &amp;c., begun to manufacture and sell medicines and other preparations, under the name of' \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and \u25a0Preparations,\u201d using the proper appellation of the several medicines and preparations by which they were known; I say, can any one doubt that it would be a fraud upon the complainant, and a grave violation of their agreement, and that upon the application of the complainant, the Court would restrain .them by injunction ? Is it less a fraud on the part of their assignees and their agents ? And is the hand of the Court to be stayed, because of their association with the complainant\u2019s brother, Dr. Stonebraker ? It is said so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">Upon what, then, does this pretension rest? There is evidence to show that Dr. Stonebraker, previous to the late civil war, while living at Shepherdstown, (to which place he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>removed from Funkstown in the fall of 1858,) and keeping a drug store, manufactured patent medicines and sold them in the neighborhood. In 1860, he was manufacturing and selling under the name of \u201cDr. Stonebraker\u2019s Celebrated Compounds,\u201d \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Ilair Restorative,\u201d \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Healing Balsam,\u201d \u201cStonebraker\u2019s Anodyne Astringent,\u201d \u201cMagic Verve and Bone Liniment,\u201d and \u201cStonebraker\u2019s Anti-Bilious Pills.\u201d He advertised his medicines in some of the county newspapers in his neighborhood, and also in the \u201c Vew Star,\u201d a paper printed at Christiansburg, in south-western Virginia, where he had an agent, and he also sent some of his medicines to Illinois. In the winter of that year, (I860,) however, he failed in the drug business, and, according to his own testimony, was about commencing the manufacture and sale of his patent medicines, but the war broke out and blasted all his hopes, as it did those of many others. During the unhappy period of the war, he was in the Confederate army; after the war, he went to Illinois, where he practised medicine until the spring of 1867, when he came to Baltimore, and entered into his engagement with Messrs. Passano and Clotworthy for the manufacture of \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations.\u201d He now claims to have been the original compounder of the medicines which his brother Henry made and sold under the name of \u201cStonebraker\u2019s Medicines and Preparations,\u201d or most of them, and that he communicated the recipes to the complainant, but the evidence does not sustain this pretension. And his conduct, (as appears by the proof)) previous to his connection -with Messrs. Passano and Clotworthy, is inconsistent with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">While living in Illinois, he wrote to his brother, the complainant, congratulating him on his success in business, his removal to Baltimore, and his new partnership; and concludes his letter by saying: \u201c If, at any time, you should want a pharmaceutical or financial clerk, with big pay and little to do, why I am open.\u201d He was a witness in the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>between the complainant and his co-partners, where the controversy was in regard to the right to the recipes, which he now says he gave to his brother, but he then was perfectly silent in regard to his own claim to them. Mr. Hoffman, (the complainant\u2019s former partner,) he says, (in his testimony,) introduced him to Mr. <em>W. </em>P. Clotworthy, and he proposed to Mr. C. to enter into an arrangement for the sale of his medicines and preparations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">So it was from him, it seems, that Messrs. Passano and Clotworthy got the brilliant, but by no means original idea, as the.cases of <em>Croft vs. Day, </em>7 <em>Beav., </em>84, and <em>Rodgers vs. Nowill, </em>5 <em>Man. Gr. &amp; Sct., </em>109, show, of using his name for the purpose of palming upon the public their medicines as those of the complainant. No doubt Dr. Stonebraker had a right to enter into an agreement with Messrs. Passano and Clotworthy, or any body else, to manufacture and sell his own medicines, b'ut he had no right to <em>lend </em>or <em>sell </em>his name to perpetrate an injury upon his brother and a fraud upon the public. The evidence shows, beyond the shadow of doubt, that the whole agreement between all the parties was but a combination to deceive the public, and to enable the parties to it to obtain for their medicines the benefit of the celebrity which the complainant\u2019s medicines and preparations had in the market, at the expense of the complainant, and in fraud of bis rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The principle upon which relief is given is, that one man cannot offer his goods for sale, representing them to be the manufacture of another <em>man; </em>and in this case I do not think it necessary to go into a particular and comparative examination of the different wrappers and labels made use of by the parties, for the different sorts of medicines and preparations made and sold by them respectively. I recognize the principle stated and applied in the late English case of <em>Seixo vs. Provezende, </em>1 <em>Chan. Appeals L. R., </em>192, by Lord Cranworti-i, to be correct and applicable to the present case. His Lordship said: \u201cI do not consider the actual physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>resemblance, of the two marks to be the question for consideration. If the goods of a manufacturer have, from the mark or device ho has used, become known in the market by a particular name, I think that the adoption by a rival trader of any mark which will cause his goods to bear the same name in the market, may be as much a violation of the rights of that rival as the actual copy of his device.\u201d And in the. case of <em>Coffeen vs. Brunton, </em>4 <em>McLean, 516, </em>Judge McLean said: \u201cIn the case under consideration, in his label, the complainant calls his medicine the \u201cChinese Liniment;\u201d the defendant calls his the \u201cOhio Liniment,\u201d but from the body of the labels, and of the directions for the use of the medicines, it is clear that the language of the defendant is so assimilated to that of the complainant as to appear to be the same medicine, the alteration being only colorable. There would seem to be no doubt that the intention of Loree, who prepared the liniment sold by the defendant as his agent, was to avail himself of the favorable reputation acquired by the \u201c Chinese Liniment\u201d in the sale of his, and by most persons it would be received as the same medicine.\u201d And, therefore, an injunction was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">In this case the defendants have used the <em>name of the complainant, </em>which he used to designate the medicines and preparations as <em>his, </em>with the addition of <em>doctor; </em>that is, Dr. Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines,\u201d &amp;c.; they have used the names used by him to designate the specific articles; they have used on their wrappers and labels the language of the complainant on <em>his </em>wrappers and labels; and they have gone further, as if to leave no doubt of their fraudulent intent, and have printed on the wrappers of some of <em>their </em>medicines and preparations the certificates given to the complainant in recommendation of his medicines and preparations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">Finally, the evidence shows, that the design of the defendants to impose their medicines and preparations upon the market, as those of the complainant, was a <em>perfect success. </em>They were even able to mislead and deceive such experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>druggists as Mr. Gosmon, Mr. Erickson and Mr. Francis Yolk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">In accordance with the foregoing opinion the Circuit Court, on the 11th of March, 1869, passed a decree perpetually enjoining and restraining Samuel Stonebraker and Henry K. Hoffman, their agents, and all persons claiming under them, from manufacturing or imitating any of the medicines or preparations, which prior to the 10th of December, 1866, had been known as \u201c Stonebraker\u2019s Medicines or Preparations,\u201d and from selling any medicines whatsoever under the names or titles of said medicines or preparations, respectively, except stock in the hands of Stonebraker, Hoffman <em>&amp; </em>Co. on the said 10th of December, 1866; and likewise perpetually restraining, and enjoining all of the defendants, their agents, &amp;c., from counterfeiting or imitating the trade-marks, labels, &amp;c., used and employed by the complainant upon his medicines and preparations; and further directing that the defendants should account with the complainant for any and all medicines and preparations, manufactured or sold, or in anywise disposed of by them, since the 10th of December, 1866, with the labels, trade-marks, <em>&amp;c., </em>of the complainant, affixed thereto.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b278-6\">From this decree the present appeals were taken.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b278-7\">The cause was argued before Stewart, Brent, Maulsby, Miller and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-8\"><em>Charles Marshall, I. Nevett Steele </em>and <em>William Schley, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-9\">The appellee is not entitled to the aid of a Court of Equity. In the outset of his career as a compounder of nostrums, he improperly assumed the title of Doctor of Medicine, and at a later period he satisfied himself with publishing, without correction, testimonials in which he was addressed as Dr. Stonebraker. He was fully aware of the advantage of the title of Doctor, in recommending his medicines to the public, and availed himself of it, thereby practising an imposition. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>rule of law is clear. No matter what may have been the conduct of the defendants, a Court of Equity will not lend its aid to protect rights acquired by fraud and misrepresentation. It is enough if the misrepresentation was calculated to deceive. It is not pretended that the appellee had any right to advertise his compounds as the preparations of a Doctor of Medicine. Nor is it denied that if any person bought his preparations under the belief that he was a Doctor, that person has been deceived. The injunction of the Circuit Court, in terms, secures to the appellee the right to continue to impose on the public. The appellee is not entitled to relief. <em>Fetridge vs. Wells, </em>13 <em>Howard Prac.

Originality in the manufacture of the compounds themselves is not enough. Any one may manufacture these medicines-who may possess the recipe. But if the appellee has shown that he <em>first </em>used the names by which the compounds are known, and that ,he used those names in writing or printing, so as to be visible, and that he used them in connection with the articles themselves, he has acquired a property in the names, otherwise he has not; and, to get an <em>injunction, </em>he must establish these facts clearly. <em>Rodgers vs. Nowill, </em>6 <em>Hare, </em>325; <em>Motley vs. Downman, </em>3 <em>My. &amp; Cr., </em>17; <em>Bacon vs. Jones, </em>4 <em>My. &amp; Cr., </em>433; <em>Coffeen vs. Brunton, </em>5 <em>McLean, </em>256; <em>Morrison vs. Moat, </em>9 <em>Hare, </em>255; <em>Wyeth vs. Stone, 1 Story\u2019s Rep., </em>282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">Dr. A.

The above part of the decree would also require William and Charles Clot-worthy and Passano to account for sales of the part of said stock, bought by them from Samuel Stonebraker and H. K. Hoifman.

The proof upon both sides has been very elaborate, and the case rests almost entirely upon questions of fact. As was said by Lord Las\u00edgdale, in the case of <em>Croft vs. Day, </em>\u201cwhat is proper to be done in cases of this kind must more or loss depend upon the circumstances which attend them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The bill asks for an injunction to prohibit the appellants from using the trade-marks of the appellee, and for an account. The law of trade-marks, as applicable to this case, may be very briefly stated; While a party has the right to manufacture and sell any article he may please, not protected by letters patent granted to another, he has no right to use the trade-marks or names previously adopted and used by another trader, and induce thereby the public to believe the articles sold are another\u2019s manufacture. Trade-marks are property, and as such the title to them will receive the protection of the Courts. If used by another, rvithout the authority or sanction of the owner, he will be restrained by injunction, and that even where it does not appear there was any fraudulent intent in their use. He will also be held to account for the profits derived from the unauthorized use of such trade-marks. <em>Croft vs. Day, </em>7 <em>Beav., 89; Farina vs. Silverlock, </em>39 <em>Eng.

They are so well considered and stated in the opinion of the Judge below, that we cannot better express our own views than by adopting, as we do, what he has said in reference to them. We are fully satisfied, from all the proof, that the trade-marks and certificates in question belong to Henry Stonebraker, and that they have been improperly, and without authority or excuse, appropriated and used by the appellants, either by themselves or through their contrivance. That there is some difference in those used by the appellants, there is no doubt. But the change is of such a character as to indicate an evident purpose to deceive. Nobody can look at the two \u2014 the genuine and the imitation\u2014 without being satisfied that the genuine have been so altered, and so craftily used and employed, as to be well calculated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>produce, upon the public mind, the impression that the medicines and preparations sold by the appellants are the medicines and preparations of the appellee, Henry Stonebraker. That Samuel Stonebraker and Henry K. Hoffman were both connected with and actively advanced the arrangement effected with Dr. Abraham S. Stonebraker, by which medicines and preparations have been manufactured and sold under the prohibited trade-marks, the weight of evidence abundantly establishes. The other appellants -were, beyond doubt, connected with the sales, and as we have determined that the trade-marks and testimonials in question are those of the appellee, their liability is clear. We need only add, that we fully concur in the conclusions of the Court below, and are of opinion that the appellee, Henry Stonebraker, is entitled to be protected by injunction, and to be compensated by having an account taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The decree of the Court below is correct in so far as it proceeds to restrain and enjoin the appellants. But that part of it which directs an account, is in some respects erroneous. Samuel Stonebraker and Henry K. Hoffman, by the terms of dissolution of the partnership between themselves and Henry Stonebraker, dated the 10th of December, 1866, reserved the right to sell under these trade-marks the stock on hand or in the hands of agents at the time of dissolution, and for the sales of such stock, no matter by whom made, whether by themselves or their vendees, no account can bo demanded. The other parties, Passano, Abraham S. Stonebraker and the Clotworthys, not being bound by any contract to the contrary, had the right, under the law as we have stated it, to manufacture the medicines or preparations to whatever extent they chose, and no accounting for such, as they manufactured simply, can be required of them. Their liability to account is limited to <em>sales, </em>under the prohibited use of the protected trade-marks, of such articles as were not part of the stock referred to. The decree is undoubtedly erroneous in requiring an account, as by its terms it clearly does, from these par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ties, of articles which they have manufactured and not sold, and should more clearly except from all accounting, by any of the parties, for sales of such articles as constituted part of the stock on hand and held by the Stonebrakers and Hoffman at \u25a0the time of the dissolution of that firm. In all other respects the decree is correct; but, for these errors, it must be reversed and the cause remanded, in order that a new decree may be passed by the Circuit Court in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion. As the decree is in the main correct, but for the reasons stated must be reversed, the costs in this Court will be equally divided, one-half to be paid by the appellee, and the other half by the appellants.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b284-6\">(Decided 7th July, 1870.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Decree reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
