C. L. R., </em>2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The second prayer of the plaintiff ignores the principle, that a want of ordinary care on the part of the deceased by which the accident was caused, would prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. If it was a want of ordinary care and prudence on the part of Trainor, to walk upon the track under the circumstances, there being no actual necessity for his so doing, and if the accident would not have happened had it not been for such a want of cai*e, then the walking on the track was the direct, or proximate, or immediate cause of the accident, and was such a contribution to 1ns own injury as will prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovering. The right to recover is dependent upon the deceased having made use of ordinary care to avoid the accident, and if he was a contributor to his own misfortune by his own negligence, no recovery can be had although the defendant by the use of greater diligence might have prevented the accident. <em>Baltimore and Ohio R. R. Company vs. State, use of Miller, </em>29 <em>Md., 262; Baltimore and Ohio R. R. Company vs. State, use of Freyer, </em>30 <em>Md., </em>52; <em>Northern Central R. R. Company vs. State, use of Geis, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>358.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s third prayer was objectionable because it instructed the jury to consider only the probability of life of the widow of Trainor, without taking into consideration a possible termination of widowhood by another marriage, when she -would be relieved from loss through the death of Trainor. The statute limiting the damages to the actual loss, this possibility should have been estimated by the jury in awarding damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-6\">The first prayer of the defendant as offered should not have been rejected; its language requiring the defendant to use reasonable care in procuring, \u201cSound machinery upon the train causing the accident,\u201d fully complies with the law. The addition made by the Court was unnecessary, and although not very material, was yet calculated to mislead the jury, by leading them to suppose that some particular kind of machinery was required specially for operating the train causing the accident. <em>Shauck vs. The Northern Central R. R. Company, </em>25 <em>Md., </em>462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The second prayer of the defendant requested the Court to instruct the jury as to what constituted the relations of employer and employ\u00e9, and the proposition stated in the prayer was so plain that the Court should have, stated it as law to the jury. The fact that Trainor had completed his day\u2019s work, did not, in the absence of a discharge, release him from the relation of employ\u00e9. <em>Tunny vs. Midland Railway Co., </em>12 <em>Jurist, N. S., </em>691; 1 <em>Redfield on Railways, </em>527 <em>and note on page </em>534; <em>Wonder vs. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>32 <em>Md., </em>411.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-5\">The rejection of the third prayer of the defendant as offered, and granting it with an amendment was erroneous. The third prayer of the defendant as offered was in compliance with the law: The evidence shows that the intention of the deceased was to cross the viaduct. By so doing he Avas clearly violating a reasonable regulation of the defendant brought to his attention by the notice placed there in a conspicuous position forbidding persons from crossing and warning them of the danger of so doing. It <em>was, </em>therefore, conclusive evidence of negligence on his part if he rvas injured while intent upon violating this regulation, and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. <em>Baltimore City Passenger Railway vs. Wilkinson, </em>30 <em>Md., </em>225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-6\">The amendment made by the Court to this prayer, renders vague and uncertain what instruction the Court really intended giving to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-7\">The rejection of the fourth prayer of the defendant as offered, and granting it with an amendment, rvas erroneous. As offered it complied with the law, and is in fact the very language of the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Bannon vs. The Baltimore and Ohio R. R. Co., </em>24 <em>Md., </em>126. It is also in compliance with the law in the case of <em>The Northern Central R. R. Co. vs. The State, use of Geis, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>357.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-8\">The prayer as amended by the Court wuis vague and uncertain in meaning, and was certainly calculated to mislead the' jury on account of the difficulty in properly construing its meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The fifth prayer of the defendant instructed the jury that their verdict must be for the defendant if the decedent couid have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable caution and care. The amendment made by the Court was not required by the law of Maryland. <em>Northern Central R. R. Co. vs. State, use of Geis, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>357; <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. vs. State, use of Miller, </em>29 <em>Md., 262.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-5\">The rejection of the defendant\u2019s sixth prayer was erroneous. The defendant was certainly entitled to the judgment of the jury upon the question, whether or not the man Trainor was an employ\u00f3, in 1\u2019act by the rejection of the defendant\u2019s second prayer, the Court submitted that question to the jury. And if the jury should find that he was an employ\u00e9, then the law asked for by the prayer was in accordance with the ruling of the Court of Appeals in the ease of <em>Wonder vs. The Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company, </em>32 <em>Md., </em>411.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-6\">There was no evidence in this case from which the jury might find that the defendant had not used reasonable care in procuring for its operations sound machinery and faithful and competent employ\u00e9s.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-7\">The Court should have instructed the jury that the facts stated hypothetically in the seventh prayer if found by the jury constituted in law such negligence on the part of the decedent as would bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-8\"><em>Michael A. Mullin </em>and <em>Robert J. Brent, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-9\">To determine whether at the time of the accident Trainor was in the employment of the defendant, the contract between them must be considered. Trainor was hired at a stipulated price per day, payable at the end of the month, and liable to bo discharged at any time. At the time of the accident he was not in the service of the company, he had concluded his day\u2019s work and was going in the direction of his homo. <em>Rex vs. Pucklechurch, </em>5 <em>East, </em>384; <em>Rex vs. Mitcham, </em>12 <em>East, </em>352; <em>Robertson vs. Jenner, et al., </em>15 <em>Law Times Reports, N. S., </em>514; <em>Schouler\u2019s Dom.

The general rule is that when injury is inflicted on one servant by the negligent act of his fellow-servant, the common master is not responsible, provided the master exercise all reasonable care in procuring for his operations sound machinery and capable and competent employ\u00e9s. <em>Priestly vs. Fowler, </em>3 <em>Mees. &amp; Wels., </em>1; O\u2019<em>Connell vs. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>20 <em>Md., </em>222; <em>Cumberland Coal and Iron Co. vs. Scally, </em>27 <em>Md., </em>603.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-6\">In this cause there was evidence that the conductor of the train was regularly employed on the main stem; he himself states he did not recollect how long before he had acted as conductor on the Washington Branch, except that he had run down several times during Mr. Lincoln\u2019s administration; a man who, from his testimony, knew nothing, and from his opportunities could not be expected to know anything of the service on which he was sent. What is said of the conductor can be doubly said of the engineei\u2019, who, according to his own statement, was not employed on the road at all; was merely employed in making up trains in the depot yard, and had not been on the Washington Branch for four years before. The brakemen were also unaccustomed to the Washington Branch.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-7\">There was also evidence of defective machinery used. The engine sent out by the company was a freight engine, used for regulating around the depot yard, consequently had no pilot or cowcatcher, as is usual with engines used on the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-8\">Assuming that Trainor, at the time of the injury, was not a servant of the company, there was evidence of such negligence on the part of the defendant, and absence of negligence on the part of the deceased to support the action, and the instruction given by the Court was correct. <em>Northern Central Railway Co. vs. State, use of Price, </em>29 <em>Md., </em>435, 436, 437, and the cases there cited with approbation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Maulsby, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Mitch of the law applicable to this case is well settled, and is stated with clearness and precision in <em>Northern Central Railway Co. vs. State, use of Price, </em>29 <em>Md., </em>421, thus, \u201cif the negligence of the defendant was the proximate, and that of the deceased the remote, cause of the injury, the action is maintainable, notwithstanding the deceased may not have been entirely without fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Tested by this rule we can perceive no error in the plaintiffs\u2019 first and second prayers which were granted by the Court below. It is objected by the appellant to the first prayer, that it admits that there may have been mutual or concurrent negligence, and that it leaves to the jury to exactly ascertain how much each party contributed, by his negligence, to the production of the injury, in which case it would be impossible to apportion the damages, and that it is therefore obnoxious to the rule announced in <em>Northern Central Railway Co. vs. State, use of Geis, et al., </em>31 <em>Md., </em>357. In that case the rule invoked by the'appellant is stated to be that an action will not lie where the negligence imputable to both parties was concurrent, and co-operated to produce the injury complained of. There can be no difficulty in distinguishing between negligence of both parties immediately concurring to, and co-operating in, the production of the injury, and the proposition of the prayer that if the killing resulted from the want of ordinary care of the defendant, and not from tiro want of ordinary care of the deceased, directly contributing to the injury, the action lies. The second prayer contains, substantially, the same legal proposition with the first, and the appellant\u2019s objection is substantially the same. It is argued that if the deceased walked on the track, and his walking on the track was want of ordinary care, and the accident would not have happened if he had not walked on the track, then such walking was the proximate cause of the accident, and the plaintiff cannot recover. This argument does not justly apply the rule in 29 <em>Md., </em>421. By \u201cproxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>mate cause \u201d is intended an act which directly produced, or concurred directly in producing, the injury. By \u201cremote cause \u201d is intended that which may have happened, and yet no injury have occurred, notwithstanding that no injury could have occurred, if it had not happened. No man would ever have been killed on a railway, if he had never gone on or near the track. But if a man does, imprudently and incautiously, go on a rail road track, and is killed or injured by a train of cars, the company is responsible, unless it has used reasonable care and caution to avert it, provided the circumstances were not such when the party went on the track as to threaten direct injury, and provided that being on the track ho did nothing, positive or negative, to contribute to the immediate injury. Any attempt to make plainer the rule laid down in the case referred to, than it is made by the language of the Judge who delivered the opinion, is more likely to obscure than to illustrate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Nor can we appreciate the force of the appellant\u2019s objection to the plaintiff\u2019s third prayer. It is, that instead of allowing the jury, in estimating damages, to consider the probability of life of the widow of deceased, it ought to have limited them to a consideration of the probable continuation of her widowhood, and that they should have been required to measure the period when, in their opinion, she would marry again, \"and allow damages to that period only.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Such a contingency this Court cannot recognize as a fit element to enter into a verdict in such a case. We think that the prayers of the appellee were properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The first, second and sixth prayers of the appellant are based on the hypothesis that the deceased was an employee of the appellant at the time of the injury which resulted in his -death. The propositions contained in these prayers could arise only on the idea that he was in the course of discharging the duties of his employment when the injury occurred. The proof on both sides is that he was not, at the time of the injury, so occupied, but that his duties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>his employer having been discharged, he was on his way to his home. His employment was as a spiker, and his duty was to go over the track twice a day from the four mile house to the nine mile stone, to see that it was in order. At six o\u2019clock in the evening his duty ended, to be resumed the next morning, unless discharged in the meantime. When the injury occurred, he was not on the track between the four mile house and the nine mile stone, but had finished his day\u2019s work, laid aside his tools, and was proceeding along, or on the track of, the Washington Branch road, towards his home on the opposite side of the Pafapsco river. This being the undisputed evidence on this subject, it is unnecessary that we shall consider these prayers further than to say there is no proof to sustain them, and therefore they are abstractions in this case, and for this reason were properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The third and seventh prayers of appellant present substantially the same question, that if the deceased was at the entrance of the viaduct, in the language of the third, or at or near the viaduct with purpose to walk over the same, or was on the rail road track near said viaduct, and walking thereon, and not at a public crossing of the same, in the language of the seventh, when the injury occurred, and that the appellant had given public notice, set up at the viaduct, warning persons not to cross it, and that the injury was the result of accident, and not wanton, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. These prayers were rejected as offered, but granted with additions putting it to the jury to find that the defendant was using ordinary care, and that by the use of ordinary care it could not avoid the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">There are no circumstances under which the defendant could be relieved of the duty of using ordinary care. What constitutes ordinary care may vary with varying circumstances, but, as a general rule, it is for the jury to determine, and we discover nothing to relieve this case from the operation of the general rule. The proposition of the prayers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>as offered, is that the public notice or warning, set up at the viaduct, is a bar to recovery, and relieves the defendant from the use of ordinary care on and about the viaduct, and from liability for any injury that might occur, at .or on the viaduct, from the want of ordinary care on its part.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">That proposition is not sound. The notice or warning was proper to be considered in determining the question of care, but was not, in itself, a fact which dispensed with the necessity of using care. An illustration can be found in the fifth and eighteenth rules or regulations of the appellant for the conduct of its trains. The fifth rule requires the passenger engineman, on his approach to all bridges (amongst other things) to sound his whistle clearly and distinctly, and cause his fireman to ring the bell. There may be other purposes in this requirement, but manifestly one purpose is to give warning to persons who may, however improperly, be on a bridge. The eighteenth rule requires the enginemen, while running trains, to keep a sharp lookout for cattle and live stock on the way, and on observing any on or about the track, to reduce speed, and use <em>great care to avoid injuring them. </em>It would be great injustice to the appellant to construe its regulations as intending to evidence greater tenderness towards cattle and other live stock, than towards human life or limb. These rules manifest the sense of the appellant as to what constitutes proper care, and the standard, which it thus establishes for itself, is correct. If they could be construed as establishing a rale of care and caution, solely for the protection of its own property and interests, which however is forbidden by the language of the eighteenth rule, still others are entitled to the benefit of the same rule. That which constitutes ordinary care for its own interests, constitutes it as well for others. And as the setting up a notice or warning, according to the appellant\u2019s own estimate, is not sufficient care to relieve it from other acts of care, in addition, as sounding the \u201c whistle-clearly and distinctly,\u201d and causing the \u201cfireman to ring the bell\u201d on approaching a bridge, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>could be no propriety in relieving it from the duty of observing its own rule of care, which was the effect of the prayers. The third and seventh prayers were properly rejected, without the additions of the Court, and they, properly construed, and as now corrected by the agreement to amend, presented the law correctly. The appellant was not injured by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The fourth prayer was erroneous in that, it failed to require the supposed contribution by the deceased to bring the injury on himself, by his own negligence and want of proper care, to be found to be the proximate cause of the injury. If the hypothetical negligence of the deceased were the remote cause of the injury, and the negligence of the appellant the <em>proximate </em>cause, the former did not bar the right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The addition of the Court substantially met this proposition, but without the addition the prayer ought to have been rejected, and with the addition it could operate no injury to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The fifth prayer Avas based on the proposition that the only duty incumbent on the appellant, in the use of ordinary care, Avas to give the usual signal, that its train was bound upon the Washington branch of its road, by sounding the whistle before reaching the relay station. The proof of the appellant is that the cattle guard at the entrance on the viaduct, or bridge, at or near Avhich the injury occurred, is eighteen hundred and eighty-four feet distant from the SAvitches. That the Avhistle Avas sounded, according to one witness, (Burton,) about six hundred yards east of the switches, the injury having occurred in the opposite direction, and by the other (Palmer) about \u00edavo hundred yards. Both these witnesses, one of whom was the conductor, and the other Avas the engineman, prove that the whistle Avas not sounded, nor the bell rung on the approach of the train to the viaduct. The injury occurred at or within a few feet of the entrance on the viaduct. There was testimony that it Avas usual for all passenger trains to bloAV the whistle betAveen the switches and the viaduct. The fifth rule required not,only that to be done, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>but also the bell to be rung. The prayer asserted that a much less degree of care was sufficient. This statement of the proof sufficiently demonstrates the error of the prayer. Without regard to the addition made by the Court, it was properly rejected, but that stated the law as favorably to the appellant as it had a right to require.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b572-6\">(Decided 26th January, 1871.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
