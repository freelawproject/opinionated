The answer admitted that O\u2019Keill died possessed of certain personal estate, but denied that he was possessed of any real estate. It also admitted the granting of letters of administration to the respondent, and charged that the nuncupative will of James O\u2019fSTeill was properly admitted to probate, and that it was then too late to have the proceedings reopened, and the matter of the will of the deceased reexamined. On the 30th of April, 1869, the Court passed an order dismissing the petition.

After a well considered examination of the authorities, the Chancellor says:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u201c I feel myself warranted in concluding, that a nuncupative will is not good, unless it be made by a testator when he is <em>in extremis, </em>or overtaken by sudden and violent sickness, and has not time or opportunity to make a written will. * * The last sickness, in the purview of the statute, has been always understood to apply to the last extremity mentioned in the books, and it never was meant to uphold these wills, made when there was no immediate apprehension of death, and no inability to reduce the will to writing.\u201d These views are fully adopted in <em>Priscilla Yarnall\u2019s Will, </em>4 <em>Rawle, </em>46; <em>Haus vs. Palmer, </em>21 <em>Penn., </em>296, and in fact in almost every State wdiere the 19th section of 29 Charles II, has been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">From these authorities it is clear that the general rule requiring wills to be in writing, was intended to be as universal as was possible; and the exception thereto in favor of a <em>nuncupative </em>will was allowed only in cases of necessity, where the testator surprised by approaching death has not the time or opportunity to make a written will. Thus tested, how stands the will in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The alleged testator it seems was an Irishman by birth, but for many years a resident of the city of Baltimore, and for some time prior to his death a boarder in the house of Michael Smith, the wife of whom, is the party claiming under this will. He had been, according to the testimony of his physician, an invalid for at least fifteen years, and for eight months previous to his death confined to the house, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>gradually yielding to the slow but sure and steady approaches of that most fatal qf all diseases, pulmonary consumption. The <em>nuncupation </em>was made in the early part of the forenoon of June the 7th, and on the day following, in the full possession ofJhis senses the testator died.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b588-10\">(Decided 31st January, 1871.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Here there is an attempt to set up a nuncupative will for a party living in a populous city, languishing for months under a disease the fatal termination of which was certain \u2014 admonished by his physician that recovery was hopeless \u2014 living a day at least after the alleged <em>nuncupation </em>and according to the testimony, in the full possession of his senses to the hour of his death. It must be admitted that there was ample time and opportunity to make a written will, and to sustain a nuncupative will under such circumstances, would obliterate all distinctions which the law has wisely drawn between written and unwritten wills, and open wide the door to frauds and perjuries, to prevent which, the Statute of 29 Charles II, was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The only remaining question, is whether the appellants by reason of any delay or <em>laches </em>on their part, have- lost their right to assail this willwithout intending to admit, that mere lapse of time would operate as a bar in any case, we are of opinion that the appellants are not precluded by any supposed delay from contesting the validity of this will.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">They were non-residents, and the Orphans\u2019 Court neither directed summons nor order of publication for the heirs-at-law, and they had not therefore either actual or constructive notice. The petition was filed within twenty-two months after the death of the testator, and for aught that appears to the contrary as soon as they had notice of the alleged will. Surely under such circumstances they cannot be said to have lost their right to impeach the will in questions</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">For these reasons the order of the Court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"AAK\">\n<em>Order reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
