St. Rep. 76; Code Civ. Proc., sec. 688, 690.) An appeal under section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not dependent on a motion under section 556. An order discharging a writ of attachment as to property seized under the writ is an order dissolving the writ as to such property. \u201cDissolution\u201d and \u201cdischarge\u201d are convertible terms. <em>(County of Monterey v.

The rolling stock and other property necessary and proper for carrying on the business of the road are incident to the franchise, and cannot be levied upon and sold separate from the franchise.

This is an action by appellant, which is also a corporation, on a promissory note of respondent; on the day aforesaid appellant caused a writ of attachment, issued in the action, to be levied on certain cars, trucks, electric goods and supplies, fire-proof safes, et cetera, the property of respondent, then used and necessary to be used in and about the business of operating said line of street railway. Thereupon respondent moved the court to discharge the attachment on the ground (we state it generally) that, considering the nature of respondent\u2019s business as a carrier of passengers, and the uses of the attached property in that behalf, the same was not subject to attachment for respondent\u2019s debt. The court ordered that \u201csaid attachment be discharged in respect of said property.\u201d Plaintiff appealed from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Respondent makes the point that no appeal lies from said order. Section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an appeal may be taken from an order (among others mentioned) \u201cdissolving or refusing to dissolve an attachment.\u201d It is argued that this applies only to orders made under section 556 of the code, which provides for discharging the writ of attachment where \u201cthe same was improperly or irregularly issued\u201d; respondent claims that an order for the release of attached property on the ground that it is not liable to seizure under the writ is not an order dissolving the attachment. To us, however, it seems that as regards the property released the attachment is as effectually dissolved by such an order as if the writ were quashed. The provision of section 963, giving the right of appeal, is in terms directed to an order dissolving an attachment; the words \u201can attachment\u201d in this connection are quite broad enough to include seizure and custody under the writ as well as the writ itself. Thus, it is common to say that final judgment for defendant has the effect to dissolve a prior attachment; an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>expression which, has no regard to any question whether the writ was properly or regularly issued. We think the order was appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">As to the merits of the order, in our opinion the quality of the exemption from execution which pertains, except when otherwise provided by statute, to the franchise of a corporation such as the respondent <em>(Gregory v. Blanchard, </em>98 Cal. 311), does not extend also to property of the kind attached in this action, although it may be proper or even necessary to operations under the franchise. Such property does not emanate mediately or immediately from the state like the privileges embraced in a franchise; it has no character of personal trust as in the case of the franchise, and in our opinion it is subject to attachment or execution in like manner as other property not exempt by- statute. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 540, 688, 690; <em>Lathrop v. Middleton, </em>23 Cal. 257; <em>Humphreys v. Hopkins, </em>81 Cal. 551; 15 Am. St. Rep. 76; 1 Freeman on Executions, sec. 146 a; <em>Coe v. Railroad Co., </em>10 Ohio St. 372; 75 Am. Dec. 518; <em>State v. Rives, </em>5 Ired. 297, 307.) There are respectable authorities which hold a different doctrine, but we are disposed to think they are not supported by the better reason. (See <em>Hart v. Burnett, </em>15 Cal. 593.) Whether the rule of liability to attachment or execution should extend to sections of railway lines, or to parts of other similar aggregation of property susceptible of use only as a unit, need not be decided. The cars, trucks, iron safes, and -other movables seized under the writ in this action are not such property. The order appealed from should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Chipman, C., and Belcher, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">McFarland, J., Temple, J., Henshaw, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
