We find that the phrase does not reference the entire juvenile court file, as the minor contends. Nevertheless, we conclude for other reasons the court should have sealed the records in a case dismissed as part of a plea bargain with another case; had the discretion under section 786, subdivision (e)(1) to seal the records pertaining to another petition in which the allegations were found not true; but did not have the discretion under section 786, subdivisions (b) or (e)(1) to seal the records pertaining to a petition filed subsequent to the last petition for which the minor was placed on probation. However, as to that petition, the minor may seek to have his records sealed pursuant to section 781. Thus, we reverse in part and affirm in part the court's orders and remand for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Pursuant to a new competency evaluation filed November 17, 2016, the court again found the minor incompetent to stand trial on the October 6, 2015 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Dismiss Petitions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 17, 2016, the minor filed a motion in San Francisco County juvenile court to seal his juvenile court records. ( \u00a7 786.) At a hearing on November 21, 2016, minor's counsel made an oral motion to dismiss the minor's October 6, 2015 petition pursuant to section 782. Regarding \"the pending petitions,\" the deputy district attorney argued for unsuccessful termination of probation. With respect to the section 782 dismissal, she had no opinion and submitted the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court observed that the minor was \"doing really well\" and \"working really hard,\" was \"testing clean,\" had \"really improved\" his attendance and behavior at school, and was participating with the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice Case Management and Wraparound Services. With respect to the motion to seal records under section 786, the court terminated the misdemeanor probation terms satisfactorily, \"given how well you've been doing since being released on home detention and given that you did complete a program, you have your difficulty with the program, for sure. But you weren't kicked out of the program and the program indicated that there was improvement over the period of the program.\" The court also granted the motion to dismiss under section 782 \"the single felony count that you picked up while you were in custody here.\" The court deferred ruling on the minor's motion to seal his juvenile records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At a hearing on January 4, 2017, the district attorney argued that section 786 did not authorize the sealing of the minor's records pertaining to the October 2015 petition because \"the plain reading of the statute indicates that the minor has to ... have successfully or satisfactorily completed probation, 602 probation or have been on 725 probation, or have been on a grant of informal probation. [\u00b6] ... [H]e was only on probation for the cases where he was competent. So this case does not fall under 786 just by the plain reading because he was never on 602 probation, or\n   725, or 654. So I don't believe that just by the plain reading of the statute that a 786 should be granted for the petition.\" The minor's counsel argued that nothing in section 786 precluded the court from granting record sealing because the minor did, in fact, successfully complete probation for all the petitions included in his unitary juvenile case file when he completed the program in Pennsylvania while he was incompetent to stand trial on the 2015 petition, and it \"just doesn't seem equitable\" not to include it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The juvenile court granted the minor's request under section 786 to seal his records from the \"petitions dated 1/15/13, 7/24/13, 12/19/13, 3/5/14, 10/9/14 and 12/9/14.\" The court did not mention, or dismiss, or seal the records pertaining to the petition filed in San Francisco on September 5, 2014, which was not sustained, or the petition filed in San Mateo County on October 3, 2014, which was dismissed as part of a negotiated disposition with the petition filed in that county on October 9, 2014. The court declined to seal the records pertaining to the October 2015 petition, which it had dismissed pursuant to section 782. The court stated: \"I agree with the district attorney that whether it's a position that this court can infer is certainly not clear by the statute. It's silent on this type of dismissal. And given that it's not silent on different-other types of probation, the court is not going to guess that a 782 falls within this.\" This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The issues on appeal include whether section 786 requires (1) the sealing of records pertaining to a petition dismissed under section 782 in the interest of justice, for which the minor was never placed on probation, but which was part of the corpus of the minor's juvenile court file while the minor was on probation under other petitions; (2) the sealing of records pertaining to a prior petition which was dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain involving an admission in another petition, for which the minor was placed on probation; and (3) the sealing of a prior petition for which the minor was never placed on probation because the allegations of the petition were not sustained. Noting that all of the minor's petitions were eventually transferred to and subsumed under San Francisco County Juvenile Court case No. JW14-6119, the minor argues that \"in the case\" means the minor's entire juvenile case file under that number. (See\n   <em>\n    In re Jose S.\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513586\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/801/#p1119\">\n    12 Cal.App.5th 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513586\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/801/#p1119\">\n    219 Cal.Rptr.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\u00a7 781].) Thus, as long as the minor satisfactorily completed juvenile probation in his case, the record sealing required by the statute encompasses all the accumulated records in the minor's juvenile case file. The Attorney General argues the only records subject to sealing are those pertaining to a specific dismissed petition for which the minor was placed on probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both parties argue that the plain language of section 786, subdivisions (a) and (b), supports their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 786 requires the court, upon the satisfactory completion of probation (formal or informal), to \"order the petition dismissed\" and further \"order sealed all\n   records\n   <em>\n    pertaining to that dismissed petition\n   </em>\n   in the custody of the juvenile court, and in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice.\" ( \u00a7 786, subd.

And, \"[u]pon the court's order of dismissal\n   <em>\n    of the petition,\n   </em>\n   the arrest and other proceedings\n   <em>\n    in the case\n   </em>\n   shall be deemed not to have occurred.\" ( \u00a7 786, subd.

With respect to the issues under consideration here, Assembly Bill No. 666 added subdivision (e)(1), which states: \"The court may, in making its order to seal the record and dismiss\n   <em>\n    the instant petition\n   </em>\n   pursuant to this section, include an order to seal a record relating to, or to dismiss, any prior petition or petitions that\n   <em>\n    have been filed\n   </em>\n   or sustained against the individual and that appear to the satisfaction of the court to meet the sealing and dismissal criteria otherwise described in this section.\" (Italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This subdivision has remained a feature of the statute through later amendments. Commonweal, a sponsor of both Assembly Bill No. 1038 and Assembly Bill No. 666 wrote in support of this provision: \"A new amendment to [Assembly Bill No.] 666 would permit the court to order the sealing and dismissal of prior petitions the individual may have, so long as the court determines that the person has met all other Section 786 criteria for sealing and dismissal in relation to the prior petitions. This discretion to seal priors would apply only in cases where the current petition (in an active probation case) is before the court. It would not apply retroactively by requiring the Court to initiate sealing in older cases. The added burden of sealing priors in a case that is already before the court under Section 786 is viewed as minimal. Defense counsel in particular have identified the need to be able to seal prior petitions in qualifying cases in order to meet the fundamental [Senate Bill No.] 1038 policy goal of opening pathways to employment and education for children who have completed their justice system obligations. The authorizations to seal prior petitions, added at a new subdivision (e), is entirely discretionary and would be applied only if the court determines that the prior petitions merit sealing by meeting all [ section] 786 sealing requirements.\" (June 12, 2015 letter to Hon. Loni Hancock, Chair, Sen. Pub. Safety Com., from David Steinhart, Director, Commonweal Juvenile Justice Program, p. 5.) We note that Senate Bill No. 666 also added new subdivisions (f)(1)(C) and (D), which limit what information can be disclosed \"[i]f a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   petition has been filed against the minor for a felony offense\" ( \u00a7 786, subd. (f)(1)(C), italics added), and \"[u]pon a\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   adjudication of a minor whose record has been sealed under this section and finding that the minor is a person described by Section 602 based on the commission of a felony offense.\" ( \u00a7 786, subd. (f)(1)(D).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our task is to \" ' \"harmonize 'the various parts of a statutory enactment ... by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    A.V., supra\n   </em>\n   , 11 Cal.App.5th at p. 705,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20704\">\n    217 Cal.Rptr.3d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We see nothing in the language of the statute or the legislative history of Senate Bill No. 666 to suggest that the phrase \"in the case,\" as used in section 786, subdivisions (a) and (b), means the entire juvenile court file. Viewed in its ordinary syntactic context, \"in the case\" clearly tethers the records to be sealed to the dismissed petition. This same meaning appears elsewhere in the statute. (See, e.g., \u00a7 786, subd. (f)(1)(H) [\"Access to the sealed record under this subparagraph shall not be construed as a modification of the court's order\n   <em>\n    dismissing the petition and sealing the record in the case\n   </em>\n   ,\" italics added]; \u00a7 786, subd. (f)(1)(D) [\"Access, inspection, or use of a sealed record as provided under this subparagraph shall not be construed as a reversal or modification of the court's order\n   <em>\n    dismissing the petition and sealing the record in the\n    <em>\n     prior\n    </em>\n    case\n   </em>\n   ,\" italics and underscoring added.] )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Viewed as a whole, the language used in these subdivisions strongly suggests that the records to be sealed are those pertaining to a particular petition: a petition for which probation was imposed and satisfactorily completed or, under section 786, subdivision (e)(1), a\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   petition either\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   or sustained, and that otherwise appears to the satisfaction of the court to meet the sealing and dismissal criteria described in section 786. The inclusion of the word \"filed\" signals that the disposition of a petition-i.e., whether it was dismissed or resulted in its own grant of probation-is not dispositive if other prerequisites are met. But, as currently written, the streamlined\n   sealing procedure codified in section 786 does not reach a petition that was filed\n   <em>\n    subsequently\n   </em>\n   to the last petition for which the minor was placed on probation, and which did not result in a grant of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Our conclusion means the juvenile court had the discretion under section 786, subdivision (e)(1) to seal the records pertaining to the petition\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   in San Francisco on September 5, 2014, which was not sustained, and therefore could never have resulted in a grant of probation. For the same reasons, the court certainly had the discretion under section 786, subdivision (e)(1) to dismiss the prior petition\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   in San Mateo County on October 3, 2014, which was dismissed as part of a negotiated disposition with a petition filed on October 9, 2014, for which the minor was placed on probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Considering the minor was essentially on a continuous grant of probation for all of his sustained petitions when he was sent to, and satisfactorily completed, the program in Pennsylvania, there were equities to be considered, but the court did not consider them because, so far as our record shows, the court was not aware of its discretion in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   However, in our view, the court was required to seal the records pertaining to the October 3, 2014 petition under section 786, subdivisions (a) and (b) for the reasons identified in\n   <em>\n    In re G.F.\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513496\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/271/\">\n    12 Cal.App.5th 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513496\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/271/\">\n    218 Cal.Rptr.3d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    G.F.\n   </em>\n   ). There, upon the prosecutor's motion, the section 602 petition was dismissed and the minor was placed on informal supervision pursuant to section 654, instead of section 654.2. After he satisfactorily completed his program of informal supervision, he moved to seal his records pursuant to section 786. The prosecutor opposed the motion, on the ground section 786 did not apply because the minor did not complete a program of supervision under 654.2, as specified in section 786. The trial court found the equities with the minor, but the law with the district attorney, and denied the motion. (\n   <em>\n    G.F.\n   </em>\n   , at p. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513496\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/271/\">\n    218 Cal.Rptr.3d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court of Appeal reversed, finding that supervision under sections 654 and 654.2 were, in that case, essentially indistinguishable, the dismissal procedure employed by the prosecutor was not contemplated by the statutory scheme, and the minor was not told, when he acquiesced to the dismissal under section 652, that his lack of opposition would result in the loss of his right to record sealing under section 786. (\n   <em>\n    G.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 12 Cal.App.5th at p. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513496\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/271/\">\n    218 Cal.Rptr.3d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The court concluded the minor's entitlement \"to relief under section 786 is also consistent with the purpose of the statute, which is to provide a streamlined sealing process for minors who satisfactorily complete a program of supervision or term of probation after a delinquency petition has been filed against them. (\n   <em>\n    In re Y.A.\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775695\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/246/523/#p526\">\n    246 Cal.App.4th 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526-528,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=200%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20933\">\n    200 Cal.Rptr.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

When consenting to the plea bargain, the minor was not informed he would be waiving his future right to relief under section 786 if he satisfactorily completed probation. In our view, the minor should not forfeit his rights under subdivision (b) of section 786 because the prosecutor chose to file two separate petitions, which resulted in one grant of probation. We do not constrain in any way the prosecutor's discretion to proceed as he or she sees fit with respect to the filing, consolidation, or negotiation of delinquency petitions. But we also do not approve a formalistic approach to pleading that results in the frustration rather than the furtherance of the salutary purposes of section 786 when the minor satisfactorily completes a probationary grant imposed pursuant to the simultaneous disposition of two unconsolidated petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

For example, in juvenile court \"it has long been the practice to file successive juvenile petitions under a single case number ... [which] has important practical considerations. It allows the court to keep track of the minor's progress (or lack thereof), to determine whether ordered rehabilitative programs are succeeding or failing and whether new ones should be tried, and to aggregate offenses in order to extend the maximum term of confinement for a new offense where the minor appears to be sliding toward incorrigibility.\" (\n   <em>\n    In re Kasaundra D.\n   </em>\n   (2004)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1204750\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/121/533/#p540\">\n    121 Cal.App.4th 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540-541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20920\">\n    16 Cal.Rptr.3d 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In our view, this distinction warrants treating the disposition of two petitions, resulting in the continuation or grant of probation which the minor ultimately completes to the court's satisfaction, as one petition for the purposes of record sealing under section 786, whether or not the petitions were formally consolidated. We therefore reverse and remand to the juvenile court to issue an order sealing the records pertaining to the October 3, 2014 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We also conclude, however, that section 786 as currently configured does not authorize the juvenile court to seal the records pertaining to the minor's October 2015 petition, which the court dismissed in the interests of justice (\u00a7 782). It is true the minor was on probation for other offenses when the charge underlying that petition arose, and when he was sent to Pennsylvania. However, because it was not a petition for which probation was granted, and was not filed prior to the last petition for which probation was granted, he was not entitled to dismissal or record sealing under section 786. Nevertheless, as we are informed the minor has attained the age of 18, on remand the juvenile court may consider sealing the minor's records pertaining to the October 2015 petition pursuant to section 781. We also reverse and remand\n   to the trial court so that it may exercise its broad discretion under section 786, section (e)(1) with respect to the September 5, 2014 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The juvenile court's order denying the minor's request to seal records pertaining to the October 2015 petition, which was dismissed pursuant to section 782 in the interest of justice, is affirmed.

The matter is remanded for (1) reconsideration of the minor's request for dismissal and/or sealing of the prior petition filed on September 5, 2014, under section 786, subdivision (e)(1) ; (2) for consideration of minor's request for sealing of the October 2015 petition under section 781; and (3) for the issuance of an order to seal the records pertaining to the October 3, 2014 petition, in light of the views expressed in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Margulies, Acting P.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Banke, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    All subsequent statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    On our own motion, we take judicial notice of our prior unpublished opinion in this case (\n    <em>\n     In re W.R.\n    </em>\n    (Jan. 6, 2016), A144659/A145118,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2070029\">\n     2016 WL 70029\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [nonpub. opn.] ).
