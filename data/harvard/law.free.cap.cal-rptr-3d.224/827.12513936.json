Long's car window was open and he looked over and saw two men in an altercation. He saw defendant holding a gun to the head of an African-American man (subsequently identified as Stanley Douglass). Defendant was yelling obscenities at Douglass, and was holding him by the back of his shirt with one hand and had the gun to his head with the other. Douglass looked scared. Long recalled defendant telling Douglass, '[D]on't mess with me' or 'don't fuck with me.' Long thought that defendant was going to kill Douglass. Douglass did not make any threatening gestures and 'stood there in shock.' Douglass walked away quickly; defendant got on his motorcycle and left. Long called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Douglass testified that on the day of the incident, he was standing with his friend on the street when defendant walked by. Douglass asked defendant for a cigarette. Defendant responded something other than 'no,' so Douglass followed him and asked him, '[W]hat did you say?' Defendant responded aggressively and said 'some profanity.' Defendant then pulled a gun out, and grabbed him. Defendant said something about shooting it. Douglass did not physically threaten defendant in any way and tried to walk away. Defendant pointed the gun at Douglass's face and then toward his back. Douglass thought that he could have died that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Sergeant Mary Ann Miller testified that defendant came to the police station on the morning of November 9, 2006, and gave her his .32 caliber handgun. He told her that he had used the gun the previous evening for self-defense purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The trial court held defendant to answer, finding that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant committed an assault with a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Defendant moved to dismiss the information pursuant to section 995, contending that the magistrate erred in excluding the testimony of Sergeant Brandon Lee regarding statements defendant made to Lee, and that the prosecution failed to adduce sufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing because Douglass's testimony lacked credibility and was contradictory. The court denied the motion, concluding the magistrate's ruling that Lee's testimony was not reasonably likely to establish an affirmative defense was proper. The court noted that: (1) there was eyewitness testimony defendant was holding a gun to\n   the victim's head; (2) substantial evidence supported the magistrate's determination of credibility, and (3) in any event, it would not substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence for that of the magistrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"On January 18, 2008, the People moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of insufficient evidence. The court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"On October 7, 2008, defendant petitioned for a finding of factual innocence pursuant to section 851.8. In support of the petition, he submitted his declaration setting forth his version of the incident in which he averred that Douglass grabbed his jacket and demanded a cigarette. Defendant responded by telling him that his conduct was a crime and could get him hurt. Defendant said that Douglass followed him and yelled that he was going to 'f- [defendant] up' and said he was a gang-banger from San Francisco. Defendant became apprehensive and when Douglass placed his hand behind his back, defendant, in fear for his life, drew his pistol to make Douglass back off. Defendant also submitted the declaration of Stephen Soria[,] who stated that he witnessed the incident. He averred that he saw an African-American man approach defendant, tug on his jacket, and ask him for a cigarette. Defendant said 'no' and pushed the African-American man away. The African-American man followed defendant and they exchanged words. Defendant told the African-American man to get away from him. Defendant reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out a small pistol, and pointed it at the African-American man. They struggled for a few seconds before defendant backed away, put the gun back in his pocket, and walked back to his motorcycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The court denied the petition, finding that the People presented substantial evidence that reasonable cause existed to believe that defendant assaulted Douglass with a firearm, and that defendant did not act in self-defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Forest I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , A124144, at pp. *1-*3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 3, 2010, Division Four of this court affirmed the trial court's ruling in an unpublished opinion, as noted in footnote 2,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   .

About two years later, in connection with a personal injury lawsuit the victim brought against Esquibel, the victim talked to an eyewitness who told him Esquibel was not looking at the victim when the truck hit him. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) This eyewitness had testified at trial, but no one\n   had asked him which way defendant was looking when he hit the victim. However, the victim testified at a deposition that, based on what the eyewitness had told him, he now believed the defendant's actions were \" 'entirely accidental and negligent.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 594,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20748\">\n    118 Cal.Rptr. 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Based on the discrepancy, the defendant brought a petition for writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   , which the trial court granted.

(\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) The Court of Appeal reversed, stating, among other reasons, that \"[t]he allegedly contradictory testimony of [the victim] involves his opinions, not facts. Forming a new opinion based on a recently learned fact which could have been brought out at trial is not a basis for relief under\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 595,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20748\">\n    118 Cal.Rptr. 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The situation here is analogous. In 2008, in opposition to defendant's petition for a finding of factual innocence, Ms. Lintott submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury stating her reasons for dismissing the assault charge\n   against defendant in 2006. She averred that she \"moved to dismiss the case based on insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\" She also averred that she \"believed that an objective fact finder\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   find the assault with a firearm by Robert Forest took place\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the standard was by a preponderance of evidence, but that there was not a 'probability' of a conviction if the standard was beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Original italics.) Her decision to dismiss was based on information the defense presented to her in December 2007 bearing on his asserted defense of self-defense. This information included \"interviews conducted by the defendant's investigators\" and a \"handwritten report\" by David\n   <em>\n    E.\n   </em>\n   Paoli, who was the father of David\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n   Paoli, who was married to the victim's mother. David\n   <em>\n    E.\n   </em>\n   Paoli \"reported encounters with [the victim] when he was off his 'meds,' and believed that [the victim] had threatened David\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n   with a mawl and 'some gang members.' \" Lintott also averred that her decision to dismiss was \"strongly disapproved of\" by the deputy district attorney who had filed the case and who believed he could win a conviction notwithstanding the anticipated defense evidence. Finally, Lintott averred defendant's prosecution was justified by six objective reasons: \"(1) the defendant pulled a firearm on an unarmed victim and held it to his face, (2) the defendant 'had a hold of' the victim's clothing as he held the gun to his head, (3) the victim had no reported record of violence, (4) the defendant at the time was parked in front of a bar where he had been drinking Tequila, (5) the defendant fled on his motorcycle instead of waiting for the police, and (6) the defendant has a criminal record (conviction under Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 12025(b) and 12301 [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] ) involving a firearm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Lintott\n   <em>\n    was not a percipient witness\n   </em>\n   to the events. Thus, her unsworn 2015 retraction could only relate to her legal opinion about whether an assault had been committed, and not a statement of fact. Furthermore, taken in its entirety, the change in Lintott's opinion does not appear to be very different from her earlier opinion. Although she states in her retraction that defendant \"did not commit an assault on an unarmed man with a gun,\" she adds that she \"want[s] to confirm that [she] made the right decision when [she] dismissed the charges that were pending against Mr. Forest.\" That decision, as we know from her 2008 declaration, was based on her\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   that she could prove assault by a preponderance of the evidence but not beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Furthermore, we are not required to accept Lintott's statement at face value\n   but may consider the circumstances under which it was made. Her statement is unsworn and was made in settlement of a lawsuit after protracted litigation, both circumstances which undermine its probative value.

In our view, Ms. Lintott's retraction is\n   not a fact but an opinion of dubious provenance that could not have prevented the rendition of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Deputy Lee's Deposition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant alleges that Fort Bragg Police Department Sergeant Brandon Lee's sworn deposition testimony presents the \"new fact\" \"that, in his opinion, no probable cause existed to arrest Mr. Forest for any criminal offense.\" He further asserts he did \"not learn that Sgt. Lee was of the opinion that there was no probable cause for his arrest until Sgt. Lee's deposition in 2014.\" Several documents submitted by defendant in support of his\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition bear on Sergeant Lee's deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On November 9, 2006 at 9:28 a.m., Sergeant Lee interviewed defendant about an altercation the previous day in Fort Bragg. Sergeant Lee had spoken to defendant the previous evening by telephone. Defendant confessed to pointing a gun at the victim but claimed he acted in self-defense. Defendant's pre-arrest statement to Lee is largely congruent with the declaration under penalty of perjury defendant submitted to the court in 2008 on the section 851.8 petition, although there are some differences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It\n   is clear from Sergeant Lee's comments that he was sympathetic to defendant and believed defendant was the actual victim of a crime. Lee did not testify at the preliminary hearing. \"Defendant moved to dismiss the information pursuant to section 995, contending that the magistrate erred in excluding the testimony of Sergeant Brandon Lee regarding statements defendant made to Lee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Forest I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , A124144, at p. *2.) The motion was denied.

It is clear that Lee was not one of the investigating officers and he\n   did not interview any of the percipient witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the opposition states that \"[o]n or about December 19, 2006, the Fort Bragg prosecutor became aware that Sgt. Lee was accusing Lt. Higdon of changing Lee's\n   <em>\n    Supplement\n   </em>\n   report as to Lee's interview of Forest. In order to make sure that Mr. Forest was being treated fairly, said prosecutor requested DA Investigator Robert Simerson to conduct his own interview of the critical third-party witness in this case, Jacob Long. Investigator Simerson interviewed Jacob ....\" No more information is available to us because the next page of the opposition memorandum is missing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 14, 2014, Sergeant Lee was deposed in connection with defendant's lawsuit against Lintott. Defendant provides selective, nonconsecutive excerpts from the deposition. As relevant here, Lee testified he would not describe himself as a personal friend of defendant's, but he knew defendant as a business owner, and the two had discussed defendant's \"nice motorcycle\" and having been in the Marine Corps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lee testified he first became aware of the incident between defendant and the victim on November 8, 2006 when \"[i]t was explained to me by Officer Lopez and some of the other officers on duty that day that were involved or had knowledge of the matter.\" Defendant's wife called him to express her concern. Lee, in turn, called defendant. At that time, a BOLO had been issued for defendant's arrest. After speaking with defendant, Lee contacted Mendocino County Sheriff's Office dispatch and requested that the BOLO be \"retracted\" and that defendant not be arrested at that time. He did so because \"no one [except him] had spoken to Mr. Forest to actually get his side of the story to find out what exactly happened\" and, in his estimation, \"[m]any of the statements, the witness statements that I had heard third hand at that point were not supportive of an actual assault with a deadly weapon occurring.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Lee stated in \"prior testimony\" that he recorded his interview with defendant on the morning of November 9, 2006. Lee testified a transcript shown to him by counsel accurately reflected the interview. Lieutenant Higdon interrupted the interview and asked to speak with Lee. Lee went to Higdon's office, where Higdon asked Lee what was taking so long. Lee explained to Higdon that \"Mr. Forest was giving me ... a statement that was\n   much different than the story that had been explained the previous night as far as the totality of the events. And Lieutenant Higdon had told me to get it done and move on and let's get this guy in custody.\" Higdon ordered Lee to arrest defendant, stating something to the effect of, \"This is a direct order[;] do you fucking understand a direct order?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lee went back to defendant and \"explained to him the situation. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] I told Mr. Forest that I was being directed by my commanding officer that I was to place him under arrest and charge him with assault with a deadly weapon. And I think I explained to him twice that it was not my decision and that I was being ordered to do so.\" Defendant asked who was making the decision and Lee \"told him it was Lieutenant Floyd Higdon.\" At the point in time that Lieutenant Higdon ordered him to arrest defendant for a felony violation of section 245, assault with a firearm, Lee \"did not\" believe there was probable cause for that arrest, and he \"would not have\" arrested him for that offense if he had not been ordered to do so by Lieutenant Higdon. Asked if at that point in time, in his opinion, there was probable cause to believe that Mr. Forest had committed any crime, Lee responded: \"I had reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Forest may have been guilty of brandishing a firearm, but based on the statement that he provided me that morning I was not convinced that even the 417 charge was applicable at that point.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After many more words were exchanged between Lee and Higdon about defendant, and defendant was not allowed to post bail from\n   Fort Bragg, Lee got ready to go home. But before he went, he told defendant: \"Whatever you do at this point, your rights have been violated, is up to you. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... Please, if this goes forward to a lawsuit or something of that nature, I said please leave me out of it. I said this is none of my doing. [\u00b6] And [defendant] just kind of smiled and nodded his head. And I said you guys want to go ahead and violate his freedom and his rights, I said go right ahead. I said I'm not going to be a part of it. He has a right to bail and if he's denied that right you can expect a visit from the A.C.L.U.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Lee wrote a supplemental report. He later learned the report had been altered, and on December 12, 2006, he e-mailed Chief Mark Puthoff to tell him so. The portions of his report which had been altered included \"the description of Sergeant [Mary Ann] Miller and Lieutenant Don Miller ... being present and taking Mr. Forest's concealed weapons from him.\" The two Millers are married to each other; Sergeant Miller worked for the Fort Bragg Police Department, and Lieutenant Miller worked for the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office. Lee was there but did not actually observe all the information included in the report, such as, \"Robert showing two loaded handguns,\n   which Lieutenant Miller unloaded and returned to Robert.\" Contrary to the report, Lee never received a copy of defendant's concealed weapon permit from Lieutenant Miller or firearm from Sergeant Miller. Finally, the report deleted the part where he explained \"Mr. Forest's statement as far as how the confrontation ... had built between [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] the two of them up to the event that was reported.\" Lee admitted that \"the D.A. is the final arbiter on whether the case should proceed or not.\" \"We have cases rejected all the time.\" He also testified it was \"correct\" that he \"may have a case where the D.A. proceeds and you don't think they should.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Sergeant Lee's deposition testimony fails to support\n   <em>\n    coram vobis\n   </em>\n   relief for at least two reasons, if not more. First, as discussed above, Sergeant Lee's opinion that there was no probable cause to arrest defendant for assault with a firearm was just that, an opinion. As discussed in connection with Lintott's retraction,\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   will not lie to correct opinions or errors of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, the content of Sergeant Lee's deposition was not new to defendant. Lee told defendant that he did not believe he committed a crime; that it was not his decision to arrest him; that he was only arresting him because his commanding officer ordered him to do so; and that his rights were being violated. Defendant understood early on that Lee was sympathetic to his cause and a potential witness on his behalf; he evidently tried to use Lee as the conduit through which he could present his self-defense theory at the preliminary hearing without actually having to testify at the preliminary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant surely could have learned of Lee's opinions and suspicions when his representatives actually interviewed Lee for the factual innocence hearing. And, if defendant did not know before, the prosecution's opposition to defendant's section 851.8 petition put him on notice that Lee had complained about changes to his supplemental report to his superiors and that an investigation had been initiated. At that point, defendant could have had Lee interviewed again on that topic. Failing to discover all that Lee had to say at this juncture, and presenting it to the judge who presided at his factual innocence hearing, is analogous to the failure to ask the eyewitness at trial in\n   <em>\n    Esquibel\n   </em>\n   which way the defendant was looking when he hit the\n   victim with his car. Due diligence has not been shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Assuming Lee's report was altered or doctored, it was not used against him in any proceeding, and even the use of false testimony to secure a conviction is insufficient to warrant\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   relief. (Appeals and Writs in Criminal Cases (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 2017) \u00a7 11.8 [\n   <em>\n    Writs of Error Coram Nobis and Coram Vobis\n   </em>\n   ], pp. 11-9 to 11-10, and cases cited therein.) Nor will\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    vobis\n   </em>\n   lie to challenge the legality of an arrest, or the failure to prove a crime was\n   committed, or to correct defects in the preliminary hearing.

Stipulation to Factual Innocence by Assistant District Attorney Sequeira.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant argues that the \"most important piece of new evidence\" is Mr. Sequeira's stipulation that defendant is factually innocent of assault. The actual signed stipulation, if there is one, is not included in the record. Instead, what is included is the transcript of the Mr. Sequeira's unsworn statement to the court below on February 24, 2016, explaining his reasons for the entering into a stipulation. Mr. Sequeira has been a member of the Mendocino County District Attorney's Office since 2011. He was selected to review Mr. Forest's\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition because the district attorney had recused himself, Mr. Sequeira has 31 years of experience, and his tenure in the office postdates the events at issue and the election contest involving Lintott and the new district attorney. He had spent \"many, many hours\" reviewing the case. In his view, when the prior district attorney issues a statement that defendant did not commit an assault with a gun on an unarmed man, it \"behooves the new district attorney to take a solid look at that and give that great weight.\" But what weighed more heavily on him was \"the disturbing evidence\" that came forth during Sergeant Lee's deposition that his report was altered by someone higher up in the Fort Bragg Police Department, \"probably and most likely\" Lieutenant Higdon, who deliberately omitted defendant's \"exculpatory statements central to the determination of whether there was an assault with a deadly weapon,\" and defendant's \"claim of self-defense and how his confrontation with [the victim] first start[ed].\" \"And when the district attorney's office was notified they were slow in acting on those reports.\" \"[G]iven the totality of the circumstances in this case,\" Mr. Sequeira thought \"the only fair and right thing to do in a case like this is to stipulate at this point that Mr. Forest is factually innocent given the tortured history in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We fail to see how the opinion of an attorney on the fairness of a process which culminated in the dismissal of a felony charge prior to trial is a new fact which would have prevented the rendition of judgment in 2008. It is first and foremost a legal opinion. Further, it is an opinion which places \"great weight\" on Lintott's retraction and on Lee's deposition which, as we have already discussed, will not support\n   <em>\n    coram vobis\n   </em>\n   relief. We also note that\n   section 851.8, subdivision (d) allows the court to grant the petition upon the concurrence of the district attorney at the time of dismissal, but not otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant's petition for writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   is no more than his latest\n   attempt to persuade a tribunal to accept, as a matter of law, that he acted in self-defense when, after consuming two tequilas, he produced a gun from his pocket and pointed it at an unarmed man who obnoxiously asked him for a cigarette. The victim and an independent witness testified under oath and subject to cross-examination at the preliminary hearing. Defendant could have testified to self-defense at this time, but did not do so. Instead, he tried to present the defense through Sergeant Lee, thereby insulating himself from cross-examination. The judge who heard the evidence found probable cause to believe the evidence showed the crime of felony assault with a firearm had been committed. The judge who heard the section 995 motion believed the evidence showed a felony assault with a firearm had been committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant's self-defense claim was litigated on the subsequent motion for a finding of factual innocence. Stephen Soria's sworn statement to police on December 14, 2006, was presented to the judge who ruled on the petition. Soria was the boy on the bicycle, an additional eyewitness. He said the \"black kid\" approached defendant, tugged on his jacket, and said, \"Sir, do you have a cigarette?\" Soria did not report hearing the victim threaten defendant. The victim was following defendant closely when defendant pulled a gun out of his pocket \"and pointed it at the kid.\" The court also considered defendant's declaration, which presented his self-defense claim in lieu of his testimony, and the transcript of the sworn testimony given at the preliminary hearing. That judge found that defendant's showing failed to establish that \" ' \"\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   reasonable cause to arrest him in the first place.\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    Medlin, supra\n   </em>\n   , 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 1102,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20810\">\n    100 Cal.Rptr.3d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; italics added.) This court affirmed that judge's decision on appeal. Defendant has also tried to convince two federal courts that he was falsely arrested, to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant now presents this court with the opinions of two attorneys and a police officer in another failed attempt to persuade us that the evidence he acted in self-defense points unerringly to his innocence. It does not. One district attorney dismissed the charge. Had she not done so, a jury might have acquitted defendant. But defendant has not presented to this court or any other court \"new facts\" that dispel the probability his asserted belief he was in imminent danger of suffering bodily harm was unreasonable under the circumstances, and that he used more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against the perceived danger. ( CALCRIM No. 3470.)

Defendant backed away but the victim followed him and verbally threatened to \"fuck [him] up,\" and said he was \"some kind of gang banger from Frisco.\" Defendant continued walking to his motorcycle. A \"kid on a bike\" rode by and hollered his name. Defendant thought he recognized the kid and asked him if the victim was his friend. He told the kid to get the victim away from him, but the kid did not respond. The victim was still trailing him. At this point, defendant began to think, based on what the victim had said earlier about fucking him up and being a gangbanger from Frisco, that \"maybe he's armed.\" The victim was \"coming [on] aggressively.\" When the victim \"closed the distance where he could actually do me harm\" and \"his right hand went behind his back,\" defendant made a \"snap decision\" and \"produced a weapon\" from his jacket pocket. Later, defendant clarified the victim was close enough to hit defendant when defendant produced the weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Lee said: \"Right. OK, so you produced this firearm-it was loaded, ... and you pointed it at him.\" Defendant responded: \"Under the circumstances, I felt it was the safest thing-the only thing I could do to ensure my safety and avoid bloodshed.\" The victim did not produce a weapon. \"[H]e backed right off\" off but kept \"yelling that he was going to fuck me up.\" Defendant yelled back, \"[T]his isn't over-you're going to hear from-you guys. ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] I'll carry that out.\" Defendant drove straight to his home to get his car because he had to pick up his daughter from a friend's house in Mendocino.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    When Lee asked why defendant had parked his motorcycle so far away from the Headlands Caf\u00e9, defendant admitted he had been at the Tip Top first, where he had a tequila and water. \"Lots of water .... Here's how I don't fool with motorcycles or weapons when I am under the influence. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] I go into the Tip-Top. Sometimes, they know I have water and I sit there long enough to be quite sober before I ever leave. So that's what I was doing. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] I sat there for a couple of hours.\" He went to get his gun from his saddlebag on his motorcycle, \"put [his] piece in here\" and then went to the Headlands Caf\u00e9. He had never seen the victim before.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Lee informed defendant that an independent witness had seen him chasing the victim down the street with his gun drawn. Defendant said, \"That's crap,\" but then admitted what the witness \"might have seen is when I drew my weapon he was within the-he had the ability to hurt me at that point. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] I made contact ... with this hand, pushed him that way and he kept moving, you know, and I might have taken a step or two, but that was it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Defendant told Lee he \"would like to file a complaint, so that this kid gets the message and you just don't grab people or make demands on them on the street and follow them and threaten them and do all that kind of stuff. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] To me, that's a crime. Am I wrong about that?\" Lee responded: \"That's not incorrect. No, you're right.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Lee asked defendant why, if he felt \"so threatened and so compelled,\" he did not come directly to law enforcement. Defendant said his daughter was everything to him, it was his habit to be responsible, and \"habit probably overrode my better judgment\" because he could have made other arrangements. Also, he was \"pretty shook up\" and \"wanted to get out of the area anyway.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    At this point, Lee stated that, as he had explained the previous night on the phone, \"as a carrier of a concealed weapons permit,\" defendant had a duty to assist law enforcement and inform them that he had drawn his firearm during an altercation, \"so that we don't just think there is some vigilante out there that, that you know, got into it with some guy on the street and pulled a gun on him.\" Lee reminded defendant that by \"working alongside the law enforcement as far as keeping us, you know, abreast of your activity, you know, because the average citizen doesn't know, you don't have the same capacity ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... that an officer has, you know. ... [Y]ou don't have a badge to display, you know, they don't know who you are, that you have a right to be, you know, carrying a firearm. You understand?\" Defendant said he did, adding he did consider making a citizen's arrest on this kid, but he did not know if the laws had changed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    So far as the exhibit shows, Lee concluded the interview with, \"OK. Alright.\" However, it is not clear whether the actual interview ended here, or whether this is the end of the defense excerpt from the interview only, since the exhibit appears from its footer to be a defense-created document and not a copy of the original interview transcript.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In his declaration, defendant stated that he got his bagel and cream cheese to go, and that he had\n    <em>\n     two\n    </em>\n    tequila drinks, the second one with water.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Defendant alleges in his reply brief that Sergeant Lee was the \"lead investigating officer of the 2006 incident\" but nothing in the record supports that assertion. In fact, Sergeant Lee testified at his deposition that Officer Oscar Lopez was \"the primary officer that handled the case.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Lieutenant Higdon's initial report, without investigator Simerson's notes, was attached to the prosecution's original opposition but is not part of the copy reproduced for the appellate record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Lee testified he later learned that \"at some point in the distant past Mr. Higdon and Mr. Forest both worked for the Fort Bragg Police Department.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
