Rules of Court, rule 8.512(d)(2) ), or pending further order of the court. Submission of additional briefing, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 8.520, is deferred pending further order of the court. The motion to compel the Board of Parole Hearings to hold a parole hearing on October 26, 2017, is denied as moot.

Palmer, is hereby stayed pending further order of this court. Corrigan, J., was absent and did not participate.</p></opinion>\n</casebody></body></html>"}}
