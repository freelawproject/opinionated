The motion sought to strike certain allegations in a cross-complaint filed by Joel D. Kettler, alleging defamation and other causes of action. The court denied the motion to the extent cross-complainant's claims were based on complaints to the Certified Financial Planners Board of Standards (the CFP Board), finding the CFP Board was not a public agency and there was no public interest issue. The court also denied the motion to the extent the claims were based on communications to cross-complainant's employer, finding the litigation privilege did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude the trial court's ruling was correct on both points and affirm the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Cross-complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cross-complainant is a financial planner and advisor who acted in that capacity for cross-defendant Leslie Gould's elderly parents from 1990 until\n   they died, in 2010 and 2011. Cross-complainant had a \"close familial relationship\" with the Goulds. The elder Goulds gave cross-complainant a power of attorney in 2006, and he managed many aspects of their finances, including payment of their bills and disbursements they authorized to Leslie Gould and his sister. According to the cross-complaint, the parents made these arrangements after expressing concerns their children were spendthrifts who lived beyond their means, to control their access to the parents' funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the deaths of the parents, cross-complainant became the trustee of the Gould Living Trust, of which Leslie Gould and his sister were the beneficiaries. (Cross-complainant succeeded Leslie Gould, who resigned as trustee in June 2011.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The cross-complaint alleges that in February and March 2013, cross-complainant learned that Leslie Gould had intentionally misdirected correspondence and financial statements to his home, to hide the existence of some of the trust's assets from his sister. Cross-complainant exposed this wrongdoing, as well as Leslie's interception of his parents' mail, including payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaint alleges that, as a result of this exposure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"13.... Cross-Defendants have engaged in a malicious, vicious, mean-spirited, scorched earth campaign against Cross-Complainant, falsely accusing Cross-Complainant of misappropriating the [elder] Goulds' funds and intentionally deceiving them to obtain the [power of attorney] and become the successor trustee. In addition to filing this frivolous lawsuit, Cross-Defendants have filed complaints with every person or agency imaginable, including, but not limited to, the Department of Insurance, Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. ('CFP Board'), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA'), Cross-Complainant's employer, and any other government agency, company, or person that could possibly interfere with Cross-Complainant's ability to engage in his profession. As a result of Cross-Defendants' wrongful actions, Cross-Complainant's employment relationship with his employer has been terminated.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   And:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"14. Cross-Defendants have also defamed Cross-Complainant's reputation to other Third Parties, including to existing and potential clients, which has caused one or more clients to cancel their business with Cross-Complainant and no longer use Cross-Complainant as their financial planner/advisor. Cross-Defendants have caused Cross-Complainant to lose clients and hence, commissions, management fees, service fees and performance bonuses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The allegations just quoted are incorporated into each of the cross-complaint's nine causes of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   addition to damages, cross-complainant sought injunctive relief \"preventing Cross-Defendants from continuing their wrongful conduct\" in connection with several causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We will describe additional allegations as necessary in our discussion of the claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Cross-defendants' First Anti-SLAPP Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cross-defendants filed an anti-SLAPP motion ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They sought to strike the entire cross-complaint. Because all of cross-complainant's causes of action were based at least in part on unprotected activity, the court concluded the anti-SLAPP motion could be denied in its entirety, and did so. Cross-defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Baral v.

The background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A defendant may bring a special motion to strike any cause of action \"arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue....\" ( \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Acts in furtherance of free speech rights in connection with a public issue include \"(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court employs a two-step process. It first looks to see whether the moving party has made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity. (\n   <em>\n    Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (2002)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"777220\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/29/53/#p67\">\n    29 Cal.4th 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20507\">\n    124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20P.3d%20685\">\n    52 P.3d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

The communications in this case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The communications at issue in this case and relevant chronology are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On August 25, 2013, Leslie Gould \"reported to AXA, who I believed to be the employer of [cross-complainant] at all times stated herein, using their dedicated 'fraud' email (ReportFraud@axa-equitable.com) what I believed to be the wrongdoing of [cross-complainant] in connection with my parents.\" The email, sent by Susan Gould at Leslie Gould's direction, stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"You should be aware that one of your employee[s] has performed illegal actions. [\u00b6] We recently discovered that [cross-complainant] has embezzled approximately 6 figures of funds from our now deceased parents and committed numerous instances of financial elder abuse. [\u00b6] His actions have been deliberate, intentional and show an ongoing and malicious pattern of his breach of fiduciary responsibility.\" The email described the background facts and types of illicit behavior, such as \"electronic transfers going to [cross-complainant's] various credit cards,\" \"false receipts,\" a \"completely bogus\" accounting, and concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"A plethora of other issues are also in play, all demonstrating [cross-complainant's] deliberate financial manipulations of our elderly parents' assets, both pre and post death. The offenses are widespread and span several years. The examples cited above are just a few. All examples are supported with back-up documents. [\u00b6] Please contact me anytime and we can meet and I can give you documentation. In the meantime, we have contacted FINRA, the DA and the FBI.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On February 10, 2014, five and one-half months later, Susan Gould on behalf of cross-defendants emailed AXA (Andrew Ziskin and Wendy\n   Pontrelli), stating that: \"I still see that as of today, [cross-complainant] is listed as 'my financial professional'. Please remove him immediately. [\u00b6] Please let me know who at AXA I should follow up with regarding employee dishonesty. I have included this message to Wendy who we notified of [cross-complainant's] previous fraudulent activities.\" Cross-defendants repeated their earlier assertions about cross-complainant's various \"nefarious actions,\" and stated they had \"reason to believe that he may have taken out a life insurance policy (again, with Gould money) on either Donna or Danny Gould, for which he had absolutely no insurable interest. Please look into these matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The February 10, 2014 email also stated that \"3 AXA annuities are still paying into a Gould Living Trust bank account\"; that cross-complainant had refused to resign as trustee; and that: \"We have filed a lawsuit seeking [cross-complainant's] removal as trustee, but he is using estate money to fight it while he crafts back-dated 'faux' letters trying to extricate himself from the lies he has been caught in. I would like to request that the annuities stop being deposited into the account and that AXA holds the money until this matter is resolved. [Cross-complainant] should have business insurance, so we are requesting a copy of his policy. [\u00b6] Thanks for your assistance and anticipated cooperation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   On February 11, 2014, cross-defendants emailed AXA again, saying: \"Please let us know how we can assist you. We have copious documentation demonstrating his fraud, elder abuse, and embezzlement.\" (That same day, AXA assured cross-defendants \"that [cross-complainant] no longer has access to your accounts and can no longer view account status.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On July 22, 2014 (11 months after the August 2013 email and five months after the February 2014 email), Leslie Gould filed a lawsuit against cross-complainant, AXA and several AXA-related entities, alleging 10 causes of action, including various claims of fraud, unfair business practices, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, elder abuse, conversion, and an accounting. (Those claims have been settled.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Contentions and conclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Cross-defendants contend the trial court should have granted the anti-SLAPP motion, to the extent cross-complainant's claims were based on the\n   communications to AXA we have just described. The substance of cross-defendants' argument is that the same allegations of misconduct they communicated to AXA in August 2013 and February 2014 later appear in two lawsuits: first in Leslie Gould's December 2013 petition to the probate court to remove cross-complainant as trustee of the\n   Gould Living Trust, and then in their July 2014 lawsuit against AXA and cross-complainant. Cross-defendants assert the communications in question therefore \"have some connection or logical relation to\" both the probate petition and the lawsuit and so are absolutely privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We do not agree. The law requires more than \"some connection or logical relation\" to a later lawsuit. The communications must be made \"to achieve the objects of the litigation\" (\n   <em>\n    Silberg, supra,\n   </em>\n   50 Cal.3d at p. 212,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20638\">\n    266 Cal.Rptr. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=786%20P.2d%20365\">\n    786 P.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and prelitigation communications must be made at a time when litigation is \"under serious consideration\" (\n   <em>\n    Action Apartment, supra,\n   </em>\n   41 Cal.4th at p. 1251,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20398\">\n    63 Cal.Rptr.3d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20P.3d%2089\">\n    163 P.3d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Cross-defendants' evidence fails both these tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   First, none of the communications contains any suggestion that cross-defendants were contemplating a lawsuit against AXA. There is no threat of suit, no demand of any kind, no warning of possible litigation-literally nothing to suggest that litigation against AXA (or cross-complainant) was \"under serious consideration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Action Apartment, supra,\n   </em>\n   41 Cal.4th at p. 1251,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20398\">\n    63 Cal.Rptr.3d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20P.3d%2089\">\n    163 P.3d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Cross-defendants merely reported cross-complainant's alleged wrongdoing and their contacts with \"FINRA, the DA and the FBI\"; said that \"we can meet and I can give you documentation\"; asked AXA to \"[p]lease look into these matters\"; and thanked AXA \"for your assistance and anticipated cooperation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Second, cross-defendants' declarations in support of the anti-SLAPP motion are likewise devoid of any statement that, at the time they communicated with AXA in August 2013 and February 2014, they were seriously considering filing the lawsuit they ultimately filed in July 2014. Leslie Gould states only that: \"Following my reporting of suspected fraud by [cross-complainant], I was never interviewed (nor was my wife) and I never heard anything further from AXA. I then decided to file the within action in July, 2014.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Third, so far as the probate proceeding is concerned, the communications to AXA could do nothing to further the objects of the litigation, which had nothing to do with AXA. Those communications were entirely \"extraneous to the action\" (\n   <em>\n    Silberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 50 Cal.3d at p. 220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20638\">\n    266 Cal.Rptr. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=786%20P.2d%20365\">\n    786 P.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and accordingly not protected by the litigation privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In short, like the trial court, we see no evidence the communications at issue were \"in furtherance of the objects of the litigation\" ultimately filed or\n   that they related to litigation that was under serious consideration when the communications were made.
