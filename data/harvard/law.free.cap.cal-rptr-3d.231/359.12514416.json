We concluded the juvenile court should have sealed the records in a case dismissed as part of a plea bargain with another case; had the discretion under section 786, subdivision (e)(1) to seal the records pertaining to another petition in which the allegations were not sustained following an adjudication hearing; but did not have the discretion under section 786, subdivisions (b) or (e)(1) to seal the records pertaining to a petition filed subsequent to the last petition for which the minor was placed on probation.

That legislation amended section 786, subdivision (e), effective January 1, 2018. We invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the application of the amendment to this case.

( Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4).) The court found minor not competent to stand trial and suspended proceedings on December 4, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On February 8, 2016, the San Francisco County juvenile court ordered minor placed at Summit Academy in Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minor was transported to Pennsylvania on March 8, 2016, and returned to San Francisco on September 9, 2016. On October 11, 2016, minor was detained pending completion of a new competency evaluation. Home detention, previously revoked, was reinstated. Pursuant to a new competency evaluation filed November 17, 2016, the court again found minor incompetent to stand trial on the October 6, 2015 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Dismiss Petitions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 17, 2016, minor filed a motion in San Francisco County juvenile court to seal his juvenile court records. ( \u00a7 786.) At a hearing on November 21, 2016, minor's counsel made an oral motion to dismiss minor's October 6, 2015 petition pursuant to section 782. Regarding \"the pending petitions,\" the deputy district attorney argued for unsuccessful termination of probation. With respect to the section 782 dismissal, she had no opinion and submitted the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court observed that minor was \"doing really well\" and \"working really hard,\" was \"testing clean,\" had \"really improved\" his attendance and behavior at school, and was participating with the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice Case Management and Wraparound Services. With respect to the motion to seal records under section 786, the court terminated the misdemeanor probation terms satisfactorily, \"given how well you've been doing since being released on home detention and given that you did complete a program, you have your difficulty with the program, for sure. But you weren't\n   kicked out of the program and the program indicated that there was improvement over the period of the program.\" The court also granted the motion to dismiss under section 782 \"the single felony count that you picked up while you were in custody here.\" The court deferred ruling on the minor's motion to seal his juvenile records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At a hearing on January 4, 2017, the district attorney argued that section 786 did not authorize the sealing of minor's records pertaining to the October 2015 petition because \"the plain reading of the statute indicates that the minor has to ... have successfully or satisfactorily completed probation, 602 probation or have been on 725 probation, or have been on a grant of informal probation. [\u00b6] ... [H]e was only on probation for the cases where he was competent. So this case does not fall under 786 just by the plain reading because he was never on 602 probation, or 725, or 654. So I don't believe that just by the plain reading of the statute that a 786 should be granted for the petition.\" Minor's counsel argued that nothing in section 786 precluded the court from granting record sealing because minor did, in fact, successfully complete probation for all the petitions included in his unitary juvenile case file when he completed the program in Pennsylvania while he was incompetent to stand trial on the 2015 petition, and it \"just doesn't seem equitable\" not to include it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The juvenile court granted minor's request under section 786 to seal his records from the \"petitions dated 1/15/13, 7/24/13, 12/19/13, 3/5/14, 10/9/14 and 12/9/14.\" The court did not mention, or dismiss, or seal the records pertaining to the petition filed in San Francisco on September 5, 2014, which was not sustained, or the petition filed in San Mateo County on October 3, 2014, which was dismissed as part of a negotiated disposition with the petition filed in that county on October 9, 2014. The court declined to seal the records pertaining to the October 2015 petition, which it had dismissed pursuant to section 782. The court stated: \"I agree with the district attorney that whether it's a position that this court can infer is certainly not clear by the statute. It's silent on this type of dismissal. And given that it's not silent on different-other types of probation, the court is not going to guess that a 782 falls within this.\" This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As relevant here, Assembly Bill No. 529 added a new subdivision (e) to section 786, which provides in pertinent part: \"If a person who has been alleged to\n   be a ward of the juvenile court has his or her petition dismissed by the court, whether on the motion of the prosecution or on the court's own motion, or if the petition is not sustained by the court after an adjudication hearing, the court shall order sealed all records pertaining to\n   the dismissed petition in the custody of the juvenile court, and in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Legislative Counsel's Digest states: \"Existing law authorizes a judge of the juvenile court to dismiss a petition, or set aside the findings and dismiss a petition, if the court finds that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require that dismissal, or the court finds that the minor is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation. [\u00b6] This bill would require, if a person who has been alleged to be a ward of the juvenile court and has his or her petition dismissed or if the petition is not sustained by the court after an adjudication hearing, the court to seal all records pertaining to that dismissed petition that are in the custody of the juvenile court, and in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice in accordance with a specified procedure.\" (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Assem. Bill No. 529 (2017-2018 Reg. Sess.) Stats. 2017, ch. 68, \u00a7 1, Summary Dig., p. 92.) According to the bill's cosponsor, \"under most circumstances a youth that has his case dismissed due to insufficient evidence, or in the interest of justice, without an adjudication must wait until he is at least 18 to petition the court to seal his record. However, minors that commit and are adjudicated for non-serious or non-violent offenses can have their records automatically sealed upon completion of probation. This means that the court orders the petition be dismissed and the juvenile court records are sealed immediately. [Assembly Bill No.] 529 ... extend[s] this same process to similar cases where a minor has had his delinquency petition dismissed without an adjudication due to insufficient evidence, in the interest of justice or because he is incompetent and not likely to become competent in the foreseeable future, regardless of the alleged offense.\" (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 529 (2017-2018 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 27, 2017, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties agree that if the amended statute applies, the minor is entitled to all the relief he seeks. The petition filed in San Francisco County on September 5, 2014, was not sustained by the court after an adjudication hearing; under the current version of section 786, subdivision (e), the records pertaining to that petition must be sealed. The petition filed in San Mateo\n   County on October 3, 2014, was dismissed by the court on the prosecution's motion as part of a negotiated disposition; the records pertaining to this petition must also be sealed. Finally, the petition filed in San\n   Francisco County on October 6, 2015, was dismissed by the court in the interests of justice, after the minor was found incompetent to stand trial and not likely to become competent in the foreseeable future. Thus, section 786, subdivision (e) requires the sealing of records pertaining to that petition as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   W.R.'s petition to seal his juvenile records was denied in January 2017, before new section 786 took effect. W.R. timely appealed and we reversed the juvenile court's order denying the minor's sealing request regarding two of the three dismissed petitions at issue, and but affirmed the order as to the third dismissed petition, and remanded for further proceedings in the juvenile court. W.R. successfully petitioned for review from this court's decision. The Supreme Court vacated our decision and transferred the cause back to us for reconsideration in light of Assembly Bill No. 529. Thus, W.R.'s appeal is still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   W.R. argues the current version of section 786, subdivision (e) applies to him because it is an ameliorative statute susceptible of an inference of retroactivity.
