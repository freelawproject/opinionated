Chavez and Gonzalez appeal judgments following their jury convictions of second degree murder ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a) ). On appeal, Chavez contends: (1) the trial court erred by admitting an eyewitness's in-court identification of him that was the result of an unduly suggestive pretrial identification procedure; (2) the court erred by improperly limiting the scope of opinion testimony by his eyewitness identification expert; (3) there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction of second degree murder; and (4) the court erred by instructing with CALCRIM No. 571 on imperfect self-defense or imperfect defense of another but omitting imperfect defense of Gonzalez. Gonzalez joins in Chavez's contentions and also contends: (1) the trial court erred by instructing with CALCRIM No. 3471 on the right of self-defense but omitting language stating that an aggressor who initially uses only nondeadly force regains the right to self-defense when his or her opponent counters with deadly force; (2) the court erred by instructing with CALCRIM No. 3472, but not modifying it with language stating that a person who provokes a fight with an intent to use nondeadly force regains the right to self-defense when his or her opponent counters with deadly force; and (3) the court abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 by admitting the testimony of an eyewitness regarding the death threat he (Gonzalez) made to dissuade that eyewitness from testifying at trial, and also abused its discretion by denying his motion for mistrial. Chavez joins in Gonzalez's contentions. After the parties submitted their briefs in this case, Gonzalez filed a supplemental brief arguing that we should: (1) conclude the provisions\n   of 2017 Senate Bill No. 620, effective January 1, 2018, apply retroactively to judgments not yet final; and (2) remand the matter for resentencing to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion to strike or dismiss the section 12022.53 firearm enhancement. Based on our reasoning\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , we remand the matter for resentencing Gonzalez to allow the trial court to consider whether to exercise its discretion to strike the section 12022.53, subdivision (h) enhancement under section 1385. In all other respects, the judgments are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 17, 2014, the Rincon Del Mar restaurant in National City was filled with customers, many of whom were there to watch the World Cup\n   soccer match between Mexico and Brazil. There was one group of customers with ties to Tijuana, including Gonzalez, Chavez, Alfonso Vasquez, Vincente Roldan, and brothers Vicente Gutierrez (Vicente) and Rafael Gutierrez (Rafael). Another group of customers had ties to National City, including Josue Crook, Edward (also known as Eddie) Lopez, Jesus Morfin, Anthony Aguilar, Tomas (also known as Tommy) Lujan, and Enrique Chavez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the match, Rafael argued with Morfin in front of the restaurant about whether he had a problem with his brother Vicente. When Morfin approached Vicente, Vicente punched him in the face, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. Vicente and Rafael beat Morfin while he was unconscious on the ground. Meanwhile, Gonzalez hit Aguilar in the face, causing him to fall unconscious onto Lujan who had been standing nearby. While on the ground, Lujan was punched by Gonzalez. Lujan escaped by crawling under a flatbed truck that was parked on the street directly in front of the restaurant. When Lujan tried to get out from under the truck, Gonzalez kicked him in the face. From under the truck, Lujan saw Gonzalez pacing back and forth, holding a pistol by his side. During the fight, Gonzalez and Chavez at times were back-to-back and then face-to-face. Other members of the two groups also began fighting with each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Juan Carlos Lopez, the restaurant's owner, broke up the initial physical altercation, the combatants moved away from the restaurant. Rafael and Vicente ran southward as Eddie Lopez chased them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Eddie Lopez was about 15 feet away from them, he threw a beer bottle at them, possibly striking one of them, and then ran back toward the restaurant. While Eddie Lopez was running after them, Gonzalez ran in Eddie Lopez's direction and, from a distance, pointed a gun at his back. Crook, who had just come out of the restaurant, and Lujan approached Gonzalez from behind and Crook tapped him on the shoulder. Gonzalez spun around and shot Crook twice at point-blank range, striking him in the chest near his armpit and in the upper right side of his back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Immediately before being shot, Crook put up his hands and began turning away from Gonzalez. Except for possibly a plastic cup, Crook did not have anything in his hands at the time and no weapons were found on or near him. Gonzalez then pointed his gun at Lujan, but Juan Carlos Lopez intervened and begged him not to shoot. Crook died from his gunshot injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While Eddie Lopez was running away from the Gutierrez brothers, he saw Chavez\n   chasing after him with a knife in his hand. However, immediately\n   after Gonzalez shot Crook, Chavez stopped his chase and ran eastward with Gonzalez. Chavez and Gonzalez got into a black truck and fled the scene. Remaining at the scene, Eddie Lopez felt his shirt was wet and then realized he had been stabbed in the back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gonzalez was arrested in Mexico and extradited to the United States. Police searched Chavez's house and found two folding knives and clothing matching what he was seen wearing on the day of the shooting. Juan Carlos Lopez told police the restaurant's surveillance camera was inoperable because a car crashed into the restaurant two to three weeks before the shooting. However, police searched the restaurant and found a flash drive containing a five- to seven-minute video recording from one of its surveillance cameras, which recording showed, inter alia, the initial physical altercation between the two group's members and Crook placing an object on the flatbed truck and then picking it back up before the shooting. During a police interview, Juan Carlos Lopez admitted he initially lied about not seeing who shot Crook because he feared retaliation. Cell phone records showed there were 12 calls between Gonzalez's phone and Chavez's phone on the day of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An information charged Gonzalez and Chavez with the murder of Crook ( \u00a7 187, subd. (a) ) and the assault on Eddie Lopez with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1) ). It also alleged that Gonzalez committed the murder while out of custody on bail pending a final judgment for a prior felony offense (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (b) ), personally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d) ), and had served three prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the joint trial of Gonzalez and Chavez, the prosecution presented evidence substantially as described\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   . In his defense, Gonzalez presented, inter alia, the testimony of Roldan, who stated he was hit during the fight and knocked to the ground. Roldan did not see either Gonzalez or Chavez attack or shoot anyone. In his defense, Chavez presented the testimony of Scott Fraser, an eyewitness identification expert, who testified generally about how alcohol, memory convergence, and stress could result in an eyewitness's faulty memory. The jury found Gonzalez and Chavez guilty on both counts and found true the firearm allegation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court sentenced Gonzalez to an indeterminate term of 40 years to life in prison plus a consecutive\n   determinate term of seven years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sentenced Chavez\n   to an indeterminate term of 15 years to life in prison plus a consecutive determinate term of two years. Gonzalez and Chavez each timely filed a notice of appeal challenging the judgments against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Admission of Eddie Lopez's Identification of Chavez\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Chavez contends, and Gonzalez joins in his contention, that the trial court erred by admitting Eddie Lopez's in-court identification of him (Chavez) as the man who stabbed him. In particular, Chavez argues Eddie Lopez's in-court identification was the result of a pretrial identification procedure that was unduly suggestive and that pretrial identification was unreliable under the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before trial, Chavez filed an in limine motion to exclude evidence of Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification of him as the man who stabbed him in the back. Noting that during a pretrial interview with police Eddie Lopez described his attacker as wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans and the police detective showed him only his (Chavez's) photograph, he argued Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification was unduly suggestive and should be excluded because there were at least two people wearing red shirts and blue jeans. He also argued the photograph shown Eddie Lopez depicted him (Chavez) holding something in his hand, which made the pretrial identification more suggestive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The prosecutor opposed the motion, arguing Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification was not unduly suggestive and was reliable based on the totality of the circumstances. The prosecutor described the circumstances of that pretrial identification. On June 25, 2014, eight days after the incident, National City Police Detectives Depascale and Ballardo interviewed Eddie Lopez at the\n   National City Police Department. When shown various photographs taken about the time of the incident, Eddie Lopez recognized and/or identified many of the persons shown in the photographs. Eddie Lopez then described his assailant, stating: \"There was another guy, a fat, short guy in a red t-shirt and blue jeans. He's the one who stabbed me.\" Eddie Lopez stated he did not see his assailant until he turned around and saw his assailant with a knife. Detective Ballardo left the room and returned with one photograph, which he placed in front of Eddie Lopez without saying anything. Eddie Lopez immediately stated: \"[T]hat's him, that's the guy who stabbed me.\" He did not identify the person shown in the photograph as Chavez by name, but only as the man who stabbed him. The prosecutor argued Eddie Lopez's identification of Chavez, as shown in the photograph, was not unduly suggestive because he had been shown other photographs before instantly identifying the photograph depicting Chavez in a red T-shirt and blue jeans as his assailant. The prosecutor also argued the fact that the photograph showed Chavez holding something in his hand did not make the pretrial identification unduly suggestive or unreliable because Eddie Lopez immediately identified the man in the red T-shirt and blue jeans (i.e., Chavez) as his assailant before having sufficient time to closely examine the photograph and see that the man had something in his hand. The prosecutor conceded there was another man at\n   the restaurant that day, but that man (Maurice Lopez) was wearing white shorts and not blue jeans. Also, the prosecutor noted that during a July 10, 2014 interview with police Chavez identified himself as the man depicted in surveillance camera photographs wearing the red shirt. Accordingly, the prosecutor argued the evidence of Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification of Chavez should be admitted in evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the hearing on Chavez's motion, counsel repeated the arguments they made in their papers. Chavez argued he did not want Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification of him to be admitted as a \"backhanded\" identification even though the prosecutor apparently planned to have Eddie Lopez identify him (Chavez) as his assailant at trial. The trial court commented: \"So really the issue is whether that identification impacts [Eddie] Lopez['s] identification of Mr. Chavez at trial.\" The court denied the motion, finding there was nothing unduly suggestive about the pretrial identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At trial, Eddie Lopez testified regarding the incident and, in particular, described the man he saw running after him holding a knife. He described the man as \"[j]ust a little heavyset, red t-shirt, blue jeans.\" From a distance of about 10 feet, he saw the man holding a knife with a blade that was \"maybe a couple of inches long.\" When shown the surveillance camera photograph of Chavez, Eddie Lopez stated it \"looks like the guy that was running behind me\" and confirmed it was a fair and accurate photograph of that man. He thought he remembered telling the man to put the knife down. When asked whether he saw that man in court, Eddie Lopez stated: \"I'm not sure. I mean\n   I just remember the clothing and I remember that.\" When shown the video recording from the restaurant's surveillance camera, Eddie Lopez stated that he recognized the man in the red shirt and blue jeans shown in the recording. On cross-examination, Eddie Lopez stated he did not know the name of the man shown wearing the red shirt and blue jeans. On redirect examination, he confirmed the only person he saw with a knife was the man wearing the red shirt. He could not say whether that man had stabbed him, but he saw that man behind him with a knife in his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Detective Depascale testified at trial and stated he and Detective Ballardo had spoken with Eddie Lopez on about June 25, 2014, at the police station. He stated they did not show Eddie Lopez the video recording from the surveillance camera, but had shown him about five still photographs from that recording. On cross-examination, Chavez's counsel asked Depascale: \"When [Eddie] Lopez identified the man in the red shirt, isn't it true that Detective Ybarra [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] came in and showed him a picture, correct?\" Depascale replied, \"Yes, came in and placed a picture on the interview room table.\" Chavez's counsel asked: \"And the picture only had the man in the red shirt on it, correct?\" Depascale replied, \"No, sir.\" Chavez's counsel then asked Depascale questions about a still photograph (exh. No. 14) that had been taken from the surveillance video recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"In order to determine whether the admission of identification evidence violates a defendant's constitutional right to due process of law, we consider (1) whether the identification procedure was unduly suggestive and unnecessary, and, if so, (2) whether the identification itself was nevertheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances, taking into account such factors as the opportunity of the witness to view the suspect at the time of the offense, the witness's degree of attention at the time of the offense, the accuracy of his or\n   her prior description of the suspect, the level of certainty demonstrated at the time of the identification, and the lapse of time between the offense and the identification.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Chavez therefore argues the trial court erred by admitting Eddie Lopez's in-court identification of him (Chavez) as his assailant, which identification was the result of, or tainted by, his pretrial identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, based on our independent review of the record, we conclude that the pretrial identification procedure used by the detectives was not unduly\n   suggestive and Eddie Lopez's identification of the photograph depicting the man who attacked him (i.e., Chavez) during that procedure was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During their pretrial interview of Eddie Lopez, the detectives first questioned him and ascertained his detailed version of events before showing him photographs of various persons from the restaurant's surveillance camera video recording. After not recognizing any of those persons as his assailant, Eddie Lopez stated: \"There was another guy, a fat, short guy in a red t-shirt and blue jeans. He's the one who stabbed me.\" Detective Ballardo left the room and returned with a single photograph depicting a man wearing a red shirt and blue jeans (i.e., Chavez, per his own subsequent admission to police) obtained from the surveillance camera video recording. Without saying anything, Ballardo placed the photograph in front of Eddie Lopez, who immediately stated: \"[T]hat's him, that's the guy who stabbed me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although single photograph lineups may be suggestive and not the preferred identification procedure, we cannot conclude Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification of Chavez was\n   <em>\n    unduly\n   </em>\n   suggestive in the circumstances of this case. The detectives did not present Eddie Lopez with just one photograph during their interview, but showed him a number of photographs before he spontaneously described his assailant to them. Given that description, Ballardo obtained a still photograph of a man matching that description from the restaurant's surveillance camera video recording. The photograph did not bear any markings or titles and Ballardo did not make any statement when he placed it in front of him. Without hesitation, Eddie Lopez identified the man depicted in the photograph as his assailant. Although that identification procedure was suggestive, it was not unduly suggestive. Ballardo simply presented Eddie Lopez with a photograph from the surveillance camera video recording of a man that matched his description of his assailant and did not expressly or implicitly attempt to persuade Eddie Lopez to identify that man as his assailant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Assuming arguendo that pretrial identification procedure was unduly suggestive, we nevertheless conclude Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification of the man in the photograph (i.e., Chavez) was reliable under the totality of the circumstances. Most importantly, the man wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans depicted in the photograph was the only person shown in the surveillance camera video recording before or during the incident who was wearing that type of clothing.

He also had an excellent opportunity to view his assailant at the time. He turned around and faced him from a distance of only 10 feet and asked him to put the knife down. He viewed the man long enough to remember what he was wearing (i.e., red T-shirt and blue jeans) and his body type (i.e., fat and short). His pretrial identification of the man in the photograph as his assailant was made only eight days after the attack. Finally, the immediacy and certainty of his pretrial identification of the man depicted in the photograph as his assailant supports the reliability of his identification. Based on our consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude Eddie Lopez's pretrial identification of the man depicted in the photograph as his assailant (i.e., the man who chased him with a knife) was reliable.

The prosecutor objected to the enlarged scope of the expert's testimony, referring to \"the last couple of sentences of the first paragraph, that he be offered to testify about situations in which witnesses misperceive a harmless object to be a lethal weapon and provide an opinion about the discrepancies in Mr. Lujan's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] testimony regarding his purported knife wound and his contradictory statement at trial. I think that this is again going a little bit a foul of the jury's [province] and determination of a witness's credibility....\" The court agreed, stating: \"I don't know how he's going to comment on anybody's testimony.\" Chavez's counsel then stated that he planned to use hypotheticals. He stated that until the previous night he did not know the depth of his expert's knowledge. The prosecutor again stated the expert's expected testimony was \"dangerously coming close to opining about the credibility of a specific witness, given the way that this particular letter is written.\" The court indicated that an Evidence Code section 402 hearing may be needed to ascertain exactly what the expert's testimony would be, stating: \"[b]ecause a general statement ... that somebody can see something take it as a weapon when it's not, I'm not sure that's [a] subject appropriate for expert testimony. The fact that a witness's statement might conflict with something that he said before, again I don't see that that's [a] subject [for] expert testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Chavez's counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Just to clarify, the intent is for Dr. Fraser to explain that these witnesses are not untruthful, they are not fabricating\n   evidence, but there are certain processes in the brain that occur after witnessing a traumatic event, which he can explain ... what the cause of the discrepancies is; that these people are not lying, they are not disingenuous, they have suffered whatever memory decay, conscious transference, misperception, post-observational influences. And these are all things that affect the memory retention after a traumatic event. And that is what he is going to testify to explain to the jury why the inconsistent stories, based on scientific research, and explain why they may happen based on hypotheticals.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"Well, I wouldn't allow a hypothetical.

After the prosecutor expressed concern regarding the court's use of the term \"reliability,\" the court agreed and clarified what it meant to say was that \"if [Fraser] has studies concerning brain chemistry, that kind of thing about people in traumatic situations, he may testify as to that.\" The court stated it would not allow expert testimony \"as to reliability of witnesses, but [would as to] brain chemistry changes, things like that if there are appropriate studies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Chavez's counsel then proffered what type of hypothetical question he would pose to Fraser, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[M]y hypothetical would have just listed individual A, alleged victim; individual B, his friend; individual D, the defendant.

However, the record on appeal does not support that premise. Based on our reading of the trial court's ruling, quoted\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , it is clear the court excluded only expert testimony, whether directly or hypothetically, on how a traumatic event or other psychological factors affected a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   witness's memory or the reliability of that witness's identification. The court stated that it would not allow Fraser \"\n   <em>\n    to comment on specific evidence\n   </em>\n   \" or to comment on discrepancies in a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   witness's identification, whether by hypothetical questions or otherwise. (Italics added.) The court noted it was the jury's function, and not the expert's function, to decide whether there were discrepancies in a specific witness's identification or other statements. The court restated its ruling, explaining it would allow expert testimony on eyewitness identifications generally (e.g., on the effect of traumatic events generally), but would not allow Fraser to \"\n   <em>\n    comment\n   </em>\n   [ ]\n   <em>\n    hypothetically or otherwise on specific witness's testimony\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) Accordingly, contrary to Chavez's assertion, the court did not exclude\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   expert testimony on the issues of fight or flight, conscious transference, memory decay, and confluences, or from using\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   hypothetical questions to explain those concepts. Rather, the court excluded such expert testimony to the extent it commented on, whether directly or indirectly, on a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   witness's identification or other statements or testimony. In so doing, the court did not abuse its discretion. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    People v.

First, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Chavez aided and abetted Gonzalez's assault with a deadly weapon or assault likely to cause great bodily injury. As the physical altercation began between members of the National City and Tijuana groups, the surveillance camera video recording shows Chavez holding an object in his hand. Based on Eddie Lopez's testimony that Chavez later chased him with a knife, the jury could reasonably infer the object in Chavez's hand was a knife. During the fight, Gonzalez and Chavez are seen back-to-back and then face-to-face near the flatbed truck. Gonzalez and Chavez are then seen pacing back and forth next to the truck. Lujan, who was under the truck at the time, testified he saw Gonzalez holding a gun at his side while pacing back and forth. The jury could reasonably infer that Chavez saw Gonzalez's gun while pacing back and forth with him. As the initial physical altercation ended and members of the groups headed southward from the restaurant, Eddie Lopez chased the Gutierrez brothers holding a beer bottle in his hand. Gonzalez and Chavez also headed in that direction. Gonzalez pointed his gun at Eddie Lopez's back, while Chavez chased him (Eddie Lopez) holding a knife. Based on that evidence, the jury could reasonably infer Gonzalez and Chavez were acting\n   together, that Gonzalez committed\n   an assault with a deadly weapon on Eddie Lopez or assault likely to cause great bodily injury on Eddie Lopez, and that Chavez intended to, and did, aid and abet that assault. Alternatively stated, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Chavez knew of Gonzalez's unlawful purpose (i.e., intent to commit an assault with a deadly weapon or assault likely to cause great bodily injury) and specifically intended to, and did in fact, aid, facilitate, promote, encourage, or instigate Gonzalez's commission of that assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( CALCRIM No. 401.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Second, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that the murder of Crook was a natural and probable consequence of the assault on Eddie Lopez that Chavez aided and abetted.

However, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the object Crook was possibly holding at the time he tapped Gonzalez on the shoulder was, or appeared to be, a glass goblet or other glass object. Rather, the evidence supports, at most, a finding Crook was holding a plastic cup at the time he tapped Gonzalez on the shoulder from behind. The surveillance camera video recording, and still photographs taken therefrom, show Crook leaving the restaurant, placing a drink container on the flatbed truck, pushing past Juan Carlos Lopez, and then picking the container back up and heading southward out of the camera's view. Crook and Lujan approached Gonzalez, who was pointing his gun at Eddie Lopez's back, from behind and Crook tapped him (Gonzalez) on the shoulder. Gonzalez spun around and shot Crook twice at point-blank range, striking him in the chest near his armpit and in the upper right side of his back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   At trial, Juan Carlos Lopez identified the drink container that Crook placed on the flatbed truck and later picked up as a plastic michelada cup. As the restaurant's owner, Juan Carlos Lopez had served\n   those drinks almost every day and the cups used were frosted plastic and had a red rim (apparently from chili powder). Although there was testimony that Crook had a shrimp cocktail earlier that evening, the container held by Crook prior to the shooting, as shown in the video recording and still photographs and as identified by Juan Carlos Lopez, was a plastic michelada cup and not the type of glass shrimp cocktail container used by the restaurant. Juan Carlos Lopez described the type of container in which the restaurant served shrimp cocktails as glass with a big base, stem, and wide bowl or cup on top of the stem and weighing about three pounds. He estimated the width of its base as about three and one-half inches and its top bowl or cup as about five inches. He testified it \"takes probably two hands to grab it. You can carry it with one, but the size of it is probably about that big [apparently gesturing with his hands].\" He testified that the restaurant's plastic michelada cup and its glass shrimp cocktail cups looked \"completely different.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Our independent review of the video recording and still photographs therefrom confirms that the object that Crook placed on the flatbed truck and later picked up before heading southward could not reasonably be believed to be one of the restaurant's shrimp cocktail glasses. Its sides are straight, slightly angling inward from top to bottom (i.e., a slight cone shape with a flat bottom). Its shape is entirely inconsistent with the shape of the restaurant's shrimp cocktail glass, as described by Juan Carlos Lopez, which we interpret, for lack of a better description, as having a top-heavy hourglass shape (i.e., curving or undulating sides) with a narrow stem in the middle. The object held by Crook appears to be frosted and contains a dark liquid. Juan Carlos Lopez testified that it was plastic (i.e., not glass), describing it as a plastic michelada cup, which looks completely different from a shrimp cocktail glass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Based on all of the evidence in the record, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that Crook was, or appeared to be, holding a heavy, three-pound shrimp cocktail glass when he approached Gonzalez from behind and tapped him on the shoulder. Accordingly, there likewise is insufficient evidence to support a finding that Chavez saw Crook approach Gonzalez from behind with such a heavy glass object and actually believed Gonzalez was in imminent danger of being struck by that glass object and being killed or suffering great bodily injury. Absent substantial evidence to support that finding, the trial court did not err by not modifying CALCRIM No. 571 to include Chavez's defense of Gonzalez in its instruction on imperfect defense of another.

However, contrary to Gonzalez's assertion, substantial evidence did not support the bracketed language the court omitted from CALCRIM No. 3471. The main premise of Gonzalez's argument is that there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Crook used, or appeared to use, deadly force (i.e., a heavy glass object) against him, but the only substantial evidence of a heavy glass object was regarding the beer bottle thrown by Eddie Lopez at the Gutierrez brothers. That bottle was not thrown at or toward Gonzalez, but was instead thrown in the opposite direction by Eddie Lopez, and Gonzalez was not charged with the murder of Eddie Lopez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Nevertheless, Gonzalez argues there is substantial evidence to support a finding that the object possibly held by Crook when he (Crook) tapped him on the shoulder was, in fact, a heavy glass object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   However, as we discussed in part IV(C)\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   and which discussion we incorporate herein, the evidence admitted at trial (including the video recording and still photographs from the surveillance camera and Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony) does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   support a finding that Crook picked up a glass object off of the flatbed truck before heading toward Gonzalez. Instead, he, at most, picked up a plastic michelada cup before heading toward Gonzalez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   At trial, Juan Carlos Lopez, as discussed in section IV(C)\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , described the restaurant's plastic michelada cups and its glass shrimp cocktail cups and\n   stated they looked \"completely different.\" Likewise, as discussed in section IV(C)\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , our independent review of the video recording and still photographs therefrom confirms that the object that Crook placed on the flatbed truck and later picked up before heading southward could not reasonably be found to be one of the restaurant's shrimp cocktail glasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   We likewise reject Gonzalez's alternative argument that there is substantial evidence to support a finding the object possibly held by Crook, if not a shrimp cocktail glass, was instead a beer glass with a \"waist\" in its middle or other similarly shaped goblet or container made of glass and not a plastic michelada cup with straight sides. The evidence discussed\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with such a finding and instead supports a finding only that the object was a plastic michelada cup, which could not have posed to Gonzalez any real or perceived threat of imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. Gonzalez merely speculates that Crook may have been holding a heavy object made of glass when he approached Gonzalez from behind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   His suggested interpretation of the object on the flatbed truck shown in the video recording and still photographs from the surveillance camera is not supported by our independent viewing of that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Accordingly, based on our review of the record and relevant evidence, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that Crook was holding, or appeared to be holding, a heavy shrimp cocktail glass, glass goblet, or other object that appeared to be made of glass when he approached Gonzalez from behind and tapped him on the shoulder. Absent substantial evidence supporting such a finding, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding Gonzalez actually believed Crook posed an imminent danger of death or great bodily injury to him or others that would justify Gonzalez's use of perfect or imperfect self-defense by shooting Crook. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err by omitting the bracketed language from CALCRIM No. 3471, which would have allowed the jury to find Gonzalez regained his right to defend himself if, inter alia, it found Crook used, or appeared to use, deadly force against him.

Gonzalez's counsel asked the trial court to preclude the prosecution from presenting Martinez's testimony. The prosecutor stated she intended to offer Martinez's testimony as relevant to Gonzalez's consciousness of guilt based on his attempt to dissuade Juan Carlos Lopez from testifying. She made an offer of proof regarding Martinez's expected testimony, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   \"[W]hat happened is [Martinez] was in custody with Mr. Gonzalez April 16th or 20th[, 2015], the last time we were here....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   \"And what [Martinez] says is he and Mr. Gonzalez were chitchatting and it came about that they realized they both knew Juan Carlos Lopez.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \"At that time, Mr. Gonzalez told [Martinez] that could he get in touch with Mr. Lopez and basically tell him not to come to court, that he knew where he lived and where his children went to school and so forth, and then reiterated that he better not come to court and testify.

He replied, \"Yes.\" When she asked why he had such discomfort, Gonzalez's counsel objected on grounds of relevancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   At a sidebar conference outside of the jury's presence, Gonzalez's counsel stated he did not know \"exactly what [Juan Carlos\n   Lopez] is going to say. There were a lot of threats going back and forth.... He could say something so highly prejudicial and inflammatory that would result in a mistrial.\" The prosecutor made an offer of proof regarding how Juan Carlos Lopez was expected to testify, stating: \"[He] feels discomfort from both sides. He's expressed to police, I think in prior statements and certainly to me, that he feels pressure from the neighborhood, because everybody feels like since he's the person that knows everybody that he should be the one to provide information on the one hand. On the other hand,\n   <em>\n    he feels threatened by Mr. Gonzalez because of that phone call that we discussed earlier in our\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    motions in limine\n   </em>\n   .

[R]ight now it is not like he is going to say he heard it from Mr. Gonzalez.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The prosecutor stated that Juan Carlos Lopez had expressed fear of Gonzalez as a result of the threat that Martinez told him about. She stated: \"His boy, oldest boy goes to school with Mr. Gonzalez'[s] eldest daughter, and unbeknownst to him they are very good friends....\" Both Gonzalez's counsel and Chavez's counsel submitted on the matter, stating they needed to cross-examine Juan Carlos Lopez to show he was pressured to come up with a story.

I shouldn't have been surprised by the detail with which Mr. Lopez gave the conversation he had with his friend, but part of my ruling, besides what we already have on the record, was in anticipation that the person who actually made the call that was in the cell [i.e., Martinez] was going to come in and testify in detail, which is I think we had a conversation before [the] trial started, so that [Gonzalez's counsel] would have an opportunity to cross-examine him on any conversation with Mr. Gonzalez.\" Gonzalez's counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   \"I never imagined for a second that a hearsay statement of that nature, which can't be sanitized under any circumstances, because the prejudicial effect is so overwhelming, the probative value can certainly be minimized by the fact that he could say he got a threat not to testify and then, of course, [Martinez] can come in and talk about it and perhaps lay a better foundation. But ... it has such an explosive and prejudicial value to my client. It is clearly a hearsay\n   statement. There are other methods by which he could indicate what his state of mind was, but not something as explosive as that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Based on those concerns, Gonzalez's counsel moved for a mistrial. The court took the motion under submission and suggested that Gonzalez's counsel could file a written motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Gonzalez's counsel subsequently filed a written motion for mistrial, arguing Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony regarding Gonzalez's death threat was inadmissible hearsay and, in particular, should not have been admitted as relevant to Juan Carlos Lopez's then-existing state of mind. He also argued the trial court abused its discretion\n   under Evidence Code section 352 by admitting that testimony without an adequate limiting instruction and, in any event, no admonition or instruction to the jury could have cured the prejudice caused by Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony. Accordingly, he argued Gonzalez was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The prosecutor opposed the mistrial motion, arguing Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony (and Martinez's follow-up testimony) was highly relevant to his credibility because of his inconsistent statements about the incident and the shooter's identity, his initial denial that the video recording existed, his possible edits to that recording, and his change in demeanor when asked on direct examination who the shooter was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The trial court denied Gonzalez's motion for mistrial, stating that Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony was relevant to his credibility and to explain his \"strong physical reaction\" when on direct examination he identified Gonzalez as the shooter. The court acknowledged that when Juan Carlos Lopez testified about the details of Gonzalez's threat, the court was not anticipating that testimony but nevertheless knew about that threat because it was discussed before trial. The court referred to its admonition or limiting instruction and also stated Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony about Gonzalez's threat was not so prejudicial as to warrant a mistrial because Martinez was expected to testify regarding that threat anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The prosecution subsequently presented testimony by Martinez regarding the details of the death threat that Gonzalez asked him to, and he (Martinez) did, convey to Juan Carlos Lopez. In particular, Martinez testified that while they were in custody together, Gonzalez asked him to relay a message to Juan Carlos Lopez to not show up in court and that he (Juan Carlos Lopez) was being a \"snitch.\" Gonzalez told Martinez he knew Juan Carlos Lopez's family, knew where they lived, and where Juan Carlos Lopez's children went to high school, specifying it by name. Gonzalez stated he \"didn't want to kill them,\" so Juan Carlos Lopez should not come to court. Martinez later conveyed Gonzalez's threat to Juan Carlos Lopez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Gonzalez asserts the trial court abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 when it admitted the testimony of Juan Carlos Lopez regarding Gonzalez's death threat. In particular, he argues the court failed to exercise its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 and, in any event, no reasonable judge would have admitted that testimony without sanitizing its undue prejudicial effect. He argues the court's error violated his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial, requiring reversal of his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Evidence Code section 352 provides that a \"court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will ... (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.\" The term \"prejudice,\" within the meaning of Evidence Code section 352, is not simply damage to the defense that naturally flows from relevant and highly probative evidence, but is instead an emotional reaction that inflames the jurors' emotions, motivating them to have a bias against, or to prejudge, an individual based on evidence that has only slight probative value on the issues.

First, we reject Gonzalez's assertion that the court was uninformed and therefore could not, and did not, weigh the possible prejudicial effect of that testimony against its probative value under Evidence Code section 352. At the sidebar conference on Gonzalez's objection to Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony on why he was uncomfortable testifying in court, his counsel stated he did not know \"exactly what [Juan Carlos Lopez] is going to say. There were a lot of threats going back and forth.... He could say something so highly prejudicial and inflammatory that would result in a mistrial.\" In so doing, he implicitly raised the issue of whether Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony would be unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352 and objected to that testimony on that ground. The prosecutor then made an offer of proof that Juan Carlos Lopez was expected to testify, inter alia, regarding Gonzalez's threat against him that was conveyed by Martinez, who also was expected to testify regarding that threat as discussed before trial and whose testimony was tentatively ruled as admissible by the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court implicitly ruled the prosecutor could question Juan Carlos Lopez on the specifics of his discomfort in testifying, including Gonzalez's threat. In so doing, the court implicitly overruled Gonzalez's Evidence Code section 352 objection to Juan Carlos Lopez's expected testimony, including his testimony regarding Gonzalez's threat, presumably weighing the probative value of that expected testimony against its potential prejudicial effect and finding it was not unduly prejudicial.

Rather, the record shows the court understood and fulfilled its responsibilities under Evidence Code section 352. (\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 16 Cal.4th at p. 213,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20123\">\n    66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=940%20P.2d%20710\">\n    940 P.2d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) To the extent Gonzalez asserts the trial court did not exercise its Evidence Code section 352 discretion because it failed to conduct an Evidence Code section 402 hearing on the expected testimony of Juan Carlos Lopez and therefore lacked \"informed\" discretion, we disagree. Gonzalez does not cite any authority showing a court must conduct an Evidence Code section 402 hearing before it may exercise \"informed\" discretion under Evidence Code section 352 and admit certain potentially prejudicial testimony. Furthermore, although Gonzalez refers to the court's comment that it \"did not know how\" to conduct an Evidence Code section 402 hearing on a witness's expected\n   testimony, we presume the court was experienced in conducting Evidence Code section 402 hearings generally and therefore would have been able to conduct an appropriate Evidence Code section 402 hearing regarding the admissibility of Juan Carlos Lopez's expected testimony on Gonzalez's threat had Gonzalez's counsel requested one and/or had the court deemed such a hearing necessary or appropriate for it to exercise its Evidence Code section 352 discretion. In any event, the record supports an inference that the court found such a hearing was unnecessary, given the prosecutor's subsequent offer of proof that summarized Juan Carlos Lopez's expected testimony on Gonzalez's threat and other reasons for being uncomfortable with testifying in court, and exercised its Evidence Code section 352 discretion to admit that testimony. Although his testimony ultimately was in greater detail than that described by the prosecutor, the court nevertheless exercised its discretion by admitting that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Second, we reject Gonzalez's assertion that the trial court abused its Evidence Code section 352 discretion by admitting Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony regarding his (Gonzalez's) threat. The court could have found Juan Carlos Lopez's expected testimony was highly relevant to his state of mind and credibility regarding his description of the incident and identification of Gonzalez as the shooter. Evidence of threats against a witness or fears of retaliation for testifying is relevant to the witness's credibility. (\n   <em>\n    People v.

[Citations.] An explanation of the basis for the witness's fear is likewise relevant to her credibility and is well within the discretion of the trial court.\"].) In light of the inconsistencies in Juan Carlos Lopez's previous statements and possible involvement in hiding and/or editing the surveillance camera video recording and his distressed appearance while identifying Gonzalez in court as the shooter, the court reasonably concluded his testimony regarding the threat from Gonzalez was highly relevant to his state of mind and credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The court could also have found any prejudice from that expected testimony would not be undue because the prosecutor\n   planned to present similar testimony by Martinez regarding Gonzalez's threat, as discussed before trial. Contrary to Gonzalez's assertion, the expected testimony by Martinez regarding the threat did not necessarily make Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony regarding that threat unduly cumulative such that the court abused its discretion by admitting it. In particular, Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony was\n   distinctly relevant to show his state of mind and credibility, whereas Martinez's testimony was relevant to Gonzalez's consciousness of guilt as well as providing evidentiary support for Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony regarding Gonzalez's threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Furthermore, the trial court could have concluded any prejudice from the admission of Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony regarding Gonzalez's threat could be minimized by a limiting instruction or admonition. Weighing the highly probative value of the expected testimony of Juan Carlos Lopez regarding Gonzalez's threat against its potential prejudicial effect, the court could reasonably conclude that expected testimony was not unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352 and allow him to testify regarding Gonzalez's threat. In so doing, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion under Evidence Code section 352. To the extent Gonzalez argues the court should have \"sanitized\" Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony by limiting the details of the nature or extent of Gonzalez's threat or otherwise, we are not persuaded the court was required to do so in the circumstances of this case and the cases Gonzalez cites do not hold a trial court errs if it does not do so.

First, immediately after Juan Carlos Lopez began testifying about Gonzalez's threat in greater detail than the court expected, the court gave a limiting instruction to minimize any possible prejudicial effect. The court admonished the jury: \"I'm going to allow this information in ... for a limited purpose. It is not for the truth of really what was said. It is for the impact on the person that heard it. Whether the words were true or not, this is just for how Mr. Lopez reacted.\" Absent affirmative evidence in the record showing otherwise, we presume the jury followed the court's instruction and considered Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony regarding Gonzalez's threat only for its impact on him (i.e., his state of mind and credibility) and not for its truth (i.e., whether Gonzalez did, in fact, threaten him).

Unlike Juan Carlos Lopez's testimony regarding Gonzalez's threat, Martinez's testimony\n   regarding that threat was admitted for the truth of the matter asserted and was relevant to show Gonzalez's consciousness of guilt.

Although the court expressed its concern regarding his criminal history, his \"senseless\" shooting of Crook, and his use of a gun while he (Gonzalez) was out on bail on a previous gun charge, the court nevertheless exercised its sentencing discretion to impose a lower two-year term for his count 2 conviction\n   for assault with a deadly weapon rather than the upper four-year term recommended by the probation department. The court explained that it did not \"think that [it] is quite fair\" to impose on Gonzalez, as an aider and abettor of that offense, an upper four-year term when the probation department recommended only a lower two-year term for Chavez, who was the actual perpetrator of that offense. Contrary to the People's assertion, the court therefore did not impose the maximum sentence allowed under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Furthermore, the record does not contain any statement by the trial court indicating that it would have imposed the section 12022.53, subdivision (h) enhancement even if it had the discretion to strike or dismiss that enhancement at the time of Gonzalez's sentencing.

(See maj. opn., p. ----, fn. 21.) Thus, the majority treats the terms as the same for purposes of their analysis, and chooses to use the term \"inference.\" Superficially, this might lead to the conclusion we are in agreement that the use of inferences controls the outcome of the issue here. However, if I am correct, that the majority believes the terms are interchangeable, and an inference is a presumption, we are in stark disagreement. I choose to analyze the majority opinion as applying a \"presumption\" of retroactivity as does\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   and employ the definitions directed by the Evidence Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   \"A\n   <em>\n    presumption\n   </em>\n   is an assumption of a fact that the law\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   to be made from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established in an\n   action.

Thus, for me, the court's terminology marks an important clarification in the way\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   is to be applied, and avoids any conflict with section 3. Because, in light of\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   , it is now clear\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   simply recognized a permissible\n   <em>\n    evidentiary inference\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   expressly limits the reach of\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   ; it does not, as my colleagues suggest, expand\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   .

Rather, when, as here, a criminal defendant\n   argues he or she is entitled to the benefit of new legislation, we must begin with the\n   <em>\n    contrary\n   </em>\n   presumption, expressly set forth in section 3, that unless there is express language to the contrary, statutes are prospective only. If there is any ambiguity in the new enactment with respect to retroactivity, we then resolve that ambiguity by resort to familiar rules of statutory history and construction, including the\n   <em>\n    inference\n   </em>\n   found by the court in\n   <em>\n    Estrada, supra\n   </em>\n   , 63 Cal.2d at page 745,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"371\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20172\">\n    48 Cal.Rptr. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"372\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.2d%20948\">\n    408 P.2d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, provisions which give trial courts discretion to reduce a sentence previously required by the Penal Code are nonetheless changes which benefit offenders who committed particular offenses or engaged in particular conduct and, as in\n   <em>\n    Estrada,\n   </em>\n   manifest an intent by the Legislature that such offenders be given the benefit of that discretion in all cases which are not yet final.

By its express terms, this provision extends the benefits of SB 620 to defendants who have exhausted their rights to appeal and for whom a judgment of conviction has been entered but who have obtained collateral relief by way of a state or federal habeas proceeding. This extension of SB 620 is a further expression by the Legislature of its understanding that the new version of section 12022.53, subdivision (h) would also be applied to all cases which were not final at the time it became effective. It is difficult to perceive a rationale for giving relief to a defendant whose judgment might be several years old, but who was a successful habeas litigant and provide no relief to a defendant whose conviction was entered in a trial court as recently as December 29, 2017. We assume the Legislature was well aware of this unfair result if the statute was not retroactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   In sum, it is not necessary or legally sound to employ a presumption that is at odds with section 3. The Legislature, in enacting SB 620 has made it clear it intended and expected that its provisions would be applied to all cases pending at the time it became effective and, thus, it is outside the general rule set forth in\n   section 3.
