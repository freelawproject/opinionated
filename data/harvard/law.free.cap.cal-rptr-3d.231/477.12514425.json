The court denied the petition with regard to the violations of section 530.5.\n   Sanders appeals contending the offenses under section 530.5 must be deemed petty thefts since the amounts of money or merchandise taken in the burglaries (shoplifting) was less than $950.

Accordingly, we will reject Sanders's contention and affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   STATEMENT OF FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of the offenses are not in dispute and are taken from the probation officer's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is sufficient to note Sanders discovered a credit card on the ground. The card belonged to someone else. Sanders used the card to obtain cigarettes and a beverage at a 7-11 store. She also obtained cash at a Burger King restaurant. The total amount of charges made by Sanders on the credit card were $174.61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Simply put, Sanders contends that since the burglary charges have been reclassified as misdemeanor shoplifting and the amount of goods taken from the merchants was under $950, the section 530.5 violations must be considered as petty thefts and therefore must be reduced to misdemeanors and dismissed. As we will point out, even though section 530.5 violations are often referred to as \"identity theft,\" they are not theft offenses. Theft is not an element of the offense. The offense is not in the theft chapter (chapter 5) of the Penal Code, but is instead listed in chapter 8 dealing with false personation. The gravamen of the section 530.5, subdivision (a) offense is the unlawful use of a victim's identity. Moreover, as we will discuss, there were multiple victims in the offenses charged. The entry into commercial establishments to obtain property by false pretenses victimized the merchant, and not the cardholder. The cardholder is a victim because her identity was unlawfully used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Additionally, we will point out that section 530.5, subdivision (a) is not one of the listed offenses in section 1170.18 as being subject to reclassification. We will also note that section 473 (forgery) as revised in Proposition 47, specifically excludes cases where the person is convicted of both forgery and identity theft in section 530.5 from the $950 minimum threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A. Proposition 47\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Proposition 47 was approved by the voters in November 2014. The proposition reduced the punishment for a number of theft related offenses to misdemeanors where the requisite minimum dollar value of the items taken has not been proved. Additionally, section 1170.18, subdivision (a) creates a procedure which permits a previously convicted defendant to petition\n   the trial court for reclassification of the convicted offenses and for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Page,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513998\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/786/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   3 Cal.5th at pages 1181 to 1182,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513998\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/786/\">\n    225 Cal.Rptr.3d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513998\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/225/786/\">\n    406 P.3d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   summarized the pertinent portions of the reclassification provisions relevant to our analysis. The court said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Proposition 47's resentencing provision, section 1170.18, subdivision (a), provides, in pertinent part: 'A person who, on November 5, 2014, was serving a sentence for a conviction ... of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (\"this act\") had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with Sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the Health and Safety Code, or Section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the Penal Code, as those sections have been amended or added by this act.' The cited provisions include section 490.2, subdivision (a), added by Proposition 47, which provides in pertinent part: 'Notwithstanding [Penal Code] Section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($ 950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor ....' [\u00b6] Under these provisions, a person serving a sentence for grand theft under Penal Code section 487 or another statute expressly defining a form of grand theft (e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 484e, 487a, 487i ) is clearly eligible for resentencing under section 1170.18 if he or she can prove the value of the property taken was $ 950 or less. (See\n   <em>\n    People v. Romanowski\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513442\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/215/758/\">\n    2 Cal.5th 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910-914,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513442\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/215/758/\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513442\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/215/758/\">\n    391 P.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Romanowski\n   </em>\n   ) [defendant convicted for theft of access card information under Pen. Code, \u00a7 484e eligible for resentencing].)\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Also relevant here is that the proposition amended the forgery statute, section 473, to make forgeries misdemeanors unless the threshold amount of loss is more than $950. Subdivision (b) of section 473 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), any person who is guilty of forgery relating to a check, bond, bank bill,\n   note, cashier's check, traveler's check, or money order, where the value of the check, bond, bank bill, note, cashier's check, traveler's check, or money order does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), shall be punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, except that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 290.\n   <em>\n    This subdivision shall not be applicable to any person who is convicted both of forgery and of identity theft, as defined in Section 530.5.\n   </em>\n   \" (Italics added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the amended section where a defendant is convicted of both forgery and violation of section 530.5 the minimum dollar amount for felony classification does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, we find it significant that section 530.5 is not one of the listed offenses in section 1170.18 which is subject to the $950 loss limitation for felony sentencing. Although the absence of specific listing of the offense in section 1170.18 provides some guidance, we recognize our Supreme Court\n   has applied section 490.2 as created in Proposition 47 to nonlisted offenses.

The argument continues that at least where the victim's identity is used to obtain property from someone else, it should be treated as a theft offense subject to section 490.2. That predicate leads appellant to claim that when she used the victim's card to obtain property from a merchant by false pretenses, she committed shoplifting under section 459.5 and the use of the card must be treated as petty theft. The basic problem is appellant's acts of stealing from merchants do not amount to a theft from the cardholder. The cardholder was harmed by the unlawful use of her card and thefts from the merchants do not make the cardholder a victim of those thefts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Perhaps the confusion which arises in evaluating crimes under section 530.5 is the fact it is referred to as \"identity theft.\" As the court observed in\n   <em>\n    People v.

However, if the victim was initially unaware of the illicit transaction, the damage to the person's credit may be very difficult to repair. The perpetrator could commit other crimes by using the victim's identity, causing great harm to the victim.

It was an unlawful use, one of several unlawful uses set forth in the statute. To the extent there was a theft within the scope of the Proposition 47 limitations in section 490.2, it was against the property interest of the merchants who were defrauded by appellant's presentation of the card as belonging to her, a false pretense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The crime of shoplifting as defined in section 459.5 was the entry into a commercial establishment, during regular business hours with the intent to\n   commit theft of less than $950. The cardholder's property rights were not implicated by that offense,\n   but her identity was unlawfully used. Appellant has received the benefit of Proposition 47's recasting of certain forms of commercial burglary. She is not, however, entitled to have her nontheft offenses of violating section 530.5, subdivision (a) reclassified under Proposition 47.
