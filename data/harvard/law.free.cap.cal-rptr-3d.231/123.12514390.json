After the buyer sued the manufacturer for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (the Act) ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 1790 et seq. ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties entered into a confidential settlement leaving attorney's fees and costs unresolved, and the buyer moved for attorney's fees as the \"prevailing party\" under the Act. This appeal chiefly presents the question: Is a buyer a prevailing party entitled to recover attorney's fees under the Act if, through settlement with the manufacturer, all she obtains by litigating is the payment of dealer add-ons for which the manufacturer is not responsible and the payment of attorney's fees? We conclude the answer is \"no.\" For these reasons and others, we affirm the denial of attorney's fees but modify the judgment to award costs because the buyer obtained a net monetary recovery by virtue of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In April 2015, plaintiff Efigenia Garcia (Garcia) bought a Mercedes-Benz GLA250W4 at Keyes European, an authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer. Garcia paid $46,593.97, comprised of a $8,540 down payment and a loan for the balance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The $46,593.97 amount included the cost of the car and $3,090 in dealer add-ons (namely, $1,700 for Mercedes-Benz tires and wheels, $995 for Ownerguard protection, and $395 for a third-party surface protection product).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A month later, the car's engine \"failed entirely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Soon thereafter, Garcia contacted defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (Mercedes-Benz), and Mercedes-Benz offered to repurchase the car. Before Mercedes-Benz laid out the details of the repurchase, Garcia hired an attorney. Mercedes-Benz sent a follow-up email, explaining that it would repurchase Garcia's car for the amount she paid the manufacturer, but would not reimburse her for dealer add-ons (or $18.99 in interest on those add-ons) or pay any attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A few days after receiving Mercedes-Benz's more detailed offer, Garcia sued Mercedes-Benz in a single-count complaint alleging breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, but which made additional allegations regarding the breach of an express warranty and sought relief only available for a breach of implied and express warranties. Pursuant to the Act, Garcia sought a refund of the full purchase price (including the amount paid to Mercedes-Benz for the car and the amount paid for the dealer add-ons), civil penalties of twice her actual damages, attorney's fees, and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Garcia did not sue the dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before and after Garcia filed her complaint, the parties tried to negotiate a settlement. Garcia demanded (1) that Mercedes-Benz take custody of the car, (2) refund her the amounts paid to the dealer as well as Mercedes-Benz, and (3) pay her attorney's fees, initially of $2,500 and subsequently of $4,020. Mercedes-Benz's pre-complaint offer eventually gave way to an offer to refund her\n   <em>\n    everything\n   </em>\n   (including the amounts paid for the dealer add-ons) and to pay either $1,000 in attorney's fees and costs or to leave them open for resolution by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties entered into a confidential settlement that did not disclose the settlement amount and left the issues of attorney's fees and costs for judicial resolution. Garcia surrendered the car, and was paid the confidential amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Garcia then filed a motion for $8,430 in attorney's fees as the prevailing party under the Act as well as a memorandum of costs seeking $750 in costs. After full briefing, the trial court issued a written order denying attorney's fees and costs. In denying attorney's fees, the court noted that Garcia's entitlement to attorney's fees under the Act turned on whether she was the prevailing party and thus had achieved her litigation objectives, but ruled that the confidentiality of the settlement made it impossible to know whether Garcia had, in fact, achieved those objectives by obtaining more in the settlement than Mercedes-Benz had offered her prior to the lawsuit. The court declined to award costs on the\n   ground that they could not be obtained by noticed motion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    All further statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The total sale amount was $49,546.88, which included the projected finance charges over the life of the automobile loan she took out. Because Garcia returned the car almost immediately after driving it off the lot, those charges were never incurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    We take judicial notice of the court file. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (c).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    A few weeks later, the trial court entered a judgment dismissing Garcia's lawsuit with prejudice. Garcia thereafter filed this timely appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Garcia argues that the trial court erred in denying her attorney's fees and costs. Mercedes-Benz asserts that we need not reach these questions because the trial court's denial order is not appealable. We address the appealability question first.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <strong>\n     I. Appealability\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Mercedes-Benz contends that we are without jurisdiction to entertain Garcia's appeal from the trial court's order denying attorney's fees and costs because it is an interim order prior to judgment that is outside our appellate jurisdiction. We independently review questions regarding our own jurisdiction. (\n    <em>\n     California Redevelopment Assn. v.

Where, as here, the party filed suit after receiving a settlement offer, we measure litigation objectives by reference to what that party sought to obtain by rejecting the last prelitigation offer. (\n    <em>\n     MacQuiddy\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 1048-1049,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=182%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20691\">\n     182 Cal.Rptr.3d 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [when buyer was offered all but civil penalty prior to litigation, buyer's litigation objective is obtaining civil penalty].) This focus dovetails neatly with the Act's overarching goal-namely, facilitating speedy and efficient refunds for (or exchanges of) \"lemons\" by giving manufacturers and retail sellers the incentives to make (and buyers the incentive to accept) offers that give buyers the remedies to which the Act entitles them. Thus, the question of whether a buyer is a prevailing party under the Act looks to what the buyer was last offered by the manufacturer or retail seller before filing suit and whether she achieved a greater result by the time of settlement or verdict. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 1049,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=182%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20691\">\n     182 Cal.Rptr.3d 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    We side with the decisions taking the more practical approach, and do so for two reasons. First, Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 provides on its face that its definition of prevailing party is meant to be \"used in this section,\" not as the universal default definition of the term. (Accord,\n    <em>\n     Galan v. Wolfriver Holding Corp.\n    </em>\n    (2000)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1103584\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/80/1124/#p1128\">\n     80 Cal.App.4th 1124\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1128,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20112\">\n     96 Cal.Rptr.2d 112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Heather Farms Homeowners Assn. v.

Second, importing Code of Civil Procedure section 1032's definition of prevailing party into the Act disserves the Act's purpose. As pertinent here, the Act is designed to facilitate timely refunds for defective new cars (and to discourage foot dragging by manufacturers and retail sellers). In so doing, the Act contemplates that buyers will\n    <em>\n     always\n    </em>\n    get a \"net monetary recovery.\" If that were enough by itself to qualify a buyer as a prevailing party (as it would be under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032's definition), a buyer would\n    <em>\n     always\n    </em>\n    be entitled to attorney's fees, even when the manufacturer or retail seller responds with alacrity to the buyer's demand for a refund. Always awarding attorney's fees is not the Act's purpose. (\n    <em>\n     Dominguez v. American Suzuki Motor Corp.\n    </em>\n    (2008)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3918222\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/160/53/#p60\">\n     160 Cal.App.4th 53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 60,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20354\">\n     72 Cal.Rptr.3d 354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Dominguez\n    </em>\n    ) [\"Based on a plain reading of the applicable statutory provisions, we cannot conclude the Legislature intended that every time a manufacturer repurchases or replaces consumer goods, a consumer is entitled to attorney fees\"].) Although adopting the pragmatic approach means that a buyer might be a prevailing party for one purpose (costs) but not another (attorney's fees), this outcome is of no moment. (E.g.,\n    <em>\n     McLarand, Vasquez &amp; Partners, Inc. v. Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn.\n    </em>\n    (1991)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4390573\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/231/1450/#p1456\">\n     231 Cal.App.3d 1450\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1456,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20828\">\n     282 Cal.Rptr. 828\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"reject[ing] the contention that the prevailing party for the\n    award of costs under section 1032 is necessarily the prevailing party for the award of attorney['s] fees\"].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The buyer bears the burden of showing that she prevailed.

Garcia purchased the add-ons from the dealer, not Mercedes-Benz. Except as to foodstuffs, a plaintiff seeking to recover for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability must prove privity with the breaching party. (\n    <em>\n     Burr v.

As to the dealer add-ons, Garcia's privity is with the dealer-not Mercedes-Benz.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Act itself reinforces this conclusion. To begin, the Act recognizes that manufacturers and retail sellers (that is, dealers) are distinct entities. (Compare \u00a7 1791, subd. (j) [defining \"[m]anufacturer\"] with \u00a7 1791, subd. (\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    ) [defining \"[r]etail seller\"].) Further, by granting only retail sellers the right to seek indemnity from manufacturers for any amounts they pay a buyer for breach of the implied warranty (\u00a7 1792), the Act (1) reinforces that each entity is only to pay for its share of the buyer's loss, and (2) by negative implication affirms that manufacturers do not have a reciprocal right to seek indemnification from retail sellers for any amounts\n    <em>\n     the manufacturers\n    </em>\n    pay on retail sellers' behalf for a breach of the implied warranty. (\n    <em>\n     Spicer v. City of Camarillo\n    </em>\n    (2011)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233613\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/195/1423/#p1427\">\n     195 Cal.App.4th 1423\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1427,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20357\">\n     125 Cal.Rptr.3d 357\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"a statute may express the law by 'negative implication' \"].) Yet Garcia is asking Mercedes-Benz to pay for the dealer's breach. Lastly, the Act affirmatively states that manufacturers are not required to refund buyers for the cost of \"nonmanufacturer items installed by a dealer\" (that is dealer add-ons) when the buyer sues for breach of an\n    <em>\n     express\n    </em>\n    warranty. (\u00a7 1793.2 subd. (d)(2)(B).) This statutory carve-out for dealer add-ons would be largely nullified if we were to conclude that buyers had a right to make manufacturers pay for dealer add-ons under an implied warranty theory; all a buyer would have to do is restate her breach of express warranty claim as a breach of implied warranty claim, something that could be done in every case in which the defect is one that tenders the new car \"[un]fit for the ordinary purposes for which [cars] are used\" (thereby breaching the implied warranty) (\u00a7 1791.1, subd. (a)(2) because such a defect necessarily renders the car \"nonconforming\" (thereby breaching any express warranty) (\u00a7 1793.2, subd. (c)). We must avoid rulings that nullify statutes in whole or in part. (\n    <em>\n     Elder v. Carlisle Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    (1987)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230876\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/193/1313/#p1319\">\n     193 Cal.App.3d 1313\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1319,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20897\">\n     238 Cal.Rptr. 897\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"In construing a statute, a court should ... avoid an interpretation that would effectively nullify a portion of the statute\"].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Garcia assails two of the above stated reasons for concluding that a buyer cannot, under the Act, sue the manufacturer for a refund of goods and services purchased from the dealer. First, she argues that the Act does not\n    require privity. To be sure, there is language in a few cases stating that \"under the Act, the buyer can sue 'the manufacturer' for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability despite a lack of privity.\" (\n    <em>\n     Mega RV Corp. v.

But this language stands for the unremarkable and statutorily compelled conclusion that a buyer may always sue the manufacturer for breach of the implied warranty under the Act irrespective of the buyer's privity with the manufacturer. (\n    <em>\n     Mega RV\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1333,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20861\">\n     170 Cal.Rptr.3d 861\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [buyer may sue manufacturer for defects in component parts integrated into a vehicle];\n    <em>\n     Gusse\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1116 [buyer may sue manufacturer for car obtained from dealer]; see generally\n    <em>\n     Mega RV\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1333,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20861\">\n     170 Cal.Rptr.3d 861\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"The Act protects purchasers of consumer goods by requiring specified implied warranties [and] placing strict limitations on how and when a manufacturer may disclaim those implied warranties\"].) This language does not stand for the much broader proposition that privity does not matter\n    <em>\n     at all\n    </em>\n    under the Act. To the contrary, and as explained above, the Act expressly treats manufacturers and retail sellers as distinct entities and consequently does not allow a buyer to sue a manufacturer for the retail seller's breach of an implied warranty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Second, Garcia asserts that we need not be concerned that buyers will always do \"end runs\" around the statutory carve out for dealer add-ons that applies to an express warranty by recasting their claims as breaches of an implied warranty because buyers may seek a refund or a replacement vehicle (and may sue for the failure to provide such) under an express warranty theory only if the manufacturer is first given a reasonable opportunity to repair the vehicle.

But this precursor requirement establishes, at best, that not all implied warranty claims can be restated as express warranty claims.

A buyer can be a prevailing party under the Act if she incurs attorney's fees after rejecting a settlement on terms the law does not require or permit.

However, a buyer\n    is not a prevailing party under the Act just because she incurs attorney's fees to obtain relief beyond that to which she is entitled. In such a case, the manufacturer or retail seller is paying more than it is legally required to pay just to end the litigation. Were the buyer who extracts such a \"nuisance value\" as part of a settlement to be rewarded with attorney's fees (by being declared a prevailing party), we would be acting in derogation of the true purpose of the Act's attorney's fees provision (which, as noted above, is to remove the disincentive buyers might face when deciding whether to hire a lawyer to enforce their rights under the Act (\n    <em>\n     Wohlgemuth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1262,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=144%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20545\">\n     144 Cal.Rptr.3d 545\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) ) as well as creating a perverse incentive for buyers to continue litigating in the hopes of obtaining a nuisance value that would entitle them to attorney's fees as well (see\n    <em>\n     Cowan v. Superior Court\n    </em>\n    (1996)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"341415\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/14/367/#p392\">\n     14 Cal.4th 367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 392,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20458\">\n     58 Cal.Rptr.2d 458\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=926%20P.2d%20438\">\n     926 P.2d 438\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"A rule that creates ... a perverse set of incentives is untenable\"] ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    We are cognizant that our conclusion that a buyer is not a prevailing party under the Act's attorney's fees provision just because she convinces the manufacturer to pay for products and services supplied by the retail seller means that a buyer will not have a right to obtain a\n    <em>\n     full\n    </em>\n    refund for all outlay associated with her new defective car from a single party. And we recognize that a \"one-stop\" remedy for buyers may make good sense, especially when the buyer in most cases purchased the car as part of a \"one-stop\" shopping experience with the dealer. However, we are not free to disregard the Act's plain language to implement what might be otherwise good public policy; that task lies solely with our Legislature.

In this case, however, substantial evidence supports the trial court's finding that the confidential nature of the settlement precluded Garcia from showing whether she achieved that litigation objective. We know the parties' prelitigation positions and that Garcia obtained\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    monetary recovery (a point the parties concede), but we do not know the exact terms they ultimately agreed to. The trial court's refusal to infer the parties' ultimate settlement terms from their final volley of a non-confidential settlement letter was reasonable, and we must indulge all reasonable inferences when evaluating a ruling for substantial evidence. (\n    <em>\n     Crawford v. Southern Pacific Co.\n    </em>\n    (1935)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2241952\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/3/427/#p429\">\n     3 Cal.2d 427\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 429,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20P.2d%20183\">\n     45 P.2d 183\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) Although settlements that make their financial terms confidential will in most cases render it impossible to determine whether the buyer prevailed in obtaining her litigation objective(s) (and thus effectively foreclose any award of attorney's fees to the prevailing buyer), the Act specifically contemplates that a buyer and manufacturer or retail seller may effect a settlement that is confidential as to its \"financial terms.\" (\u00a7 1793.26, subd. (c).) As long as the Act sanctions such confidential settlements, buyers may effectively surrender their right to collect attorney's fees under the Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    c. Attorney's fees\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Where, as here, the trial court\n    <em>\n     could not\n    </em>\n    have found Garcia to be a prevailing party because Mercedes-Benz refunded\n    the dealer add-ons and\n    <em>\n     did not\n    </em>\n    find that Garcia prevailed because she obtained a civil penalty, the trial court also did not abuse its discretion in declining to find Garcia to be a prevailing party just because she may have obtained the sole remaining litigation objective-namely, an agreement to pay attorney's fees in whatever amount the trial court deemed appropriate. The Act rewards a buyer who prevails with an award of attorney's fees. (\u00a7 1794, subd. (d).) If a buyer's decision to hold out for attorney's fees were enough by itself to confer prevailing party status upon that buyer, then all a buyer would have to do to obtain attorney's fees is refuse to accept any settlement that did not offer attorney's fees and then sue for these fees. This is circular, because the buyer's entitlement to attorney's fees would make her a prevailing party and hence entitled to attorney's fees. It would also make attorney's fees available in just about every case, a result courts have soundly rejected.

(\u00a7 1794, subd. (d).) As noted above, the Act does not define what it means to be prevailing party. Fortunately, also as noted above, our Legislature has defined what the term means in the context of costs in Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, making it unnecessary for us to resort to the judicially developed definition of prevailing party we used, above, to assess attorney's fees. Under section 1032, a prevailing party includes a \"party\" who obtains \"a net monetary recovery.\" ( Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1032, subd. (a)(4).) Our Supreme Court recently clarified that \"a partial recovery, as long as it is a net monetary recovery, entitles a plaintiff to costs.\" (\n    <em>\n     DeSaulles\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454537\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/62/1140/#p1157\">\n     62 Cal.4th 1140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at p. 1157,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20429\">\n     202 Cal.Rptr.3d 429\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=370%20P.3d%20996\">\n     370 P.3d 996\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) Because Garcia obtained\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    net monetary recovery in her settlement with Mercedes-Benz (albeit of unknown amount), she is entitled to costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The trial court declined to award costs on the ground that Garcia submitted a\n    <em>\n     motion\n    </em>\n    for costs rather than a memorandum for costs, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1). The court's ruling overlooked that Garcia submitted a memorandum of costs along with her motion for attorney's fees. Although Garcia's memorandum was filed\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    judgment was entered (rather than after, as the Rules of Court contemplate), this is of no significance.
