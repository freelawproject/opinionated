Each of the challenged ordinances provide that the fees shall be paid by developers into an affordable housing trust fund, utilized by the municipality to satisfy its <em>ML Laurel II </em>obligation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the issue raised is whether or not such ordinances have been authorized by the Legislature under the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1, <em>et seq., </em>the Fair Housing Act (Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:270-301, <em>et seq., </em>or the municipality\u2019s general police power, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2. We must also determine whether an ordinance requiring a mandatory set-aside of affordable units as a condition to residential subdivision approval must provide for a compensating benefit, by density bonus or other zoning incentive.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The four ordinances challenged here were adopted by the Townships of Chester, South Brunswick, Middletown and Holmdel. In separate actions, each trial court declared the ordinance before it facially invalid, each holding that the ordinance constituted a revenue-raising device which had no legislative authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Although the issues raised by these consolidated appeals are similar, it is necessary to describe briefly the components of each ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">CHESTER TOWNSHIP ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Chester Township\u2019s ordinance imposes a development fee on all new commercial and residential construction, except develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ments which provide low or moderate-income housing. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy is conditioned upon payment of the fee. The fee is paid into a fund designed to (1) provide technical assistance to small lot owners to encourage them to construct low-cost housing; (2) permit the township itself to develop low-cost housing; (3) aid the township in managing low-cost housing programs, and (4) provide for grants, subsidies or loans in satisfaction of its <em>Mt. Laurel II </em>obligation. The amount of the fee varies depending upon the size of the project, ranging from 25c to 75c per square foot of the unit or units being constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Plaintiff in the Chester litigation, New Jersey Builders Association, is a trade organization consisting of more than 2,500 residential and commercial developers doing business statewide. Prior to commencement of the action, Chester Township had collected over $200,000 in fees from plaintiff\u2019s members. Plaintiff has cross-appealed the order of the trial court dismissing its demand for a refund on behalf of its owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">SOUTH BRUNSWICK TOWNSHIP ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">South Brunswick\u2019s ordinance also imposes a development fee on all new residential and nonresidential development, with exceptions not here pertinent. The fee must be paid as a condition to subdivision or site plan approval, and is computed based on square footage, ranging from 10c to 15c per square foot for residential development, and 25c to 50c per square foot for nonresidential development. The declared purpose of the ordinance was to receive contributions into a fund to permit rehabilitation of substandard housing by the municipality in order to provide its fair share of affordable housing. Plaintiff is an association of developers and owners of nonresidential property doing business throughout the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"AYV\">Middletown\u2019s ordinance provides that all new major residential subdivision and site plan applications must set aside 7% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>of the development\u2019s total dwelling units for lower income housing. On tracts other than those zoned specifically for inclusionary development, a developer may make a cash contribution to the affordable housing trust fund in lieu of constructing the affordable units. All nonresidential developers are required to pay a development fee into the fund. For residential construction, the fee. ranges from 80c to $1.80 per square foot, depending upon total gross floor area. The nonresidential development fee is based on a complex formula, using various \u201ccoefficients.\u201d The intended purpose of the ordinance is to permit the township to participate in regional contribution agreements, offer grants for the rehabilitation of existing structures and allow the township itself to build affordable housing. Plaintiff is a contract purchaser of a large tract of land situate within the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">HOLMDEL TOWNSHIP ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Prior to 1986, the residentially-zoned land in Holmdel designated R-40A permitted a maximum density of .8 dwelling units per acre. In 1986, the governing body passed on first reading an amendment to the ordinance, creating an R-40B zone, affecting specific parcels originally zoned R-40A. The R-40B zone downgraded density from .8 to .4 units per acre. However, developers were given the option of building at a density of .6 units per acre by agreeing to pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the sales price of the residential units into the municipality\u2019s housing trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Various property owners filed a statutory protest against the zoning change. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-63. Also, the planning board had various technical objections to the ordinance. Nevertheless, the governing body adopted the ordinance in December 1986 and plaintiff, an association of property owners and builders, responded by filing the present action. Plaintiff not only challenged the development fee, it also asserted that the reduction in density from .8 to .4 units per acre was not a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>exercise of the zoning power, and that the ordinance was adopted in a procedurally improper manner. The trial court essentially invalidated all of the ordinance, concluding first that the development fee was an invalid revenue-raising device, and second that reducing density and then permitting a density increase upon payment of a development fee constituted an abuse of the township\u2019s zoning power. The court characterized Holmdel\u2019s actions as a \u201cmunicipal slight-of-hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The challenged ordinances were adopted in response to our Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements in <em>So. Burl. Cty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Tp. of Mt. Laurel, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>151, 174 (1975), app. dis. <em>sub. nom. Township of Mount Laurel v. Southern Burlington County NAACP, et al., </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>808, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>18, 46 L.Ed.2d 28 (1975) <em>(Mt. Laurel I) </em>and <em>Mt. Laurel II, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 260-261 that municipalities must adopt land use regulations which create a realistic opportunity for the construction of low and moderate income housing. <em>Mt. Laurel II </em>set forth a number of techniques available to municipalities in order to meet their obligation, including removing cost-generating restrictions not essential to the general welfare, obtaining available governmental subsidies, and utilizing incentive zoning and mandatory set-asides. 92 <em>N.J. </em>265-270. The court held that use of such inelusionary devices \u201ckeyed to the construction of lower income housing, are constitutional and within the zoning power of a municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271. The court also provided for a \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278-281.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In response to <em>Mt. Laurel II, </em>the Legislature passed the Fair Housing Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301, <em>et seq. </em>The act creates the Council On Affordable Housing (COAH), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-305, and charges it with the responsibility of determining the State\u2019s need for low-cost housing and assigning a specific \u201cfair share\u201d number to each municipality. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307. <em>See also generally Hills Dev. Co. v. Bernards Tp. in Somerset Cty., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>1, 21-23 (1986). The Act sets forth a number of permissible zoning techniques available to municipalities to meet their fair share, including \u201c[r]ezoning for densities neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>sary to assure the economic viability of any inclusionary developments, either through mandatory set-asides or density bonuses[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-311a(l). A municipality may, but need not, use municipal revenues to provide its fair share of low-cost housing. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-311a(8) and 52:27D-311d.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The defendant municipalities and Public Advocate contend that the development fee ordinances are sustainable because they are the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d to the mandatory set-aside recognized by <em>Mt. Laurel II </em>and the act, and thus a valid land use regulation. Defendants argue that since developers may be required to build lower income units as a condition to subdivision or site plan approval, they may also be required to pay the cash equivalent to the municipality for rehabilitation or construction of low-cost housing by the municipality itself. As authority for this proposition, defendants point to the following language in <em>Mt. Laurel II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">[W]e in no way intend our list [of inelusionary zoning devices] to be exhaustive; municipalities and trial courts aro encouraged to create other devices and methods for meeting fair share obligations. [92 <em>N.J. </em>at 265-266].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Recently, our Supreme Court in <em>N.J. Bldrs. Ass\u2019n v. Bernards Tp., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>223, 230-232 (1987) recognized the nationwide trend toward imposing exactions upon developers, including \u201cimpact fees\u201d for the construction of public capital improvements, as well as \u201clinkage\u201d ordinances that condition the right to develop on construction of or contribution to the cost of low and moderate-income housing. The court observed that most cases considering the validity of such exactions \u201cdo so in the context of the underlying statutes that set forth the powers of local governments in reviewing subdivision and development applications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-234. <em>See also </em>4 Anderson, <em>American Law of Zoning </em>(2d ed. 1977), \u00a7 23.40 at 145; and <em>see </em>Smith, \u201cFrom Subdivision Improvement Requirements to Community Benefit Assessments and Linkage Payments: A Brief History of Land Development Exactions,\u201d 50 <em>Law and Contemporary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Problems </em>5, 10 (Winter 1987) (\u201c[a]bsent free-wheeling home rule authority, express or implied statutory authority is crucial to the validity of an exaction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In New Jersey it is well-settled that a municipality is \u201cbut a creature of the State, capable of exercising only those powers granted to it by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Moyant v. Paramus, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>528, 535 (1959); <em>see also Dome Realty, Inc. v. Paterson, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>212, 225 (1980). A municipality has no revenue-raising power, including the power of taxation, without an explicit constitutional or legislative grant. <em>Moyant v. Paramus, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 543; <em>Daniels v. Point Pleasant, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>357, 360-361 (1957). The power to originate a tax for revenue is vested in the Legislature. <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. IV, \u00a7 VI, par. 1; <em>see also Atlantic City Casino Hotel v. Casino Control Com\u2019n., </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 236 (App.Div.), certif. den. 102 <em>N.J. </em>326 (1985). Property must be assessed for taxation under general laws and by uniform rules. <em>N.J. Const, supra, </em>Art. VIII, \u00a7 I, par. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In <em>Daniels v. Point Pleasant, supra, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>at 362, the Supreme Court held that although a municipality has the power under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>40:48-1 to meet the construction of buildings and charge license fees to meet incidental costs, it cannot employ its regulatory power for the sole purpose of raising revenue \u201cto defray the general cost of government____\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">Admittedly, the purpose of the ordinance was to raise revenue to defray the increased cost of school and other government services. The philosophy of this ordinance is that the tax rate of the borough should remain the same and the new people coming into the municipality should bear the burden of the increased costs of their presence. This is so totally contrary to tax philosophy as to require it to be stricken down; <em>see Gilbert v. Town of Irvington, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>432 (1956). <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Similarly, in <em>West Park Ave., Inc. v. Ocean Tp., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>122 (1966), municipal officials conditioned the issuance of building permite and certificates of occupancy upon the developer agreeing to pay to the board of education $300 per house to be placed in a trust fund for capital improvement of the township\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>schools. <em>Id. </em>at 124-125. The court held that while the Legislature authorized the municipality to require the developer to install improvements peculiarly benefiting the land being developed <em>(see N.J.S.A. </em>40:55-1.21, now repealed), it had no statutory authority to pay for governmental services traditionally supported by general taxation by the exaction of such fees. 48 <em>N.J. </em>at 126-127. The court observed that \u201c[t]he dollar burden would likely be unequal if new homes were subjected to a charge in addition to the general tax rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Recently, in <em>Nunziato v. Edgewater Planning Bd., </em>225 <em>N.J. Super. </em>124, 133-134 (App.Div.1988), we struck down a \u201cvoluntary\u201d fee paid by the developer of a high-rise condominium of $500 per unit as a condition to variance and site plan approvals. We concluded that such exactions must be supported by enabling legislation and local ordinance, with appropriate standards to prevent arbitrary, \u201cfree-wheeling bidding\u201d for development approvals. <em>Id. </em>at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In view of the foregoing case law authority, we share the view expressed by each of the trial courts that mandatory development fee ordinances are nothing more than revenue-raising devices which have no legislative authority. As such, particularly in view of their compulsory nature, <em>see Gross v. Ocean Tp., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 150 (App.Div.1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds 92 <em>N.J. </em>539 (1983), the development fees constitute an illegal tax imposed upon a discrete group of landowners and taxpayers for the single purpose of satisfying a general municipal obligation to provide a realistic opportunity for affordable housing. As in <em>West Park Ave., </em>the developer of new construction suffers a double tax: first, the development fee itself, representing a \u201cprice\u201d to build within the municipality, and second, the general property tax imposed upon the newly developed land, also available for use to defray the cost of the municipality\u2019s community-wide <em>Mt. Laurel </em>obligation. <em>See </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>at 126-127. This shifting of a public responsibility to a limited segment of the community is not only without legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>tive authority, it also violates the rule of uniform taxation established by our State constitution. <em>See N.J. Const., supra, </em>Art. VIII, \u00a7 I, par. 1. It would be highly inequitable to tax but a small segment of the community, current and future builders, rather than all property owners, to remedy the municipality\u2019s prior default in providing for inclusionary housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We do not share defendants\u2019 view that the development fee is \u201cfunctionally equivalent\u201d to the mandatory set-aside technique recognized by <em>Mt. Laurel II. Mt. Laurel II </em>held that \u201cinclusionary devices such as density bonuses and mandatory set-asides keyed to the construction of lower income housing, are constitutional and within the zoning power of a municipality.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 271. Citing <em>Taxpayers Assn. of Weymouth Tp. v. Weymouth Tp., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>6 (1976), app. dis. <em>sub. nom. Feldman, et al. v. Weymouth Township, et al, </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>977, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1672, 52 L.Ed.2d 373 (1977), the court concluded that if a zoning ordinance restricting a particular district exclusively for mobile homes for the elderly is sustainable as a valid land use regulation, it follows that the \u201ccomparable special need of lower income families for housing, and its impact on the general welfare,\u201d could justify a land use restriction creating a zone that included such use. <em>Mt. Laurel II, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 272. The court rejected as \u201cartificial\u201d the distinction between the regulation tied to the physical use of property and the one tied to the income level of those who use the property. <em>Id. </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">What is clear from <em>Mt. Laurel II </em>is that a mandatory set-aside is valid because it advances the general welfare by regulating land use. However, we do not read the decision as embracing a pure revenue-raising device as valid land use regulation, even if the revenue raised will be utilized for the construction or rehabilitation of low-cost housing. Zoning ordinances adopted under the MLUL must bear a real and substantial relationship to the regulation of land, advance a statutory purpose of zoning, and advance the authorized purpose \u201cin a manner permitted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>State v. C.I.B. International, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>262, 271-272 (1980). A mandatory development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>fee applied indiscriminately as a price to build within the municipality has no \u201creal and substantial relationship to the regulation of land,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 271, nor does it advance a purpose of zoning \u201cin a manner permitted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Alternatively, the municipalities argue that the Fair Housing Act provides the necessary authority for the development fee. They point to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-311a(8), which states that a municipality\u2019s housing element may include \u201c[Utilization of municipally generated funds toward the construction of low and moderate income housing,\u201d and reason that the development fees provide these \u201cmunicipally generated funds.\u201d The problem with this argument is that the statute speaks only to the <em>utilization </em>of such funds; it does not address how municipalities may <em>raise </em>the funds. Our courts have demanded far more specificity than this before finding that the Legislature has given a municipality the power to raise revenue. <em>See Salomon v. Jersey City, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>379 (1953); <em>cf. Divan Builders v. Planning Bd. Tp. of Wayne, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>582, 596-597 (1975) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>40:55-1.21, now repealed, sufficiently specific to empower municipalities to demand off-site improvements as condition to subdivision approval). We believe that, in view of the potentially far-reaching source of revenue that could be generated from such mandatory development fees, the Legislature would have specifically authorized such fees if it so intended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Beyond the question of whether the development fee ordinances are statutorily sanctioned, we do not read <em>Mt. Lau</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>re\u00ed II </em>or the Fair Housing Act as intending to burden current and future builders with the full obligation to solve the affordable housing crisis. To be sustainable, a development fee ordinance must provide some compensating benefit to a new developer since it is paid as an alternative to the assumption of other <em>Mt. Laurel </em>obligations. In <em>Mt. Laurel I, </em>the Supreme Court held that a developing municipality \u201cmust, by its land use regulations, presumptively make <em>realistically possible </em>an appropriate variety and choice of housing.\u201d 67 <em>N.J. </em>at 174 [emphasis supplied]. <em>Mt. Laurel II </em>held that the \u201cconstitutional basis for the <em>Mt. Laurel </em>doctrine remains the same.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 208. Land use regulations that do not provide \u201cthe requisite opportunity\u201d for a fair share of the region\u2019s needs for low and moderate income housing conflict with the general welfare and violate the State constitutional requirement of substantial due process and equal protection. <em>Ibid; see also Hills Dev. Co. v. Bernards Tp. in Somerset Cty., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Mt. Laurel II </em>suggests that techniques such as density bonuses and mandatory set-asides are essential because of the economic reality that \u201c[satisfaction of the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine cannot depend on the inclination of developers to help the poor. It has to depend on affirmative <em>inducements </em>to make the opportunity real.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 261 [emphasis supplied]. In other words, \u201c[f]or an opportunity to be \u2018realistic\u2019 it must be one that is at least sensible for someone to use.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Fair Housing Act codified this concept by permitting the inclusion in a municipality\u2019s housing element \u201c[r]ezoning for densities necessary to assure the <em>economic viability </em>of any inclusionary developments, either through mandatory set-asides or density bonuses, as may be necessary to meet all or part of the municipality\u2019s fair share[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-311a(l) [emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We agree with plaintiffs that the intent of both <em>Mt. Laurel II </em>and the Fair Housing Act is that mandatory set-asides must be accompanied by density bonuses in order to compensate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>developer for the cost of constructing the <em>Mt. Laurel </em>housing. Without such benefits, developers have no economic incentive to build such housing, and thus no \u201crealistic opportunity\u201d is offered by the ordinance to satisfy the municipalities\u2019 <em>Mt. Laurel </em>obligation. As Judge Skillman explained in <em>Van Dalen v. Washington Tp., supra, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 339:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">The theory of mandatory set-asides without subsidization is that the requirement will be accompanied by higher-density zoning than normally would be permitted. Such higher-density zoning permits a developer to construct more units and thereby to cover any shortfall between what lower income households can afford and the real costs of construction. In effect, an increase in permitted densities generates any subsidies necessary for lower income housing, without cost either to the developer or non-lower income residents of the development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\"><em>See also </em>Mallach, \u201cAtlantic City, the Casinos, and the Mount Laurel II Decision,\u201d 15 <em>Rutgers Law Journal, </em>695, 719 (Spring 1984) (\u201c[i]f the full <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligation is imposed on developers, the full array of feasible cost-reduction activities, subsidies, and other supports should be provided to the developer on whose shoulders the <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligation is being placed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\"><em>N.J. Bldrs. Ass\u2019n. v. Bernards Tp., supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>223, while not directly on point, is instructive. There the question was whether an ordinance requiring new developers to pay their pro-rata share of the township\u2019s long-term road improvement plan exceeded the township\u2019s authority conferred by <em>N.J. S.A. </em>40:55D-42. <em>Id. </em>at 224. That statute permits a governing body to adopt an ordinance conditioning site plan or subdivision approval upon the developer paying \u201chis pro-rata share\u201d of the cost of off-site improvements, which are \u201cnecessitated or required by construction or improvements within such subdivision or development.\u201d Pre-MLUL decisions, codified by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-42, held that a developer may be compelled to pay only \u201cthat portion of the cost which bears a rational nexus to the needs created by, and benefits conferred upon, the subdivision.\u201d <em>Longridge Builders, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Princeton Tp., </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>348, 350 (1968); <em>see also Divan Builders v. Planning Bd. Tp. of Wayne, supra, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>at 600; <em>Brazer v. Borough of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Mountainside, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>456 (1970). Beyond that, \u201c[planning [bjoard impositions ... amount to impermissible exactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466. Recognizing the pre-MLUL decisions, the court in <em>N.J. Bldrs. Ass\u2019n. v. Bernards Tp., </em>struck down the township\u2019s ordinance, interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-42 as limiting \u201cmunicipal authority only to improvements the need for which arose as a direct consequence of the particular subdivision or development under review.\u201d 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 237; <em>see also Baltica Const. v. Planning Bd., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 433 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Although <em>N.J. Bldrs. Ass\u2019n. v. Bernards Tp., </em>applies the \u201crational nexus\u201d test to off-site improvement exactions under a specific statute, the case underscores the fairness of requiring a rational or reasonable relationship in \u201cimpact fee\u201d and \u201clinkage\u201d ordinances between the exaction imposed and the benefit conferred, even when the exaction has legislative sanction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, it may be argued that for the exaction imposed here, there is an even more compelling reason to provide a compensating benefit to the developer: the \u201cneed\u201d for affordable housing is not \u201ccreated by\u201d the proposed development, at least if it is a residential subdivision. Rather, the need pre-existed the application, caused by a continued history of exclusionary zoning attributable to the municipality\u2019s zoning practice, not to the proposed subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The \u201crational nexus\u201d and \u201creasonable relationship\u201d tests have been applied by courts in other jurisdictions in examining the validity of \u201clinkage\u201d ordinances. In <em>Terminal Plaza v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>City &amp; Co. of San Francisco, </em>177 <em>Cal.App</em>.3d 892, 223 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>379 (Ct.App.1986), the court reviewed a San Francisco ordinance which prohibited conversion of residential hotel units to any other use unless the owner constructed a replacement unit, rehabilitated a similar unit, or paid a fee in lieu of satisfying this requirement to the city\u2019s residential preservation fund. The court concluded that the exaction was valid because of the reasonable relationship between the ordinance and the problem created by the developers in converting residential hotel units, otherwise available for affordable housing, to another use. <em>Id. </em>at 386-387. In <em>San Telmo Associates v. City of Seattle, </em>108 <em>Wash.2d </em>20, 735 P.2d 673, 675 (1987), an ordinance conditioning conversion of low-income housing to nonresidential use upon providing relocation assistance or paying an in lieu fee was declared an invalid \u201ctax,\u201d because it shifted the public responsibility of providing such housing to a limited segment of the population. <em>See also </em>Delaney, Gordon and Hess, \u201cThe Needs-Nexus Analysis: A Unified Test for Validating Subdivision Exactions, User Impact Fees and Linkage,\u201d 50 <em>Law and Contemporary Problems, supra, </em>at 148-153.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">CO AH itself has incorporated the requirement that a developer be given compensating benefits for mandatory set-asides. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-8.1, <em>et seq., </em>provides for adjustments to a municipality\u2019s fair share, and permits COAH to \u201cpresumptively require a 20 percent maximum set-aside and a minimum gross density of six units per acre on vacate and developable sites.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-8.4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All agreements involving single-family units that vary from these presumptive requirements may provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">... in exchange for an increase over existing density, the developer either: construct low and moderate income units as part of an inclusionary development; or pay a voluntary fee to be utilized by the municipality for an RCA or municipally constructed low and moderate income housing. <em>The developer\u2019s expense in either case must bear a reasonable relationship to the increase in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>density, suck that the agreement-does not violate the test in (d)l-3 above. [N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-8.4(e) <em>(effective </em>July 18, 1988); emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Subparagraphs (d)l-3 require all agreements: (1) to provide the requisite realistic opportunity for creation of low and moderate income units; (2) not to impose an excessive burden on the market units, giving due consideration to due process and equal protection rights, and (3) to assure the financial ability of the developers to perform the agreement. Thus, the very agency charged with the responsibility of implementing the Fair Housing Act has concluded that voluntary agreements must provide for compensating benefits for mandatory set-asides. While we are not bound by COAH\u2019s interpretation of the act, we should give substantial deference to the interpretation of the act by the agency charged with enforcing it. <em>See Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 25 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">We are not unmindful of our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Matter of Egg Harbor Associates (Bayshore Centre), </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>358 (1983), which sustained a mandatory set-aside of 20% affordable housing units as a condition to approval under the Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-1 to 21. The issue in <em>Egg Harbor </em>was whether the act authorized the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to condition CAFRA approval upon the construction of affordable housing within the proposed development. <em>Id. </em>at 361. The court found such authority existed on the theory that the Legislature had conferred broad powers in the DEP to regulate all land use in coastal areas. <em>Id. </em>at 372. It reasoned that since municipalities have the zoning power to create housing opportunities for the poor, it would \u201cmake no sense at all to hold\u201d that a State agency may not use such power. <em>Id. </em>at 367.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>In our view, <em>Egg Harbor </em>is not dispositive. There the emphasis was on the condition as a use restriction, not as an exaction. The court rejected the developer\u2019s claim that the condition was confiscatory because the developer had failed to demonstrate that building the development \u201cwill not return a profit or will return a profit so low as to amount to a taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. The court did not discuss the need for a rational nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">However, it can be concluded from the unique, highly intense use proposed by the <em>Egg Harbor </em>developer that compensating benefits were in fact conferred. The proposal included 1,530 residential units, a 500-room hotel, a 300-slip marina, a 22-sto-ry office building, and 4,200 parking spaces on a 127-acre tract. <em>Id. </em>at 362. The DEP concluded that \u201c[gjiven the magnitude and variety of uses proposed ...,\u201d a contribution by the project toward meeting the full range of housing needs in the municipality and region was justified. <em>Id. </em>at 363. We question whether the set-aside condition would have been sustainable if only 64 residential units, for example, had been proposed for the site, instead of the highly intense proposal actually submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that an ordinance which provides for a mandatory set-aside, and which also gives the developer a density bonus or other zoning incentive having a reasonable relationship to the cost incurred in constructing the mandatory set-aside housing, is sustainable. We also conclude that a <em>voluntary </em>provision for an \u201cin lieu\u201d development fee, paid into a fund for the construction of <em>ML Laurel </em>housing is sustainable, provided that the fee charged bears a reasonable relationship to the benefits conferred by the density bonus. Such a scheme not only advances <em>Mt. Laurel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>II\u2019&amp; </em>goal, it does so by regulating land use rather than by solely raising revenue. Also, absent in such a scheme is the compulsory nature of a tax, since the developer may either construct the mandatory set-aside units or pay a comparable \u201cin lieu\u201d fee. Of most importance is that such an ordinance makes it \u201crealistically possible\u201d for the developer to build the low-income units or pay the \u201cin lieu\u201d fee by off-setting the attendant cost with the construction of higher density, non-inclusionary units.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Applying the foregoing principles to the four ordinances challenged here, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">CHESTER AND SOUTH BRUNSWICK TOWNSHIPS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The Chester and South Brunswick ordinances impose a mandatory fee on all new residential and commercial development as a condition to the right to build. Imposition of the fee under both ordinances is unrelated to a particular parcel or particular district. Rather, it is imposed on all new development as a price for building within the municipality. As such, it is nothing more than a revenue-raising device which shifts the burden of providing affordable housing to a discrete segment of the population. Further, neither ordinance gives a reasonable compensating benefit to off-set the development fee expense. We therefore conclude that the ordinances are unlawful taxes, imposed without legislative sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">For the reasons expressed above, that portion of Middle-town\u2019s ordinance which imposes a mandatory development fee upon all nonresidential development is without- statutory authority and therefore invalid. Since residential developments are required to set aside 7% of the units for affordable housing or pay an \u201cin lieu\u201d development fee without receiving a reasonable density bonus or other zoning incentive in return, we conclude that that condition is also an impermissible exaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>HOLMDEL TOWNSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Holmdel\u2019s ordinance is distinguishable from the others. It focuses on a particular land use within a particular zoning district rather than on indiscriminate revenue raising. Also, the developer is entirely free to construct at a density of .4 units per acre without payment of a development fee. If the developer pays the fee, it is given a density bonus of .2 units per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Because of the voluntary nature of the ordinance and its compensating benefit, we do not agree with the trial court that the ordinance is facially invalid. In our view, a full factual inquiry is necessary to determine whether the voluntary development fee is reasonable. Without a factual record, we cannot determine, for example, whether it is rational to base the fee on a percentage of the total purchase price of the homes sold, nor can we determine whether the .2 unit density bonus reasonably compensates the developer for the exaction imposed. Finally, a factual inquiry is necessary to determine whether even the .6 unit density provides a \u201crealistic opportunity\u201d to satisfy Holmdel\u2019s <em>Mt. Laurel </em>obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Moreover, we are satisfied the trial court erred in holding, without a plenary hearing, that reduction in density from .8 to .4 units per acre was an abuse of zoning power. A zoning ordinance enjoys a presumption of validity, which may be overcome by a showing that the ordinance is \u201cclearly arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or plainly contrary to fundamental principles of zoning or the [zoning] statute.\u201d <em>Riggs v. Long Beach Tp., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>601, 611 (1988), quoting <em>Bow &amp; Arrow Manor v. Town of West Orange, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>335, 343 (1973). The party challenging the ordinance bears the burden of overcoming the presumption. <em>Kozesnik v. Montgomery Twp., </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>154, 167 (1957). If Holmdel downgraded the density and now permits upgrading simply as a guise to exact fees from the developer, the ordinance may indeed not have had a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>zoning purpose. Such a technique would be analogous to the rezoning of property for the single purpose of deflating its value prior to the municipality\u2019s condemnation of the property, a device held invalid in <em>Riggs v. Long Beach Tp., supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 615. However, an inquiry as to the municipality\u2019s intent, and whether the ordinance advances a valid purpose of zoning involve factual questions which can only be resolved following a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Accordingly, we remand to the Law Division for a plenary hearing respecting the validity of Holmdel\u2019s ordinance. At the remand hearing, the trial court shall also address plaintiff's contention that the governing body failed to comply with <em>N.J.S. A. </em>40:55D-62a in adopting the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">On New Jersey Builders Association\u2019s cross-appeal, it contends that the trial court erred in dismissing its demand for a refund of fees paid by its members under Chester Township\u2019s development fee ordinance. The trial court concluded that plaintiff lacked standing to assert the claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">A trade organization such as plaintiff may not assert its members individual damage claims. <em>See Mill Race Ltd. v. Mayor &amp; Tp. of Bernards, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>160, 166 (App.Div.1989); <em>see also Travel Agts. Malpractice v. Regal Cul. Soc., Inc., </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 190 (App.Div.), certif. den. 60 <em>N.J. </em>353 (1972). While plaintiff has a real interest in having the development fee ordinance declared invalid, the real parties in interest in collection of the fees are its individual members. The trial court properly dismissed this claim without prejudice to the rights of the individual members to seek return of the funds in separate actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-10\"><em>So.
