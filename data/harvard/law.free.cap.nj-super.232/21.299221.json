In accordance with the plea bargain, the State recommended concurrent probationary terms of five years on each conviction and the dismissal of numerous other charges then pending against defendant. The trial judge sentenced defendant to am aggregate term of five years probation and imposed an appropriate Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">In 1987, defendant was arrested on a robbery charge at which time he made an inculpatory statement to a law enforcement officer. A charge of probation violation was filed against him in February, 1987. Thereafter, a violation hearing was held before the trial judge who based his conclusion that defendant violated his probation on the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement and on the testimony of the officer as to the circumstances under which the statement was given. He then sentenced defendant on the original charges as follows: 1) ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>years, with parole ineligibility for five years, for robbery (Accusation 2623-10-86); 2) five years, with parole ineligibility for two and one-half years, for each of the counts of terroristic threats (for a total of ten years, with parole ineligibility for five years) (Accusations 2624-10-86 and 2626-10-86); 3) five years, with parole ineligibility for two and one-half years, for theft (Accusation 2625-10-86); and 4) ten years, with parole ineligibility for five years, for burglary (Accusation 2627-10-87). The sentences were to be served consecutively, except for the sentence for burglary, which was ordered to run concurrently with the robbery sentence. Defendant later entered a guilty plea to the charge of robbery which underpinned his probation violation and was sentenced to an extended term of thirty years, twelve and one-half without parole to be served concurrent with the sentence at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Defendant appeals, claiming that the following errors warrant reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">POINT I:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">THE COURT IMPROPERLY IMPOSED A PROBATION REVOCATION SINCE AT THE TIME OF ITS REVOCATION DEFENDANT HAD NOT BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF ANY OFFENSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">POINT II:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">THE SENTENCE IMPOSED ON DEFENDANT\u2019S PROBATION VIOLATION WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE, UNREASONABLE AND AN IMPROPER EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">In Point I, defendant maintains that the State is precluded from holding a revocation proceeding in a situation such as this. In support of this argument, he relies on <em>State v. Reyes, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 135 n. 2 (App.Div.1986), certif. den. 103 <em>N.J. </em>499 (1986) where we made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">If the charged violation is the commission of an offense for which defendant has not yet been tried, the issue of guilt or innocence of that offense is not normally tried in a summary hearing. Defendant may be committed without bail in the probation proceedings pending determination of the new criminal charge \u201cif there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed another offense or if he has been held to answer therefor____\u201d [citation omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The question presented here is not answered by <em>Reyes. </em>We are not faced with the issue of what is the better procedure in a case in which a violation of probation is based on the commission of a new offense. Clearly, in most cases, the most sensible, fair and expeditious procedure will be to await the outcome of the trial on the new criminal charges. <em>See Commentary, New Jersey Penal Code </em>(1971), Vol. II at 347. The question before us is a different one: is the State limited to abiding the event of a new criminal disposition or may a violation of probation hearing take place in advance of it. Our recent decision in <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261 (1989) laid this issue to rest. There we reaffirmed the proposition that the commission of a new offense also constitutes a failure to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of probation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3a(4). Thus, while under the statute, a probationer may be confined without bail pending disposition of criminal charges <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3a(3)), that is not the only available procedure. The court may alternatively proceed with a probation revocation hearing based upon the probationer\u2019s failure to comply with the probation condition requiring law-abiding conduct. <em>See State v. Garcia, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>334, 338 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v. Serio, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>394, 396 (Law Div.1979). Consequently, there is no warrant for our intervention with respect to the hearing of defendant\u2019s charged violation of probation in advance of the disposition of the criminal charges against him. This conclusion accords with the weight of authority from other jurisdictions which have analyzed the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>We have also evaluated defendant\u2019s claim as to the excessiveness of his sentence. In imposing the original sentence, the trial judge stated the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">In order to determine whether or not to accept the plea agreement, the court considered the nature and degree of the crime, the need for punishment and deterrence, the prospect for rehabilitation, the presentence report, the defendant\u2019s previous involvement with the criminal justice system, the recommendation of the prosecutor, the recommendation of the probation department, the terms of the plea agreement and the interest of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">While he expressed misgivings about the plea bargain, he imposed the negotiated five year probationary term.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">At the sentencing on the violation of probation, the judge indicated that he had erred at the original sentencing in rejecting the probation department\u2019s conclusion that defendant was not a suitable candidate for probation. He also stated that he had made a mistake when, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld, he originally allowed defendant to avoid the presumption of incarceration which his conviction for a second degree offense carried. We think that the judge\u2019s candid acknowledgement of error was relevant on the resentencing. This was not a case of the benefit of hindsight. Here, the judge failed to heed the probation department\u2019s in-depth analysis of defendant\u2019s character and record with its poor prognosis for non-custodial success and also neglected to conform to the statutory sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>scheme in the first instance. We thus have no difficulty with the theoretical imposition of a prison term on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Since defendant\u2019s sentencing on the violation of probation, the Supreme Court has enunciated standards for the use of a probation violation at a resentencing. In <em>State v. Baylass, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>169 (1989), the Court declared that while a probation violation may be used on the \u201cin-out\u201d decision whether to revoke probation and incarcerate a defendant, it is neither an aggravating factor nor evidence of such a factor. <em>See State v. Molina, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>181 (1989) (companion case to <em>State v. Baylass). </em>The Court went on to hold that a probation violation may, however, be used to diminish or negate mitigating factors such as defendant\u2019s ability to lead a law-abiding life, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(7); the unlikelihood that he will commit another offense, <em>8N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(9); and the likelihood that he will respond affirmatively to probation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(10). <em>Id. </em>For a defendant who has committed multiple offenses, the Court concluded that a probation violation may not be used to determine whether the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive. <em>Id. </em>at 331-332. Finally, the Court emphasized the need for a sentencing judge to identify and weigh aggravating and mitigating factors at both the original sentencing hearing and the probation violation hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Here, in resentencing defendant, among the reasons advanced by the trial judge for the increase from five years probation to twenty-five years in custody with a twelve and one-half year parole disqualifier were that the violation enhanced certain aggravating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">Need to punish, absolute need to punish this defendant for his criminal activity, because notwithstanding the fact that he got every benefit and afforded the opportunity to rehabilitate himself and prove to society that he was a meaningful member of society, he could not be trusted not to commit further criminal activity. In a short period of three months, he went out and committed the very same crime. So, there\u2019s an absolute need to punish him. There\u2019s a need to hopefully deter him from future criminal activity, there\u2019s a very substantial need to deter others who would follow in his footsteps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>These reasons clearly contravene <em>Baylass\u2019 </em>instruction as to the use of a probation violation on a resentencing and require reversal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In addition, in determining that defendant\u2019s sentences (with one exception) should be served consecutively, the trial judge violated both <em>Baylass </em>and <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 644 (1985) which prescribes that \u201cthere should be an overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses not to exceed the sum of the longest terms (including an extended term, if eligible) that could be imposed for the two most serious offenses.\u201d In imposing the sentence here, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">When we evaluate the need for consecutive sentencing, now, the court is ever mindful of <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>but also <em>Yarbough </em>indicates to us that a defendant should not receive the benefits of a free crime. This defendant has had numerous free crimes. And the time is coming and it has arrived when he will get no further free criminal activity. The court\u2019s clearly satisfied that there is a substantial need to make many of these sentences consecutive, because I\u2019m satisfied that the words of Judge Gruecio in the case of <em>State v. Mosch </em>[214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457 (App.Div.1986)] have application here. When he pointed out that under our system, one is punished \u2014 under our system, the punishment shall fit the crime. And this defendant has had his share of free crimes an it is now time for him to receive his just desserts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">He also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">And finally, giving <em>Yarbough </em>its due in the opinion of the court, recognizing, however, the sentence to this point has exceeded the maximum that could be imposed for the two most serious crimes that the defendant has been sentenced, but I did that consciously and objectively, because I feel the defendant should be adequately punished and that\u2019s the only way to do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">These statements, which boil down to the conclusion that the defendant \u201cdeserves\u201d a greater than <em>Yarbough </em>sentence, <em>are </em>no basis for disregarding the Supreme Court\u2019s standards. Moreover, to the extent that defendant\u2019s violation of probation was improperly considered as an aggravating factor enhancing his need for punishment, the rule of <em>Baylass </em>that a probation violation may not be used to determine whether sentences should be concurrent or consecutive was also violated. On the remand, defendant\u2019s exposure will be limited under <em>Yarbough </em>to the maximum terms imposable for two second degree of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>fenses, with maximum parole disqualifiers: twenty years, ten years without parole. This is not to suggest that this limit should be approached in the resentencing, only that as a matter of law it may not be exceeded absent a clear statement of justification by the trial judge which he has, as yet, failed to articulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\">For cases holding that a criminal conviction on a subsequent offense is not required before revoking probation so long as there is evidence of unlawful conduct, see <em>United States v.
