We affirmed in our opinion of August 8, 1988. Defendant petitioned for certification to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ordered that the matter be \u201csummarily remanded to the Appellate Division for clarification of its disposition of the \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 issues raised in defendant\u2019s letter to the Appellate Division dated March 24, 1988.\u201d 114 <em>N.J. </em>304 This court had inadvertently not considered the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d issues in its prior opinion. We requested of the parties and have received briefs on the remanded issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The essential facts are set forth in our August 8, 1988 opinion. Preliminarily, it is sufficient to state that defendant\u2019s conviction involved sexual assaults upon five-year old R.B. Approximately one or two weeks after the assaults, R.B. was taken to the hospital for a physical examination by two Division of Youth and Family Services workers. The child denied to the examining physician that she had been sexually abused. However, on the following day, Peggy Foster, a social worker at the hospital, discussed the incidents with R.B., and the child discussed and demonstrated the assaults by the use of anatomically correct dolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Defendant contends that Ms. Foster\u2019s testimony relating R.B.\u2019s statements about the assaults was erroneously admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>as \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony, citing <em>State v. J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247 (App.Div.), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>588 (1988). No objection was made before the trial court that Ms. Foster\u2019s testimony regarding R.B.\u2019s \u201cfresh complaint\u201d should not be permitted as it was the product of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The \u201cfresh complaint\u201d rule permits the introduction of evidence that the victim of a sexual assault complained of the proscribed act within a reasonable time after the act occurred to someone who she would normally turn to for sympathy, protection or advice. <em>State v. Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>331, 338 (1966), app. dism., <em>cert. </em>den. 388 <em>U.S. </em>461, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>2120, 18 L.Ed.2d 1321 (1967); <em>N.J. Youth &amp; Family Serv. Div. v. S.S., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>3, 8 (App.Div.), certif. den. 91 <em>N.J. </em>572 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In <em>State v. Kozarski, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12 (App.Div.), certif. den. 71 <em>N.J. </em>532 (1976), the defendant contended for the first time on appeal that the \u201ccomplaint\u201d of the infant victim of a sexual assault should not have been admitted under the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d rule, as it \u201cmay not have been a complaint at all, but may have been elicited under questioning by the mother.\u201d <em>Id. </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 17. The court did not decide the issue, as testimony of a different, unchallenged, \u201cfresh complaint\u201d witness had been admitted and there was thus no plain error. <em>Ibid. </em>As noted by appellant, in <em>J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 253, it was stated that in order for a statement by a victim of a sexual assault to be admitted under the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d rule, it must have been self-motivated and not extracted by interrogation. <em>Cf. State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 359 (1988), (\u201c[A] child victim\u2019s spontaneous out-of-court account of an act of sexual abuse may be highly credible because of its content and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d) and proposed <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33) in appendix to opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Other jurisdictions are split on the issue of whether to admit statements which follow questioning under the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine. <em>Compare Illinois v. Alexander, </em>11 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>782, 789, 298 <em>N.E.2d </em>355, 360 (1973) (statements of rape victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>upon questioning may constitute \u201cfresh complaint\u201d) with <em>Ketcham v. Indiana, </em>240 <em>Ind. </em>107, 112, 162 N.E.2d 247, 249 (1959) (statement received by mother from five year old child not admissible as \u201cfresh complaint\u201d as story was \u201cdrawn out reluctantly by questions.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Ms. Foster, the hospital social worker, when asked on direct examination by the prosecutor what R.B. had said to her, responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">I interviewed her by asking her questions regarding her body. I asked her where her nose and mouth was [sic], I went over her body parts with her. I asked her at that time if anyone \u2014 anybody had touched her in the genital area and when going over the body parts, she identified her vagina as her privates. She identified the male anatomy as \u2014 the penis as the dicky. She then told me that Joey had put his dicky in her privates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">When asked what she did when she approached R.B., Ms. Foster responded, \u201cI introduced myself to her. I told her what my job was at the hospital. I told her that I needed to ask her some questions about why she was in the hospital and then I showed her the dolls.\u201d Thus, R.B.\u2019s complaint was not spontaneous, but flowed from questioning by Ms. Foster.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Evidence of \u201cfresh complaint\u201d is not offered as proof of the truth of the matter contained in the complaint, rather it is used to respond to the fact finder\u2019s natural assumption that if the act complained' of had occurred, an early complaint would have been made. <em>Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 338-40. \u201cThe function of such evidence is not corroboration or substantive proof but solely to sustain the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>State v. Gambutti, </em>36 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 229 (App.Div.1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The label \u201cfresh complaint\u201d is not rigidly adhered to, as testimony of this nature is competent even when it is not truly \u201cfresh.\u201d 4 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn Revision 1972) \u00a7 1135 at 301-03. The length of the delay is a factor to be considered as relevant to the weight to be given to the fresh complaint under all of the accompanying circumstances. <em>Ibid. </em>We have refused to adopt an inflexible approach on the issue of timeliness of the child\u2019s complaint. <em>Kozarski, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>at 16; <em>State v. Hummel, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 423 (App.Div.), certif. den. 67 <em>N.J. </em>102 (1975). The timeliness of the complaint and any circumstances explaining the delay are treated as questions for the jury. <em>See Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">It was stated in <em>State v. Schaeffer </em>that to a large extent the rule pertaining to \u201cfresh complaint\u201d is an arbitrary exception to the hearsay rule, and having determined that the testimony is competent, there is no sound reason why a greater lapse of time should render it incompetent, when the delay in making the complaint can be considered as relevant to the weight to be given to such testimony. 87 <em>N.J.L. </em>663, 667 (E. &amp; A.1915). The same rationale is viable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">At least with regard to children of tender years, the fact that the complaint was made in response to questioning need not be fatal to admissibility. It must be considered that there may be a reluctance on the part of an abused, and consequently confused and troubled young child, to discuss a traumatic sexual incident. <em>Cf. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 359-60. It is only natural and realistic not to require that the complaint be entirely volunteered and spontaneous. Having established that a jury may weigh the value of the complaint where freshness is in issue, we see no reason why that same consideration should not extend to the circumstances under which the complaint was made, <em>i.e., </em>whether in response to questioning or volunteered. To the extent that <em>J.S. </em>implies a contrary result, we are compelled to disagree with its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">A proper instruction will focus the jury\u2019s attention on the issue of whether the \u201ccomplaint\u201d is truly from the child in all of the circumstances, including whether it was volunteered or the result of interrogation. It is for the jury to decide whether the complaint is sufficiently probative to dispel a contention that no complaint was in fact made at a point in time when, if the assault had occurred, the child would have made the fact known. In many cases the child\u2019s first opportunity for complaint may be coincidental with interrogation. We expect that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the scenario often follows a pattern where the child is upset, crying and otherwise disturbed and is then questioned by a parent or other authority figure, and for the first time discloses what has taken place. Here, the court effectively admonished the jury to consider all of the circumstances surrounding the child\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Defendant also contends that additional testimony given by Ms. Foster \u201cexceeded the permissible content of fresh complaint testimony,\u201d and was \u201cincurably prejudicial, as it conveyed the allegation that defendant habitually molested R.B..\u201d Ms. Foster testified at trial that R.B. had told her that the sexual assault had happened \u201ca lot of times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">It is clear that \u201cin cases of sexual abuse of an infant, testimony of similar incidents involving the same parties is admissible.\u201d <em>State v. Hintenberger, </em>41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597, 605 (App.Div.), certif. den. 23 <em>N.J. </em>57 (1956). Testimony by a third party to a victim\u2019s \u201cfresh complaint,\u201d however, may only confirm the fact of the complaint and may not recount the details of the victim\u2019s complaint. <em>See Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 339.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">In applying this rule, it has been held that while the witness should not be permitted to tell the particulars of the complaint, enough may be given in evidence to show the nature of the complaint, even though it involves to some extent the particulars thereof, and that the rule is not violated by evidence as to the time and place where the complaint was made, the circumstances under which it was made, and the person to whom made, the condition of the victim when making the complaint, the conduct of the prosecutrix at the time she made complaint, and that she exhibited, if such was the fact, marks of violence and other like indications, as confirmatory of her testimony. <em>[State v. Saccone, </em>7 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263, 266 (App.Div.1950) (citations omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 339, noted that the response of the victim\u2019s mother to an inquiry as to what the victim told her, that \u201c \u2018she said Mr. Bailes had put his hands down her panties and had touched here,\u2019 \u201d did not constitute the improper recounting of details, as \u201c[s]he did not elaborate and could hardly have said less and still identified the nature of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>victim\u2019s] complaint.\u201d Indeed, there is merit to the observation in <em>State v. Ramos, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 202-03 (Law Div.1985), overruled by <em>J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247 (App.Div.), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>588 (1988), that when the evidence is strictly limited to the question of whether or not the child complained, it is not hearsay at all, as it is not introduced to prove the truth of the matter stated. <em>See Evid.R. </em>63.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The complained of testimony by Ms. Foster that R.B. said she had been assaulted \u201ca lot of times\u201d did not go beyond confirming the fact of the victim\u2019s complaint of multiple attacks. It did not add details that were outside the scope of the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine. The recounting of the child\u2019s complaints was not required to be limited to a single instance when she complained of multiple attacks. It is the detailed elaboration of the particulars of the complaints which is prohibited. The fact that complaints were made which related to more than one instance is not objectionable. Further, the challenged testimony of Ms. Foster, that <em>R.B. </em>had told her that defendant had assaulted her \u201ca lot of times,\u201d was not reasonably objected to during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Defendant further argues that, under <em>J.S., </em>the instructions given by the trial court regarding \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony were erroneous. The charge given by the trial court, both after Ms. Foster\u2019s direct testimony regarding R.B.\u2019s complaint and at the close of summations, was similar to the charge which was found unacceptable in <em>J.S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">It is clear that with \u201cfresh complaint\u201d evidence an appropriate limiting instruction must be given by the trial judge. <em>State v. Tirone, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>222, 227 (1974), citing <em>Evid.R. </em>6. The charge given in the present case as well as the charge in <em>J.S. </em>implied that the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d rule permitted \u201cthe testimony of a fresh complaint to bolster the credibility of the abused female.\u201d <em>J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 255. We stated in <em>J.S. </em>that the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>guage of the instruction \u201cinvites misapplication by a jury of fresh complaint testimony and exacerbates the prejudicial impact of such evidence when it is improperly received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255-56. In <em>J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257, we disavowed the Law Division decision in <em>State v. Ramos, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202-03 to the extent that it held that a victim\u2019s statement may be considered \u201cas corroboration of the victim\u2019s assertion that she was assaulted \u2014 a way to bolster her testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In the <em>Ramos </em>appeal to this court, decided six months after our decision in <em>J.S., </em>we found that while the <em>Ramos </em>jury charge did speak of the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony as \u201csupporting\u201d the infant victim\u2019s credibility, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as \u201cthe jury was immediately alerted to the fact that the particular testimony had a limited purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Ramos, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>339, 341-42 (App.Div.1988). In the present case, the jury charge followed the theme of the <em>Ramos </em>charge by stating that \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony is \u201cpermitted but only for the purpose of supporting the credibility of the victim\u2019s complaint and not as corroboration of the alleged offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The only objection made to the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d charge given the jury, either after Ms. Foster\u2019s direct testimony or at the conclusion of the trial, concerned the use of the words \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201calleged perpetrator\u201d rather than the words \u201caccuser\u201d and \u201caccused,\u201d which were used. No objection was made regarding the wording of the instruction, that a purpose of the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony was to \u201cbolster\u201d R.B.'s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">As no objections were made below, we will reverse only if the error was of such magnitude as to constitute plain error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>Spiegle v. Seaman, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 480 (App.Div.1978). Plain error is \u201clegal impropriety ... prejudicially affecting the substantial rights of the defendant and sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u201d <em>State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526, 538 (1969), <em>cert. </em>den. 399 <em>U.S. </em>930, 90 S.Ct. 2254, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>797 (1970) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The trial judge during the testimony of Ms. Foster specifically advised the jury that the hearsay evidence was being permitted \u201conly for the purpose of supporting the credibility of the victim\u2019s complaint and not as corroboration of the alleged offense.\u201d Having concluded that the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony was proper, we find no possibility that the trial judge\u2019s passing reference to courts having \u201cadopted the rule of permitting testimony of a fresh complaint to bolster the credibility of the abused female\u201d led to an unjust result or in any way influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 335 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
