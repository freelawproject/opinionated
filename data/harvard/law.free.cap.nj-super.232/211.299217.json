STEIN, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">We granted leave to appeal from the Law Division\u2019s order suppressing evidence taken from defendant\u2019s dental office pursuant to a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The motion judge suppressed all of the seized evidence on the ground that the search warrant \u201cwas impermissibly broad in scope.\u201d We reverse and remand for the entry of a modified order limiting the retention of the seized records to a time period of one year prior to the date of the first intercepted telephone conversation set forth in the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">Defendant is one of sixteen defendants named in six counts of a fifty-one-count indictment. Count one charges all defendants with conspiring to commit racketeering, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2; count two alleges that all defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>engaged in racketeering, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2c, and count four charges all defendants with conspiring to violate the various substantive criminal offenses set forth in the other counts of the indictment. Defendant is also charged with two other defendants with theft by unlawful taking (count twenty-nine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20 \u2014 3), individually with a violation of the Dental Plan Organization Act (count thirty, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:48D-18), and individually with uttering false records to the New Jersey Department of Insurance (count thirty-one, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2G:21-4a).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Dr. Burnett is a licensed dentist who operates a dental plan which provides dental care to members of Local 262, AFL-CIO. The plan\u2019s offices are located on the second floor of 137 Evergreen Place, East Orange, one floor below the offices of Local 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On September 22, 1986, Detective Howard E. Butt of the New Jersey State Police executed a 140-page affidavit in support of the issuance of arrest warrants for forty-two persons and search warrants for fourteen locations, including Dr. Burnett\u2019s office. The affidavit purported to outline facts to support the contention that Local 262 was controlled by a prominent organized crime \u201cfamily.\u201d Defendants Ralph Vicaro and Anthony DeVingo are identified as the persons who exercised this control. According to the affidavit, court-authorized intercepted conversations between Vicaro and DeVingo discussed the illegal receipt and division of union money and of control over elected union officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The affidavit also recites an intercepted conversation between Vicaro and DeVingo which took place in the Cage Social Club in Newark on February 28, 1986:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">... DeVingo identifies the doctor as \u2018coming in on the twelfth ... that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to get the other money.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The affidavit then recites that on March 18, 1986, in another intercepted conversation between Vicaro and DeVingo in the Cage Social Club:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">... DeVingo related that he called from the \u2018dentist office in the union hall\u2019 and that he gave me \u2018eight (hundred) fifty\u2019 (dollars). DeVingo then said \u2018I got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the seven hundred\u2019 and \u2018we got five hundred more coming.\u2019 He adds that he got \u2018the eight fifty for this month.\u2019 DeVingo also stated that \u2018I even holler at the doctor.\u2019 At that time Vicaro said \u2018Give me four hundred and the rest is all yours.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Elsewhere in the affidavit, Butt recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">In the February 28, 1986 conversation, DeVingo identified an arson that he helped arrange for Doctor Burnett with several other individuals and supplied details of how the money paid by Dr. Burnett for the arson was divided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Based upon the above allegations, a search warrant was issued authorizing the search and seizure from the defendant\u2019s dental plan office of the following items for the period from January 1, 1976 to the date of execution of the warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">1. Record of all receipts from Local Union #262.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">2. Records of all billings to patients belonging to Local Union #262.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">3. Record of all disbursements to Local Union #262, including books of account, support billings, bank statements and cancelled checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">4. Records of any other disbursements not associated with Local Union # 262, including books of account, support billings, bank statements and cancelled checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">5. Any and all contracts, correspondence or other documentation evidencing an agreement between Dr. Richard J. Burnett\u2019s dental plan and Local Union #262.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">6. All wage and payroll records of Dr. Richard J. Burnett\u2019s employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-15\">7. Receipts on purchases, expenses and other disbursements concerning operation of Dr. Richard J. Burnett\u2019s dental practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">We conclude that, in light of the facts set forth in Detective Butt\u2019s affidavit, the search warrant was not overly broad as to the wide variety of items authorized to be seized from defendant's dental offices. The affidavit spelled out probable cause that defendant and others were engaged in a criminal venture to steal money from Local 262, its dental plan and its union members. The intercepted conversations between DeVingo and Vicaro portrayed defendant as giving kickbacks to members of an organized crime organization which unlawfully controlled Local 262. Probable cause existed for the issuance of this warrant, there being a \u201cfair probability that ... evidence of a crime\u201d would be found in Dr. Burnett\u2019s office. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>213, 238, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2317, 2332, 76 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 527, 548 (1983); <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 122-123 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Indeed, defendant does not even argue that the affidavit and warrant are subject to attack on probable cause grounds. He contends that the warrant is so overly broad as to the types of items seized and the ten-year period of seizure that it authorizes a general search, in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and its New Jersey counterpart, Art. I, \u00b6 7. <em>State v. Sims, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>337, 345-346 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the warrant is excessively broad in the nature of the items permitted to be seized. These are all business records maintained in the operation of defendant\u2019s dental practice. The seizure and examination of such items is appropriate to the effort to determine the existence of an illegal kickback scheme involving defendant and members of organized crime. The items authorized to be seized by the warrant are listed with considerable particularity. This warrant easily passes constitutional standards of specificity. <em>Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>463, 480, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2737, 2748, 49 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 627, 642 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We conclude, however, that given the facts set forth in the supporting affidavit, authorization of the seizure of defendant\u2019s records covering a period of approximately ten years was overly broad. Nowhere does the affidavit indicate when defendant first entered into any contract or other arrangement to operate Local 262\u2019s dental plan, or when he commenced performing any dental services for the union\u2019s members. The affidavit establishes probable cause that some time around March 18, 1986, defendant handed $750 in kickback money to DeVingo and that another $500 would be paid by defendant to DeVingo on the following Friday. That portion of the warrant which authorized a search of Dr. Burnett\u2019s dental records for this approximate ten-year period is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s contention that the entire warrant should be suppressed because of its overly broad authorization to seize records encompassing the ten-year period. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are amply protected by reducing the excessive period of ten years to a more reasonable period consistent with the facts set forth in the supporting affidavit. In <em>State v. Dye, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>518 (1972), our Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">In the ordinary case where articles of personal property are seized pursuant to a valid warrant, and the seizure of some of them is illegal as beyond the scope of the warrant, those illegally taken may be suppressed, or excluded at the trial, but those within the warrant do not become so tainted as to bar their receipt in evidence. [At 537].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">For the same reason, otherwise admissible evidence should not be excluded because a portion of the warrant authorizes the seizure of records for a time period in excess of that justified by the supporting affidavit. The proper remedy is \u201credaction,\u201d the striking of those portions of the warrant which are invalid for want of probable cause, and preserving those severable portions that satisfy the Fourth Amendment, and our state constitutional counterpart. <em>Aday v. Superior Court, </em>55 <em>Cal.</em>2d 789, 13 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>415, 421, 362 P.2d 47, 53 (1961); <em>United States v. Christine, </em>687 <em>F.2d </em>749, 754 (3d Cir.1982). See, also, <em>State v. Masco, </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 282 (App.Div.1968), holding that a search warrant containing a valid command to search premises was not totally void because it also contained an illegal blanket command to search all persons found on the premises. The invalid portions were treated as suplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">As <em>Aday, </em>13 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 421, 362 P.2d at 53 and <em>Christine, </em>687 <em>F.</em>2d at 754 both point out, redaction is inappropriate where the valid portions of the warrant may not be severable under all circumstances. There is no abuse of the warrant procedure in confining the items seized to a time period consistent with the criminal events described in the affidavit. Professor LaFave points out in his treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">... it would be harsh medicine indeed if a warrant which was issued on probable cause and which did particularly describe certain items were to be invalidated in toto merely because the affiant and magistrate erred in seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and permitting a search for other items as well. 2 LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment </em>(2d Ed., 1987) \u00a7 4.6(f) at 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Research reveals no other case in which redaction has been applied to reduce the seizure of records to a time period less than that authorized by the search warrant. The cases authorizing severance of tainted from untainted materials in a search warrant all deal with items rather than time periods. <em>Annotation, </em>\u201cPropriety in State Prosecution of Severance of Partially Valid Search Warrant and Limitation of Suppression to Items Seized Under Invalid Portions of Warrant,\u201d 32 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 378 (1984); <em>Annotation, </em>\u201cPropriety in Federal Prosecution of Severance of Partially Valid Search Warrant and Limitation of Suppression to Items Seized Under Invalid Portions of Warrant,\u201d 69 <em>A.L.R.Fed. </em>522 (1984). We see no reason to distinguish between making redaction of improper items and cutting back the number of years in which otherwise untainted evidence may be properly seized and retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Considering the facts set forth in the affidavit issued in support of the search warrant, the seizure of defendant\u2019s records should be limited to a period inclusive of one year prior to February 28, 1986 \u2014 the date of the first intercepted conversation between DeVingo and Vicaro \u2014 and the date of execution of the search warrant. This is the longest period which could reasonably have been granted by the issuing judge upon the initial application for the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Finally, we note that certain of the items seized, Dr. Burnett\u2019s appointment books for 1984, 1985 and 1986, were not authorized for seizure by the warrant. They remain suppressed. <em>State v. Dye, supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The order of suppression is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of a new order and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
