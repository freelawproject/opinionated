S.A. </em>2C:20-3a. The trial court sentenced defendant to probation for one year, on the condition that he serve 30 days in the Atlantic County Jail, and assessed a penalty of $30, payable to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Defendant seeks a reversal of his conviction and the entry of a judgment of acquittal or, alternatively, a reversal of his conviction and a remand for a new trial on the following grounds set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">I. THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE STATE WAS SO CONFUSING, DEFICIENT AND CONTRADICTORY IN MATERIAL RESPECTS THAT THE JUDGE ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL AT THE END OF THE STATE\u2019S CASE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">II. DEFENDANT\u2019S FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY WAIVE HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL RENDERS HIS CONVICTION VOID. (Not raised below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">III. DEFENDANT\u2019S SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO TRIAL BY AN IMPARTIAL JURY WAS VIOLATED IN THAT THE TRIER OF FACT PREJUDGED DEFENDANT\u2019S GUILT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">We have carefully considered these contentions and all the arguments advanced by defendant in support of them and find that, with the exception of defendant\u2019s argument set forth in <em>Paint </em>II that he did not effectively waive his right to a jury trial, they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">We, therefore, turn to defendant\u2019s contention that he did not effectively waive his constitutional right to a jury trial. <em>R. </em>1:8-1, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">(a) Criminal actions required to be tried by a jury shall be so tried unless the defendant, in writing and with the approval of the court, after notice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>prosecuting attorney and his opportunity to be heard, waives a jury trial. In sentencing proceedings conducted pursuant to NJ.S.A. 2C:ll-3(c)(l), the consent of prosecutor shall be required for such waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The requirement of <em>R. </em>l:8-l(a) that a defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury trial be in writing is not jurisdictional and the failure to comply therewith will not constitute a fatal defect in the conviction where the defendant in open court expressly and understandingly personally waives his right to a jury trial. <em>See State v. Paolino, </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>284, 285 (App.Div.1970), certif. den., 57 <em>N.J. </em>127 (1970). <em>See also United States v. Saadya, </em>750 F.2d 1419,1420 (9th Cir.1985). <em>Cf. State v. Ciniglio, </em>57 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 404-406 (App.Div.1959), certif. den., 31 <em>N.J. </em>295 (1960). A defendant\u2019s mere acquiescence in proceeding without a jury, however, is not sufficient to constitute a waiver of his right to a jury trial. <em>See Landry v. Hoepfner, </em>818 F.2d 1169, 1178 (5th Cir.1987), rev\u2019d on other grounds on reh\u2019g <em>en banc, </em>840 F.2d 1201 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 US. \u2014, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1540, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>844 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Here, defendant did not waive his right to a jury trial in writing pursuant to <em>R. </em>l:8-l(a), nor did he personally in open court expressly and understandingly waive his right to such a trial. The trial transcript is devoid of any discussion between the trial court and defendant concerning an express and understanding waiver of his right to a jury trial or even an express and understanding assent to any waiver of that right by his attorney. In the circumstances, defendant cannot justly be deemed to have waived his fundamental constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">We deem it important to emphasize that trial courts and prosecutors should make certain that a waiver of a jury trial be in writing and signed by the defendant as required by <em>R. </em>l:8-l(a), or that the defendant personally place on the record in open court an express and understanding waiver of his or her right to such a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and order of commitment are reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
