Garrison applied for and was rejected by the Burlington County Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI). Defendant appealed the rejection to the Law Division.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 14, 1988, the trial judge issued a letter opinion reversing the PTI rejection and admitting defendant into the program. The State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The factual basis for the indictment must be considered undisputed for purposes of the PTI application. Garrison was an accomplice to an armed robbery in which one William Carter entered a liquor store wearing a dark blue ski mask with eye and nose holes, and using a gun, robbed the store of $500. Carter then left in a car driven by defendant Garrison. Carter gave Garrison $100. Both Garrison and Carter were under the influence of cocaine and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In his PTI rejection letter the PTI Director said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">.. .There is a need for society\u2019s prosecution [of] an individual who participate[s] in armed robberies where a firearm is used. In fact this is a crime of the first degree which makes it one of the most serious crimes under New Jersey Criminal Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The Director also said that not only had defendant been discharged from the Navy for substance abuse, but that defendant had lied about his drug habit in order to get into the Navy. The Director observed that, although defendant had prior opportunities, he first obtained help for his addiction only after he had been charged with this criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">The help which defendant received and to which the Director referred was at Hampton Psychiatric Hospital, where defendant was diagnosed as having a major depression with a guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ed prognosis. From there defendant was discharged to out-patient psychotherapy with Dr. Harvey Musikoff, a psychologist. Dr. Muskikoff filed a report with the court which said that Garrison \u201csuffers from major depression with melancholia and thought disturbance within a borderline personality.\u201d His thought processes were so impaired that he could not logically think through the consequences of the crime he committed. Dr. Musikoff recommended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">The public welfare will not be compromised if he is allowed to participate in a Pretrial Intervention Program. Moreover, this would enhance the gains already made toward his recovery. This man has considerable potential, which will not be realized in prison. It is, therefore, that I recommend the following program:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">1. Individual psychotherapy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">2. Psychotropic medication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">a. Nortryptyllne;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">b. Lithium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">3. Alcohol Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">4. Fulltime employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">5. Community Service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-13\"><em>R. </em>3:28(f) provides that there is no pre-trial appeal from a rejection by the PTI program director. However, where the designated or assignment judge reverses the prosecutor for denying consent to the enrollment of a defendant, the prosecutor may appeal by leave granted under <em>R. </em>2:2. This is such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">The State rejected defendant based on Guideline 3(i) of <em>R. </em>3:28 which provides that \u201c[a] defendant charged with a first or second degree offense ...should ordinarily not be considered for enrollment in a PTI program except on joint application by the defendant and the prosecutor.\u201d Under that rule the applicant has the opportunity to present to the program director (and through him to the prosecutor) facts demonstrating his amenability to the rehabilitative process, showing \u201ccompelling\u201d reasons to justify his admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The judge stated that compelling reasons for the admission of Garrison should be defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cCompelling reasons\u201d are those reasons which, when based upon an analysis of all PTI factors, compel a conclusion that admission to the program better serves the purposes of PTI than nonadmission, that a denial of the application would be unfair. A balancing of the PTI factors is required. The positive must outweigh the negative to such an extent that reasonable persons cannot differ as to the appropriate result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The judge found that Garrison had used drugs since age 13. (He was then age 20). He had been discharged from the Navy as a result of drug use, a practice which he untruthfully denied when questioned by the Navy. He had a high intelligence and except for his drug abuse, an excellent school and community record.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The judge noted the seriousness of the offense, but rejected that as a determinative reason to deny PTI. While the judge also recognized a substantial reason to reject defendant in his untruthfulness in connection with his Navy experience, he found Garrison\u2019s admission to PTI would fulfill the purposes of the program. Emphasizing that the central consideration in PTI admission is the person himself, the judge found that defendant\u2019s potential for good citizenship and his achievements were ignored by the Director. He said the rejection letter\u2019s reference to the Hampton Hospital\u2019s finding that Garrison\u2019s prognosis was \u201cguarded\u201d was inaccurate and that other factors listed in the guidelines favored Garrison\u2019s admission, such as his: absence of prior criminal record, motivation, age, and the absence of objection from the victim. He further found the crime was not part of a continuing criminal pattern, defendant had no history of violence and he was not part of organized criminal activity. He found that defendant met the criteria recently enunciated in <em>State v. Burger, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 341 (App.Div.1988), that \u201ca defendant\u2019s admission to a PTI program must be measured according to his or her amenability to ...rehabilitation as well as by the nature of the offense involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-F\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>It is, of course, clear that the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation is subject to reversal only if it represents \u201ca patent and gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>State v. Burger, </em>involving a charge of welfare fraud, we noted that the prosecutor had acknowledged that defendant\u2019s attitude was positive. <em>Id. </em>at 342. There was no such acknowledgment in this case. Hampton Hospital\u2019s report contained many negative findings concerning defendant\u2019s characteristics as a whole person, as the Director noted. The authors of that report found defendant \u201cnarcissistic,\u201d \u201ctaking advantage of others to achieve his own ends,\u201d with a \u201cgrandiose sense of self-importance,\u201d with a \u201csense of entitlement,\u201d a \u201clack of empathy toward others\u201d and \u201csome antisocial characteristics\u201d as demonstrated in his current charges for conspiring in the armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The Director\u2019s rejection reasons adopted by the Prosecutor reflected the application of the criteria contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12e(l), (2), (7), (8), (10), (14) and (17). In our view, these reasons also reflected the Director\u2019s consideration of defendant as a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">While it was the judge\u2019s view that defendant\u2019s potential could not be realized in prison, it is the prosecutor\u2019s properly informed determination under the statute which the courts must respect. In <em>State v. Hess, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 326 (App.Div.1984), we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">Judicial review of the prosecutor\u2019s decision is narrowly limited and is available to check only the most egregious examples of injustice and unfairness. <em>State v. Leonardis (II), </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 380-384 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\"><em>See also State v. Dalglish, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>503, 513 (1981); <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 93 (1979); <em>State v. Sutton, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>110, 119 (1979); <em>State v. Litton, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 212 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Our careful review of the record persuades us that rejecting defendant from PTI was not an egregious example of injustice or unfairness, <em>State v. Hess, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 326. We accordingly reverse the Law Division\u2019s contrary ruling.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Although there was oral argument, no transcript was submitted on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
