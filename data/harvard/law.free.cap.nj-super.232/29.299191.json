We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff, a New Jersey State employee with the New Jersey State Police, was struck by a state vehicle driven by defendant Solomacha, a New Jersey State employee with the Department of Treasury. At the time of the accident, both employees were performing their respective State duties. Plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the State and now seeks to pursue his fellow State employee, as well as the State, for damages claimed to have been caused by negligence on the part of defendant Solomacha. The complaint was dismissed by the trial court on the basis of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. On appeal, plaintiff contends the statutory bar applies only where there is commonality in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>employment relationship or where both employees are engaged in a common enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">If an injury or death is compensable under this article, a person shall not be liable to anyone at common law or otherwise on account of such injury or death for any act or omission occurring while such person was <em>in the same employ </em>as the person injured or killed, except for intentional wrong, [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Enacted in 1961 as an amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8, this legislatively fashioned bar was intended to relieve employers of an obligation, direct or indirect, for common-law damage judgments. <em>Millison v. E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 185 (1985); <em>Miller v. Muscarelle, </em>67 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 321 (App.Div.1961), certif. den., 36 <em>N.J. </em>140 (1961). On its face, the bar applies to plaintiffs negligence suit against defendant Solomacha. Though both work for different departments of the State, the employer of both is, in fact, the State. <em>Cf. Assoc. of N.J. State Col. Fac. v. Bd. of Higher Ed., </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 245-246 (Law Div.1970). Neither the State Police nor the Department of Treasury is a separate legal entity, but rather each is a division or department of the State performing State functions. <em>Id. See N.J. Const. </em>of 1947, Art. V, \u00a7 4, par. 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">We reject plaintiffs argument that when the Legislature used the words \u201cin the same employ\u201d it intended to limit the class of co-employees to those involved in a common employment relationship or common enterprise. A similar argument was raised in <em>Bergen v. Miller, </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350 (App.Div.1969), certif. den., 53 <em>N.J. </em>582 (1969). In that case, plaintiff, an employee of General Motors, had been treated by a doctor also employed by General Motors. She sought to avoid the statutory bar by arguing employment functions of a company doctor are distinct from employment functions of an industrial worker and thus neither are \u201cin the same employ\u201d. In rejecting this argument, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">We see no valid reason for making any such distinction. The Legislature did not do so. The broad language of the state applies to all employees. We discussed the rationale which prompted the adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 in <em>Miller v. Muscarelle, </em>67 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 321 (App.Div.1961), certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>denied 36 <em>N.J. </em>140 (1961). Simply stated, its purpose was to make the injured workman\u2019s remedy exclusive under the Workmen's Compensation Act both as to the employer and the fellow-employee, except where the fellow-employee was guilty of some intentional wrong. <em>There was no intent in the adoption of the statute to classify fellow-employees. </em>Therefore, the immunity applies to a fellow-employee even if he is in a supervisory capacity or uniquely talented. [104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 352-353; emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Since General Motors was the common employer of the parties in <em>Bergen, </em>the bar applied notwithstanding the fact their respect employment duties may have been distinct. <em>Accord, Boyle v. Breme, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>569 (1983) (bar against common-law tort claim applied to county employee and county physician). <em>See also Stillwell v. McGrath, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252 (Law Div.1964) (bar applicable to county rescue squad workers even though each was a member of a different squad).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Similarly, in <em>Taylor v. Pfaudler Sybron Corp, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48 (App.Div.1977), we rejected an argument the statute limits the bar to a common enterprise relationship. Plaintiff, an industrial worker, was injured while in the employ of Ionac Chemical Company, a chemical manufacturing division of Sybron Corporation. After receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, he sued Pfaudler Company, an equipment manufacturing division of Sybron. Noting both companies were but divisions of a single corporate entity, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">Since Sybron was in fact the employer of plaintiff and Sybron is the corporate entity called upon to respond in damages for the third-party action founded on the negligence of its Pfaudler division, the policy of a single recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act bars any additional right of action. <em>The mere use of divisions or departments, or the labeling of these divisions by proper names in the conduct of Sybron\u2019s business enterprises, does not warrant a deviation from the express legislative policy. </em>[150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 51; emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Thus, as in <em>Bergen, supra, N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 barred the plaintiff\u2019s suit in <em>Taylor </em>because the entity responsible for plaintiff's workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the entity responsible for plaintiff\u2019s injuries, albeit indirectly through one of its separate divisions, was the same, i.e. plaintiff's employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">So too here. The State, as plaintiff\u2019s employer, is responsible for his workers\u2019 compensation benefits. It would as well be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>responsible for injuries negligently caused by defendant Solomacha, albeit indirectly. We see no distinction between this case and <em>Bergen </em>or <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In holding, as we do, that the bar of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 applies to co-state employees regardless of where and for what department they are engaged in performing State duties, we express a view that is consistent with that espoused by other jurisdictions. <em>See Walker v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>97 <em>Cal.App.2d </em>901, 219 <em>P.2d </em>487 (Ct. of App.1950) (fireman injured in a collision with municipal street car); <em>Holody v. City of Detroit, </em>117 <em>Mich.App. </em>76, 323 <em>N</em>.W.2d 599 (Ct. of App.1982) (police officer struck by fire truck); <em>State v. Coffman, </em>446 <em>N.E.2d </em>611 (Ind.App.1983) (highway department truck driver injured while spreading salt or sand when collided with vehicle of state police officer); <em>DeGiuseppe v. City of N.Y., </em>188 <em>Misc. </em>897, 66 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>866 (Sup.Ct.1946), aff\u2019d , 79 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>163 (App.Div.1948) (employee of sanitation department struck by trolley operated by employee of transportation board); <em>Berger v. U.G.I. Corp. &amp; City of Allentown, </em>285 <em>Pa.Super. </em>374, 427 <em>A.2d </em>1161 (1980) (city fireman killed by gas explosion allegedly caused by negligent installation of gas lines by employees of city water and sewer department); <em>Green v. Turner, </em>437 <em>So.2d </em>956 (La.App.1983) (employee of department of transportation injured in a car accident by an employee of the department of health and human resources); <em>Osborne v. Commonwealth, </em>353 <em>S.W.2d </em>373 (Ky.App.1962). See also 2A Larson, <em>The Law of Workmens\u2019 Compensation, </em>\u00a7 72.85(b), (c), p. 274, 276 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We note, as plaintiff points out, the amendment originally proposed by Assembly Bill 117, introduced January 12, 1960, contained the phrase \u201cin the same employ of the same employer\u201d. Although plaintiff claims deletion of the reference to \u201csame employer\u201d may be considered indicative of an intent to narrow the scope of the bar, <em>cf. Illes v. Edison Tp. Zoning Bd. of Adj., </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 608 (Law Div.1985), neither the language of the amendment as enacted, its purpose, nor case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>law supports this contention. We consider \u201cof the same employer\u201d and \u201csame employ\u201d as merely redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Since plaintiff and defendant Solomacha were both working for the State at the time of the accident, plaintiff is limited to his workers\u2019 compensation remedy. The dismissal of the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
