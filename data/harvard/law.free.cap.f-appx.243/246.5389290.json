Carey, </em>we recognized under California law that the California Board of Parole Hearing\u2019s (\u201cthe Board\u201d) inquiry under California Penal Code \u00a7 3041 primarily turns on a discretionary consideration of a petitioner\u2019s unsuitability for parole as a public safety risk. <em>See </em>479 F.3d 658, 662 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cAlthough the Board must \u2018normally set a parole release date\u2019 before the minimum term has been served, an inmate \u2018shall be found unsuitable for parole and denied parole if, in the judgment of the [Board,] the prisoner will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if released from prison.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>In re Dannenberg, </em>34 Cal.4th 1061, 1078, 1080, 23 Cal.Rptr.3d 417, 104 P.3d 783 (2005) (alteration in original))). In tacit rejection of Mosby\u2019s purported presumption in favor of setting a parole release date at one\u2019s first parole hearing, we further recognized that the Board\u2019s unsuitability finding under \u00a7 3401(b) \u201c \u2018must <em>precede </em>any effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>set a parole release date\u2019 \u201d under 3041(a). <em>See id. </em>at 662 n. 3 (quoting <em>Dannenberg, </em>34 Cal.4th at 1079-80, 23 Cal.Rptr.3d 417, 104 P.3d 783) (emphasis added). Mosby disagrees with <em>Dannenberg\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 3401, but that is a question of state law that we will not review here. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d); <em>Langford v. Day, </em>110 F.3d 1380, 1389 (9th Cir.1997) (A federal habeas petitioner \u201cmay not ... transform a state-law issue into a federal one merely by asserting a violation of due process. We accept a state court\u2019s interpretation of state law, ... and alleged errors in the application of state law are not cognizable in federal habeas corpus.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Other than the alleged statistical denial rate and Mosby\u2019s suggested inference of a blanket policy, Mosby has presented no evidence to the district court that the Board in fact automatically rejected petitioners like Mosby, at the time of his 2002 petition, based solely on \u201cpolitical deliberation.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because there is no evidence of a blanket policy, the Board\u2019s decision to deny Mosby\u2019s petition is not constitutionally infirm if it is supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Irons, </em>479 F.3d at 664-65; <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123,1128-29 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Here, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), it was a reasonable application of the <em>Hill </em>standard for the Court of Appeal of California to conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in making the unsuitability finding based on the \u201cespecially cruel and callous\u201d nature of the offense, <em>see </em>Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402(c)(1), in light of Mosby\u2019s cruel and calculated decision to \u201ccap a Mexican\u201d over a trivial argument. <em>See Irons, </em>479 F.3d at 664-65 (applying \u201csome evidence\u201d standard to deny petition based on \u201cespecially cruel and callous\u201d nature of the offense where petitioner had yet to complete minimum term). Likewise, the California appeals court did not unreasonably apply the <em>Hill </em>standard in declining to invalidate the Board\u2019s denial based on a supported finding that Mosby\u2019s escalating pattern of criminal activity, the destabilizing effect of prior drug abuse, and a failure to upgrade educationally or vocationally, <em>see </em>Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402(d), outweighed any positive factors identified by the Board. While Mosby asks us to reevaluate this evidence with respect to his potential public safety risk, we are not authorized to re-balance the evidence that was before the Board on appellate review. <em>See Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768. Because some evidence supported the Board\u2019s finding of unsuitability for parole, the decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Board cannot be overturned pursuant to Mosby\u2019s federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b269-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. We review the district court\u2019s ruling on Mosby\u2019s Motion for Evidentiary Hearing And Expansion of the Record for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Shryock, </em>342 F.3d 948, 983 (9th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 965, 124 S.Ct. 1729, 124 S.Ct. 1736, 158 L.Ed.2d 411 (2004). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mosby\u2019s motion because Mosby was not diligent in developing the record with available documentation in his state court post-conviction proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(A)(ii) (limiting availability of evidentiary hearing unless \u201ca factual predicate ... could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence\u201d); <em>see also Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 435, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (requiring under \u00a7 2254(e)(2) that petitioner \u201cundertake his own diligent search for evidence\u201d); <em>Griffin v. Johnson, </em>350 F.3d 956, 966 (9th Cir.2003) (holding petitioner is not entitled to evidentiary hearing where petitioner had access to documentation but failed to present it in state proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
