Loredo-Pecina, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 312 (5th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>- U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>Mendoza-Torres v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 826, 166 L.Ed.2d 660 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-19\">Loredo argues that his prior Texas felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance does not qualify as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, in light of <em>Lopez. </em>He also contends that his appeal is not moot despite his release from imprisonment and subsequent deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-20\">In <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007), we held that an appellant\u2019s challenge to the characterization of a state offense as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2 was moot when the appellant had completed his term of imprisonment and had been deported. The court could not grant relief because the defendant was barred from entering the United States, and therefore could not be resentenced. <em>Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d at 383. Because Loredo is barred from entering the United States and cannot be present for a resentencing proceeding as required by Fed.R.CrimP. 43, we cannot grant his request to be resentenced. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Loredo\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
