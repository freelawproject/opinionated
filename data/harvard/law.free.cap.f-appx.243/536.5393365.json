Luna-Roman faced an enhanced Sentencing Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months on account of two prior convictions. The district court sentenced Luna-Roman to serve 65 months in prison. On appeal, Luna-Roman argues that his below-Guidelines sentence was unreasonable because the district court \u201cdid not give appropriate weight\u201d to relevant sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including his personal characteristics and family ties to the United States, which compelled his illegal reentry, or to the \u201cabsence of criminal conduct leading up to his arrest.\u201d Luna-Roman also argues that the district court should have shortened his sentence to account for those lesser sentences that are imposed for similar misconduct in districts in which the Department of Justice has established early disposition or \u201cfast-track\u201d programs. Shortening his sentence, Luna-Roman argues, would have helped to alleviate \u201cunwarranted sentence disparities\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">We apply the deferential standard of reasonableness to the final sentence, focusing our attention on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-11\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (summarizing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The district court need not explicitly state on the record that it has considered each factor. Nor need the court discuss each individual factor. An acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>Absent such an express acknowledgment, the district court\u2019s statements over the entire sentencing hearing may indicate that the court adequately weighed the statutory factors and the defendant\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944-45 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that the \u201csentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority\u201d). Additionally, we may compare the sentence actually imposed to the statutory maximum in the reasonableness review process. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). The burden of proving that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>record and these factors rests on the party challenging the sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In this case, the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range and heard arguments from both parties on the appropriate factors to consider in sentencing Luna-Roman. While the court did not explicitly acknowledge that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court\u2019s statements over the entire sentencing hearing nevertheless indicate that the court afforded adequate consideration to these factors and to Luna-Roman\u2019s arguments. Finally, the district court\u2019s finding that the claimed \u201cfast-track\u201d disparities were irrelevant to the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(6) was consistent with the law of this Circuit. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As a result, Luna-Roman has failed to meet his burden of establishing that his sentence was unreasonable. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
