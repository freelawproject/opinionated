We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Williams was employed as an electrician with Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. (\u201cHelmerich\u201d). He injured his knee in June 1999 and thereafter applied for and received disability benefits from Hartford, which administered Helmerich\u2019s employee welfare benefit plan. The plan is governed by ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>The Hartford policy provides that, during the first twenty-four months of disability, the participant is entitled to receive benefits if he is unable to perform one or more of the essential duties of his job. Benefits continue only if the participant is unable to perform the essential duties of <em>any </em>job for which he is qualified by education, training, or experience. In accordance with the policy, Hartford notified Williams in June 2001 that his first 24 months of disability benefits would soon expire and that Hartford had begun an investigation into whether Williams was entitled to continuing benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Hartford determined that Williams could perform sedentary work and discontinued disability benefits in August 2002. Following an unsuccessful appeal of that decision with Hartford, Williams commenced this action in July 2004. Hartford asserted a counterclaim for overpaid disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s decision whether the plan administrator abused its discretion in discontinuing disability benefits. <em>Barhan v. Ry-Ron Inc., </em>121 F.3d 198, 201 (5th Cir.1997). Since the terms of the ERISA benefit plan give the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine benefits, the district court reviews the denial of benefits for abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>\u201c[I]f the administrator\u2019s decision on eligibility is supported by substantial evidence and is not erroneous as a matter of law, it will be upheld.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding, because Hartford acts as both the insurer and the claims administrator, it operates under a conflict of interest because it \u201cpotentially benefits from every denied claim.\u201d <em>Vega v. Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 287, 295 (5th Cir.1999). As the district court did, this court therefore applies a \u201csliding scale standard\u201d and grants Hartford\u2019s decision less than full deference. <em>Gooden v. Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>250 F.3d 329, 333 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AVX8\">A. Benefits decision</p>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">Williams first challenges Hartford\u2019s decision to discontinue disability benefits on the basis that Hartford\u2019s reviewing physician, Dr. Wagner, misconstrued a statement from one of Williams\u2019s physicians, Dr. Pasco. Pasco informed Wagner that Williams was capable of functioning at a sedentary level. Based on his review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Williams\u2019s medical records and Pasco\u2019s statement, Wagner concluded that Williams could perform work at a sedentary level with lifting restrictions. Though Pasco later wrote a letter to Hartford to urge that he did not mean his statements to Wagner \u201cto imply that [Williams] was not disabled,\u201d Hartford did not abuse its discretion in discontinuing benefits. Pas-co\u2019s letter was sent <em>three years </em>after Hartford\u2019s discontinuance of Williams\u2019s benefits, and Hartford did not rely on Pasco\u2019s statement alone. Hartford relied on Wagner\u2019s opinion, Williams\u2019s medical records, and a report from a Hartford rehabilitation expert who concluded that Williams had sufficient skills that would allow him to be readily employable with earning equal to his pre-disability wages. Williams has not demonstrated a genuine issue of fact as to whether Hartford abused its discretion in discontinuing benefits. <em>See Simoneaux v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>101 Fed.Appx. 10, 11-12 (5th Cir.2004) (rejecting a benefits determination challenge because the determination was rationally connected to the facts in the administrative record).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Williams also argues that summary judgment was error because Hartford considered neither Williams\u2019s back problems nor a letter from a physician, Dr. Eicke, who asserted that Williams was unable to perform sedentary work due to mental illness. As to the back problems, though the evidence was submitted <em>after </em>the benefits discontinuance decision, we conclude, as did the district court, that Hartford nonetheless considered the evidence as part of Williams\u2019s appeal with Hartford and determined that it was consistent with other medical information that Hartford already had reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Dr. Eicke\u2019s letter was not submitted to Hartford until after Williams\u2019s appeal with Hartford was denied. The letter, moreover, was not accompanied by any medical records, and it presented a new basis for disability benefits\u2014Williams originally applied for and received disability benefits due to <em>physical </em>disability. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that Hartford abused its discretion in discontinuing benefits. <em>See Vega, </em>188 F.3d at 298 (\u201cThere is no justifiable basis for placing the burden solely on the administrator to generate evidence relevant to deciding the claim, which may or may not be available to it, or which may be more readily available to the claimant.\u201d); <em>Simoneaux, </em>101 Fed.Appx. at 12 (finding no abuse of discretion where the administrator declined to give overriding weight to medical opinions not supported by objective medical findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">We also find no merit in Williams\u2019s argument that because a part of the medical records reviewed by Wagner were illegible, the administrator must have abused his discretion by discontinuing benefits. Williams\u2019s argument misapprehends Hartford\u2019s burden. The existence of some unspecified quantity of illegible notes does not render meaningless the legible medical records, Wagner\u2019s investigation, including phone calls to Williams\u2019s treating physician, Wagner\u2019s medical evaluation, and the employability analysis performed by Hartford. There is substantial evidence supporting Hartford\u2019s disability determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Considering the full record and the parties\u2019 submissions, we hold that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Hartford on Williams\u2019s claim for improper discontinuance of disability benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">B. Williams\u2019s requests for remand and additional discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Williams seeks a remand to Hartford for consideration of certain evidence, including Dr. Pasco\u2019s letter submitted three years after the benefits determination and Dr. Eicke\u2019s letter regarding Williams\u2019s mental illness. Williams also seeks remand because portions of the records were illegible and because Dr. Wagner never successfully contacted two of Williams\u2019s treating physicians, even though the medical records from Williams\u2019s treatment by those physicians was before Hartford either during Wagner\u2019s initial evaluation or during the Hartford appeal. We decline to remand on this basis. <em>See Vega, </em>188 F.3d at 302 n. 13 (\u201cWe decline to remand to the administrator to allow him to make a more complete record on this point. We want to encourage each of the parties to make its record before the case comes to federal court, and to allow ... another opportunity to make a record discourages this effort.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Williams also seeks review of the district court\u2019s denial of his discovery requests. Under ERISA, as a general rule, the district court is limited to a review of the administrative record that existed when reviewed by the administrator. <em>See Estate of Bratton v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>215 F.3d 516, 521 (5th Cir.2000). There are limited exceptions to the rule, including exceptions for evidence related to how an administrator interpreted certain policy provisions and for evidence that assists the district court in understanding medical terminology. <em>See id. </em>Williams argues that he should have been allowed to depose Hartford employees about the disability determination. At issue is a factual determination of no disability by Hartford, not Hartford\u2019s interpretation of plan terms. Williams has not explained why his discovery requests fit into the limited exceptions to the administrative record rule. We find no merit in his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b818-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\">. Hartford declined to defer to the Social Security Administration\u2019s determination that Williams, an electrician by trade, had no skills transferable to sedentary work, but this decision does not necessitate reversal. Hartford is not required to defer to a Social Security ruling. <em>See Horton v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>51 Fed.Appx. 928 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201d[W]hile an ERISA plan administrator might find a social security disability determination relevant or persuasive, the plan administrator is not bound by the social security determination.\u201d (citation omitted)). Hartford, moreover, conducted an employability analysis, the substance of which Williams has challenged in only a conclusory fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. As to Hartford\u2019s counterclaim, Williams does not dispute that he is contractually obligated to refund overpayments. He instead argues that, since Hartford assigned the collection of the overpayments to a collection agency, Hartford has no standing to pursue the claim. However, the right to collect the payments and the right to the payments themselves are distinct. The assignment of collection responsibility alone does not establish that the right to the overpayments was also assigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
