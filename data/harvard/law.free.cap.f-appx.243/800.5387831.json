Davis, </em>226 F.3d 346, 348 (5th Cir.2000). The district court sentenced Davis to 60 months of imprisonment on the conspiracy and wire fraud counts and 97 months of imprisonment on the remaining five counts, to run concurrently. The district court also ordered Davis to pay restitution in the amount of $3,609,937.79. This court affirmed Davis\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 360. Davis now appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying miscellaneous motions (docket entry 519) and amending the conditions of Davis\u2019s supervised release by increasing his monthly restitution payments from $100 to $300 (docket entry 500).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">Davis does not address, in the context of the instant appeal, the district court\u2019s statement in docket entry 519 that all of the issues raised in his motions were addressed in previous orders. Accordingly, Davis\u2019s appeal of docket entry 519 is dismissed for failure to adequately brief. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Davis\u2019s argument that exculpatory evidence and records were concealed from him during discovery is similarly inadequately briefed. Any purported appeal on this issue is dismissed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\">Davis\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order amending the conditions of supervision by increasing his monthly restitution payments from $100 to $300 (docket entry 500) is moot. The district court subsequently entered an order again modifying Davis\u2019s conditions of supervision by increasing his monthly restitution payments from $300 to $600. Davis explicitly agreed to the modification. Thus, he is no longer bound by the order he seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>appeal. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>940 F.2d 130, 131-32 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Davis\u2019s motion to hear his appeal on an expedited basis and his motion for judicial notice are denied. All other outstanding motions are hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b823-15\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b823-20\"> Davis was released from prison on August 13, 2004.
