R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order adopting and affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying petitioners application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">A review of the administrative record demonstrates that petitioners stipulated at their merits hearing that they lacked a qualifying relative as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir. 2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioners were ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s opposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">To the extent petitioners now raise claims that they did not present to the Board of Immigration Appeals, this petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We lack jurisdiction to consider unexhausted claims that could have been corrected by the Board of Immigration Appeals. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
