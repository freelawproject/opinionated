Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). (Garcia\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal with unsworn factual assertions is DENIED.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-24\">Because Garcia has briefed only his deliberate-indifference claims against defendant Washington for disregarding his work restrictions, he has abandoned all others. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Our court reviews <em>de novo </em>both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e dismissals for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 865 (5th Cir.2003), and dismissals for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1997e and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Bazroux v. Scott, 136 </em>F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998) (applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>same standard as that for a Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(6) dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The district court\u2019s failure-to-exhaust conclusion was based on Garcia\u2019s failure to assert \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d at all stages of the administrative process. Neither Bureau of Prisons procedures, as related by the defendants in the record before us, nor \u00a7 1997e required such assertion, however. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 922-23, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Garcia\u2019s grievance forms, which alleged Washington wrongly ignored his work restrictions, were sufficient to give prison officials the requisite \u201cfair opportunity to address the problem that ... later form[ed] the basis of the [action]\u201d. <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 517 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Moreover, Garcia\u2019s complaint alleged: he had a work restriction; Washington knew of it, but made him work in violation of it; and such action led to severe harm. If accepted as true, these allegations are sufficient to avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1997e and Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(6). <em>See Calhoun v. Hargrove, </em>312 F.3d 730, 734-35 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Accordingly, the dismissal of Garcia\u2019s deliberate-indifference claim against Washington in his individual capacity is vacated, and we remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. In all other respects, the district court\u2019s dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART; MOTION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
