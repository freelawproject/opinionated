We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-25\">Samuel contends that he has been denied due process because California Penal Code \u00a7 3041(c) requires that he be released from prison now. We disagree. Section 3041(c) and the statute it references do not apply to Samuel\u2019s life sentence for the first degree murder he committed on October 15, 1977 because those statutes apply only to certain felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>nies committed prior to July 1, 1977. <em>See </em>CaLPenal Code \u00a7 8041(c); CaLPenal Code \u00a7 1170.2. Samuel received the process he was due because there is some evidence to support the Board of Prison Terms\u2019 determination that he was not suitable for parole. <em>See Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1128 (9th Cir.2006). Thus, the California court\u2019s rejection of Samuel\u2019s due process claim did not result in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Samuel further contends that certain California parole statutes and regulations have been applied to him retrospectively to set his term in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The California court concluded that \u201capplicable base terms and post-conviction credit that may be due to petitioner cannot be considered until petitioner is found suitable for parole\u201d and that, as a result, \u201c[n]o ex post facto ... concerns are implicated by the Board of Prison Terms\u2019 finding of parole unsuitability.\u201d We hold that the California court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established United States Supreme Court authority. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Harris v. Pulley, </em>885 F.2d 1354, 1378 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b302-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
