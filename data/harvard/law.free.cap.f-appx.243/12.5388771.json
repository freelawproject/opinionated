Grande-Dorantes contends his prior Texas conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine is not a drug-trafficking offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) because Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7 481.112(a) defines a \u201cdelivery\u201d to include an \u201coffer to sell,\u201d which is not punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Because Grande-Dorantes challenged this sentencing enhancement in the district court, we review the district court\u2019s application of the advisory Guidelines <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 910, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">At sentencing, the Government submitted state-court records establishing that Grande-Dorantes stipulated to possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute it. Because Grande-Dorantes stipulated to conduct which constitutes a drug-trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court did <em>not </em>err in enhancing his sentence. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Grande-Dorantes also asserts that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court decisions. This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Grande-Dorantes properly concedes this; he raises the issue here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b34-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
