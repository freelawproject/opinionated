Francia pled guilty to intentional sexual contact with a minor in violation of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 163.415 by touching the minor\u2019s genitals and breast. This conviction fits within the BIA\u2019s definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d <em>see Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 991, 995 (BIA 1999) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(8)), and the BIA\u2019s definition is a permissible construction of the statute. <em>See Afridi v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 1212, 1216 (9th Cir.2006). Because his conviction counts as an aggravated felony, Francia is \u201cdeportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">2. However, Francia is eligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a), unless his conviction is a crime of \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Under the categorical approach of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), some of the conduct proscribed by Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 163.415 doesn\u2019t constitute a crime of moral turpitude because the Oregon statute criminalizes sexual touching of a minor, even if the minor is 17 years old, consents and isn\u2019t injured. <em>See State v. Landino, </em>38 Or.App. 447, 450, 590 P.2d 737 (Ct.App.1979). Crimes against protected classes don\u2019t necessarily involve moral turpitude if they don\u2019t result in injury. <em>See Galeana-Mendoza v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 1054, 1061 (9th Cir.2006); <em>see also Matter of Sanudo, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 968, 972 (BIA 2006). Even \u201c[cjonsensual sexual <em>penetration\u201d </em>of a 17-year-old-by a 22-year-old doesn\u2019t necessarily result in injury, <em>United States v. Lopez-Solis, </em>447 F.3d 1201, 1207 (9th Cir.2006) (emphasis added), so the lesser crime of consensual sexual <em>contact </em>with a 17-year-old isn\u2019t a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">Under the modified categorical approach, there is no evidence in the \u201cdoeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ments that are part of the record of conviction,\u201d Galea<em>na-Mendoza, </em>465 F.3d at 1058, that Francia was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. Francia\u2019s plea agreement showed only that he was 23 years old; it didn\u2019t state the age of the victim, whether the victim consented or whether the victim was injured. Likewise, the indictment and judgment of conviction offer no additional facts that would suggest Francia was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. The record before us does not contain any other documents, such as the plea colloquy, that might be considered under the modified categorical approach. The government does not suggest that such documents could be obtained and has not asked for a remand to allow the BIA to consider any such documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We therefore remand to the BIA so that the agency may exercise its discretion under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Petition DENIED in part, GRANTED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b321-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
