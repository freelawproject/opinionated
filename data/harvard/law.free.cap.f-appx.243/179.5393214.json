While free on pretrial release, Hinshaw absconded, and he remained at large until 1997, when he was caught driving a pickup truck in Kansas with 13 gallons of liquid PCP in a spare gasoline tank. He ultimately pleaded guilty in the District of Kansas to interstate travel in aid of racketeering and served a five-year sentence, all the while using the aliases \u201cRon Arthur Taylor\u201d and \u201cCharles Arthur Henshaw.\u201d Law enforcement officers in Kansas never discovered that Hinshaw was a fugitive, and after he served his sentence, he settled in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In October 2001 Hinshaw was finally arrested in California on the outstanding warrant from the Northern District of Illinois. He was returned to Chicago to face the 1991 drug and assault charges. A fourth charge of failing to appear for trial, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1), was added in a superseding indictment. At trial, he stipulated that his real name is Charles Arthur Hinshaw. The jury found him not guilty of possessing PCP and guilty of the remaining three counts. He was sentenced to a total of 156 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. He appeals, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Hinshaw first contends that his convictions should be overturned and the indictment dismissed because of noncompliance with the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-74. The government responds that Hinshaw waived this argument by failing to move to dismiss the indictment in the district court, but Hinshaw insists that two of his pretrial motions preserved the issue for appeal. Hinshaw points to a motion filed in December 2002, but that filing was a demand for discovery. The notation in the motion\u2019s last numbered paragraph that \u201cDefendant specifically reserves the right to further move for ... Dismissal of the Indictment\u201d simply contemplates a future motion to dismiss. Hinshaw next cites counsel\u2019s March 2003 motion for reconsideration of a previously denied combined motion to suppress evidence and dismiss the indictment for grand jury misconduct. None of these motions had anything to do with the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Hinshaw, then, did not preserve his statutory claim in the district court, and to the extent he seeks to enforce his right to a trial commencing within 70 nonexcludable days of his indictment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c), the government is correct that he waived the argument. The statute itself provides that a defendant\u2019s failure to move for dismissal before trial or the entry of a guilty plea waives the right to enforce the 70-day rule. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2); <em>see United States v. White, </em>443 F.3d 582, 589 (7th Cir.2006). Absent a motion to dismiss filed at the appropriate time, even plain-error review is unavailable. <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>384 F.3d 439, 442 (7th Cir.2004). But Hinshaw doesn\u2019t appear to be concerned only with the 70-day clock; the specific lapses of time he finds problematic fall between his arrest on a criminal complaint and his indictment, a period that must not exceed 30 nonexcludable days, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(b). We have not yet analyzed whether the waiver language in \u00a7 3162(a)(2) applies equally when a defendant seeks to enforce the 30-day rule. Arguably the statute could be read to demand that a defendant timely assert his right to dismissal for a violation of the 70-day rule, but not the 30-day rule. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 3162(a)(1). But we think that the First Circuit, among other courts, provides a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>better reading of the statute. <em>United States v. Spagnuolo, </em>469 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.2006). We see no reason to depart from the uniform practice of the other courts of appeals that have made a timely motion to dismiss a prerequisite to relief in either case. <em>See id.; United States v. Gamboa, </em>439 F.3d 796, 803-04 (8th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Pollock, </em>726 F.2d 1456, 1464 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Even if we found Hinshaw\u2019s argument to be forfeited instead of waived, he has nothing to gain by our reviewing for plain error. The remedy for a speedy-indictment violation is dismissal of charges in the original complaint on which the defendant is not indicted within 30 days. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(1). In this case, the criminal complaint charged Hinshaw only with possession of PCP in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The remedy for a 30-day violation (if one occurred) would have been dismissal of the possession count, but the jury acquitted Hinshaw on that count anyway. The three counts of conviction not charged in the complaint, including the conspiracy that encompassed the possession charge, are unaffected. <em>See United States v. Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 451-52 (2d Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Hemmings, </em>258 F.3d 587, 592 (7th Cir.2001). Hinshaw\u2019s substantial rights could not have been affected by a speedy-indictment violation where the district court failed to dismiss a charge on which he ultimately was acquitted; accordingly, Hinshaw could not establish plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Hinshaw next argues that his conviction is void because his name was incorrectly spelled as \u201cHenshaw\u201d on the jury verdict. Hinshaw contends that the misspelling \u201cproduced an unreliable verdict\u201d and created a disparity with the judgment of conviction, where his namely is spelled properly. Leaving aside the audacity of this defendant\u2019s insistence that all court documents reflect his correct name (indeed two of his 20 known aliases use the surname \u201cHenshaw\u201d), we see no prejudice. Hinshaw\u2019s attorney incorrectly referred to his client as \u201cHenshaw\u201d in the early stages of the trial, but he later realized his error and brought it to the court\u2019s\u2014and the jury\u2019s\u2014attention. With this correction on the record, it is difficult to imagine what error the jury could have made, particularly where Hinshaw was tried alone and could not have been confused with another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Finally, Hinshaw argues that his prison sentence is inconsistent with the requirements of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He contends that the district judge impermissibly found based on a preponderance of the evidence facts, such as the drug quantity, that must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. But <em>Booker, </em>because of its remedial opinion, requires no such thing. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThis Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment cases do not automatically forbid a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not determined by a jury and to increase the sentence in consequence.\u201d). Hinshaw also insists that applying <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding to offenses committed before that case was decided raises <em>ex post facto </em>concerns, but we have rejected this contention. <em>Booker </em>\u201caffected neither what conduct was considered criminal nor the statutory maximum penalties.\u201d <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>483 F.3d 509, 516 (7th Cir.2007); <em>see United States v. Jamison, </em>416 F.3d 538, 539 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
