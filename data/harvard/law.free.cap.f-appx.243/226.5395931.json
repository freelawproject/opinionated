Kyllingstad (\u201cKyllingstad\u201d) filed claims against the Town of Camp Verde (\u201cCamp Verde\u201d) and individual officers under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Arizona state tort law arising from his arrest, detention, and indictment for custodial interference. A jury found for Kyllingstad and awarded him damages. Kyllingstad appeals the district court\u2019s vacation of the jury verdicts and awards with respect to his section 1983 claim and state law tort claims arising from his arrest. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u201c[W]e do not lightly cast aside the solemnity of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Graves v. City of Coeur D\u2019Alene, </em>339 F.3d 828, 844 (9th Cir.2003). The verdicts make clear that the jury found no probable cause for Kyllingstad\u2019s arrest. This finding must be upheld if \u201creasonable persons might reach different conclusions on the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845 n. 21. We do not overturn a jury\u2019s verdict on qualified immunity unless it is \u201cquite clear that the jury ... reached a seriously erroneous result.\u201d <em>Settlegoode v. Portland Pub. Schs., </em>371 F.3d 503, 513 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The district court erred in overturning the jury\u2019s verdict and finding probable cause for Kyllingstad\u2019s arrest. The facts known to the officers did not provide probable cause to arrest Kyllingstad under any section of Arizona\u2019s custodial interference statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1302. <em>See Devenpeck v. Alford, </em>543 U.S. 146, 155, 125 S.Ct. 588, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004). The jury found that the officers did not know about the permanent custody order in the case, so the only question was whether there was probable cause to arrest Kyllingstad for violating the temporary custody order. Deputy Richard Watkins (\u201cWatkins\u201d) failed to read the relevant provisions of the temporary custody order before deciding Kyllingstad had violated it. A mistake of law cannot justify an arrest under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Beier v. City of Lewiston, </em>354 F.3d 1058, 1065 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Without probable cause for Kyllingstad\u2019s arrest, the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity. Accepting the jury\u2019s version of the facts, as we must, it was objectively unreasonable of the officers to believe they had probable cause to arrest Kyllingstad. <em>See Graves, </em>339 F.3d at 846 n. 24; <em>see also Beier, </em>354 F.3d at 1068-69. The officers could not reasonably rely on the unsubstantiated claims of Susan Kyllingstad that Kyllingstad was violating the temporary custody order when \u201cthey ma[d]e no attempt to ascertain the applicable prohibitions.\u201d <em>Beier, </em>354 F.3d at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">Without probable cause for Kyllingstad\u2019s arrest, the Town of Camp Verde is not entitled to qualified immunity as a municipality. Kyllingstad showed that (1) the officers violated his rights; (2) Camp Verde\u2019s customs and policies with regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>to custodial interference amounted to deliberate indifference to his rights; and (3) the customs and policies were the moving force behind the violation of Kyllingstad\u2019s rights. <em>See Gibson v. County of Washoe, </em>290 F.3d 1175, 1194 (9th Cir.2002). Camp Verde\u2019s indifference to Kyllingstad\u2019s rights \u201cis generally a jury question,\u201d which the jury resolved in favor of Kyllingstad. <em>Id. </em>at 1195. The jury reasonably found that Camp Verde\u2019s failure to train its officers to confirm the terms and existence of custody orders was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the violation of Kyllingstad\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Since there was no probable cause for Kyllingstad\u2019s arrest, the jury verdicts for Kyllingstad on his state law tort claims must also be reinstated. <em>See State v. Keener, </em>206 Ariz. 29, 75 P.3d 119, 122 (Ariz.Ct.App.2003); <em>Hockett v. City of Tucson, </em>139 Ariz. 317, 678 P.2d 502, 505 (Ariz.Ct.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We REVERSE and REMAND for reinstatement of the jury verdicts and awards.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
