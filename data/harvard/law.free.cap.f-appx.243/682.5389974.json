For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with the case, we need not set forth the factual background or procedural history except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, Cedeno agreed that the amount of cocaine attributable to him was to be determined at the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cedeno argues that the district court erred by imposing the mandatory prison term of ten years under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) based solely on the court\u2019s determination of the amount of cocaine. He claims the quantity should have been established beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the court should have applied the safety valve provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\">Cedeno\u2019s appeal was filed before we decided, <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 565 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc). Cedeno\u2019s claim that the court could not determine drug quantity absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt is foreclosed by that decision. We there held that the Due Process Clause does not require facts relevant only to sentencing enhancements to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Grier, </em>475 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>F.3d at 565-66. Rather, such findings need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Additionally, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A), a defendant\u2019s guideline range is determined on the basis of \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">There is no dispute about the actual weight of the drugs involved in this case. Rather, Cedeno argues that the government did not establish that he knew how much the drugs he was transporting weighed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He admitted the interstate transportation of all of the cocaine he was charged with possessing with the intent to distribute. It was therefore appropriate to hold him responsible for that entire amount, even if he did not know the precise weight. The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that that cocaine weighed eight kilograms, and that quantity triggered the statutory maximum of ten years imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); and U.S.S.G \u00a7 5Gl.l(e)(2). The guideline term is 120 months. The record also establishes that the court considered the relevant sentencing factors and reasonably applied them in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The safety valve provisions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) apply if five specified conditions are met. The fifth condition under \u00a7 3553(f) is the only one in dispute here. That condition requires a defendant to truthfully provide all relevant information and evidence pertaining to the offense to the government. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). The defendant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he/she complied with that requirement. <em>See United States v. Sabir, </em>117 F.3d 750, 754 (3d Cir.1997) (citing <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>94 F.3d 1095, 1100-02 (7th Cir.1996)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Although Cedeno did file a sentencing memorandum in which he purported to comply with that requirement, the district court questioned the veracity of the information Cedeno provided. The court also found that the information he gave was vague.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Cedeno requested an additional opportunity to address the court\u2019s concerns, the court proceeded to sentence him based upon the information Cedeno\u2019s first bite of the apple provided. However, the court nevertheless suggested that the government could file a Rule 35 motion to reduce the sentence if appropriate in view of any subsequent information Cedeno might choose to provide. That was both reasonable and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Although Cedeno claims that the district court erred and misunderstood his request for an additional opportunity to obtain evidence for the government, the record does not support that claim. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous, and the resulting sentence was reasonable given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>court\u2019s consideration of the various sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">For all the above reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\">. We have jurisdiction to review all final decisions of the district court of the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">\u201cWe exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and constitutional questions.\u201d <em>United States v.

Cedeno\u2019s sentencing memorandum acknowledged the following language of the United States Sentencing Guidelines:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.
