Gamez-Villagrana argues that he is not removable because he acquired citizenship through his mother, Simona, a United States citizen who is now deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u201c[T]he Constitution is violated when a person with a non-frivolous claim to U.S. citizenship is deported without receiving a judicial determination of that claim.\u201d <em>Rivera v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 1129, 1140 (9th Cir.2005) (as amended). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B), \u201cIf [a] petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner\u2019s nationality is presented, the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court ... for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (authorizing declaratory judgment action).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A petitioner\u2019s claim to citizenship based on the citizenship of his or her parent is determined by looking to the statutes in effect at the time of the petitioner\u2019s birth. <em>See Miller v. Albright, </em>523 U.S. 420, 424, 118 S.Ct. 1428, 140 L.Ed.2d 575 (1998); <em>Solis-Espinoza v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 1090, 1092 (9th Cir.2005). It is undisputed that (1) Gamez-Villagrana was born in Mexico on March 8, 1957, (2) his mother was a United States citizen, and (3) his father was a Mexican national. Based on these facts, and on other evidence in the record, including Gamez-Villagrana\u2019s testimony before the IJ, his mother\u2019s baptismal record, her FICA record, his parents\u2019 marriage certificate, and a letter from Simona\u2019s younger sister, Bernarda, we find that a genuine issue of fact exists concerning whether petitioner acquired United States citizenship under the versions of INA \u00a7\u00a7 301(a)(7), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(g), and 309(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(c), in effect at the time of his birth in 1957. We therefore transfer this proceeding to the federal district court for the District of Arizona, where petitioner is in custody, for a de novo hearing on his nationality claim, and hold his \u201cpetition for review in abeyance pending judicial determination of this claim.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Sanchez v. INS, </em>957 F.2d 702, 703 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">We note that petitioner has now been in the custody of the Attorney General, pursuant to INA \u00a7 236(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c), for more than three years. In <em>Tijani v. Willis, </em>430 F.3d 1241, 1242 (9th Cir.2005), we held that \u201cthe authority conferred by \u00a7 1226(c) ... applies] to expedited removal of criminal aliens. Two years and eight months of process is not expeditious.... \u201d Thus, under <em>Tijani, </em>petitioner may well be entitled to habeas relief upon application to the district court given the length of his detention to date and of the \u201cforeseeable process\u201d to come. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Petition HELD IN ABEYANCE; proceeding TRANSFERRED to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
