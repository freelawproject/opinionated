McLaren appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgement in favor of Defendants Ron McNesby, Sheriff of Escambia County, and- Rene Vasquez Reguindin, Deputy Sheriff, on the grounds that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Count I of the complaint is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against Reguindin in his individual capacity for unlawful detention. Count II is a state law claim for unlawful detention pled in the alternative against both Reguindin and McNesby. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Reguindin on Count I and, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims, dismissed Count II without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-19\">We affirm the grant of qualified immunity, agreeing with the district court that McLaren cannot show improper detention as a result of a failure to disclose truly exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
