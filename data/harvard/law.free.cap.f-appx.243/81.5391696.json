Having reviewed the record and the applicable law, and having the benefit of oral argument and the parties\u2019 briefs, we determine that no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a panel opinion. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision largely for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s opinion with a caveat about the court\u2019s treatment of the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment retaliation claim. The plaintiffs alleged that Mayor Gadd retaliated against them because Speedy spoke out against him and supported an opposing candidate for mayor. According to the plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint, this retaliation took the form of \u201ca taking of Plaintiffs\u2019 personal and real property interests with threats of a lawsuit.\u201d As the district court correctly recognized, a \u201cretaliation claim essentially entails three elements: (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between elements one and two\u2014that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiffs protected conduct.\u201d <em>Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, </em>175 F.3d 378, 394 (6th Cir.1999). Our review confirms that the plaintiffs met the first two prongs of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>test\u2014Speedy engaged in protected conduct, and the plaintiffs demonstrate opposition by a government official that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from speaking. To the extent that the district court\u2019s opinion can be read to require the plaintiffs to show that the opposition deterred Speedy in a subjective sense, we do not endorse its view. Nevertheless, as the district court properly concluded, the plaintiffs are unable to meet their burden to demonstrate any causal nexus between Speedy\u2019s speech and the defendants\u2019 actions. The record does not support the conclusion that the allegedly retaliatory lawsuit stemmed from anything other than a business dispute unrelated to Speedy\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons set forth above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
