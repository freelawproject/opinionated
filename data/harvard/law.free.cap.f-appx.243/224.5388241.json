The California Service Center of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied HSPC\u2019s petition; the Administrative Appeals Office (\u201cAAO\u201d) dismissed HSPC\u2019s appeal; and the district court affirmed. In this appeal, HSPC contends that it was error for the AAO to require the church to prove that Kim had worked full time as a minister during the two years immediately preceding the visa petition. HSPC further contends that, even if the AAO\u2019s interpretation of the law is proper, the church produced sufficient evidence of Kim\u2019s full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">Our review focuses on the AAO\u2019s decision, which we analyze \u201cfrom the same position as the district court.\u201d W. <em>Radio Servs. Co. v. Espy, </em>79 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir.1996). We may reverse that decision only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d or is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">By statute, a minister may qualify for a special immigrant religious worker visa only if he (1) has been a member of a bona fide religious denomination for at least two years, (2) \u201cseeks to enter the United States ... solely for purpose of carrying on the vocation of a minister of that religious denomination,\u201d and (3) \u201chas been carrying on such vocation ... continuously for at least the [immediately preceding] 2-year period.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(C); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(4). These requirements are restated in regulatory form at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(m). The applicable statutes and regulations neither expressly require religious workers to carry on their vocations full time during the two years preceding their petitions nor expressly foreclose such a reading. The AAO\u2019s adoption of a full-time employment requirement accords with <em>Matter of Faith Assembly Church, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 391 (BIA 1986), in which the BIA held that \u201cpart-time ministerial employment\u201d did not qualify a minister for special immigrant classification under a prior version of \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(C). <em>Id. </em>at 393. The BIA explained that the statute \u201crequires the minister to have been and intend to be engaged solely as a minister of a religious denomination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the BIA\u2019s decision in that case was neither arbitrary nor manifestly contrary to the statute, we conclude that it was reasonable for the AAO to follow the BIA\u2019s lead and require a showing of full-time employment. <em>Cf. Garcia-Quintero v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 1006, 1011-14 (9th Cir.2006) (explaining that <em>Chevron </em>deference is appropriate when the BIA construes an immigration statute in a published disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Substantial evidence supports the AAO\u2019s finding that HSPC failed to prove that Kim had worked full time as a minister during the two years immediately preceding its petition. The AAO was legitimately concerned by inconsistencies in HSPC\u2019s financial records and by HSPC\u2019s failure to provide tax documents, bank statements, or similar information to establish Kim\u2019s full-time employment. We agree with the district court that the discrepancies in the record, and HSPC\u2019s failure to account fully for those discrepancies, provide a sufficient basis for the AAO\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
