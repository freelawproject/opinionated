He now appeals his sentence. He presents the following grounds: (1) that the district court committed plain error at the sentencing hearing by receiving into evidence certain exhibits offered by the Government; (2) the court erred in finding appellant eligible for career offender status; (3) the court denied appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by using his prior convictions to enhance his sentence as a career offender because the convictions were not alleged in the indictment and established by a jury; and (4) the Government breached its promise to move the court for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. We consider these grounds in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The first ground is meritless. The Government introduced a DEA report, exhibit 1, which indicated that appellant had allegedly solicited a murder, and a signed plea agreement, exhibit 4, that was not entered into in open court. Appellant did not question the exhibits\u2019 authenticity, but contends that the exhibits were irrelevant. We conclude that they were relevant and sufficiently reliable to enable the court to consider them under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). The court could consider the exhibits because the information they contained related to the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the applicable Sentencing Guidelines. The Government referred to the DEA report in explaining why it did not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and to the plea agreement to shed light on appellant\u2019s understanding of any promises he thought the Government had made to induce his guilty plea. In short, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s consideration of the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The gist of appellant\u2019s second ground is two-fold: the court (1) failed to obtain appellant\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d to its application of the career offender enhancement, and (2) impermissibly treated the career offender enhancement as mandatory. There is nothing in the record to support either point. Appellant made no objection to the existence of the prior convictions the court considered, and cites no authority that barred the court from taking them into account in fashioning his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">As to appellant\u2019s third ground, the record reveals no constitutional challenge (by appellant) to the sentence he received. We therefore review his argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2005). We find no error, much less error that is plain. His argument therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s fourth ground\u2014the Government\u2019s failure to seek a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. The filing of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. Nonetheless, the court may inquire of the prosecutor in order to determine whether the Government\u2019s decision not to seek a departure is based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Absent a finding that the withholding is based on such motive, the court proceeds no further. Here, appellant did not contend that the Government\u2019s decision was unconstitutionally motivated. His fourth ground therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
