To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion, and claims of due process violations due to ineffective assistance of counsel <em>de novo. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Ge\u2019s pro se brief largely addresses the IJ\u2019s underlying order denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We lack jurisdiction to review that determination, because Ge failed to file a timely petition for review of that decision with this court. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Liberally construing Ge\u2019s contentions as challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider, the BIA acted within its discretion because Ge failed to demonstrate he has plausible grounds for relief, and the presumption of prejudice created by his former attorney\u2019s failure to file a brief with the BIA is rebutted. <em>See Amarjit Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1189-90 (9th Cir.2004) (to demonstrate plausible grounds for relief, \u201c[petitioner] must show that the BIA could plausibly have determined that he was [eligible for relief] based on the record before it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b360-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
