At sentencing, Vega-Gomez received a 12-level enhancement based on a previous conviction for delivery of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 34 months\u2019 imprisonment. Vega-Gomez now appeals his sentence, arguing that (1) the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) (2005); and (2) the enhancement provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. For the following reasons, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">On October 13, 2005, Vega-Gomez pleaded guilty, without a written plea agreement, to attempting to reenter the United States after previously having been deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a 12-level enhancement because of a prior conviction for an Illinois drug offense which called for a sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>13 months or less.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This recommendation was based on an Illinois state court conviction for delivery of cocaine in which Vega-Gomez was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Prior to sentencing, Vega-Gomez asserted that the 12-level upward adjustment was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because it enhanced his sentence beyond 2 years. In doing so, Vega-Gomez asked the court to hold that \u00a7 1326(b) was \u201cfacially unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Vega-Gomez\u2019s objection to the application of the \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d enhancement based on <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United </em>States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, Vega-Gomez\u2019s advisory guidelines imprisonment range was 30 to 37 months. The court sentenced him to 34 months, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Vega-Gomez raises two issues: (1) whether the district court misapplied the Guidelines when it enhanced his offense level by 12 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B); and (2) whether the enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Vega-Gomez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence by 12 levels because the Illinois conviction for delivery of a controlled substance includes acts that cannot form the basis for a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). As Vega-Gomez concedes, we review for plain error since he did not object in the district court to the 12-level enhancement on the basis that his conviction did not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">Plain error exists when \u201c(1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if these conditions are met, an appellate court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">Vega-Gomez argues that a conviction for delivery of a controlled substance under 56J4 111. Comp. Stat. Ann. 111401 (West 1988)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d because a person can be found criminally liable for \u201cdelivery\u201d even if the person only solicited the delivery of drugs,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that solicitation does not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d We assume without deciding that Vega-Gomez is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-19\">We conclude, however, that even if the district court committed obvious error, Vega-Gomez has failed to satisfy the third prong of plain error review. Vega-Gomez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>bears the burden of proving that the error affected his substantial rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To meet that burden, he must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would have received a lesser sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Vega-Gomez does not argue to us that his conviction was for solicitation, the conduct prohibited under the Illinois statute that may not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Vega-Gomez does not contend that were the district court to review allowable evidence, that this evidence would show that the conduct for which he was convicted was limited to solicitation and, therefore, not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, Vega-Gomez simply shows that without the 12-level enhancement he would have received a shorter sentence. Without at least arguing that the drug trafficking enhancement was ultimately wrong, Vega-Gomez cannot show that he would have received a lesser sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Vega-Gomez has not shown that the error\u2014if any\u2014affected his substantial rights. Therefore, his argument fails under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Vega-Gomez contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Vega-Gomez concedes that his challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and raises the argument to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
