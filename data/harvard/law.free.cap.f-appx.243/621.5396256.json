Walker appeals from an October 31, 2005 judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (McMahon, <em>J.), </em>convicting Walker of 60 counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-16\">In a nutshell, Walker\u2019s convictions arise from the operations of his company Program Corporation of America (\u201cPCA\u201d), which charged commissions for booking speaking engagements. As PCA\u2019s finances deteriorated in 2001, Walker began (1) to pocket speakers\u2019 fees, responding to their demands for payment with evasion, misrepresentation, or outright refusal; and (2) to pocket deposit payments from venues without arranging for the appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"AKL\">Walker\u2019s brief argues that his convictions should be overturned because (1) the district court refused to disqualify prosecuting attorneys who had seen four privileged documents seized from Walker\u2019s home in a search conducted pursuant to a warrant, and screened by an insulated team of prosecutors; and (2) the district court removed a particular juror\u2014one favored by Walker\u2014before the trial began after asking him \u201cleading\u201d questions about his ability to concentrate on his duties as a juror. Although he is represented by counsel on appeal, Walker was permitted to file a pro se \u201csupplemental appeal,\u201d which is a lengthy catalog of factual allegations that, in our view, raises no cognizable objection other than the supposed bias of the district court judge. This Court, like a trial court, is not obligated to allow Walker to follow a course of hybrid pro se representation under which he files both a counseled and pro se brief. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>101 F.3d 17, 19 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>83 F.3d 60, 67 (2d Cir.1996). Nevertheless, we will address his allegations of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"A9R\">\n<em>Disqualification of Prosecutors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-20\">Walker complained to the district court that 170 of the documents obtained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>search and passed on to the trial team were privileged. Of the 170 documents\u2014 none of which the government used at trial\u2014the district court concluded that one document was privileged and that three others were protected by the work-product doctrine. Because the prosecutors had engaged in no affirmative misconduct, and because they had gained no insight into Walker\u2019s defense through their limited exposure to the handful of privileged documents, the district court declined to grant Walker the extreme relief of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">A district court\u2019s refusal to disqualify an attorney is reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>881 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Locascio, </em>6 F.3d 924, 931 (2d Cir.1993)); the same standard applies where the attorney is a prosecutor, <em>see United States v. Badalamenti, </em>794 F.2d 821, 828 (2d Cir.1986). At least one district court has disqualified prosecutors who engaged in \u201cserious misconduct\u201d by reviewing and copying\u2014against the district court\u2019s explicit instructions\u2014attorney work product that \u201cprovided an important insight into defense tactics, strategy, and problems.\u201d <em>United States v. Horn, </em>811 F.Supp. 739, 750-51 (D.N.H.1992), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>29 F.3d 754 (1st Cir.1994). Unlike the defendant in <em>Horn, </em>however, Walker has suffered no prejudice; the documents at issue could not possibly have provided insight into defense strategy or into the relationship between Walker and his attorney. Exhibits one through three are handwritten lists of dates, financial entries, and contract statistics concerning PCA; according to Walker, they were prepared for Walker\u2019s defense. The fourth document is a letter from Walker to his attorney tersely asking for advice about how to respond to a communication from a creditor and attaching non-privileged documents. Neither the letter nor the handwritten lists should have been reviewed by the trial prosecutors; but they did not do the screening, and (more importantly) any theory of prejudice to Walker\u2019s defense is far too attenuated to indicate that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The same is true as to the remainder of the 170 documents, which were composed chiefly of various form printouts summarizing PCA\u2019s contracts. Even assuming the documents (or the handful of corrections and clarifications handwritten thereon) were work product or were privileged, they contain solely factual information about PCA\u2019s business, and shed no light on Walker\u2019s confidential communications with counsel or defense strategy. Moreover, we agree with the district court that these documents were neither work product nor attorney-client communications. The attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure the contents of confidential attorney-client communications, but does not prevent disclosure from the client\u2019s records the underlying factual information included in attorney-client communications. <em>See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 </em>U.S. 383, 395, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). For this reason, putting otherwise non-privileged business records (like the contract summaries here) in the hands of an attorney\u2014or printing out such records for an attorney to review\u2014 does not render the documents privileged or work product. <em>See Ratliff v, Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, </em>354 F.3d 165,170-71 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cDocuments obtain no special protection because they are housed in a law firm; \u2018[a]ny other rule would permit a person to prevent disclosure of any of his papers by the simple expedient of keeping them in the possession of his attorney.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Colton v. United States, </em>306 F.2d 633, 639 (2d Cir.1962)); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, </em>318 F.3d 379, 384 (2d Cir.2003) (stating that the work product doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>generally does not \u201cshield[] from discovery materials in an attorney\u2019s possession that were prepared neither by the attorney nor his agents\u201d). Moreover, the \u201cselection and compilation of ... documents by counsel transforms that material into attorney work product\u201d only if there is \u201ca real, rather than speculative, concern that counsel\u2019s thought processes in relation to pending or anticipated litigation will be exposed through disclosure of the compiled documents.\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, </em>318 F.3d at 386 (internal quotation marks omitted). Walker has failed to raise such a real concern here.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The district court acted within its discretion when it refused to disqualify the prosecutors who inadvertently reviewed the documents. Because we see no indication in the record that the prosecutors committed egregious misconduct, we express no opinion on whether such misconduct would call for disqualification without substantial prejudice to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\n<em>Juror Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">At voir dire, Juror Number 10 was initially the subject of a government peremptory challenge. After the district court sustained a <em>Batson </em>objection from Walker and reseated the juror, the panel was sworn in. Later, Juror Number 10 called the judge to express concerns about the income he would lose by jury service. When questioned by the district court on the subject, the juror averred that he would be a \u201ccompetent juror\u201d notwithstanding his financial situation\u2014but moments later said that he thought the financial strain would distract him from his duties as a juror. The district court discharged him. Walker complains that the district court asked the juror leading questions about whether hardship would be a distraction, and thereby \u201cencouraged\u201d the juror to say he would be unfit to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a juror for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>352 F.3d 65, 68 (2d Cir.2003). We will not disturb the district court\u2019s decision \u201cwithout a showing of bias or prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe issue of what, if any, inquiry must be made before deciding whether a juror should be excused ... is committed to the judge\u2019s discretion ... [and] this court need only satisfy itself that the district court had sufficient information to make an informed decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Mulder, </em>273 F.3d 91, 108 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in discharging Juror Number 10; the district judge conducted a searching inquiry to determine whether the juror would be distracted from his duties. Walker\u2019s argument that the judge erred by continuing to question after the juror\u2019s initial reassuring response is unsupported by precedent or reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">\n<em>Judicial Bias</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Walker\u2019s supplemental submission argues that the district court judge personally disliked him and exhibited bias against him both before and during his trial. Chiefly, he takes issue with (1) statements reflecting impatience with Walker\u2019s late request that his trial be delayed after he had a dispute with his attorney and (2) statements to the effect that Walker\u2019s conduct showed an unwillingness to respect the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">A judge must recuse herself \u201cin any proceeding in which [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d or where she \u201chas a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), (b)(1). \u201cTo ensure that a party does not \u2018hedg[e] its bets against the eventual outcome\u2019 of a proceeding, a party must move <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>for recusal \u2018at the earliest possible moment after obtaining knowledge of facts demonstrating the basis for such a claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Amico, </em>486 F.3d 764, 773 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Apple v. Jewish Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., </em>829 F.2d 326, 333-34 (2d Cir.1987)). Walker never requested recusal in the district court, and bases his claim of bias on statements made in open court, not on any information he obtained subsequent to his conviction. Walker fails to explain why he delayed raising the issue of bias, and we are not required to review allegations of bias that could have been brought in a motion for recusal but are instead raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See LoCascio v. United States, </em>473 F.3d 493, 496 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, even if Walker\u2019s allegations of bias had been timely raised before the district court, they are meritless. The comments cited by Walker arose out of events in the course of the proceedings, and the record shows no sign of any \u201cdeep-seated favoritism or antagonism\u201d on the judge\u2019s part. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We have reviewed the remainder of Walker\u2019s arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Walker\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
