He appeals from the denial of a motion for sentence modification putatively brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He asserts that the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), met the conditions precedent for an alternative sentence announced by the district court. He therefore requests that his sentence be modified accordingly or that his case be remanded for resentencing. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it is barred by the terms of an appeal waiver contained in Phan\u2019s plea agreement and, alternatively, requests an extension of time in which to respond if Phan\u2019s appeal is not dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>The district court\u2019s jurisdiction to correct or modify a defendant\u2019s sentence is limited to those specific circumstances enumerated by Congress in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b). <em>See United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997). The record does not show that his motion for resentencing in the district court falls under any provision of \u00a7 3582. Although the motion could be construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court did not suggest that it was so construing the motion, and it did not provide Phan notice. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Consequently, the motion did not arise under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Phan\u2019s motion was an unauthorized motion which the district court correctly concluded that it was without jurisdiction to consider. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Phan\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and should be dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, Phan\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of the appeal waiver is DENIED as unnecessary. The Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot. Phan\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
