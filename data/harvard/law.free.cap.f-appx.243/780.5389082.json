This apartment building is a three story, wood-framed building containing twelve individual units. Jonathan Dean was the tenant in apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>four, in the basement of 211 Whitewood Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Deputy Fire Marshall James Barber responded to the address around midnight on the morning of November 6, 2006. Barber was an investigator for the Albemarle County Fire Marshall\u2019s Office. Barber\u2019s training included instruction in the cause of fires and in incendiary devices and explosives. Upon arriving, Barber could smell gasoline fumes in the pai\u2019king lot outside the building and in the common areas inside the building. In investigating the source of the fumes, Barber observed a window that was opened several inches and covered by a screen. Barber was able to look through the window and into Jonathan Dean\u2019s bedroom. As Barber stood outside and looked in the room, he observed a red plastic gasoline can with the lid off. Barber also observed a drop cord, a box of C02 cartridges, a box that appeared to have been scorched, and a lamp that was plugged in and turned on.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Barber then knocked on Dean\u2019s door. After receiving no response, Barber went to his truck and retrieved his camera. Barber returned to Dean\u2019s door and knocked again. When he still received no answer, Barber unlocked Dean\u2019s door using a key provided by the apartment manager and entered Dean\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The front door of Dean\u2019s apartment led into a small hallway. Dean\u2019s kitchen was immediately to the right of the front door. As Barber looked into Dean\u2019s kitchen he observed three two-liter bottles modified with initiator wires, bottle caps modified with Shrader or tire pressure valves, propane tanks, batteries, and wires. Based on his training and experience, Barber knew that these objects could be used to create explosive devices. Barber photographed what he observed in the kitchen. He then proceeded to Dean\u2019s bedroom, photographed the gas can, and then removed it by taking it out the front door. Barber then left to secure a search warrant. Meanwhile, county police located Dean, handcuffed him, and detained him pending the search of his apartment. After being informed of his rights, Dean made statements that \u201cthey were just messing around\u201d and that \u201che was not a terrorist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">After Barber secured a search warrant, Dean\u2019s apartment was searched for bomb making materials and a number of items were seized. The police later secured a second warrant to search computers found in Dean\u2019s apartment for information on manufacturing explosives. During this search for bomb making information, the police discovered evidence of child pornography on Dean\u2019s computers. The police then secured a third warrant to search Dean\u2019s computers for child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Dean was ultimately charged in a four count indictment. Counts One and Two charged Dean with possession of a destructive device, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5845(a) and (f) (2000) and 5861(d) (2000); Count Three charged Dean with possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) (2000) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) (West 2000 and Supp.2007); and Count Four was a forfeiture provision. After the district court denied Dean\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from his apartment, Dean pled guilty to Counts One, Two, and Three pursuant to a plea agreement. Dean\u2019s agreement specifically preserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. Dean timely noted his appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">\u201cSearches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable\u201d unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies. <em>See Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 583, 587, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). A warrantless search of a home may be justified when exigent circumstances, such as an emergency, necessitate the search. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number><em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 394, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978). For a warrantless search to qualify under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement, the police must possess an objectively reasonable belief that an emergency existed that required immediate entry to render assistance or prevent harm to persons or property within. <em>United, States v. Moss, </em>963 F.2d 673, 678 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Here, the initial warrantless entry into Dean\u2019s apartment falls within the emergency exception to the warrant requirement. The Albemarle County Fire Department received a call sometime after 11:30 p.m. regarding gasoline fumes in a wood-framed, three story apartment building. Gas fumes were noticeable in the parking lot outside of the apartment building and in the common areas inside the building. Looking through a ground level window into Dean\u2019s apartment, Barber observed a red gas can with its top off. Based on his training and experience, Barber considered the gas can an imminent threat and knew that an explosion and flash fire were possible if the mixture of air and gas was right and a source of ignition was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">After making his observations, Barber twice knocked on Dean\u2019s door, and after receiving no response, Barber entered Dean\u2019s apartment. Once inside, Barber observed in Dean\u2019s kitchen devices that could be used to make explosives. Barber photographed these materials but did not spend long looking at Dean\u2019s bomb making equipment. Barber was in Dean\u2019s apartment no more than two minutes. During these two minutes, Barber took less than twenty-four photographs and then removed the gas can.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Prior to entering Dean\u2019s apartment, Barber had an objectively reasonable belief that the gas fumes filling the apartment building created an emergency and that immediate entry was necessary to prevent harm to other people in the apartment building. <em>Moss, </em>963 F.2d at 678. Moreover, once inside, Barber did not engage \u201cin a general voyage of discovery\u201d but took no more than twenty-four photographs and then removed the imminent threat. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Barber\u2019s initial warrantless entry into Dean\u2019s apartment was justified by the emergency exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Once lawfully in Dean\u2019s apartment, Barber was not required to close his eyes to the materials he observed openly in Dean\u2019s kitchen and that his training and experience told him were potential bomb making materials. Barber then properly used his brief observations to secure a warrant authorizing a search of Dean\u2019s apartment for bomb making materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Similarly, while searching Dean\u2019s computer pursuant to the second warrant, the police discovered evidence of child pornography. This evidence was then used to secure the third warrant to search Dean\u2019s computer for child pornography. Because the initial search of Dean\u2019s apartment occurred pursuant to a valid, recognized exception to the warrant requirement, Dean\u2019s statements made after being detained and his child pornography were not fruit of the poisonous tree. <em>See United States v. Banks, </em>482 F.3d 733, 738 (4th Cir.2007). Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Dean\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
