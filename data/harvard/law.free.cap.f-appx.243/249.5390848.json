We reject all three arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The district court did not plainly err in discussing Adams\u2019 financial resources in imposing the fine. Socioeconomic status is different than financial resources. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary 1361 (4th ed.2005) (defining \u201csocioeconomic\u201d as \u201cof or involving both social and economic factors\u201d). The former has no place in sentencing, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.10 (Nov.2005), but the latter is required by statute, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a) (\u201cIn determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount ... the court shall consider ... (1) the defendant\u2019s income, earning capacity, and financial resources\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d) (Nov.2005) (\u201cIn determining the amount of the fine, the court shall consider ... defendant\u2019s ability to pay ... in light of his earning capacity and financial resources ....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Adams\u2019 reliance on <em>United States v. Painter, </em>375 F.3d 336 (5th Cir.2004), and <em>United States v. Graham, </em>946 F.2d 19 (4th Cir.1991), for the proposition that wealth cannot be considered in imposing a fine is misplaced. These out-of-circuit cases consider challenges to upward departures. The pertinent question in a departure case is whether \u201cthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b). Because \u201cthe Sentencing Commission adequately considered a defendant\u2019s ability to pay in formulating the fine guideline,\u201d the district court in <em>Graham </em>erred in basing the departure on the defendant\u2019s financial resources. 946 F.2d at 21. No departure is at issue in this case so <em>Graham </em>and <em>Painter </em>are inapposite. The district court is required by statute to consider a defendant\u2019s financial resources in imposing a sentence in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Further, the district court did not draw a negative inference or otherwise penalize Adams for failing to disclose information about his drug operation. Rather, the district court specifically recognized Adams\u2019 right to remain silent and noted it would have to rely solely on the government\u2019s evidence in determining the extent of gain or loss. This is not contrary to <em>Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999). <em>See United States v. Romero-Rendon, </em>220 F.3d 1159 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Finally, Adams provides no legal authority for the proposition that a fine can be imposed only where ill-gotten gains are shown. Instead, ill-gotten gains are but one factor among many to be considered in imposing a fine. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a)(5). The district court specifically referenced \u00a7 3572 in imposing Adams\u2019 fine and discussed the appropriate factors, including the absence of evidence showing ill-gotten gains. The district court im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>posed a within-Guidelines sentence and that sentence was reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
