The decision denied asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-21\">Because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). An IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is unentitled to asylum \u201cmust be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cUnder this highly deferential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>ney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only-supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We address Salvatierra\u2019s asylum claim first. The IJ determined that Salvatierra\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that extraordinary circumstances did not excuse the untimely filing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government asserts that we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Salvatierra was ineligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We review \u201cquestions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). An asylum application must be \u201cfiled within [one] year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). But the determination of whether an alien can apply for asylum is left exclusively to the Attorney General; so we do not have jurisdiction to review a decision about whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Salvatierra\u2019s asylum application was untimely. We also lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination on whether extraordinary circumstances excused the untimely filing of Salvatierra\u2019s asylum application. <em>Id. </em>We dismiss Salvatierra\u2019s petition for review on his asylum claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">We now address Salvatierra\u2019s withholding of removal claim. An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his life or freedom would be threatened because of a protected ground, such as political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Therefore, an alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon return to his country of nationality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. \u201cAn alien cannot demonstrate that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the IJ finds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Here, the IJ denied Salvatierra\u2019s withholding of removal claim on three grounds: (1) Salvatierra\u2019s failure to show a nexus between a protected ground and the alleged past persecution; (2) his failure to establish past persecution; and (3) his failure to show that the option of relocating within Argentina\u2014to avoid the threat against him\u2014was unavailable. We conclude that each of these findings is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Salvatierra produced no evidence of an actual or imputed political opinion that resulted in the alleged persecution. Salvatierra testified that he worked at Okasa, a courier company in Argentina, for several years until he left to work at his own courier company. After he left Okasa, Salvatierra received several threats, including a threat allegedly from his former boss at Okasa, explaining that Salvatierra needed to be careful and to stop what he was doing. Salvatierra testified that a threatening note was left at his house when his television was stolen and that some of his couriers were robbed and told to give him a warning. Even if we assume that Okasa was responsible for these acts and that Salvatierra was correct that his former employer had a \u201ctight relationship\u201d with the Argentinian government, Salvatierra has not shown that his refusal to cooperate with his former employer constituted a political opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">And the record does not compel the conclusion that the acts against Salvatierra constituted persecution. Salvatierra testified that he received threats for several years; but he acknowledged that neither he nor his family was physically harmed. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Salvatierra did not suffer persecution. <em>See Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that persecution is an \u201cextreme concept,\u201d which \u201crequires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, unaccompanied by any physical punishment, infliction of harm, or significant deprivation of liberty\u201d and that \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Salvatierra did not show that he would continue to have problems in Argentina if he relocated to a different part of the country. Even though Salvatierra testified that he would not be safe in Argentina, he did not indicate that he attempted to relocate within that country. And the record, which included State Department Country Reports on Argentina\u2019s human rights practices, does not show that Okasa presented a country-wide threat. In fact, Salvatierra testified that he was not aware of other private courier companies in Argentina having the same problems as he experienced. Salvatierra has not demonstrated that the option of relocating within Argentina is unavailable; so he has not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">Because Salvatierra has failed to establish that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted in Argentina, he also has not established \u201ctorture\u201d sufficient to warrant CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (explaining that, to obtain CAT relief, the burden is on the alien to establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured in his country of origin). We deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Salvatierras petition on his withholding of removal and CAT relief claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-14\">. Salvatierra included his wife and children as derivatives in his asylum application. We refer only to Salvatierra in this opinion; but our decision about Salvatierra also applies to his wife and children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\">. Salvatierra entered the United States in February 2001; and his wife and children entered the United States in March 2001. Salvatierra filed his asylum application in July 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">. We note that the jurisdictional provisions of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 310 (2005), do not affect this conclusion because, although the REAL ID Act provides that we retain jurisdiction over \"constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,\u201d see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), the IJ's determination of the timeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or a reviewable question of law. <em>See Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 957.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b520-12\">. If the alien establishes past persecution in his country based on a protected ground, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country unless the government shows by a preponderance of evidence that, among other things, (1) the country's conditions have changed such that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened; or (2) it would be reasonable for the alien to relocate to another part of the country. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. An alien who has not shown past persecution may be entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. Salvatierra also testified that persons working for the \u201cpost office workers union\u201d came to his business, asked to see certain documentation, and told Salvatierra to pay them a fee. The record does not show that Salvatierra's refusal to pay the requested fee imputed a certain political opinion to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
