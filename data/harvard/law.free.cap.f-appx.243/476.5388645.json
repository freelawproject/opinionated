Because the changes made by Amendment 591 to the Guidelines had no impact on Crawford\u2019s sentence in this case, the district court correctly denied Crawford\u2019s request for sentencing relief as outside the \u201cscope\u201d of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and we AFFIRM in part as to that portion of the district court\u2019s order. Because the district court never considered whether to issue a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the portion of its order denying Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, however, we REMAND in part for consideration of which, if any, issues meet the COA standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In June 1995, Crawford was indicted along with six other individuals and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), (b)(l)(A)(iii), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. A jury found him guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In calculating Crawford\u2019s sentencing range, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) grouped Crawford\u2019s two counts of conviction together pursuant to U.S.S.G.\u00a7 3D1.2(d) (1994) and noted that the base offense level for a \u00a7 846 offense was found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The PSI initially assigned a base offense level of 38, which the district court later reduced to 36 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) based on the court\u2019s finding that the offense involved between 500 grams and 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. After applying 2-level enhancements for a co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, the court found that Crawford had a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of I, resulting in a guideline sentencing range of 292 to 365 months of imprisonment. The court sentenced Crawford to 292 months of imprisonment, and we affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Stallworth, </em>No. 95-3533, 121 F.3d 721 (11th Cir. July 22, 1997) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In 1998, Crawford filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, which the district court denied. Both the district court and our court denied a COA. After the conclusion of his \u00a7 2255 proceedings, Crawford also filed (1) an application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, which we denied; and (2) a motion for a new sentencing hearing, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Crawford then filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to modify his sentence based upon a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Crawford stated that retroactive application of Amendment 591 to the Guidelines would result in the reduction of his sentence because, under that amendment, a district court must base its selection of the applicable offense guideline only on the charged offense, not simply a finding that the defendant had engaged in conduct covered by that guideline. Crawford then asserted that the district court violated his Confrontation Clause rights by enhancing his sentence based on unreliable hearsay evidence regarding drug quantity and a co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm. Crawford argued that, \u201c[bjecause the scope of conduct for which a defendant can be held accountable under the sentencing guidelines is significantly narrower than the conduct embraced by the law of Conspiracy,\u201d district courts may not \u201cwithout further findings simply sentence a defendant according to the amount of narcotics involved in the conspiracy.\u201d R352 at 7. Crawford then asserted that (1) the government failed to prove disputed sentencing facts by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) the district court sentenced him based on the total drug quantity involved in the conspiracy without properly considering his lesser role in the conspiracy; (3) he should have received a four-level minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2; and (4) he should not have received a two-level firearm enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b) because his co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a weapon was not \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-11. Crawford thus concluded that his total offense level should be 30, and that the district court had the discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to vacate his sentence and resentence him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>within a guideline range of 97 to 121 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Without requiring the government to respond, the district court denied Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction because the motion is an attempt to file a second Section 2255 petition, without Circuit authorization.\u201d R353. The court further stated that Crawford\u2019s motion was \u201c[a]lso DENIED on the merits because it is not within the scope of Section 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Crawford filed a timely notice of appeal, which the district court did not construe as a motion for a COA. Crawford then moved in our court for leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d). We granted Crawford\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">A. <em>The Requirement of a COA in this Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">As an initial matter, it appears that at least a portion of Crawford\u2019s appeal is not properly before us. As noted above, the district court denied Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on two grounds: (1) for lack of jurisdiction because it was an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and (2) on the merits because it was not within the \u201cscope\u201d of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). R-353. To the extent that the district court denied Crawford\u2019s motion on the ground that it was not within the \u201cscope\u201d of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), that portion of the judgment would be appealable as a final order of the district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">To the extent the district court denied relief on the ground that the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was, in substance, a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, however, Crawford must receive a COA to appeal that portion of the order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (providing that \u201cunless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from\u2014(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court; or (B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d). Because Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, at least in part, challenged the constitutionality of his sentence under the Confrontation Clause, the district court correctly construed the filing as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Means v. Alabama, </em>209 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (citation omitted) (noting that federal courts must look beyond the labels of motions filed by <em>pro se </em>inmates to interpret them under whatever statute would provide relief); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (providing the exclusive statutory vehicle for a federal prisoner to claim \u201cthe right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence\u201d). As such, Crawford would need a COA to proceed as to that portion of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">As noted above, Crawford properly filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, but the district court did not construe the notice of appeal as a motion for COA, and, thus, never considered whether to issue a COA. We will not make the initial determination of whether to issue a COA; the district court must rule first. <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam). Accordingly, we order a limited remand in part for the district court to consider which issues, if any, meet the standard for issuance of a COA, pursuant to <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">Because the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying Crawford\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as outside the \u201cscope\u201d of \u00a7 3582 is properly before us as an appeal under \u00a7 1291, and because the parties already have submitted their appellate briefs, in the interest of judicial economy we will address Crawford\u2019s appeal from that portion of the judgment without waiting for the district court\u2019s ruling on a COA on the other portion of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">B. <em>The Merits of Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">On appeal, Crawford reasserts essentially <em>verbatim </em>the arguments he initially raised in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Again, Crawford contends that Amendment 591 would result in the reduction of his sentence because the selection of the offense guideline must be based only on the offense of conviction, not a finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct fell within a particular guideline. Crawford argues that the district court violated his Confrontation Clause rights by enhancing his sentence based on unreliable hearsay testimony regarding the total drug quantity involved in the conspiracy and a co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm. Crawford contends that relevant conduct under the Guidelines is a narrower concept than the \u201claw of Conspiracy,\u201d and that the district court must make additional findings before holding a defendant accountable for the total amount of drugs in a conspiracy. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. As before, Crawford argues that (1) the government failed to prove disputed sentencing facts by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) the district court sentenced him based on the total drug quantity involved in the conspiracy without properly weighing his lesser role in the offense; (3) he deserved a four-level minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2; and (4) his \u00a7 2Dl.l(b) firearm enhancement was improper because his co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a weapon was not \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-17. Crawford again concludes that his total offense level should be 30, and that the district court had the discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to vacate his sentence and resentence him within a guideline range of 97 to 121 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In his reply brief, Crawford also argues (for the first time) that we should consider whether <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. Crawford acknowledges our contrary holding in <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1050, 126 S.Ct. 1643, 164 L.Ed.2d 351 (2006), but asserts that \u201c[s]ome circuits ha[ve] held that <em>[Booker </em>] does [apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 1. Crawford then briefly reiterates his claim that Amendment 591 prohibited the district court from considering his relevant conduct in setting his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when that defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that has been subsequently lowered by the Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Before granting a sentence modification, however, a district court must consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, and evaluate whether such a reduction is \u201cconsistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 3553(a) provides that the court must evaluate, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, the law permits, but does not require, a district court to resentence a defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1255 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (citation omitted). Moreover, only amendments listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) may be applied retroactively using a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999). Amendment 591 is one of the amendments listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e); <em>Moreno, 421 </em>F.3d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We do not require a district court to make specific findings explaining its decision not to resentence a defendant, so long as the court clearly considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and set forth adequate reasons for its refusal to modify the original sentence. <em>Brown, </em>104 F.3d at 1255. Moreover, a sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a de novo resentencing. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781 (citation omitted). All original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the language of several sentencing guidelines to address \u201ca circuit conflict regarding whether the enhanced penalties in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 ... applied] only in a case in which the defendant was convicted of an offense referenced to that guideline or, alternatively, in any case in which the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct included drug sales in a protected location or involving a protected individual.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 591 at \u201cReason for Amendment\u201d (Nov.2000). By its explicit terms, Amendment 591 simply clarified that, \u201cin order for the enhanced penalties in \u00a7 2D1.2 to apply, the defendant must [have been] convicted of an offense referenced to \u00a7 2D1.2, rather than simply have engaged in conduct described by that guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 2D1.2(a)(l) provides heightened base offense levels for drug offenses involving a \u201cprotected location or an underage or pregnant individual.\u201d Only defendants convicted of offenses under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859, 860, and 861 are subject to the enhanced penalties of \u00a7 2D1.2. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2, comment. (Statutory Provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In <em>Moreno, </em>the defendant sought a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendment 591 prohibited the district court from selecting a base offense level of 38 within \u00a7 2D1.1 because that level was not based solely on the jury verdict in his case, which did not reference a drug quantity. 421 F.3d at 1219. We noted that \u201cAmendment 591 directs the district court to apply the guideline dictated by the statute of conviction, but does not constrain the use of judicially found facts to select a base offense level within the relevant guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219-20 (citation omitted). We observed that Moreno\u2019s argument confused two distinct steps: (1) the selection of the applicable offense guideline, and (2) the selection of the base offense level within the relevant offense guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1220. We then agreed with two other circuits in holding that Amendment 591 only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of the specific base offense level within the applicable offense guideline. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Thus, we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Moreno\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Here, the district court correctly found that Crawford\u2019s request for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 591 fell outside the \u201cscope\u201d of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>R-353. By its express terms, Amendment 591 only clarified that the enhanced base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.2 apply only to defendants convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859, 860, and 861. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.2, comment. (Statutory Provisions). Crawford was convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, which are not enumerated offenses subject to the enhanced base offense levels of \u00a7 2D1.2. <em>See Id. </em>As such, the changes made by Amendment 591 had no impact on Crawford\u2019s sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Similarly, to the extent that Crawford contended that Amendment 591 prohibited the district court from setting his base offense level within \u00a7 2D1.1 based on facts not found by the jury, that argument is directly foreclosed by our decision in <em>Moreno. See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Moreover, Crawford\u2019s various other sentencing arguments\u2014that (1) the government failed to prove disputed sentencing facts by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) the district court did not properly weigh his role in the conspiracy before sentencing him based on the total drug quantity involved in the conspiracy; (3) he should have received a mitigating-role reduction; and (4) the firearm enhancement was improper because the co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a weapon was not \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d\u2014are not based on any retroactive guideline amendment, and, thus, are not properly raised in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Finally, Crawford\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, raised for the first time in his reply brief, is not properly presented to us. <em>See United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104-05 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that a <em>Booker </em>claim cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief). Even if Crawford\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument was properly raised on appeal, however, it would be without merit. In <em>Moreno, </em>we additionally held that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions because it is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment promulgated by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Accordingly, <em>Booker </em>does not provide a jurisdictional basis to modify and reduce Crawford\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM in part, and order a limited REMAND in part for the district court to consider which issues, if any, meet the standard for issuance of a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, LIMITED REMAND IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
