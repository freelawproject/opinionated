FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, Chief Judge, Hon. JOHN L. COFFEY, Circuit Judge, Hon. DANIEL A. MANION, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">David Rounsaville pleaded guilty to bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and using and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). The district court sentenced him within the guidelines range to 110 months\u2019 imprisonment for the bank robbery and to a mandatory consecutive term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for using the firearm. Rounsaville filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel moves to withdraw because he cannot discern a non-frivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Rounsaville to comment on counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), and he has responded that he wants to challenge his sentence but does not add to the potential grounds evaluated by counsel. Our review is thus limited to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">As part of its written plea agreement with Rounsaville, the government stipulated that a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) was \u201cappropriate\u201d if Rounsaville continued to accept responsibility. The government also agreed to move for an additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) if his offense level was high enough to make him eligible for that further reduction. Rounsaville, however, failed to appear for his sentencing, and when he was caught the government, not surprisingly, opposed any reduction for acceptance of responsibility and instead recommended a three-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. Rounsaville conceded that he had obstructed justice and thus lost his chance for the first two acceptance points under \u00a7 3El.l(a). But counsel argued that the plea agreement still obligated the government to recommend one acceptance point under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Counsel pointed out that, while the plea agreement expressly conditioned a reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a) on Rounsaville\u2019s <em>continued </em>acceptance of responsibility, the provision involving \u00a7 3El.l(b), paragraph 6(g), includes no similar language. In counsel\u2019s view, paragraph 6(g) conditioned the government\u2019s duty solely on Rounsaville\u2019s pleading guilty; that paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">Defendant has timely notified the government of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the Court to allocate its resources efficiently, within the meaning of Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(b). Accordingly, at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government will move for an additional 1-level reduction in the offense level, provided the Court determines the offense level to be 16 or great<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>er prior to the operation of Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The district court rejected Rounsaville\u2019s argument and adopted the government\u2019s position in full. The judge then considered but was unpersuaded by several submissions Rounsaville offered in support of a sentence below the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In his <em>Anders </em>submission, counsel first considers reiterating his argument that the government breached the plea agreement by refusing to recommend one acceptance point under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Counsel concludes that it would be frivolous to raise this argument on appeal because the district court ultimately imposed a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Counsel\u2019s reasoning is off the mark; although advisory, the guidelines still must be properly calculated. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>435 F.3d 699, 700-01 (7th Cir.2006). We would thus review Rounsaville\u2019s interpretation of the plea agreement, and do so <em>de novo. United States v. Sowemimo, </em>335 F.3d 567, 571 (7th Cir.2003). Nonetheless, we agree with counsel\u2019s conclusion that an argument premised on the plea agreement and \u00a7 3El.l(b) would be frivolous because we could not conclude that the government breached the agreement. Since plea agreements are contracts, their content and meaning are determined according to ordinary contract principles. <em>See United States v. Pappas, </em>409 F.3d 828, 830 (7th Cir.2005). The terms of promises must be read according to their natural meaning, <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>453 F.3d 911, 914 (7th Cir.2006), and in light of the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations, <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>259 F.3d 648, 654 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Matchopatow, </em>259 F.3d 847, 852 (7th Cir.2001). The \u201cnatural meaning\u201d of paragraph 6(g) is that the government would move for a third acceptance point under \u00a7 3El.l(b) only if Rounsaville qualified for the first two points under \u00a7 3El.l(a). This meaning is easily gleaned from the paragraph\u2019s plain language, which refers to an <em>\u201cadditional </em>one point reduction\u201d (emphasis added). Plus, according to the guidelines, the one-point reduction in \u00a7 3El.l(b) is available only \u201c[i]f the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b); see <em>id. </em>cmt. n. 6; <em>United States, v. Davila-Rodriguez, </em>468 F.3d 1012, 1014 (7th Cir.2006). Rounsaville therefore could not have \u201creasonably expected\u201d the government to move for an acceptance point under \u00a7 3El.l(b) after he conceded, rightfully, that his flight ended any claim to the first two acceptance points available under \u00a7 3El.l(a). <em>See United States v. Buckley, </em>192 F.3d 708, 711 (7th Cir.1999) (\u201c[We] do not see how obstruction of justice at the sentencing hearing can be thought consistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Counsel also considers challenging the reasonableness of Rounsaville\u2019s overall prison sentence. We agree with counsel that such a challenge would be frivolous. Rounsaville\u2019s guidelines-range sentence is presumed reasonable, <em>see United States v. Gama-Gonzalez, </em>469 F.3d 1109, 1110 (7th Cir.2006), but we would find Rounsaville\u2019s sentence reasonable even without that presumption. <em>See United States v. Rita, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 357 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). The district court gave meaningful consideration to the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <em>see United States v. Laufle, </em>433 F.3d 981, 987 (7th Cir.2006), and counsel is unable to articulate any basis for arguing that the sentence imposed is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
