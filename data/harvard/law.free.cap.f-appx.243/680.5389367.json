The Factors seek to reopen the proceedings in order to prevent Alliance Bank, Locust L.P., and Locust LLC (\u201cappellees\u201d) from pursuing two mortgage foreclosure actions filed against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d) and 1291. <em>See In re Zinchiak v. CIT Small Bus. Lending Corp., </em>406 F.3d 214, 222 (3d Cir.2005). Our standard of review over the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision is the same as that exercised by the District Court. <em>Id. </em>at 221. Thus, we review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision not to reopen a previously closed bankruptcy proceeding under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 221-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">In August 2002, the Factors filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Bankruptcy Court subsequently converted the matter into a Chapter 7 proceeding. In February 2004, the Bankruptcy Court granted Alliance relief from the automatic stay to allow it to proceed against the Factors in two state court mortgage foreclosure actions involving certain residential and commercial properties. In August 2004, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Factors a discharge of debts pursuant to \u00a7 727 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727, and thereafter closed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Several months later, in December 2004, the Factors moved to reopen their closed bankruptcy case in order to file adversary proceedings against appellees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The undisputed purpose of the adversary proceedings was to defeat appellees\u2019 foreclosure actions against the Factors\u2019 residential and commercial property. The Factors argued that the two state court foreclosure actions violated \u00a7 524 of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides, in relevant part, that a discharge in bankruptcy \u201coperates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a <em>personal liability of the debtor, </em>whether or not discharge of such debt is waived.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2) (emphasis added); <em>see also Johnson v. Home State Bank, </em>501 U.S. 78, 83, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991) (noting that \u201ca discharge extinguishes <em>only </em>the personal liability of the debtor ... a creditor\u2019s right to foreclose on the mortgage survives or passes through the bankruptcy\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). After the Bankruptcy Court denied their motion to reopen, the Factors appealed the decision to the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The District Court ruled that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Factors\u2019 motion to reopen because (1) the state court foreclosure actions seek <em>in rem </em>relief only and do not seek to hold the Factors personally liable on the mortgages; and, (2) in any event, the Factors insulated themselves from <em>in personam </em>liability by objecting in their answer to the state court complaints to any judgment for personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In reaching its conclusion, the District Court relied primarily on <em>Insilco Corp. v. Rayburn, </em>874 Pa.Super. 362, 368, 543 A.2d 120 (Pa.Super.Ct.1988), in which the court explained that under Pennsylvania law, \u201c[a]n action in mortgage foreclosure is strictly an <em>in rem </em>action and may not include an <em>in personam </em>action to enforce personal liability.\u201d The court in <em>Insilco </em>further explained that, where a party fails to follow Pennsylvania procedural rules and seeks both <em>in rem </em>and <em>in personam </em>relief, the latter is only available if the mortgagor (in this case, the Factors) \u201cwaives any objection to the inclusion of the assumpsit action for a personal judgment in the mortgage foreclosure proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the District Court held that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen the Factors\u2019 closed bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Having reviewed the thorough and well-reasoned opinions of both the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court, as well as the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we will affirm for substantially the same reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion. Accordingly, we will also deny as moot the motion of appellees for summary action pursuant to Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 27.4.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ayz\">. Alliance at some point assigned its deed and mortgage to the commercial property to Locust L.P., of which Locust LLC is general partner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-17\">. The Factors also filed an adversary proceeding against Alliance for violation of the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>charge injunction, which the Bankruptcy Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Court later denied the Factors\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Because the Factors do not challenge these rulings in their brief on appeal, we need not address them. <em>See Laborers Int\u2019l Union of N. Am., AFL-CIO v. Foster Wheeler. Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1995) (noting that \u201d[a]n issue is waived unless a party raises it in its opening brief\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
