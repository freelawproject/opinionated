He appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">Reyna argues that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d because his Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance did not qualify. He contends that delivery of cocaine as defined under Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7 481.112 does not automatically qualify as a controlled substance offense because the statutory definition of delivery under Texas law includes offering to sell a controlled substance, which is broader than and includes acts outside of the guidelines definition of a controlled substance offense. He contends that the district court was not allowed to rely on the Presentence report\u2019s (PSR\u2019s) characterization of his offense in determining whether the prior conviction was a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-20\">Because Reyna did not object to the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) in the district court, this court reviews for plain error. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-21\">Section 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) provides for a base offense level of 20 if the \u201cdefendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d According to the PSR, Reyna was convicted in 2000 of delivery of cocaine. Based on information from the Houston Police Department, Reyna sold two rocks of crack cocaine to an undercover officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>\u201cUnder the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 ... (1990), a district court looks to the elements of a prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction, when classifying a prior offense for sentence enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273. In considering whether a prior conviction qualifies as a controlled substance offense, the court may look to the statutory definition and elements of the offense, the charging paper, a written plea agreement, the guilty-plea transcript, factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented, or jury instructions. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (addressing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)); <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273. However, \u201ca district court is not permitted to rely on a PSR\u2019s characterization of a defendant\u2019s prior offense for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The statutory definition of the offense must be considered because the record includes only the PSR\u2019s description of the offense based on information from the police. At the time of Reyna\u2019s conviction in 2000, \u00a7 481.112 provided that: \u201ca person commits an offense if the person knowingly or intentionally manufactures, delivers, or possesses with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance listed in Penalty Group 1.\u201d \u00a7 481.112(a) (Vernon 1994). \u201cDeliver\u201d is defined to include \u201coffering to sell a controlled substance.\u201d \u00a7 481.002(8) (Vernon 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-15 (5th Cir.2007), we considered whether a conviction under \u00a7 481.112 for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance warranted a 16-level increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), and whether the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. We held that the statutory definition of delivery of a controlled substance, as defined in \u00a7 481.112, encompasses activity that does not fall within \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of drug trafficking offense. <em>Id. </em>We held that the district court erred in applying the drug trafficking enhancement and that the error was plain. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1 has the meaning given in \u00a7 4131.2(b) and comment. (n.l), and it is defined in almost the identical manner as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b); \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)). The definitions of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d and \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d are identical for our purposes under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Our decision in <em>Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 714-16, that a conviction under \u00a7 481.112 encompasses activity that does not fall within \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of drug trafficking offense, applies equally to the definition of controlled substance offense in \u00a7 2K2.1. The district court erred in determining, based on the PSR\u2019s description of his conduct, that Reyna\u2019s prior conviction was a controlled substance offense, and the error was plain. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">We must then determine whether the error affected Reyna\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 716-17. Reyna argues that the sentencing error affected his substantial rights because absent the enhancement for a prior conviction for a controlled substance offense, his correct base offense level would have been 14 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6), and, with the other unchallenged offense level adjustments and a criminal history category of III, his guideline range would have been 41-51 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">In <em>Gonzales, </em>we determined that the defendant had satisfied the third prong of plain error because absent the erroneous enhancement, the defendant\u2019s guideline range would have been significantly lower than the sentence he received. 484 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>at 716-17. We concluded that the defendant had satisfied the fourth prong of plain error because the district court\u2019s error clearly affected the sentence. <em>Id. </em>We vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Without the enhancement for a prior conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d Reyna\u2019s guideline range would have been 41-51 months, significantly lower than the guideline range of 78-97 months determined by the district court. Reyna has satisfied the third prong of plain error. <em>See Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 716-17. If the district court had started with a guideline range of 41-51 months, it is not clear that the district court would have varied from the guideline range to 120 months. We conclude that the error clearly affected the sentence. <em>See Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 716-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Reyna also argues that the district court erred by imposing an unreasonable sentence above the applicable imprisonment range. We do not reach the reasonableness issue because we cannot say that the district court\u2019s error in calculating the advisory Guidelines range did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the 120-month sentence because the erroneously calculated sentencing range served as a reference point for the upward departure. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>478 F.3d 266, 273-74 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Reyna\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b847-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
