Bank v. United States Gyp</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number><em>sum Co., </em>950 F.2d 1144, 1148 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Ortiz argues that the imposition of consecutive sentences is unreasonable. He contends that the district court incorrectly weighed the relevant sentencing factors and that his term of imprisonment was greater than necessary to achieve the legitimate goals of sentencing. He further reasons that his 70-month combined sentence is outside the advisory sentencing guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The record reflects that the court properly considered the guidelines, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) factors, and Ortiz\u2019s arguments in favor of mitigation when it imposed his sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Furthermore, the consecutive nature of Ortiz\u2019s sentence is specifically permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f), p.s. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 925-29. Thus, the sentence is neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114,120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>547 U.S. 1083, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b904-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
