We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Wang, a native and citizen of China, seeks asylum under \u00a7 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), based on alleged persecution he suffered on account of his father\u2019s practice of Falun Gong. During removal proceedings, Wang testified that he was assaulted and threatened with death and imprisonment during a confrontation between the police and his parents at his parents\u2019 home. The IJ found that Wang failed to testify credibly that he experienced past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ further found that, even accepting Wang\u2019s testimony as true, he failed to establish fear of future persecution based on one of the five protected grounds. For those reasons, the IJ denied Wang\u2019s application for asylum and issued an order of removal. The BIA affirmed the order of removal and agreed with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The BIA declined to address whether Wang\u2019s testimony, taken as true, would establish fear of future persecution on one of the five protected grounds. Wang then appealed the BIA\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">We review for substantial evidence the factual determinations underlying a denial of asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 488-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Accordingly, to reverse the BIA\u2019s findings, we must find that the evidence not only supports the opposite conclusion, \u201cbut <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see also Zi Zhi Tang v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 987, 989-90 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">In this case, the BIA found that Wang failed to testify credibly because, <em>inter alia, </em>he offered conflicting and inconsistent testimony regarding when he learned that his parents had been arrested. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s conclusion. Specifically, Wang maintained throughout direct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>cross-examination that he did not know his parents were arrested until after arriving in the United States. When the IJ questioned Wang, however, Wang testified that he learned of his parents\u2019 arrest from an uncle before leaving China. Wang\u2019s conflicting testimony regarding when he learned of his parents\u2019 arrest goes to the heart of his claim because the issue bears directly on whether the sole incident on which Wang\u2019s claim is based actually occurred. <em>See Smolniakova v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir.2005). Consequently, the BIA offered \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for its adverse credibility determination. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006). The record does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
