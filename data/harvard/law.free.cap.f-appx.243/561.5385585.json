No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">In this civil rights action, Vavrus alleged violations of his equal protection and substantive due process rights arising out of Defendants\u2019 \u201ccampaign of harassment against Plaintiff through the use of code enforcement proceedings and ex parte injunction actions\u201d taken \u201cin an effort to coerce Plaintiff to sell his ranch ... at less than its fair market value and to stymie his efforts to deannex the property from the City.\u201d The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants, and we affirmed. <em>Vavrus v. Russo, </em>128 Fed.Appx. 107 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cVavrus I\u201d). </em>We also denied Defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">After the mandate issued, Defendants notified the district court of their intent to proceed with their previously-filed motion to tax attorney\u2019s fees to Vavrus, which the district court had stayed pending Vavrus\u2019 appeal. After briefing by both parties, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion and awarded attorney\u2019s fees. Vavrus now appeals from this order, contending that the district court erred in awarding Defendants attorney\u2019s fees because (1) the law of the case doctrine barred the district court from granting Defendants\u2019 motion because we denied Defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal; and (2) Vavrus\u2019 suit was not \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\u201d as required for an award of fees to prevailing defendants under <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">We review the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>ACLU v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">Section 1988 states that a \u201ccourt, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.... \u201d Although a prevailing plaintiff \u201c[ojrdinarily ... \u2018is to be awarded attorney\u2019s fees in all but special circumstances,\u2019 \u201d a prevailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>defendant may recover attorney\u2019s fees \u201conly when the court finds that the plaintiffs claim was \u2018frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>Head v. Medford, </em>62 F.3d 351, 355 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Christiansburg, </em>434 U.S. at 418, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694). The Supreme Court has cautioned that, in making such determinations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">it is important that a district court resist the understandable temptation to engage in <em>post hoc </em>reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation. This kind of hindsight logic could discourage all but the most airtight claims.... Even when the law or the facts appear questionable or unfavorable at the outset, a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for bringing suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\"><em>Christiansburg, </em>434 U.S. at 421-22, 98 S.Ct. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We have noted that frivolity determinations must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account various factors, including (1) whether the plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>case, (2) whether the defendant offered to settle; and (3) whether the suit was dismissed before trial. <em>See Head, </em>62 F.3d at 355-56. Here, the district court concluded that Vavrus\u2019 claims were \u201clegally meritless\u201d because he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for his equal protection or substantive due process claims and because the suit was decided on summary judgment. We conclude that no error exists in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">First, the law of the case doctrine did not preclude the district court from independently exercising its discretion to award Defendants attorney\u2019s fees under section <em>1988. </em>This doctrine provides that \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court are generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case.... \u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., </em>15 F.3d 166, 169 (11th Cir.1994) (citation and quotation marks omitted). But, the doctrine only applies to those things decided explicitly or by necessary implication. <em>Id. </em>Contrary to Vavrus\u2019 contention, our denial of Defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees on Vavrus\u2019 earlier appeal did not explicitly or by necessary implication determine that Vavrus\u2019 suit was not \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d Our order simply stated that Defendants\u2019 motion was \u201cDENIED.\u201d We did not explain the denial. And, the denial could not <em>necessarily imply </em>that we had concluded that Vavrus\u2019 suit was nonfrivolous; whether or not we actually regarded Vavrus\u2019 underlying claims as without foundation, we might have simply exercised our discretion to deny attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Cf. Thomas v. Bible, </em>983 F.2d 152, 154 n. 2 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]f an appeal is non-frivolous we <em>cannot </em>award appellate fees ..., but if an appeal is frivolous [we have] discretion to grant or deny fees.... [F]or purposes of the law of the case doctrine the consequences of relying on one ground rather than the other are entirely different.\u201d); <em>Price v. State of Hawaii </em>939 F.2d 702, 710 n. 10 (9th Cir.1991) (noting that appellate court \u201cmust exercise [its] own discretion when fees are requested on appeal,\u201d even when the lower court\u2019s fee award is affirmed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Vavrus\u2019 claims were \u201clegally meritless.\u201d We see no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Vavrus failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case on both his equal protection and substantive due process claims because he failed to introduce evidence supporting his allegations. In Vav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>rus\u2019 earlier appeal, we concluded that Vavrus\u2019 equal protection claims \u201clack merit because the Plaintiff produced <em>no </em>evidence that he was treated differently from similarly situated persons.\u201d <em>Vavrus I </em>(emphasis added). We also affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that Vavrus\u2019 substantive due process claims were \u201cmerit-less.\u201d Thus, we do not accept Vavrus\u2019 contention that the district court misconstrued the nature of Vavrus\u2019 claims in determining that his suit was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">That we determined that Vavrus\u2019 claims were properly dismissed on summary judgment does not automatically entitle Defendants\u2019 to attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>see Head, </em>62 F.3d at 356; but that Vavrus\u2019 suit was unsuccessful because he failed to introduce evidence supporting his allegations does suggest that his suit was groundless. <em>See id. </em>at 355 (noting that findings of frivolity have generally been sustained when plaintiffs failed to introduce evidence supporting their claims); <em>Munson v. Milwaukee Bd. of Sch. Directors, </em>969 F.2d 266, 270 (7th Cir.1992) (upholding fee award to defendant where plaintiff offered no evidence to support his allegations of wrongful discharge).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">That Vavrus\u2019 claims survived Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss does not indicate that the suit was <em>not </em>frivolous. At that early stage, the district court must accept as true the plaintiffs well-pleaded factual allegations. Vavrus\u2019 claims failed because he did not introduce evidence supporting his allegations, not because the district court \u201csimply changed its mind.\u201d <em>See Hutchinson v. Staton, </em>994 F.2d 1076, 1080-81 (4th Cir.1993) (affirming fee award to defendants where plaintiffs\u2019 claim survived motions for dismissal and summary judgment, but was ultimately determined to be factually frivolous). Contrary to Vavrus\u2019 assertion, the legal standards and theories applicable to Vavrus\u2019 claims were not novel. The district court consistently set forth the standards at both the motion to dismiss and summary judgment stages and compared Vavrus\u2019 allegations and evidence, respectively, to the standards. In granting summary judgment to Defendants, the district court repeatedly stated that Vavrus had introduced <em>no </em>evidence demonstrating that Defendants had treated Vavrus differently than other similar landowners or had acted with an improper motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">We conclude that the court acted within its discretion in awarding Defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Vavrus does not challenge the amount of fees awarded. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of attorney\u2019s fees in favor of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-12\">.
