SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">William Murray was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The district court denied habeas corpus relief but granted a certificate of appealability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-20\">Murray entered the home of ninety-three-year-old Rena Ratcliff and looked through her home and bedroom for valuables. Ratcliff woke up while Murray was in her room and confronted him. Murray hit and choked Ratcliff, eventually raping and killing her. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-22\">\u201cUnder [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996], a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus for a defendant convicted in state court unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u2018(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parr v. Quarterman, </em>472 F.3d 245, 252 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2)). \u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s findings of facts for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo, applying the same standards to the state court\u2019s decision as did the district court.\u201d <em>Busby v. Dretke, </em>359 F.3d 708, 713 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Martinez v. Johnson, </em>255 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u201cA decision is contrary to clearly established Federal law \u2018if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 481, 485 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). \u201cFactual determinations by state courts are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 324, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Murray first asserts that the state trial court\u2019s decision not to require a psychological examination to determine whether Murray was competent to waive his appeal was objectively unreasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The trial court had a considerable amount of evidence relating to Murray\u2019s competence. Murray\u2019s counsel stated Murray was competent to waive his appeal; Murray testified at the waiver hearing that he was competent to waive his appeal; one expert told the court that, based on an informal evaluation, he had no reason to suspect Murray was incompetent, though he was not sure, because he had not been asked to do a formal evaluation; and one expert provided a pretrial report stating Murray was competent to stand trial five months before the waiver hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Murray claims his own testimony should have alerted the trial court to the need for an examination. In his testimony, he claimed that his decision was based on emotion, not rational reasoning, as shown by the fact he gave unfounded emotional reasons for his waiver: He said he wanted to \u201cget it over\u201d for the victim\u2019s family\u2019s sake, even though he knew it was a \u201cmistake.\u201d Moreover, he claims that his major depression and suicidal ideation should have caused the court to order a psychological examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">In <em>Mata v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 324 (5th Cir.2000), we analyzed when a federal district court must obtain a psychological examination for a defendant waiving his right to continue habeas appeals. In that case, the district court did not require an examination, and we examined whether the evidence raised a <em>bona fide </em>issue of competence. <em>Id. </em>at 330. The record contained evidence that raised a <em>bona fide </em>question of competence, because there was evidence that the defendant suffered from an organic brain disorder, had made numerous suicide attempts, and had a delusional disorder. <em>Id. </em>at 332. The district court erred by relying on an expert report that was twelve years old. <em>Id. </em>Also, in that case the defendant did not appear before the court for the court to observe his behavior personally. <em>Id. </em>at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Having carefully reviewed Murray\u2019s brief and supporting documents, we conclude that the state trial court did not base its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts in failing to require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>psychological exam. The evidence in the record did not raise a question of Murray\u2019s competence. His depression and suicidal ideation are unlike the repeated suicide attempts and documented delusional disorder in <em>Mata. </em>The five-month-old expert report stating Murray was competent to stand trial is quite different from the twelve-year-old report in <em>Mata; </em>nothing indicates the report in this case was insufficiently current. Finally, the state court examined Murray, personally observing his behavior, and concluded he was competent. The federal district court did not err in finding that the state court\u2019s failure to require a psychological exam was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Murray urges that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cTCCA\u201d) denied him procedural due process because it used a. postcard to deny his motion for rehearing of its affirmance of his conviction. He also asserts that he should have been able to withdraw his waiver of his right to appeal because his motion for rehearing was made only a few months after he had requested permission to waive his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Murray filed a motion that stated that he had informed his counsel that he wanted to waive his right to appeal. Three months later, the TCCA affirmed his sentence, noting he had waived his right to appeal. About two weeks later, Murray moved for rehearing, stating he had changed his mind about waiving. The TCCA denied the motion for rehearing with a postcard that noted that three of the nine members of the court dissented from the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Murray claims that the TCCA\u2019s use of a postcard to deny his motion for rehearing was \u201cthe essence of arbitrary action\u201d and that the refusal to permit him to withdraw his waiver was an abuse of discretion that affected \u201cthe fundamental fairness of the trial.\u201d Yet, Murray has not shown that the TCCA\u2019s procedure was contrary to any clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. He provides no law stating that defendants have a right to a rehearing or that they have a right to have their rehearing denied with a written opinion that is not on a postcard. The Supreme Court has \u201cdefined the category of infractions that violate \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 very narrowly,\u201d <em>Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 352, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990), and the procedure followed here does not fit into that narrow category, because it does not violate \u201cthose fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions, and which define the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 110 S.Ct. 668 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">Murray contends that the federal district court erred in denying his claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. Murray admits that he did not exhaust his state remedies, so he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). But, he claims that his failure to exhaust his claims does not limit relief available under \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>To qualify for an exception under \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(B), a prisoners must \u2018\u201cdemonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cTo prove \u2018cause\u2019 [Murray] must establish that some \u2018external force\u2019 impeded the defense\u2019s efforts to comply with the procedural rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756 (citing <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 758, 111 S.Ct. 2546). \u201cTo meet the \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 test, [Murray] needed to supplement his constitutional claim with a colorable showing of factual innocence, i.e., \u2018a fair probability that, in light of all the evidence, including that ... evidence tenably claimed to have been wrongly excluded or to have become available only after the trial, the trier of the facts would have entertained a reasonable doubt of his guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sawyer v. Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 383, 339 &amp; n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992) (citations and quotations omitted)). Murray has not met either of these requirements, and we cannot discern any argument in his brief that appears designed to do so. Because he has not established that he qualifies for an exception to the exhaustion requirement, he is not entitled to relief on the basis of ineffective assistance. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Murray posits that Texas\u2019s method <em>of </em>selecting who is prosecuted for the death penalty is objectively unreasonable under the Fourteenth Amendment because it gives prosecutors excessive discretion and permits similarly situated criminals to be treated differently. As pointed out in the proceedings in the district court, however, the Supreme Court has rejected the foundation for this claim. <em>See Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 199, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). Murray\u2019s assertion is meritless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Murray avers that the state court\u2019s failure to inform jurors on the effect of the parole law violated equal protection and due process. Our precedent, however, precludes his argument, because we have consistently held that a defendant does not have a due process right to present parole eligibility information to the jury. <em>Thacker v. Dretke, </em>396 F.3d 607, 617 (5th Cir. 2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regarding his equal protection ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>gument, Murray presents no reason that the state court\u2019s \u201cadjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d so he cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b74-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

Murray argues that we should abandon this requirement based on the statutory language and public policy reasons. Because we are bound by our past decisions, such as <em>Bagwell, </em>we do not abandon that requirement today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\">. In <em>Gregg, </em>the Court characterized the type of argument Murray asserts here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">The petitioner\u2019s argument is nothing more than a veiled contention that <em>Furman </em>indirectly outlawed capital punishment by placing totally unrealistic conditions on its use. In order to repair the alleged defects point-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-14\">ed to by the petitioner, it would be necessary to require that prosecuting authorities charge a capital offense whenever arguably there had been a capital murder and that they refuse to plea bargain with the defendant. If a jury refused to convict even though the evidence supported the charge, its verdict would have to be reversed and a verdict of guilty entered or a new trial ordered, since the discretionary act of jury nullification would not be permitted. Finally, acts of executive clemency would have to be prohibited. Such a system, of course, would be totally alien to our notions of criminal justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-15\"><em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 199 n. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2909.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b77-16\">. <em>Simmons v.
