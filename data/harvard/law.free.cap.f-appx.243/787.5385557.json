He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court disposed of the matter in an order docketed on June 20, 2007, 2007 WL 1796244. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Earl\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. Although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny Earl\u2019s motion for default and request for compensation and attorney fees. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
