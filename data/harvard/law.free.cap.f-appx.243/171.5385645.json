The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Flaningam lacked a protected property interest in continued employment. Flaningam responded that he had a property interest in his job by virtue of language in an employee handbook and personnel regulations codified in Chapter 62 of the Winnebago County Code. The district court rejected Flaningam\u2019s argument and granted summary judgment for the defendants. On appeal, Flaningam argues primarily that the County\u2019s personnel code allows the County to terminate employees only for cause, thereby giving him a property interest in his job. Because we do not read the ordinance as limiting the County\u2019s discretion to terminate its employees, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Flaningam worked for the County\u2019s Department of Animal Services for nearly fifteen years, beginning in 1988 when he was hired as a kennel worker. He was soon promoted to Animal Services Officer, and in April 2001 he was appointed by the Director of Animal Services to the position of Animal Services Supervisor. Shortly thereafter, the director left the department and was replaced by Michelle Sell. The Department of Animal Services faced systemic problems such as poor organization and low employee morale and had an unsatisfactory reputation within the local court system. Sell, in cooperation with Jim Kelly, the Human Resources Director, was charged with reforming the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">After Sell became the director in October 2001, she and Kelly each had conversations with Flaningam about how to improve the department\u2019s performance and morale. At various times Sell approached Flaningam about issues such as revising the officers\u2019 procedural manual, improving the scheduling system, and providing better oversight of the paperwork filed by officers. Sell was unsatisfied with Flaningam\u2019s progress on these fronts. Sell also confronted Flaningam after he violated department policy by allowing a news reporter to ride along with an officer without prior approval and using (and allowing officers to use) county-provided cellular phones for personal phone calls. Kelly approached Flaningam about the need to schedule more staff meetings for the officers and to improve officer training.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Sell eventually concluded that Flaningam lacked the necessary judgment and skills to be an effective supervisor. On April 26, 2002, she and Kelly met with Flaningam and fired him due to \u201chis inability to function as Officer Supervisor, and the lack of indication that he intended to improve his performance.\u201d Flaningam was shocked that he was fired \u201cwithout warning\u201d after fifteen years of service. He asserts he \u201cwas never told that he had done anything wrong, as he had never been given a verbal warning, had never been written up and never been suspended.\u201d He later learned that he was replaced as supervisor by an employee of the county sheriffs department who lacked any experience in the field of animal control.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Flaningam sued the County, Sell, and Kelly under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging he was fired for purely political reasons in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and that he was deprived of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>his job without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted as to the first claim but denied as to the second. The court asked the parties to provide \u201cevidence whether the personnel code was adopted as an ordinance of the County\u201d and if so, to address whether its language \u201ccreates a property interest in plaintiffs job by prohibiting him from being fired except for cause.\u201d Ultimately the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the due process claim; the court concluded that \u201c[njothing in the ordinance at issue provides that discharge may only be for cause,\u201d and so the code did not create a property right that entitled Flaningam to due process. The court noted that the code sets forth certain procedures that the County did not follow, but reasoned that absent a property interest in continued employment, the failure to follow established procedures in itself does not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In order to prevail on his due-process claim, Flaningam must show that he had a constitutionally protected property interest in his job and that he was deprived of that interest without due process of law. <em>Moss v. Martin, </em>473 F.3d 694, 700 (7th Cir.2007). The parties agree that Flaningam was afforded no process and dispute only the existence of a property interest. Where a plaintiff alleges a due-process violation based on the termination of his employment, we look to state law to determine whether the plaintiff has a property interest in keeping his job. <em>Id.) Draghi v. County of Cook, </em>184 F.3d 689, 692 (7th Cir.1999). In Illinois, employment without a fixed duration is presumed to be at-will, <em>Duldulao v. Saint Mary of Nazareth Hosp. Ctr., </em>115 Ill.2d 482, 106 Ill.Dec. 8, 505 N.E.2d 314, 317 (1987), unless the employee can point to \u201ca specific ordinance, state law, contract, or understanding limiting the ability of the [employer] to discharge him,\u201d <em>Ertl v. City of DeKalb, </em>303 Ill.App.3d 524, 236 Ill.Dec. 988, 708 N.E.2d 574, 576 (1999) (citing <em>Faustrum v. Bd. of Fire &amp; Police Comm\u2019rs, </em>240 Ill.App.3d 947, 181 Ill.Dec. 567, 608 N.E.2d 640, 641 (1993)); <em>see Miller v. Ret. Bd. of Policemen\u2019s Annuity, </em>329 Ill.App.3d 589, 264 Ill.Dec. 727, 771 N.E.2d 431, 437 (2001). Under Illinois law a public employee who may be terminated only for cause has a property interest in continued employment. <em>Prato v. Valias, </em>331 Ill.App.3d 852, 265 Ill.Dec. 94, 771 N.E.2d 1053, 1064 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Here, Flaningam argues that personnel regulations contained in Chapter 62 of the Winnebago County Code created the requisite property interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The provisions Flaningam cites, however, do not expressly limit the County\u2019s authority to discharge its employees only for cause. For instance, Flaningam cites \u00a7 62-291(b), which states: \u201cIn general, any action or attitude which adversely affects job performance or the reputation of the county government may be cause for disciplinary action.\u201d This provision does not limit the County\u2019s discretion or create an assurance of continued employment; instead, it simply states a general principle that \u201cany action or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>attitude\u201d that adversely affects job performance or the County\u2019s reputation \u201cmay be\u201d grounds for discipline. We have previously addressed similar language in an employee handbook and concluded that it was too \u201cweak\u201d to rebut the presumption of at-will employment. <em>Border v. City of Crystal Lake, 75 </em>F.3d 270, 274 (7th Cir. 1996) (employee handbook language stating that employees were subject to discipline \u201cat any time, as may be appropriate for conduct or performance,\u201d does not create a property interest in continued employment). Moreover, we have held that permissive language like that used in \u00a7 62-291(b) <em>{\u201cmay </em>be cause\u201d) generally does not create an enforceable property right. <em>See Moss, </em>473 F.3d at 701; <em>Flynn v. Kornwolf, </em>83 F.3d 924, 927 (7th Cir. 1996); <em>Lashbrook v. Oerkfitz, </em>65 F.3d 1339, 1347 (7th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Flaningam also relies on \u00a7 62-292 of the code, which he argues imposes a \u201cmandatory discipline process\u201d that limits the County\u2019s discharge authority because it specifies that \u201cformal disciplinary actions will be processed\u201d in the manner outlined in the ordinance. But Flaningam\u2019s entitlement to disciplinary procedures, mandatory or otherwise, does not bear on whether he has a property interest in his job. <em>See Montgomery v. Stefaniak, </em>410 F.3d 933, 939 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Moulton v. Vigo County, </em>150 F.3d 801, 805 (7th Cir.1998). An employer\u2019s failure to comply with its disciplinary procedures may be actionable, but not as a federal constitutional claim. <em>Garcia v. Kankakee County Hous. Auth., </em>279 F.3d 532, 535 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Shegog v. Bd. of Ed. of City of Chi, </em>194 F.3d 836, 837-38 (7th Cir.1999). For the same reason, the existence of a formal grievance procedure\u2014which Flaningam never invoked\u2014 does not itself establish a property interest; Flaningam \u201cmust show entitlement to the job, not just to the procedures.\u201d <em>Border, 75 </em>F.3d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Flaningam next asserts that \u00a7 62-292(4), pertaining to suspensions, demonstrates that he had a property interest in his job. That provision states that \u201ca department head may as a disciplinary action suspend without pay any employee for cause\u201d and lays out the procedures for doing so. The words \u201cfor cause,\u201d however, are not repeated in the next subsection, which concerns discharges. Flaningam argues that a \u201cfor cause\u201d limitation must be implicit in the discharge provision because \u201cit would make no sense to require a showing of cause when suspending an employee ... while not requiring a showing of cause upon discharges.\u201d We reject this strained reading of the ordinance. In any event, as we have already noted, the use of permissive language (\u201ca department head <em>may ... </em>suspend\u201d) does not create a property interest in continued employment. <em>See Moss, </em>473 F.3d at 701 (manual stated an employee \u201cmay be discharged for cause\u201d); <em>Lashbrook, </em>65 F.3d at 1347 (handbook stated that \u201cDepartment Heads, with the approval of the Director, may dismiss any employee for just cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Finally, Flaningam relies on the code\u2019s distinction between employees with \u201cprobationary\u201d status and those with \u201cpermanent\u201d status to support his argument that the ordinance gives him a property interest in his job. Flaningam asserts that an employee with \u201cpermanent\u201d status cannot be an at-will employee because \u201cpermanent\u201d implies a lasting engagement. The personnel code does not define \u201cpermanent\u201d employee; the term is used only in juxtaposition to \u201cprobationary\u201d employees to distinguish between those who may avail themselves of the grievance process and receive certain employment benefits such as insurance coverage. In any case, that the code distinguishes between \u201cprobationary\u201d and \u201cpermanent\u201d employees for some purposes does not establish a manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>tory limitation on the County\u2019s authority to discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Flaningam has not identified any provision in the Winnebago County Code that expressly limits the County\u2019s authority to terminate its employees only for cause. Accordingly, he did not have a property interest in continued employment with the Department of Animal Services. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">. Flaningam does not develop and thus waives the contention that a policy or practice of the County established a property interest in continued employment. <em>E.g., Murdock &amp; Sons Constr., Inc., v. Goheen Gen. Constr., Inc., </em>461 F.3d 837, 841 (7th Cir.2006). Although property interests may be created by \u201cmutually explicit understandings,\u201d <em>Crull v. Sunderman, </em>384 F.3d 453, 464 (7th Cir.2004), Flaningam fails to describe any particular \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201cpractice\u201d supporting the existence of a mutual understanding between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
