For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">This matter is before this Court on appeal for the second time. In the first appeal, we remanded the case to the district court for its consideration of damages against NP as guarantor of an indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>provision included in a January 22, 1988 purchase agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d). In this appeal, we consider NP\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s judgment awarding Perry damages of $1,191,381.96. The Agreement, which contained the indemnification provision at issue, provided that Perry would sell Auto Works Division (\u201cAWD\u201d), a chain of auto parts stores, to Northern Retail Corp. (\u201cNorthern Retail\u201d), a subsidiary of NP\u2019s predecessor-in-interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The Agreement provided that the purchaser, then Northern Retail, would indemnify Perry from claims asserted against Perry that relate to AWD. The indemnity provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-5\">The purchaser indemnifies and agrees to hold Perry harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred or sustained by Perry resulting from (i) any inaccuracy in, or breach or violation of, the representations, warranties and covenants made by Purchaser herein, or (ii) any and all claims asserted against Perry which relate to the properties or operations of [AWD], regardless of the basis for such claims or whether Perry knew or had reason to know of any such claim or the basis for any such claim on the date hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The basis for NP\u2019s liability to Perry in the instant litigation is NP\u2019s guaranty of the purchase agreement. NP executed an instrument promising to guaranty the performance of the purchaser under the Agreement. The guaranty provided that \u201c[NP] ... does hereby guarantee the full and complete performance by Purchaser of all of its obligations under this Purchase Agreement....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Prior to closing on the Agreement, Northern Retail assigned the Agreement to its newly-formed subsidiary, Auto Works Holding, Inc. (\u201cAWHI\u201d). AWHI thus became the purchasing entity. At the closing, Perry transferred AWD to AWHI, and AWHI signed an assumption of liabilities instrument, agreeing to \u201cassume and pay or discharge all liabilities and obligations of Perry relating to the operations of [AWD] which ... are related to the executory contracts and leases to be assigned by Perry to and assumed by Purchaser.\u201d On February 29, 1988, NP\u2019s counsel sent a letter to Perry stating that \u201c[t]he Guaranty constitutes a valid and binding obligation of [NP], enforceable against [NP] in accordance with its terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">On December 14, 1989, NP signed a First Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, acknowledging that the Amendment \u201cshall not act to release or diminish the obligations of [NP] as the guarantor of the [AWHI]\u2019s obligations under the Purchase Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">In 1994, AWD and AWHI merged as AWD. In 1997, AWD filed for bankruptcy, and failed to pay rents due under certain leases guaranteed by Perry prior to its 1988 sale of AWD to AWHI. Perry\u2019s parent corporation, Rite Aid Corporation (\u201cRite Ad\u201d), paid these liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">Perry subsequently demanded indemnification from NP and Northern Retail. In 1998, Perry initiated this action in federal district court against NP and numerous other entities. In December of 2000, the district court entered summary judgment for Perry. Because AWD had dissolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>and had no assets, the district court awarded Perry damages of $1.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Perry then appealed to this Court, which affirmed the dismissal of certain defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction, but reversed the damage award, and the case was remanded to the district court for a proper assessment of damages against NP, specifically \u201cwhether, or how much, liability NP bears for Perry\u2019s loss\u201d as the guarantor of the indemnification provision. <em>See Perry Drug Stores v. CSK Auto Corp., </em>93 Fed.Appx. 677, 683 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">On remand, the parties agreed to the appointment of a special master (\u201cSpecial Master\u201d) for purposes of making \u201call of the factual findings and legal conclusions necessary to determine ... the issue of NP\u2019s liability and damages,\u201d and further agreed that the Special Master\u2019s findings of fact \u201cshall be final and conclusive and that only conclusions of law will thereafter be considered by the court.\u201d On April 7, 2005, the Special Master issued his report and recommendation as to the liability and damages of the defendant. A second report and recommendation on attorney\u2019s fees was filed on May 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">In his first report, the Special Master made twenty-nine conclusive findings of fact, including that: (1) Perry guaranteed or subleased each AWHI lease claim at issue; (2) Perry, through Rite Aid, its corporate parent, was requested to pay the AWHI lease obligations; (3) Perry, through Rite Aid, paid $683,621.83 to satisfy AWHI lease obligations; (4) Perry transferred AWD to AWHI with an assumption of liabilities instrument executed by AWHI; and that (5) NP guaranteed AWHI\u2019s indemnity obligations, and was liable for $683,621.83. The report also contained thirteen conclusions of law, including that: (1) Perry, not Rite Aid, was obligated to pay the unpaid AWHI lease obligations; (2) NP guaranteed AWHI\u2019s full and complete performance as Perry\u2019s indemnitor; (3) Perry did not intend to release NP\u2019s guaranty; (4) NP reaffirmed its guaranty after the closing transaction the court found created an implied novation of Northern Retail; (5) the implied novation of Northern Retail did not discharge NP\u2019s guaranty because Perry manifested its intent to retain its claims against NP by obtaining a reaffirmation of the guaranty during and after the closing; and that (6) Rite Aid\u2019s payment of Perry\u2019s obligations was not a defense against Perry\u2019s claims against NP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">The Supplemental Report contained eight conclusive findings of fact, including that the Agreement contained a broad indemnification provision, which covered \u201ccosts causally related to at least two classes of occurrences at issue in the case: i) breaches/violations of the purchasers\u2019 covenants (i.e., breaches of the promises contained in the purchase agreement) and ii) claims asserted against Perry relating to the properties or operations of [AW'D].\u201d The Supplemental Report also found that: (1) NP guaranteed AWHI\u2019s performance of the Indemnity; (2) Perry, through Rite Aid, incurred attorneys\u2019 fees in defending AWHI lease claims and in prosecuting the instant litigation, caused by NP\u2019s failure to indemnify Perry; and that (3) Perry incurred $450,386.50 in attorney fees and $57,373.63 in costs. The Supplemental Report contained five conclusions of law, including that: (1) the indemnity provision included attorneys\u2019 fees, AWD lease claims asserted against Perry, and breaches of the indemnity provision itself; (2) that Perry\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees were caused by claims asserted against Perry which related to the properties or operations of AWD and NP\u2019s breach of its guaranty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Indemnity; and (3) that Perry was entitled to recover $450,386.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees, as well as costs totaling $57,373.63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Upon de novo review of the legal issues, the district court adopted the Special Master\u2019s findings in both reports in their entirety, and entered judgment in favor of Perry in the amount of $1,191,381.96. NP appeals, raising multiple grounds for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">A. NP\u2019s Liability as Indemnitor/Guarantor</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">NP first contends that it was improperly found liable as guarantor because: (1) the Special Master\u2019s reports adopted in the district court\u2019s order did not find a basis on which AWHI was liable; and (2) Perry\u2019s claim improperly relied on the obligations of Northern Retail and AWD to seek liability against NP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">This Court must accept the Special Master\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Demjanjuk v. Petrovsky, </em>10 F.3d 338, 340 (6th Cir.1993). We review conclusions of law de novo. <em>See Carter-Jones Lumber Co. v. Dixie Distrib. Co., </em>166 F.3d 840, 846 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">NP\u2019s cannot claim that there was no basis for which it was liable to Perry for AWHI\u2019s indemnification obligations. In the first appeal, we held that, pursuant to novation, Northern Retail\u2019s indemnity obligations became the obligation of AWHI. <em>Perry Drug Stores, </em>93 Fed.Appx. at 682. We also noted that NP guaranteed AWHI\u2019s indemnity obligations under the Agreement: (1) at the closing of the Agreement, <em>id. </em>at 679 n. 2 (\u201c[NP] ... provided a written guarantee of the [AWHI] indemnity at closing.\u201d); and (2) pursuant to the First Amendment to the Agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 682 n. 8 (\u201c[NP] ... consented] to the First Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, agreeing not to \u2018release or diminish the obligations of [NP] as the guarantor of the [AWHI\u2019s] obligations under the [ ] Agreement.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Having established that NP is responsible as guarantor of AWHI\u2019s indemnity obligations, we turn to the issue of whether the specific leases for which NP was found liable as guarantor in the Special Master\u2019s report were contemplated by the indemnity provision in the Agreement. \u201cIndemnity contracts are construed in accordance with the general rules for construction of contracts.\u201d <em>Grand Trunk Western R, Inc. v. Auto Warehousing Co., </em>262 Mich.App. 345, 686 N.W.2d 756, 761 (2004). \u201cAn unambiguous contract must be enforced according to its terms.\u201d <em>Burkhardt v. Bailey, </em>260 Mich.App. 636, 680 N.W.2d 453, 464 (2004). If indemnity contracts are ambiguous, the trier of fact must determine the intent of the parties. <em>Badiee v. Brighton Area Sch., </em>265 Mich. App. 343, 695 N.W.2d 521, 531 (2005) (citing <em>Sherman v. DeMaria Bld Co., Inc., </em>203 Mich.App. 593, 513 N.W.2d 187 (1994)). \u201cWhile it is true that indemnity contracts are construed strictly against the party who drafts them and against the indemnitee, it is also true that indemnity contracts should be construed to give effect to the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">The language used in the indemnification provision of the Agreement uses \u201cbroad all-inclusive\u201d language very similar to the language of the indemnification provision construed by the Michigan Court of Appeals in <em>Triple E Produce Corp. v. Mastronardi Produce, Ltd., </em>209 Mich.App. 165, 530 N.W.2d 772, 776 (1995). In <em>Triple E, </em>the indemnification provision at issue provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>Seller shall unconditionally indemnify and hold harmless ... Buyer ... against and in respect of any and all liabilities, loss, cost, damage, interest, legal fees and other expenses, of whatsoever kind or nature incurred by ... Buyer and/or their successors and assigns, by reason of: (a) any claims, of whatsoever kind or nature, against Corporation of any nature, whether accrued, matured, unmatured, absolute, contingent or otherwise and which arise out of the operations of Corporation prior to the closing date, or which are based upon any facts in existence prior to the closing date which are known to Seller, or should have been known to Seller ... or (d) any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 775. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that the \u201cthe use of the term \u2018all\u2019 in an indemnity clause has been interpreted to provide for the broadest possible indemnification,\u201d and construed the indemnification clause against the indemnitor. <em>Id. </em>at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Here, the indemnification provision also includes the term \u201call\u201d in reference to the scope of liability provided by the indemnification provision. The indemnification provision signed by AWHI obligates AWHI to indemnify Perry against \u201cany and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred\u201d from AWD\u2019s operations. Like the indemnification language in <em>Triple E, </em>the indemnification language in the Agreement is broad and all-inclusive. Because the indemnification provision provided \u201cthe broadest possible indemnification,\u201d AWHI was under an obligation to indemnify Perry for any AWD lease claims for which Perry incurred liability. The Special Master found that Perry incurred liability in the amount of $688,621.83 for AWD lease claims, which we do not find clearly erroneous. NP, as AWHI\u2019s guarantor, is equally liable for this amount for indemnification of Perry, given that the \u201cliability of the sureties is coextensive -with the liability of the principal.\u201d <em>See City of Ferndale v. Florence Cement Co., </em>269 Mich.App. 452, 712 N.W.2d 522, 528 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">However, NP argues that Perry intended to release NP from its guaranty obligations, and NP was thus released from its guaranty. The Restatement (Third) Suretyship and Guaranty \u00a7 39 provides for the circumstances in which a secondary obligor (NP) may be discharged when the principal obligor (Northern Retail) is released: \u201cTo the extent that the obligee releases the principal obligor from its duties pursuant to the underlying obligation!;,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 the secondary obligor (surety) is discharged from any unperformed duties pursuant to the secondary obligation unless ... the language or circumstances of the release otherwise show the obligee\u2019s intent to retain its claim against the secondary obligor[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">Here, circumstances following the release of Northern Retail, pursuant to novation, demonstrate Perry\u2019s intent to retain its claim against NP as guarantor. NP\u2019s February 29, 1988 letter expressly stated that \u201c[t]he Guaranty constitutes a valid and binding obligation of [NP], enforceable against [NP] in accordance with its terms.\u201d The December 14, 1989 Amendment also demonstrates the intent of the parties to hold NP to its obligations under the guaranty. In light of these clear indicators of the parties\u2019 intent that NP remain bound to its guaranty, we find that NP was not released from the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>NP next argues that Perry was required to first pursue its indemnification against AWHI before enforcing NP\u2019s guaranty. However, under Michigan law, \u201cwhether the guarantee must first sue the primary obligor depends upon the type of guaranty. While the guarantee may proceed immediately against the guarantor if it is a guaranty of payment, if it is a guaranty of collection, the guarantee must first sue the primary obligor.\u201d <em>Brodsky v. Lehigh Valley Indus., Inc., </em>424 F.Supp. 863, 864-65 (E.D.Mich.1976) (applying Michigan law). The guaranty in <em>Brodsky </em>guaranteed \u201cfull, prompt and complete performance\u201d and the district court thus held that the guarantee was under no duty to proceed first against the primary obligor. <em>Id. </em>at 865. Here, NP\u2019s guaranty of \u201cfull and complete performance\u201d employs virtually identical language as the guaranty in <em>Brodsky, </em>and contains no language indicating that Perry must proceed first against AWHI. Therefore, Perry may proceed directly against NP without resort to suit against AWHI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">NP claims that Perry\u2019s failure to give notice to AWHI was a basis for it to avoid its indemnity obligations. Section 10(c) of the Agreement provides that \u201cthe party seeking indemnification shall promptly notify the party from whom indemnification is sought ... provided that failure to notify the party from whom indemnification is sought on a prompt basis shall not relieve such party from its indemnity obligations hereunder.\u201d Not only does this language imply that NP is the party subject to notification\u2014as NP is the party from whom Perry sought indemnification\u2014but the language is clear that failure by the indemnitee to notice the indemnitor does not relieve the indemnitor of its obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">NP also argues that its guaranty does not apply to stores Perry subleased to AWD. However, the language of the indemnification provision provides that it applies to \u201cany and all claims asserted against Perry which relate to the properties or operations of the [AWD].\u201d This broad and all-inclusive language makes no distinction between subleased and store leases guaranteed by Perry. The language of the guaranty also fails to make a distinction between Perry-subleased and Perry-guaranteed stores. Instead, the guaranty promises AWHI\u2019s \u201cfull and complete performance\u201d under the Agreement. Thus, we hold that the Perry-subleased stores were contemplated by the indemnification agreement for which NP is liable as guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">B. Payment of Perry\u2019s Liability by Rite Aid</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">NP claims that because Perry\u2019s parent, Rite Aid, paid Perry\u2019s liabilities, Perry incurred no liability; and because Perry had incurred no liability, NP had no obligation to indemnify Perry. The district court found that NP \u201cmade no attempt, in spite of having every opportunity to do so, to question whether Perry remains indebted to its corporate parent for payments the parent made on behalf of its subsidiary.\u201d While Perry has submitted evidence that Rite Aid debited its internal account when paying for Perry\u2019s liabilities, the district court\u2019s finding indicates that NP may have waived this issue by failing to timely raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">In any event, an argument like NP\u2019s was disposed of in <em>Oakview Treatment Ctrs. of Kansas, Inc. v. Garrett, </em>53 F.Supp.2d 1196, 1208-09 (D.Kan.1999), which we find persuasive. In <em>Oakview, </em>the defendants argued that the plaintiff corporation\u2019s indemnity claim was barred because its parent companies had paid the costs and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>penses of the underlying litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 1208. The court rejected this argument, stating that \u201c[the defendants\u2019] argument is based on the fact that [the plaintiff corporation\u2019s] name does not appear on actual payments made on its behalf. This does not mean that [the plaintiff corporation] did not incur the costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found that the plaintiff corporation incurred the contested costs because the parent corporation paid its subsidiaries\u2019 expenses out of a central management account, and debited any expenses paid on behalf of the plaintiff corporation. <em>Id. </em>Here, as in <em>Oakview, </em>the parent corporation (Rite Aid) made payments in satisfaction of claims against its subsidiary, the indemnitee. NP has presented evidence that its account was debited for these costs. Thus, following <em>Oakview, </em>Rite Aid\u2019s payment of claims on behalf of Perry is immaterial to NP\u2019s obligation to guaranty the indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">III. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">NP challenges the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees, arguing that the Agreement does not provide for an award of all of Perry\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees sustained in the instant litigation, but only those attorneys\u2019 fees resulting from \u201ca breach of a representation, warranty or covenant\u201d or \u201cclaims asserted against Perry.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cohn v. Nat\u2019l Board of Trial Advocacy, </em>238 F.3d 702, 704 (6th Cir.2000). An abuse of discretion exists where this court is firmly convinced that a mistake has occurred, <em>Southward v. South Cent. Ready Mix Supply Corp., </em>7 F.3d 487, 492 (6th Cir.1993), or where a district court has relied upon clearly erroneous findings. <em>Romstadt v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>59 F.3d 608, 615 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">\u201cThe parties to a contract may include a provision that the breaching party will be required to pay the other side\u2019s attorney fees and such provisions are judicially enforceable.\u201d <em>Zeeland Farm Servs., Inc. v. JBL Enters., Inc., </em>219 Mich.App. 190, 555 N.W.2d 733, 736 (1996). A party\u2019s recovery under such a provision is \u201climited to reasonable attorney fees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The indemnification provision specifically provides for the indemnification of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, stating in relevant part that AWHI indemnifies against \u201cany and all ... costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneysf] fees, incurred or sustained by Perry resulting from ... [ (1)] any ... breach or violation of ... [the] warranties and covenants made by [AWHI]\u201d; or (2) \u201cclaims asserted against Perry which relate to the properties or operations of [AWD][.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">NP argues that because it did not itself breach the indemnification provision, Perry can only recover attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending against third-party AWD lease claims. However, the indemnification provision provides for attorneys\u2019 fees resulting from AWD lease claims, and Perry\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees in the instant litigation are result of AWD lease claims, namely because Perry\u2019s satisfaction of AWD lease claims caused it to pursue NP for its guaranty of indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">The use of the term \u201call\u201d in an indemnity clause has been interpreted to provide for the broadest possible indemnification. <em>Triple E, </em>530 N.W.2d at 776. Under a broad interpretation of the indemnification provision, the district court did not err in its award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">Additionally, NP contends that the \u201crecord establishes that it was Rite Aid, and not Perry, for whose benefit the fees were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>incurred and the entity that contracted for and paid the legal fees that were awarded.\u201d We find this argument to be without merit for the same reasons we found this argument unpersuasive with respect to Rite Aid\u2019s payment of Perry\u2019s lease liabilities. <em>See Oakview, </em>53 F.Supp.2d at 1208-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">IV. Reference to the Special Master</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Finally, NP contends \u201c[t]he referral of the legal fee issue to the Special Master was not authorized under Fed. R.Civ.P. 53 and the procedures there specified were not followed.\u201d A district court may appoint a master to \u201cperform duties consented to by the parties.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 53(a)(1)(A). Pursuant to Rule 53, on April 5, 2004, the district court entered a stipulated order of reference appointing the Special Master to determine \u201cthe issue of NP\u2019s liability and damages.\u201d While the order did not explicitly authorize the Special Master to determine NP\u2019s liability for attorneys\u2019 fees, such issue clearly pertains to NP\u2019s liability and damages. Like the issue of NP\u2019s liability for AWD lease obligations, NP\u2019s liability for attorneys\u2019 fees was determined pursuant to NP\u2019s guaranty of AWHI\u2019s indemnity obligations under the Agreement. Consequently, it cannot be said that the Special Master was without authority in determining NP\u2019s liability for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">. Northern Retail is now known as CSKG, Inc. At the time the parties entered into the Agreement, NP\u2019s predecessor-in-interest was Northern Pacific Corp. (\"Northern Pacific\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
