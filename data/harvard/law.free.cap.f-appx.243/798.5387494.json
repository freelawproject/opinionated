At the time, Bonilla was serving a two-year term of supervised release following a prior conviction and prison sentence for importing a quantity of marijuana and possessing with intent to distribute a quantity of marijuana. The district court sentenced Bonilla to 33 months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release. The district court also revoked Bonilla\u2019s supervised release and imposed a three-month prison sentence, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for unlawful entry. Bonilla appeals, asserting that his sentence is unreasonable because this court\u2019s rulings, post <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , have effectively reinstated the mandatory Guideline regime condemned in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-17\">The parties disagree concerning the standard of review that governs. We do not reach that issue because Bonilla\u2019s sentence passes muster under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-18\">Bonilla concedes that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent and that he wishes to preserve his arguments for further review in light of the grants of certiorari in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006), and <em>Claiborne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). Further, the record shows that the district court fulfilled its duty to consider the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors in addition to the Guidelines, and sentenced Bonilla to 33 months of imprisonment, the lowest end of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir. 2005). There is no indication that the sentence imposed is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Bonilla also contends that district courts should be free to disagree with the Guidelines\u2019s policy choices and that the district court should have been allowed to impose a below-guidelines sentence in part because of his family responsibilities and strong ties to the United States. Bonilla raises the argument only to preserve it for further review. As Bonilla concedes, his contention is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Guidry, </em>462 F.3d 373, 377 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Bonilla argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 33-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Bonilla\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Bonilla properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
