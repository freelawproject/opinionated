Remand orders issued under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the grounds specified therein are usually immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d). Accordingly, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to review this case. We have provisional jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we have jurisdiction to determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear the case. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 622, 628, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002). For the reasons set forth below, we find that we lack jurisdiction to review this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Section 1447(d) states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not renewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Despite this broad prohibition, the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 1447(d) must be read together with \u00a7 1447(c) such that \u00a7 1447(d) precludes review only of remands made pursuant to a ground enumerated in \u00a7 1447(c). <em>See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 346, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976) (\u201c[Ojnly remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the grounds specified therein\u2014that removal was improvident and without jurisdiction\u2014are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 711-15, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). \u201cSection 1447(c) states that remand may be ordered either for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for \u2018any defect\u2019 in the removal procedure.\u201d <em>Aguon-Schulte v. Guam Election Comm\u2019n, </em>469 F.3d 1236, 1240 (9th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The statute further states that a motion to remand for any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within thirty days after the filing of the notice of removal under \u00a7 1446(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). Therefore, we have no authority to review a remand ordered for (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction or (2) a timely raised \u201cdefect\u201d in the removal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We conclude that this basis for remand related not to subject matter jurisdiction, but to another defect in the removal procedure. <em>See id. </em>The right to remove a case from state to federal court is vested exclusively in \u201cthe defendant or the defendants....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). The district court granted Bilbruck\u2019s motion to remand after concluding that BNSF is not the defendant, but the plaintiff at whose will the \u201cinstitution and continuance of the proceedings depend[ed].\u201d <em>See Chicago, R.I. &amp; P.R. Co. v. Stude, </em>346 U.S. 574, 580, 74 S.Ct. 290, 98 L.Ed. 317 (1954). Regardless of whether the district court was correct in its application of <em>Stude, </em>because we conclude that the district court granted the remand on the basis of this timely raised procedural defect, we lack jurisdiction to review this appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">BNSF contends, however, that Bilbruck\u2019s assertion of this procedural defect was not timely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). We disagree. On January 25, 2005, BNSF removed the action to the federal district court. Bilbruck moved to remand the case on February 18, 2005. BNSF does not dispute that Bilbruck filed the motion to remand raising this procedural defect within the thirty-day limit prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). However, ten days later, the district court denied without prejudice Bilbruck\u2019s motion because it failed to comply with a local rule which required that the motion state whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>BNSF objected to the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this order, the district court stated that Bilbruck was permitted to resubmit his motion, provided that he complied with the local rule. On March 2, 2005\u2014two days beyond the thirty-day limit\u2014Bilbruck amended his remand motion to comply with the local rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">BNSF is correct that Bilbruck failed to file a defect-free motion to remand within the thirty-day deadline. This failure, however, is not fatal. Although \u00a7 1447(c)\u2019s thirty-day deadline is plainly mandatory, the deadline does not render a timely filed motion to remand untimely simply because the movant is required to amend that motion to comply with a local rule. <em>See Phoenix Global Ventures, LLC v. Phoenix Hotel Assocs., Ltd., </em>422 F.3d 72, 76 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Farzana K. v. Indiana Dept. of Ed., </em>473 F.3d 703 (7th Cir.2007); <em>Somlyo v. J. Lu-Rob Enters., Inc., </em>932 F.2d 1043, 1048-49 (2d Cir.1991) (noting that a district court has inherent authority to determine when to overlook or excuse a departure from its own local rules, regardless of whether such departure is authorized in the local rules). Bilbruck\u2019s motion to remand was timely despite his failure to comply with a local rule. Further, BNSF has not identified any prejudice arising from the two-day delay in its receipt of the amended remand motion. <em>See Phoenix Global Ventures, LLC, </em>422 F.3d at 76. Therefore, we hold that the district court properly exercised its discretion when it found that Bilbruck\u2019s technical noncompliance did not render his motion to remand untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">Because the district court\u2019s remand order related to \u201cany defect\u201d in the removal procedure, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), and the district court acted within its discretion in waiving Bilbruck\u2019s failure to comply with the local rule, Bilbruck\u2019s motion to remand was timely, <em>see Phoenix Global Ventures, LLC, </em>422 F.3d at 76, and the district court\u2019s remand order is unreviewable, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to hear this case, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\">. Montana District Court Local Rule 7.1(j) requires that, \"[w]ithin the text of each motion submitted to the Court, the moving party shall note that other parties have been contacted concerning the motion and whether other parties object to the motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007), does not impact our holding. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the filing deadline for a Notice of Appeal is jurisdictional. <em>See id. </em>at 2365. The Court based its holding on the fact that the filing deadline is set forth in a statute. <em>See id. </em>(recognizing that Notice to Appeal deadlines are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a)). Here, Bilbruck\u2019s motion to remand was filed within the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)\u2019s thirty-day deadline, but it ran afoul of a <em>local </em>rule. The <em>Bowles </em>Court recognized that such rules are not jurisdictional. <em>See Bowles, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2364 (recognizing that filing deadlines not dictated by statute are \u201cprocedural rules adopted by the [court] for the orderly transaction of its business\u201d and \"are not jurisdictional.\u201d (quoting <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004) (internal quotations omitted))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-14\">. Because we determine we are without jurisdiction to review this case, we do not address whether the district court erred when, relying on <em>Shamrock Motors v. Ford Motor Co., </em>120 F.3d 196 (9th Cir.1997), it identified an alternate procedural defect in removal and held that the case before it was not a \"civil action\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. We note, however, that the viability of <em>Shamrock Motors </em>is highly questionable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Chicago v. Int'l College of Surgeons, </em>522 U.S. 156, 118 S.Ct. 523, 139 L.Ed.2d 525 (1997). <em>See id. </em>at 178-79, 118 S.Ct. 523 (Ginsburg J., dissenting) (listing <em>Shamrock Motors </em>among the cases that <em>College of Surgeons </em>\"overrides\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
