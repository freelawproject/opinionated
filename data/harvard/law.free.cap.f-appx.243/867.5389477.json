Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 245 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Moore v. City of Kilgore, </em>877 F.2d 364, 376 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Boddie v. City of Columbus, </em>989 F.2d 745, 748-49 (5th Cir.1993). Phillips, who was a fire fighter for the City of Victoria and president of the Victoria Fire Fighters Union (\u2018VFFA\u201d) at the time of the events giving rise to this dispute, alleges that Riley, fire chief for the City of Victoria, suspended Phillips\u2019s city driving permit because he submitted a signed grievance to the City of Victoria on behalf of the VFFA asserting that Riley had made \u201creckless, dangerous, and hazardous decisions and judgments in the delivery of the Fire Department\u2019s services to the public,\u201d and calling for Riley\u2019s termination. Riley concedes that the suspension of Phillips\u2019s city driving permit is an adverse employment action. And Riley does not challenge the district court\u2019s determinations that Phillips\u2019s grievance was speech related to a matter of public concern and Phillips\u2019s interest in speech and association outweighed the city\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency. Finally, the district court determined that the summary judgment evidence created a genuine fact issue regarding whether Riley\u2019s conduct was motivated by Phillips\u2019s grievance against Riley.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Riley raises three arguments on appeal challenging the district court\u2019s assessment of the summary judgment evidence. It is well-established that on interlocutory appeal we lack jurisdiction to challenge the district court\u2019s determination regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, that is, whether there is enough summary judgment evidence in the record for a jury to conclude that certain facts are true. <em>See Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995). We consider only \u201cwhether the district court erred in assessing the legal significance of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">Riley argues that Phillips\u2019s summary judgment evidence is insufficient to establish that Riley\u2019s decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit was motivated by Phillips\u2019s grievance against Riley. He contends that he suspended Phillips\u2019s city driving permit because Phillips drove his motorcycle off-duty while intoxicated and was involved in an accident. Riley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>further argues that the suspension was inevitable under city policy and that only the City Manager had the authority to impose any less discipline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the district court determined that Phillips\u2019s summary judgment evidence was sufficient to create genuine fact issues regarding whether Riley\u2019s decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit was motivated by Phillips\u2019s grievance against Riley and whether the suspension was inevitable. The district court relied on Riley\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d investigation of Phillips\u2019s motorcycle accident in which Riley told the district attorney that he hoped he \u201cdidn\u2019t give leniency\u201d to Phillips and evidence that Phillips was treated differently than other fire fighters whose conduct violated the fire department employee manual. The summary judgment record also shows that Riley told Phillips\u2019s attorney that Phillips\u2019s employment would not be affected as long as he was not convicted of driving while intoxicated (which he was not) and that Phillips\u2019s accident did not fall under any of the circumstances in the city\u2019s \u201cDriving of Vehicles\u201d policy that required the suspension of his city driving permit. Because Riley disputes the sufficiency of Phillips\u2019s evidence and we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s \u201cdetermination that the evidence is sufficient to permit a particular finding of fact after trial,\u201d Johnson, 515 U.S. at 314, 115 S.Ct. 2151 we lack jurisdiction to consider these portions of Riley\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Riley also contends that City Manager Denny Arnold and not Riley was the final decision maker in the decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit. The district court, relying on our decision in <em>Hitt, </em>301 F.3d at 248-49, determined that \u201cRiley was the final decision-maker for purposes of determining causation\u201d because Assistant City Manager Charles Windwehen and Arnold reviewed Riley\u2019s decision only after Phillips chose to appeal Riley\u2019s decision, and without the elective review, Riley\u2019s decision to suspend Phillips would have been final. Riley asserts that the summary judgment evidence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> particularly Arnold\u2019s affidavit, \u201cunquestionably establishes\u201d that Arnold made the final decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit, and therefore <em>Hitt </em>is distinguishable. To the extent that Riley\u2019s arguments are fact-based, they are misplaced in this interlocutory appeal. We lack jurisdiction to review the correctness of the district court\u2019s conclusion, on the summary judgment record, that Riley was the final decision maker for purposes of causation. <em>See Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 361; <em>Coleman v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>113 F.3d 528, 532 n. 4 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>To the extent that Riley argues that the district court erred in assessing the legal import of the summary judgment evidence by applying an incorrect legal framework to that evidence, we conclude that the district court did not err. The district court noted that Arnold\u2019s affidavit stated that the decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit was not final until Arnold and Windwehen completed their independent reviews. But our decision in <em>Hitt </em>makes clear that \u201cthe mere authority to review an employment decision is not decisive.\u201d <em>Hitt, </em>301 F.3d at 248-49. Under <em>Hitt, </em>other relevant factors, phrased in relation to the instant case, include whether Riley has the authority to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit, whether Windwehen\u2019s and Arnold\u2019s reviews are merely elective on the part of the employee or instead are necessary to finalize the decision, and whether their review is for \u201cconformity with applicable law and regulations.\u201d <em>Id,.; see also Quinn v. Monroe County, </em>330 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2003). Based on the facts the district court deemed to be sufficiently supported by the record, the district court did not err in concluding that <em>Hitt </em>governs the instant case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Riley also raises challenges to the admissibility of Phillips\u2019s summary judgment evidence. On interlocutory appeal, we limit our review to the evidence that was critical to the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment. <em>See Mersch v. City of Dallas, Tex., </em>207 F.3d 732, 735 (5th Cir. 2000). We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Brazos River Auth. v. GE Ionics, Inc., </em>469 F.3d 416, 423 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">First, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Riley\u2019s motion to exclude Chris Hamrick\u2019s affidavit. Riley\u2019s argument of prejudice is belied by his own affidavit, which shows that Riley was not deprived of any opportunity to respond in detail to the situation described by Hamrick. Riley\u2019s argument that Ham-rick\u2019s affidavit is irrelevant fails because the affidavit was relied on to show Riley\u2019s intent, and intent is a critical element of a First Amendment retaliation claim. <em>See generally Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 373 n. 42. Second, Riley\u2019s argument that his testimony regarding fire fighter Shawn Hoff is irrelevant fails. Because Hoff was rumored to have reported to work intoxicated and that rumor was investigated, Hoffs situation is not irrelevant to the question whether Phillips was treated differently than other fire fighters in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Riley next argues that his decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit did not violate a clearly established constitutional right because he suspended Phil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>lips\u2019s city driving permit for driving while intoxicated, and Phillips has no clearly established constitutional right to violate city policy by driving while intoxicated. Riley\u2019s argument improperly advances his version of the genuinely disputed facts concerning what motivated him to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit. Beyond advancing his version of the factual dispute, Riley does not challenge the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that the violation of the rights Phillips alleges are clearly established. Nor could he succeed if he did. Here, Phillips alleges that Riley suspended his city driving permit because Phillips filed a grievance against Riley on behalf of the VFFA. In Moore, we held that a fire fighter\u2019s public speech regarding a staffing shortage in the fire department and the shortage\u2019s impact on fire fighter and public safety was related to a matter of public concern such that the subsequent suspension of the fire fighter on the basis of his speech violated the First Amendment. 877 F.2d at 376. And this court has held it clearly established that a government employer violates the First Amendment when he retaliates against an employee for engaging in union activities. <em>See, e.g., Boddie, </em>989 F.2d at 748-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Finally, Riley contends that even if Phillips\u2019s constitutional rights were violated, his own conduct in suspending Phillips was objectively reasonable because (1) an arguable basis existed for his actions given city practice, (2) Windwehen and Arnold agreed with his decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s city driving permit, and (3) Phillips\u2019s misconduct required suspension. But each argument again improperly hinges on Riley\u2019s version of the genuinely disputed facts concerning what motivated Riley\u2019s decision to suspend Phillips\u2019s driving permit and whether Phillips\u2019s suspension was inevitable. Intent is a \u201ccritical element\u201d of a First Amendment retaliation claim. <em>Tompkins v. Vickers, </em>26 F.3d 603, 607 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Crawford-El v. Britton, </em>523 U.S. 574, 588-89, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998). When reviewing the objective reasonableness of an official\u2019s conduct, we do not disregard the district court\u2019s conclusion that a genuine issue of fact exists regarding the official\u2019s intent: \u201c[w]hen an official\u2019s intent or the reasons for his or her actions are an essential element of the underlying violation, we have treated factual disputes over intent just like any other factual dispute that can justify a denial of qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 373 &amp; n. 43 (collecting cases); <em>see also Locurto v. Safir, </em>264 F.3d 154, 169 (2d Cir.2001). Riley\u2019s conduct, as presented in the summary judgment record and viewed in Phillips\u2019s favor, was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law. <em>See Moore, </em>877 F.2d at 376; <em>Boddie, </em>989 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court denying Riley\u2019s motion for summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-5\">. At oral argument Riley shifted his argument from whether <em>Riley himself </em>inevitably would have suspended Phillips\u2019s city driving permit (as he argued below) to whether City Manager Denny Arnold and Assistant City Manager Charles Windwehen inevitably would have suspended Phillips\u2019s city driving permit. We will not address arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-6\">. Riley contends that he is entitled to state official immunity from Phillips\u2019s state law claim for the same reason that he is entitled to qualified immunity\u2014because he has established \u201cthat he has not denied Phillips public employment because of his membership or non-membership in a labor organization.\u201d Because Riley's argument for official immunity relies solely on the sufficiency of Phillips\u2019s evidence, we lack jurisdiction to address this portion of Riley's appeal. <em>Johnson, </em>515 U.S. at 314, 115 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b891-11\">. Riley\u2019s final-decision-maker argument on appeal relies heavily on the City Charter for the City of Victoria. Unfortunately, Riley did not make this argument in the district court proceedings and the City Chatter is not part of the record on appeal. Accordingly, counsel for Riley improperly included the City Charter at Tab 6 of Riley's record excerpts. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 30.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">. Riley also argues that the district court erred in relying on <em>Hitt </em>instead of our decision in <em>Brown v. City of Houston, </em>337 F.3d 539 (5th Cir.2003). <em>Brown </em>is inapposite; it is a case in which the issue is whether municipal liability can be imposed based on allegedly discriminatory action by the mayor, who was alleged by the plaintiff to be a policymaker for the city. See <em>generally Quinn, </em>330 F.3d at 1326 (distinguishing between the policymaker and final-decision-maker inquiries). In <em>Brown, </em>we concluded that the mayor was not a <em>policymaker </em>for purposes of imposing municipal liability for the plaintiff's firing because the mayor placed an employee on indefinite suspension and had only that limited power under the city's code. The mayor's decision was \"subject to review\u201d by the Civil Service Commission, which actually terminated the plaintiff, having the power to make the \u2018final\u2019 decision to \u2018sustain the action, lessen the penalty, increase the penalty, or reject the action of the mayor.\u2019 \" <em>Brown, </em>337 F.3d at 541 (quoting the city code).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b892-11\">. Riley asks us to \u201cstrike\u201d the portions of his deposition that are not properly cited in Phillips's brief. This challenge has no merit because Phillips properly cited to the portion of Riley's deposition upon which the district court relied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
