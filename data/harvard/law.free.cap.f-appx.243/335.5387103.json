We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review Leyva-Estrada\u2019s contention that the BIA denied him a full and fair hearing, because he failed to adequately raise this issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (court lacks jurisdiction to review claims that could have been, but were not, exhausted in administrative proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Leyva-Estrada\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s application of the reopening regulations deprived him of due process is not a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]raditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute color-able constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Leyva-Estrada\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (an alien seeking to reopen proceedings before the BIA must file the motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision). Leyva-Estrada did not demonstrate that he exercised diligence in discovering his prior counsel\u2019s errors. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (equitable tolling is available to a petitioner who establishes she suffered from deception, fraud or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Leyva Estrada\u2019s motion to file a late reply brief is granted. The clerk shall file the reply brief received on September 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b358-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
