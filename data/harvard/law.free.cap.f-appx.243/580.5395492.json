Sheppard appeals his sentences for one count of threatening to kill the President and one count of threatening to kill an immediate family member of the President, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 871(a) and 879(a)(2). The government concedes that a sentencing error in this case occurred and after our own review, we agree and vacate and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">While Sheppard was a federal prisoner, prison officials found an envelope addressed to President George W. Bush that contained a letter that threatened President Bush and his family. Sheppard was identified as the sender on the return address. In addition, forensic analysis revealed that it was his handwriting in the letter and that his fingerprints were on the letter and the envelope. Sheppard was indicted and, after a jury trial, found guilty of both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-19\">The probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommending that Sheppard receive a 4-level reduction in his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(5). Under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(5), the defendant\u2019s offense level is decreased by 4 levels if the offense \u201cinvolved a single instance evidencing little or no deliberation.\u201d However, a defendant is not entitled to this reduction if, <em>inter alia, </em>he has received a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2) because the offense involved \u201cmore than two threats.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-20\">The government objected to the 4-level reduction and provided the probation officer with four additional threatening letters Sheppard wrote to President Bush, Vice President Richard Cheney and the presiding judge in this case. Sheppard wrote these four letters <em>after </em>he was indicted for the instant offenses and was awaiting trial. The government argued that these four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>letters should be counted as relevant conduct. According to the government, once the four letters were considered, Sheppard\u2019s offense level must be increased by 2 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2), which would then disqualify him from receiving the 4-level reduction under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In response to the government\u2019s objections, the probation officer revised the PSI. Citing the four additional threatening letters provided by the government, the amended PSI included the 2-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2) and deleted the 4-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">At sentencing, over Sheppard\u2019s objection, the district court considered the four additional threatening letters as relevant conduct and adopted the guidelines calculations in the amended PSI. Thus, the district court imposed the 2-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2) and declined to impose the 4-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(5). With a total offense level of 16 and a criminal history category of V, Sheppard\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 41 to 51 months. The district court imposed two concurrent 46-month sentences. Sheppard filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">On appeal, Sheppard argues, and the government concedes, that the district court erred in relying on the four additional threatening letters to support the \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 2-level enhancement if the threatening communications \u201cinvolved more than two threats....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2). The commentary to \u00a7 2A6.1(b) indicates that the sentencing court should \u201cconsider both conduct that occurred <em>prior </em>to the offense and conduct that occurred <em>during </em>the offense .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 1 (emphasis supplied). However, this Court has concluded that conduct that did not occur \u201cbefore or during\u201d the offense, but rather \u201cafter\u201d the offense has been completed, is not considered in determining whether to apply a \u00a7 2A6.1(b) enhancement. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Here, the district court imposed the 2-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(2)(b) based on the four threatening letters Sheppard wrote <em>after </em>he had been indicted for the instant offenses. Under <em>Scott, </em>this was error. Therefore, we must vacate Sheppard\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing. On remand, the district court shall consider whether, absent consideration of the four additional letters, the Sentencing Guidelines call for a 2-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2). If the district court answers this question in the negative, the district court shall also consider whether Sheppard should receive a 4-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\">.

In <em>Scott, </em>the defendant was interviewed by the FBI after he mailed threatening letters to a federal judge. 441 F.3d at 1324. During the interview, the defendant made statements suggesting that he intended to carry out his threats once he was released from prison. <em>Id. </em>Based on these statements, the district court imposed a 6-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(l), because \"the offense involved conduct evidencing an intent to carry out\u201d the threats. <em>Id. </em>at 1324-25 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court reversed, explaining that the commentary to \u00a7 2A6.1(b) required the conduct to have been \"committed before or during the offense ...\u201d and Scott\u2019s statements to the FBI had occurred while he was in custody and \"after the crime had been completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-15\">.
