We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">In March 2005, Orama filed a complaint in the District Court, alleging that Morris County Police Officer Christopher Boyko violated his rights by causing him injury in the course of handcuffing him and testing him for driving under the influence. Ora-ma also alleges that Boyko discriminated against him due to his race and disability. The defendant answered the complaint and the Magistrate Judge issued a scheduling order. On July 10, 2006, the Magistrate Judge held a conference with the parties to address deficiencies in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-25\">After the conference, the Magistrate Judge issued an order directing that Ora-ma\u2019s pretrial submissions were due on September 8, 2006. Orama did not submit the materials, and on September 27, 2006, the Magistrate Judge issued an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. In response, Orama submitted a letter asserting that the District Court had discriminated against him. Orama complained that Boyko was receiving \u201cspecial privileges.\u201d Orama also claimed he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>threatened with being put in jail \u201cevery-time [Boyko] wants to obtain information.\u201d Orama did not offer any additional explanation of these accusations. His letter also noted that \u201c[i]f the Defendant is in such a rush to finish this case and is willing to pay for pain and suffering, I am willing to listen to a reasonable negotiation.\u201d He indicated that if Boyko did not engage in negotiation, he would continue to wait for a response from the various agencies and legal advocacy groups that he had contacted for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">On October 10, 2006, the Magistrate Judge, by letter order, gave Orama <em>\u201cone final opportunity </em>to meet his obligations as a litigant,\u201d and assigned a November 8, 2006, deadline for submission of the materials. The letter specified that if Orama failed to comply, the Magistrate Judge would recommend appropriate sanctions. When Orama again failed to comply, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice, citing <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>747 F.2d 863 (3d Cir.1984). On December 13, 2006, the District Court issued an order giving Orama \u201cone final opportunity to show cause,\u201d and setting an oral argument date. Oral arguments were held, and on December 27, 2006, the District Court ordered Orama to produce all pretrial submissions by January 5, 2007. The order specified that the report and recommendation would remain under consideration pending Orama\u2019s compliance with the order. When Orama again failed to submit the materials, the District Court adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Orama now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He has also filed a motion requesting that the defendant produce the original video tape documenting his May 2003 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Mindek v. Rigatti, </em>964 F.2d 1369, 1373 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Management of discovery is uniquely within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivJP. 16(a)-(b); <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litigation, </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982) (\u201cmatters of docket control and conduct of discovery are committed to the sound discretion of the district court\u201d). District courts may use sanctions to facilitate pretrial proceedings and enforce pretrial orders. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivJP. 16(b); <em>Mindek, </em>964 F.2d at 1373. In light of Orama\u2019s multiple failures to comply with the District Court\u2019s calls for pretrial submissions, sanctions were warranted. The only remaining issue is whether the District Court\u2019s abused its discretion by employing the \u201cextreme sanction\u201d of dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Dismissal with prejudice is only appropriate in limited circumstances; doubts should be resolved in favor of reaching a decision on the merits. <em>Emerson v. Thiel College, </em>296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir.2002). Accordingly, before dismissing an action, a district court is required to make explicit findings regarding the six factors enumerated in our decision in <em>Poulis. See United States v. $8,221,877.16 in U.S. Currency, </em>330 F.3d 141, 162 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Emcasco Ins. Co. v. Sambrick, </em>834 F.2d 71, 74 (3d Cir.1987). The <em>Poulis </em>factors to be weighed by the District Court are: (1) the extent of the party\u2019s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party ... was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim. <em>See Poulis, </em>747 F.2d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Orama\u2019s failures to comply warranted dismissal with prejudice. The report and recommendation set out findings with regard to each factor. The Magistrate Judge noted in Orama\u2019s favor that Orama did not have a history of non-compliance with court orders, and that the judge could not conclude from the pleadings alone that Orama did not have meritorious claims. The Court concluded, however, that this was outweighed by Orama\u2019s willful decision not to comply with past orders, and expressed intention not to comply with future orders, making it impossible to ready the matter for trial, and rendering alternative sanctions ineffective. <em>See Mindek, </em>964 F.2d at 1373 (not all <em>Poulis </em>factors need to be satisfied in order to dismiss a complaint). Although Orama\u2019s argument that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(f) does not mandate dismissal is correct, repeated failure to comply with pretrial orders can be grounds for dismissal. <em>See id. </em>We cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in finding dismissal warranted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. Appellant\u2019s motion to compel production of the videotape of his arrest is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\">. Orama\u2019s notice of appeal cites the date of the report and recommendation. However, the document also refers to District Court Judge William J. Martini, and the judgment in favor of the defendant. Giving Orama the wide latitude afforded to pro se litigants, we construe his notice as appealing the District Court\u2019s final order entered January 22, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
