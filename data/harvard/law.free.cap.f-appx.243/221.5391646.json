Griffin appeals the dismissal of his action, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses by warden Mike Mahoney and related defendants. We review a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A de novo. <em>Ramirez v. Galaza, </em>334 F.3d 850, 853 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Due process claims require that the plaintiff suffer \u201ca deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.\u201d <em>Brewster v. Bd. of Educ. of Lynwood Unified Sell. Dist., </em>149 F.3d 971, 982 (9th Cir.1998). Griffin\u2019s first claim, founded on the allegation that he has been unlawfully denied sexual offender treatment while in prison, does not implicate a protected interest. Sexual offenders serving criminal sentences do not have a constitutional right to rehabilitative treatment. Ba<em>lla v. Idaho State Bd. of Corr., </em>869 F.2d 461, 470 (9th Cir.1989). Nor does the delay Griffin has experienced in being admitted to the program constitute an \u201catypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\u201d making it insufficient to establish a liberty interest. <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Griffin\u2019s second due process claim, alleging denial of parole eligibility due to Griffin\u2019s inability to complete sexual offender treatment, also does not implicate a protected interest. Prisoners have \u201cno constitutional or inherent right\u201d to parole, <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979), and Montana\u2019s current statutory parole scheme does not create a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>See Worden v. Mont. Bd. of Pardons &amp; Parole, </em>289 Mont. 459, 962 P.2d 1157, 1165 (1998). Dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">Griffin\u2019s equal protection claims alleged that (1) there is unequal treatment of sexual offenders at the prison, and (2) there is unequal treatment of inmate sex offenders relative to prison staff sex offenders. Because the preferential treatment alleged in the former claim is neither based on a suspect classification nor impinges on constitutionally protected rights, it must merely withstand rational basis review. <em>City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). Montana\u2019s policy of scheduling offender participation in treatment groups according to parole eligibility and discharge dates is rationally related to legitimate state interests. Although the policy was not followed in Griffin\u2019s case due to clerical errors, delaying Griffin\u2019s treatment, Griffin does not allege that he was intentionally or arbitrarily discriminated against and cannot proceed on a \u201cclass of one\u201d theory. <em>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 </em>U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Griffin\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
