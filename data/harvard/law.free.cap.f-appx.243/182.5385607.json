Borders already had a string of convictions, and while preparing the presentence report for this case, the probation officer caught Borders running another scheme. The district court sentenced Borders to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, 18 months above the high end of the guidelines range. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Borders raises two challenges to his sentence. First, he contends that the district court should have, but did not, warn him of its intention to impose a sentence above the guidelines imprisonment range. Second, he argues that the district court did not sufficiently explain why it deviated from the guidelines range, thus resulting in an unreasonable prison sentence. Both contentions are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In 1996 Borders and his wife began sending fraudulent invoices to businesses that advertised in legitimate magazines. The invoices were, ostensibly, for advertisements printed in other publications, but those publications did not exist. Between 1996 and August 2003 the Borderses (joined in 2002 by their 17-year-old son) billed $1.2 million to 3,385 businesses; more than 900 businesses mailed them checks totaling over $305,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In their plea agreement, the parties calculated a total offense level of 25, reflecting a base offense level of 6, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1); increases for intended losses exceeding $1 million, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I), more than 50 victims, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B), and use of a minor in committing the offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.4; and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. The parties also agreed that Borders\u2019s criminal history placed him in category VI which combined with his total offense level of 25 yielded a recommended imprisonment range of 110 to 137 months. The government agreed not to argue for a sentence outside the guidelines range, and Borders waived his right to appeal except as to the reasonableness of a sentence above the guidelines range as \u201cdetermined by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Borders\u2019s probation officer then prepared a presentence report, calculating Borders\u2019s criminal history and offense level as in the plea agreement, except that he determined there were more than 250 victims, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C), which resulted in a total offense level of 27. Coupling that with Borders\u2019s criminal history, the probation officer calculated an imprisonment range of 130 to 162 months. The probation officer also discovered that Borders had not ceased his criminal activity. In particular, Borders was trying to con restaurants by hounding them to refund the price of food he never purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">At sentencing the district court adopted the guidelines calculations set forth in the presentence report. Borders insisted that his actual criminal history was not as bad as it looked on paper because, he said, his son and daughter actually committed one of the crimes he pleaded guilty to in the past. He also maintained that he tried the restaurant hustle only after a friend had put him onto it, and he asked for leniency. But the court found that Borders had been \u201cnothing but a liar, a cheat, and a flim-flam man\u201d all his life and was even \u201ctrying to do it here standing before me now.\u201d The court recounted Borders\u2019s \u201cabysmal\u201d history, including eight prior felonies, five for conduct similar to the ad scam. The court found that Borders was \u201ca threat to the general public\u201d and needed \u201csevere punishment.\u201d The court labeled Borders a \u201cbad seed\u201d and told him that the \u201chigh end of the guidelines isn\u2019t sufficient for you.\u201d Concluding that \u201ca guideline sentence doesn\u2019t take into account all\u201d Borders had done, the court imposed a prison sentence of 180 months, three years of supervised release, and restitution of $305,163.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">On appeal Borders first contends that the district court violated Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(h) by not giving him advance notice of its intent to \u201cdepart\u201d upward from the guidelines range for his prison sentence. This argument is foreclosed by his appeal waiver, which allows Borders to challenge only the <em>reasonableness </em>of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>above-guidelines sentence. In any event, his argument is also contrary to circuit precedent. We have held that Rule 32(h) does not require the district court to warn a defendant before imposing a sentence outside the range. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>447 F.3d 999, 1007 (7th Cir.2006). As we explained in <em>Walker, </em>after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), all defendants are on notice that the sentencing court may exercise its discretion to exceed the guidelines range as warranted by factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and no additional notice is required. <em>See Walker, </em>447 F.3d at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Borders next challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court did not give sufficient reasons for exceeding the guidelines range. A district court must explain, with reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, its choice to sentence the defendant outside the guidelines range; the farther outside the guidelines range the sentence is, the more compelling that explanation must be. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Vasquez, </em>469 F.3d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Valle, </em>458 F.3d 652, 656 (7th Cir.2006). But the court need not discuss every factor, so long as it explains its sentencing choice in a manner consistent with \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Nitch, </em>477 F.3d 933, 937 (7th Cir.2007); <em>Orozco-Vasquez, </em>469 F.3d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Here the district court adequately justified imposing a term of imprisonment 18 months beyond the 162-month high end of the advisory range. The court commented on Borders\u2019s \u201cabysmal\u201d criminal past and noted that Borders \u201ccan\u2019t help but try to screw people out of money.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Several times the court referenced the need to protect the public from Borders and reasoned that he deserved a severe punishment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), (C). The court concluded that a guidelines sentence simply did not account for all of Borders\u2019s crimes. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). Thus, Borders\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See Valle, </em>458 F.3d at 658-59 (upholding sentence 51 months above guidelines range where district court explained that lengthy sentence was necessary because defendant was likely to keep committing crimes); <em>Walker, </em>447 F.3d at 1008 (noting that increase of 30 months\u2019 imprisonment over high end of advisory range was appropriately justified by court\u2019s discussion of nature and seriousness of offense and need for deterrence, just punishment, and protection of public).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
