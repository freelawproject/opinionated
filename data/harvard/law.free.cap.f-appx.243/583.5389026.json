After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b605-25\">Campbell\u2019s charges stemmed from a government sting in which Campbell and two codefendants, Maurice Hicks and Adrian Daniels, planned to rob a cocaine stash house containing fifteen kilograms of cocaine. Daniels pled guilty and cooperated with the government. Campbell and Hicks pled not guilty and went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Following trial, a jury convicted Campbell and Hicks on both counts. The jury specially found that the drug conspiracy involved five or more kilograms of cocaine. Hicks was sentenced to 228 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Prior to Campbell\u2019s sentencing, his Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) found, among other things, that Campbell qualified as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines. The statutory maximum sentence for Campbell\u2019s drug conspiracy offense was life imprisonment, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and the PSI assigned Campbell a total offense level as a career offender of 37, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A). The PSI listed seventeen adult convictions. However, because Campbell was a career offender, the sentencing guidelines set and the PSI assigned, Campbell\u2019s criminal history category at VI regardless of his criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The PSI concluded that, as to the drug conspiracy offense, Campbell\u2019s statutory mandatory <em>minimum </em>was twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). As to the firearm offense, the PSI concluded that Campbell\u2019s statutory mandatory <em>minimum </em>was five years\u2019 imprisonment, and that the sentence must run consecutive to any other sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae. Ultimately, the PSI calculated that Campbell\u2019s guidelines range by adding the mandatory minimum consecutive penalty of 60 months for the firearm count to the applicable 360 months to life imprisonment range for the drug conspiracy count, which yielded a total of 420 months to life. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">At the initial sentencing, Campbell objected to the PSI, asserting the \u201chuge disparity\u201d between his guidelines range and co-defendant Hicks\u2019s 228-month sentence. The district court overruled Campbell\u2019s objection and adopted the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations. The district court then imposed a 360-month sentence for Campbell\u2019s drug conspiracy conviction, followed by a consecutive 60-month sentence on Campbell\u2019s firearm conviction, for a total of 420 months\u2019 imprisonment, imposed under a mandatory guidelines regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Campbell appealed to this Court, which vacated Campbell\u2019s sentence and directed the district court to resentence Campbell under advisory guidelines as required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>174 Fed.Appx. 505, 506-07 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished). However, this Court affirmed Campbell\u2019s career offender status and the district court\u2019s correct calculation of Campbell\u2019s guidelines range and vacated only for re-sentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">At resentencing, the government asked the district court to reimpose a 420-month sentence. Campbell raised several arguments in mitigation, including: (1) that Campbell\u2019s offense, though serious, arose out of a government sting operation in which the government was in control and no one would actually be harmed, and (2) that many of Campbell\u2019s prior convictions were petty or a result of his drug problem. However, Campbell argued that the most important factor was the disparity between his advisory guidelines range and his co-defendant Hicks\u2019s 228-month sentence. According to Campbell, the only difference between him and Hicks was Campbell\u2019s career offender status and that Hicks had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>been the organizer of the drug conspiracy. Thus, Campbell maintained that he should receive a sentence similar to Hicks\u2019s 228-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The district court stated that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and noted that a \u201clengthy prison sentence [was appropriate] in view of the seriousness of the offense and [Campbell\u2019s] criminal history.\u201d However, the district court also concluded that a sentence below the advisory guidelines range was appropriate, noting that such a sentence would: (1) still reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment and adequately deter criminal conduct; (2) protect the public from future crimes by Campbell, noting especially Campbell\u2019s age upon release; and (3) provide time for education and vocational training. The district court also stated that a sentence below the advisory guidelines range would be \u201cmore proportional to the sentence received by [co-defendant Hicks], who was equally if not more culpab[le],\u201d and yet still would be \u201csufficiently longer\u201d than Hicks\u2019s sentence to account for Campbell\u2019s \u201cmore serious criminal history [and] career offender status.\u201d Accordingly, the district court imposed a 264-month sentence on the drug conspiracy conviction and a consecutive 60-month sentence on the firearm conviction, for a total sentence of 324 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Campbell filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">On appeal, Campbell argues that his 324-month sentence is unreasonable due to the disparity between it and codefendant Hicks\u2019s 228-month sentence. Specifically, Campbell argues that his sentence should be closer to Hicks\u2019s sentence because Hicks was convicted under the same charges, was the organizer of the planned robbery, and also had a substantial criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range and then consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201c[T]he party challenging the sentence bears the initial burden of establishing that the district court considered an impermissible factor at sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">After review, nothing in the record convinces us that Campbell\u2019s 324-month sentence is unreasonable. First, Campbell\u2019s sentence is well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment, 96 months below the bottom end of the advisory guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>lines range and only 24 months above the total 300-month mandatory minimum sentences (240 months followed by 60 months). Second, the district court carefully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, noting the need for the punishment to reflect the seriousness of the offense and the need for deterrence and protection of the public, among others. Third, the district court considered Campbell\u2019s proportionality argument. In determining that Campbell\u2019s sentence needed to be proportionate with co-defendant Hicks\u2019s sentence, yet still reflect Campbell\u2019s distinct career offender status and extensive criminal history, the district determined that a sentence of 324-month sentence was appropriate. On the record before us, Campbell has not shown that his 324-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. Campbell\u2019s instant federal drug conspiracy conviction and his two prior Florida felony convictions for delivery of cocaine qualified Campbell for career offender status within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). <em>See Hicks, </em>174 Fed.Appx. at 506.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)\u2014(2), (6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AG-\">. In this appeal, Campbell does not challenge the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations. Indeed, in the first appeal, this Court already held that the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations were correct. <em>See Hicks, </em>174 Fed.Appx. at 507.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
