The jury also convicted Wallace of robbery, criminal conspiracy, and second degree murder in the death of Carl Luisi. Wallace has filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, challenging his convictions. The District Court, adopting the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, ordered that the first degree murder conviction be vacated because the trial court did not admit hearsay evidence of a statement made by Wallace\u2019s accomplice, Henry Brown, that he, not Wallace, shot Spalla. The District Court held that the refusal to admit this statement violated Wallace\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as set forth in <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). The other convictions were allowed to stand, leaving Wallace to serve a sentence of life imprisonment without the opportunity for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Wallace appealed the judgment of the District Court, raising the following five claims: First, the exclusion of evidence of Brown\u2019s confession warranted the vacating of all Wallace\u2019s convictions, not just the conviction for first degree murder. Second, the manner by which Brown\u2019s testimony was secured violated Wallace\u2019s rights to due process and a fair trial. Third, Wallace\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek an independent ballistics test. Fourth, Wallace\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when the prosecution enlisted the aid of a jailhouse informant, who later testified against Wallace. Fifth, the penalty-phase jury instructions regarding mitigation erroneously suggested a need for unanimity in violation of <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988), and that error was not harmless. The Commonwealth cross-appealed, claiming that the District Court erred in vacating the first degree murder conviction on the grounds that Wallace\u2019s federal constitutional rights were violated and also erred in not concluding that any possible errors were harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">We do not recount the facts and history of this case, which are well-known to the parties. The Report and Recommendation and the opinion of the District Court are thorough and well-reasoned, and we readily affirm the judgment of the District Court in full. We do note that in analyzing whether the <em>Chambers </em>and Confrontation Clause violations amounted to harmless error, the District Court employed the \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d standard set forth in <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). Although the Supreme Court had yet to decide <em>Fry v. Pliler, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007), the District Court was right to use the <em>Brecht </em>standard, regardless of whether the Pennsylvania courts had recognized the precise error at issue and reviewed it for harmlessness under the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard set forth in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). <em>See Fry, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2327-28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Because the writ is granted as to Wallace\u2019s conviction for first degree murder, we will dismiss as moot his penalty-phase claim under <em>Mills, </em>which goes only to the sentence on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">For the reasons stated above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\">. We also note that the Commonwealth had conceded at oral argument that, with regard to the <em>Chambers </em>and Confrontation Clause violations, we would not be bound by the harmless error determination made by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
