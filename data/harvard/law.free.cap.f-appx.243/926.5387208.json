For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AF2\">Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Defendant Grady Yokeley entered an Internet chatroom on June 2, 2005 called \u201cmoms want older men for dau.\u201d Defendant used the screen name \u201cfang422001\u201d and initiated an online conversation with a user named \u201cVicki.\u201d According to \u201cVicki,\u201d she was a thirty-year-old mother of two young daughters. In actuality, \u201cVicki\u201d was an undercover FBI Agent posing as a mother as part of an investigation of crimes against children. \u201cVicki\u201d informed Defendant that she had two daughters, \u201cKristie,\u201d who was nine years old, and \u201cJulie,\u201d who was twelve years old. Defendant expressed an interest in traveling from his home in Virginia to \u201cVicki\u2019s\u201d home in Ohio for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts with both daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">\u201cVicki\u201d offered to put \u201cJulie\u201d online so that Defendant could speak directly to her. During this initial conversation, Defendant told \u201cJulie\u201d that he wanted to engage in oral sex with her and than he wanted her to help him get her younger sister to participate with them as well. On June 9, 2005, Defendant had another online conversation with \u201cVicki.\u201d He stated in that conversation that he believed her daughter \u201cJulie\u201d would be \u201chot enough to rape both of us,\u201d seemingly implying that he expected \u201cVicki\u201d to participate in his sexual activity with her daughters. \u201cVicki\u201d stated that she did not wish to engage with them and told Defendant she thought he wanted to be Julie\u2019s first sexual partner. He informed her that he did and that he planned to come to Ohio soon.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">On June 13, 2005, a local detective pretending to be \u201cVicki\u201d made a phone call to Defendant to arrange his visit. The call was consensually recorded. Defendant then spoke to \u201cJulie\u201d in a phone call later that day. The same detective pretended to be \u201cJulie\u201d as Defendant described what he wanted to do with her, telling her graphically how he wanted to have oral sex and intercourse with her. On June 15, 2005, Defendant had another online conversation with \u201cVicki\u201d in which he asked her to get a morning-after pill for \u201cJulie\u201d because he did not want to use a condom during his encounter with \u201cJulie.\u201d On Friday, June 17, 2005, Defendant drove from Virginia to Brooklyn, Ohio where he was arrested by FBI agents. Defendant was indicted on three charges: 1) Using the Internet to attempt to persuade, induce, entice and coerce a person who had not yet reached the age of eighteen (a twelve-year-old girl) to engage in illegal sexual activity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b); 2) Crossing a state line with the intent to engage in a sexual act with a person who had not yet attained the age of twelve (a nine-year-old girl), in violation of \u00a7 2241(c); and 3) traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, as defined by \u00a7 2423(f), with another person (a twelve-year-old girl), in violation of \u00a7 2423(b).</p>\n<p id=\"A-b\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Defendant pled guilty to all three charges. At the sentencing hearing, the district court was aided by Defendant\u2019s Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), Defendant\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum, his oral statements, and the arguments of counsel. The judge determined that Defendant\u2019s criminal history placed him in category I and his offense level was thirty-three; the combination resulted in a Guidelines range of 135 to 168 months. According to the PSR, the primary Guideline source for Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2241(c) violation was \u00a7 2A3.1. The primary Guideline source determines the starting point for a defendant\u2019s offense level. Defendant argued that the application of this Guideline was unjust. Although he admitted that \u00a7 2241(c) violations are properly paired with \u00a7 2A3.1, Defendant argued that the second and third charges punished him separately for the same conduct under two different provisions. Defendant argued that the decision to charge him both with a violation of \u00a7 2241(c) (in Charge 2) and \u00a7 2423(b) (in Charge 3), which he contended were punishing the same conduct, was made solely because a violation of \u00a7 2241(c) is paired with \u00a7 2A3.1, which carries \"with it a base offense level of 30, whereas a violation of \u00a7 2423(b) is paired with \u00a7 2G1.3, which carries a base offense of 18. According to Defendant, charging him with a violation of both statutes to punish the same offense effectively guaranteed that he would receive the higher base offense level. Defendant argued that \u00a7 2A3.1 should be reserved for situations in which the victim was an actual minor, instead of a Special Agent posing as a minor. The government responded that had there been actual sexual contact with a minor, there would have been an additional four level enhancement, and thus, there was nothing inconsistent about applying this enhancement despite the fact that there had been no real minor involved and no actual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The court determined that application of \u00a7 2A3.1 was appropriate, particularly because despite Defendant\u2019s argument, Charges 2 and 3 were based on different offenses because one referred to his behavior with respect to a twelve-year-old victim and the other referred to his behavior with respect to a nine-year-old victim. Accordingly, based on the PSR and the court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors and Defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence, the court sentenced Defendant to 108 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">I. Guideline Application to Defendant\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Chriswell, </em>401 F.3d 459, 463 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">Section 2A3.1 is the primary Sentencing Guideline for a \u00a7 2241(c) violation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Thus, a violation of this statute properly applies that guideline to determine a defendant\u2019s base offense level. Defendant, however, argues that the government\u2019s decision to charge him with violating both \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c) and 2423(b) was made merely to insure he would receive a harsher sentence. According to Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>dant, \u00a7 2423(b) could have governed both Charges 2 and 3, a decision that would have resulted in a base offense level of eighteen instead of thirty. Defendant concedes that the government has prosecutorial discretion to choose the statute under which it will prosecute an offense; however, Defendant argues that the decision to charge him under the statute that is partnered with \u00a7 2A3.1 is illogical in this case because no abuse ever actually occurred and no real minor was involved. Thus, Defendant\u2019s sole argument before this Court is that \u00a7 2A3.1 should be unavailable in cases where the victim is not an actual minor and instead is an undercover agent, and thus, the district court should have applied \u00a7 2G1.3, which is the Sentencing Guideline for violations of \u00a7 2423(b). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The question of whether the \u00a7 2A3.1 guideline is applicable where no minor is involved has been addressed previously by this Court in <em>United States v. DeCarlo, </em>434 F.3d 447, 457 (6th Cir.2006). In a factually similar case, this Court held that the \u00a7 2A3.1 enhancement was applicable to the defendant, DeCarlo. <em>Id. </em>DeCarlo, making arguments identical to those of Defendant in the instant case, asserted that \u00a7 2A3,1 did not apply to him because the ten-year-old child DeCarlo believed he had arranged to meet for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity was actually an undercover agent and no abuse ever actually occurred. <em>Id. </em>458-59. In concluding that \u00a7 2A3.1 was, nevertheless, appropriate, we were particularly persuaded by the commentary that was added to \u00a7 2A3.1 subsequent to its enactment. We noted first that the Sentencing Commission explicitly stated that \u201c[s]exual offenses addressed in this section are crimes of violence. Because of their dangerousness, attempts are treated the same as completed acts of criminal sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458 (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2A3.1, cmt. background (2004)). Thus, we remain convinced that this explanation forecloses Defendant\u2019s argument that merely because he was unable to complete the sexual abuse, \u00a7 2A3.1 cannot be applied to his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Additionally, in <em>DeCarlo </em>we noted that a comment was added to make clear that the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201c\u2018[v]ictim\u2019 includes an undercover law enforcement officer.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2A3.1, cmt. 1 (2004). Citing <em>DeCarlo, </em>this Court reached the same conclusion when confronted with the identical argument in <em>United States v. Hochschild, </em>442 F.3d 974, 978 (6th Cir.2006), and we reach the same conclusion today. Section 2A3.1 was entirely appropriate in the instant case, despite the fact that the victims were not actual minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Defendant spends a significant portion of his brief focused on the legislative history of the Protection of Children from Sexual Predator Act of 1998, which amended the United States Code and added the sections relevant to the instant case. Protection of Children from Sexual Predator Act of 1998, Pub.L. No. 105-314, 112 Stat. 2974 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C.). Despite this extensive academic review of the legislative history, his argument boils down to one that is virtually indistinguishable from the argument we rejected in <em>DeCarlo </em>and <em>Hochschild, </em>which is simply that \u00a7 2A3.1 is unavailable when the victim is not a real minor. Defendant cites no case law, focusing instead on the legislative background of the section as illustrated by statements given and letters written by Judiciary Committee members about the goal of protecting children from cyber-predators that motivated the enactment of the Act. According to Defendant, this legislative history makes it clear that the protection of minors was the primary concern of lawmakers, and accordingly, it is not appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>ate to apply \u00a7 2A3.1 when no real minors were affected. However, this assertion is belied by our holdings in <em>DeCarlo </em>and <em>Hochschild, </em>neither of which is addressed by Defendant until his reply brief, and even then, he distinguishes the instant case from them on the grounds that neither of those cases involved an argument about the legislative history of the Act or a discussion of \u00a7 2G1.3. We do not find these to be meaningful distinctions. The thrust of Defendant\u2019s argument is that because of the legislative history and in spite of controlling cases in this Court that come to the contrary conclusion, \u00a7 2A3.1 is not the appropriate guidelines range when the minor victim was fictitious and was actually an undercover agent. The law of this Circuit and the comments added to \u00a7 2A3.1 instruct us otherwise, and Defendant\u2019s brief contains an incredible dearth of analysis with respect to why the instant ease presents a unique argument to this Court. Additionally, while neither <em>DeCarlo </em>nor <em>Hochschild </em>explicitly discuss \u00a7 2G1.3, this fact amounts to a distinction without a difference. In neither of those cases did we hold that \u00a7 2A3.1 was the most appropriate Guideline only where \u00a7 2G1.3 was unavailable; thus, the fact that Defendant discusses \u00a7 2G1.3 does not make those cases any less controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Further, Defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive because it fails to address the fact that while \u00a7 2423(b) was one possible statute under which he could have been charged, it seems clear that \u00a7 2241(c) was obviously more appropriate. Section 2241(c) makes it unlawful specifically to cross state lines \u201cwith intent to engage in a sexual act with a person who has not attained the age of 12 years,\u201d while \u00a7 2423 refers only to minors in general. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c); 2423(b). Section 2241(c) is clearly the more appropriate choice when the intended victim is a child of nine years of age, which undermines Defendant\u2019s contention that the charging decision was made for no reason other than to insure a harsh sentence. This fact is wholly ignored by Defendant. Thus, we hold that this case is squarely governed by our previous holdings in <em>DeCarlo </em>and <em>Hochschild </em>and, accordingly, we AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
