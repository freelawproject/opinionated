(collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) for claims related to the alleged denial of certain health care benefits to which she claimed her husband was entitled under her health care plan. The Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which dismissed the complaint in its entirety as completely preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-17\">As we write only for the parties, we will forgo a lengthy recitation of the factual and legal background to this case. On December 23, 2004, the Scheiblers filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Highmark Blue Shield asserting claims for health care benefits under ERISA, and for bad faith denial of insurance under Pennsylvania\u2019s bad faith statute, 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8371. The complaint alleged that Mr. Scheibler was improperly denied health benefits as a beneficiary of his wife\u2019s health care benefits plan, and sought to recover from High-mark damages they suffered as a result of the denial\u2014namely, having to pay for Mr. Scheibler\u2019s medical procedure out-of-pocket. On February 1, 2005, the District Court dismissed the Scheiblers\u2019 bad faith claim, holding that it was preempted under \u00a7\u00a7 502(a) and 514(a) of ERISA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-18\">Subsequently, on October 17, 2005, Scheibler filed a five-count complaint against Highmark Blue Shield and Keystone Health Plan West, Inc. in the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. This action asserted claims for specific performance, \u201cdereliction of a duty to deal in good faith,\u201d bad faith pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8371, unjust enrichment, and violation of Pennsylvania\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act. On November 7, 2005, the Defendants in this state court action removed the case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on the grounds of complete ERISA preemption. Scheibler never filed a motion to remand the matter to state court. On November 16, 2005, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of ERISA preemption. After Scheibler failed to respond to this motion, the District Court entered an order granting the motion to dismiss on December 21, 2005. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We exercise jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction is plenary, as is our review of the District Court\u2019s order granting dismissal based on ERISA preemption. <em>Pryzbowski v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>245 F.3d 266, 268 (3d Cir.2001). When considering whether the District Court properly granted a motion to dismiss, \u201cwe accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Pinker v. Roche Holdings, Ltd., </em>292 F.3d 361, 374 n. 7 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The crux of Scheibler\u2019s appeal is that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over this case and improperly determined that her claims were preempted by ERISA. We disagree. \u201cUnder the \u2018well-pleaded complaint\u2019 rule, federal question jurisdiction only exists where an issue of federal law appears on the face of the complaint. However, there is an exception to this rule: when a purportedly state-law claim \u2018comes within the scope of [an exclusively] federal cause of action,\u2019 it \u2018necessarily \u201carises under\u201d federal law,\u2019 and is completely preempted.\u201d <em>DiFelice v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, </em>346 F.3d 442, 445-46 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Const. Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Cal., </em>463 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Under this exception, we have consistently held that a plaintiffs state law claims are preempted by ERISA if \u201cthe claim \u2018could have been the subject of a civil enforcement action under \u00a7 502(a).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446 (quoting <em>Pryzbowski, </em>245 F.3d at 273). That section allows civil actions \u201cby a participant or beneficiary ... to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). Thus, we have explained that \u201cchallenges [to] an administrative decision regarding whether a certain benefit is covered under an ERISA plan\u201d are completely preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>DiFelice, </em>346 F.3d at 446. In addition, a state law claim is preempted under \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA if the state law giving rise to the claim \u201crelates\u201d to the benefit plan in that \u201cit has a connection with or reference to such a plan,\u201d even if the law is not specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans. <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 47, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">In this case, all of Scheibler\u2019s claims are directed at the Defendants\u2019 decision not to cover certain treatment for her husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>and are thus completely preempted by \u00a7\u00a7 502(a) and 514(a) of ERISA. Although Scheibler likely waived any argument to the contrary by failing to file an opposition to the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, it is clear that her claims are preempted. Count I of the complaint asks that the \u201cdefendant[s] be ordered to specifically perform [their] agreement to authorize payment of all medical expenses related to the claim.\u201d This, of course, clearly seeks to recover benefits due under an employee benefit plan and is thus preempted by ERISA. <em>See Pane v. RCA Corp., </em>868 F.2d 681, 635 (3d Cir.1989). Counts II and III both attempt to state claims under Pennsylvania\u2019s bad faith statute, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8371. However, we have explicitly held that actions under section 8371 are preempted by ERISA. <em>See Barber v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>383 F.3d 134, 140-41 (3d Cir.2004). Count IV asserts a claim for unjust enrichment, which clearly turns on whether or not the Defendants should have covered Mr. Scheibler\u2019s surgery. As such, this claim is also preempted by ERISA. <em>See DiFelice, </em>346 F.3d at 446. Finally, Count V of Scheibler\u2019s complaint charges the Defendants with violating Pennsylvania\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act. Because this claim \u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan, it is expressly preempted by \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA. <em>See Pilot Life Ins. Co., </em>481 U.S. at 47, 107 S.Ct. 1549; <em>Murphy v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>152 F.Supp.2d 755, 758 (E.D.Pa.2001). Thus, not only did the District Court here have subject matter jurisdiction, but it properly determined that Scheibler\u2019s claims were preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We similarly find that Scheibler\u2019s arguments regarding lack of notice of removal and other so-called \u201cprocedural defects\u201d are without merit. The Notice of Removal provided by the Defendants contains a Certificate of Service indicating that Scheibler\u2019s counsel was served with the Notice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the record contains evidence that the District Court called Scheibler\u2019s attorney to inquire about the removal. In addition, Scheibler was in no way prejudiced by the Defendants\u2019 failure to file a Disclosure Statement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1. Such statements are intended to provide judges with information to determine if any financial interests require the judge to disqualify him or herself from the case. There is no indication that the District Judge in this case had any financial stake in the Defendant corporations that would require recusal, and indeed the same District Judge was presiding over the ERISA action between these parties when the Notice of Removal was filed. As such, we conclude that there is no merit to any of the arguments advanced by the Appellant in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-13\">. As of the filing of this appeal, the ERISA action was still proceeding in the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\">. Scheibler's argument that the employee benefit plan at issue is not an ERISA \"plan\u201d is without merit. In addition to the fact that such an argument was never raised below, an employee welfare benefit plan is essentially \"any plan, fund, or program ... established or maintained by an employer ... for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, ... medical, surgical or hospital care benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1)(A). The plan in this case clearly meets this definition, and Scheibler has advanced no colorable argument to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-4\">. We also find no merit to Scheibler\u2019s complaints regarding defects in the civil cover sheet the Defendants filed with the Notice of Removal. \"The civil cover sheet, of course, is merely an administrative aid to the court clerk, and is therefore not typically considered part of a litigant's pleading papers.\u201d <em>Favors v. Coughlin, </em>877 F.2d 219, 220 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
