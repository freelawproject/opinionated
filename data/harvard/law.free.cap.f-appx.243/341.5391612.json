To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). In No. 05-71280, we deny in part, dismiss in part, grant in part, and remand. In No. 05-73931, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In No. 05-71280, the record shows that the IJ used the correct \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual\u201d hardship standard and not an \u201cunconscionable\u201d standard, as petitioners claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Petitioners contend they should receive voluntary departure because the IJ denied voluntary departure for the same reason it denied cancellation\u2014lack of good moral character\u2014and the BIA set aside the IJ\u2019s moral character finding. Because the BIA set aside the IJ\u2019s basis for denying voluntary departure, without expressly addressing petitioners\u2019 eligibility for voluntary departure, we grant the petition and remand to consider voluntary departure in the first instance. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">In No. 05-73931, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because they failed to demonstrate the evidence they submitted was previously unavailable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 1003.2(a) and (c); <em>Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that their due process rights were violated because the BIA did not consider the evidence regarding their son\u2019s hardship, is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.
