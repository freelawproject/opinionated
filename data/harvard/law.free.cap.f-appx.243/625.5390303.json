Lamb denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In Re Mei Yue Dong, </em>No. A97 851 823 (B.I.A. Oct. 18, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 851 823 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 5, 2005). Dong sought relief on the ground that she had been persecuted for violating the family planning policies of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>People\u2019s Republic of China by being forced to have an abortion. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The IJ found Dong not to be credible based on purported inconsistencies between her testimony and the abortion certificate which she submitted for review. Contrary to the IJ\u2019s conclusion, however, these alleged inconsistencies in Dong\u2019s testimony, stating the color of the abortion certificate and naming the hospital where the abortion allegedly was performed, were far from a sufficient basis to support an adverse credibility finding. While minor inconsistencies need not be overlooked, nevertheless \u201c[w]here an applicant\u2019s testimony is generally consistent, rational, and believable, [inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony] need not be fatal to credibility, especially if the errors are relatively minor and isolated.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). Further, the IJ acknowledged\u2014but failed to evaluate\u2014 Dong\u2019s testimonial explanation for the apparent inconsistency between the residential address noted on her abortion certificate and the address of her household registration. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Rather than relying on these \u201cinconsistencies,\u201d the IJ based her adverse credibility finding in substantial part on the U.S. Consulate\u2019s \u201cReport of Investigation,\u201d which concluded that Dong\u2019s abortion certificate was a forgery. This was improper because the report fails to meet minimum indicia of reliability analogous to those we identified in <em>Zhen Nan Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255 (2d Cir.2006). In <em>Zhen Nan Lin, </em>we found a \u201cConsular Report to be highly unreliable and therefore insufficient to satisfy the substantial evidence requirement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 269, and based on that particular report we identified a nonexhaustive set of guidelines establishing what type of information should be evident in a reliable report: \u201c(i) the identity and qualifications of the investigators); (ii) the objective and extent of the investigation; and (iii) the methods used to verify the information discovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The specific requirements of <em>Zhen Nan Lin, </em>to be sure, were attuned to the particular set of facts in that case, but they nonetheless reflect the requirements of reliability which the U.S. Consulate report in the instant case failed to provide. The report identified the name of the investigator but omitted her qualifications. The absence of such information is especially troubling in light of this particular investigator\u2019s history of unreliability\u2014noted by our court, and other courts\u2014in reporting abortion certificates to be inauthentic. <em>See Zhen Nan Lin, </em>459 F.3d at 272 n. 10; <em>Qiu Rong Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>83 Fed.Appx. 480, 485 (3d Cir.2003) (unpublished). Further, the report\u2019s description of the investigator\u2019s methodology was limited to the fact that she sent the certificate to the hospital and that she received a response, <em>see Zhen Nan Lin, </em>459 F.3d at 272; and the report contained numerous hearsay statements from hospital personnel regarding the stamp and the doctor\u2019s signature, without corroboration. The Report does not indicate that Ms. Liu attempted to contact the doctor to corroborate the hospital\u2019s claim that the signature was a forgery, nor that Ms. Liu tried to obtain a copy of an abortion certificate from the hospital in order to compare the formatting and the size of the hospital seal with that of Dong\u2019s certif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>icate. We indicated in <em>Lin </em>that when the Consular Report concludes that the petitioner\u2019s document is a forgery solely on the basis of statements by the foreign government\u2019s agents, the Consular Report should explain what efforts the investigator took to verify those statements. 459 F.3d at 272. If no additional steps were taken, the Report should explain \u201cwhy such a verification was impossible or unduly burdensome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Moreover, the IJ critically failed to address the affidavit of petitioner\u2019s expert witness which calls into serious question the reliability of the sources on which the report relies for its forgery finding. Accordingly, the consular report was not a reliable basis to support the finding that the abortion certificate was a forgery. Given the IJ\u2019s erroneous reliance on the fraudulent nature of the abortion certificate, we cannot state with confidence that the same decision would be made on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The BIA concluded, citing <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395 (2d Cir.2006), that even if \u201cthe abortion certification is regarded as valid, it would serve to undermine the claim that the abortion was forced.\u201d We have upheld an IJ\u2019s reliance on a State Department country profile which suggests that the only documents resembling \u201cabortion certificates\u201d frequently are merely sick-leave \u201cexcuse-letters for workers who undergo abortion voluntarily,\u201d see <em>Tu Lin, </em>446 F.3d at 400 (citing U.S. Department of State, China: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions 24 (Apr. 14, 1998)). Yet we also have made clear that such observations of a State Department country report \u201cdo not automatically discredit contrary evidence presented by the applicant\u201d and \u201care not binding on the immigration court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 130 (2d Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In the instant case, the BIA did not reference any country profile indicating that abortion certificates, if valid, are only for sick-leave after a voluntary abortion. Consequently, the decision leaves unclear the extent to which the BIA intended to rely on this basis. We need not, however, determine whether its citation to <em>Tu Lin </em>should suffice to deem dispositive such a country profile that is outside the record, because, in this case, the IJ and BIA relied overwhelmingly, and manifestly, on the falsity of the document for its credibility determination. Since we lack the required confidence that the result would be the same absent a conclusion of document falsity, we cannot conclude that remand would be futile. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 402 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Finally, petitioner appeals the agency\u2019s denial of her CAT relief claim. Dong failed to brief and argue this issue before our court. That claim is, therefore, waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the order of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
