Liebig argues that the decision of the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) is unsupported by substantial evidence. We disagree and will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-17\">Because we write only for the parties, we will not state the facts separately. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and 1383(c). We have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is limited to determining whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Leibig was not disabled. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); <em>Rutherford v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 546, 552 (3d Cir.2005). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 has been defined as \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Califano, </em>637 F.2d 968, 970 (3d Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-20\">The Social Security Act gives the Commissioner authority to pay DIB and SSI benefits to disabled persons. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d), 1382. Disability is defined as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The Commissioner applies a five-step test to determine whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). The first two steps require the claimant to demonstrate that he is not currently engaging in substantial gainful activity, and that he is suffering from a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>A failure of proof at step one or step two renders the claimant ineligible for DIB and SSI. <em>See Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 428 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">If, however, the claimant progresses to step three, then the question becomes \u201c \u201cwhether the impairment is equivalent to one of a number of Listed Impairments that the Commissioner acknowledges are so severe as to preclude substantial gainful activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Knepp v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 78, 84 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Bowen v. Yuckert, </em>482 U.S. 137, 141, 107 S.Ct. 2287, 96 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987)). A claimant who satisfies step three \u201cis conclusively presumed to be disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A claimant who fails at step three must press on to steps four and five.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Under step four, the question is \u201cwhether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform [the claimant\u2019s] past relevant work.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 428. It is the claimant\u2019s burden to establish an inability to return to his past relevant work. <em>See id. </em>A failure of proof at step four dooms the claimant\u2019s case. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 416.920(a)(4)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">If, however, the claimant satisfies his burden at step four, then the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner. At step five, the Commissioner \u201cmust show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with [the claimant\u2019s] medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">In this case, Leibig challenges the ALJ\u2019s determinations at steps three and five. At step three, the ALJ concluded that Leibig did not satisfy Listing 104.A, which relates to spinal disorders. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 1.04A (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At step five, the ALJ found that Leibig retained the ability to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">Leibig\u2019s primary contention is that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision to accord limited weight to the opinion of Dr. Abraham, Leibig\u2019s treating physician. An \u201cALJ must ... pay close attention to the medical findings of a treating physician,\u201d <em>Brewster v. Heckler, </em>786 F.2d 581, 584 (3d Cir.1986), and \u201cmay reject a treating physician\u2019s opinion outright only on the basis of contradictory medical evidence.\u201d <em>Morales v. Apfel, </em>225 F.3d 310, 317-18 (3d Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). Here, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to accord limited weight to Dr. Abraham\u2019s conclusions. We agree with the District Court that the ALJ accepted almost all of Dr. Abraham\u2019s conclusions, except for his opinion that Leibig could only work six hours per day. As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that finding, Dr. Abraham was all alone among the physicians involved in this case. Dr. Punjabi\u2019s view of Leibig\u2019s functional capacity was far less restrictive than that of Dr. Abraham. Dr. Finch, the state agency physician, also offered a less restrictive functional-capacity assessment. And Dr. Sachs, a treating specialist, identified no significant functional restrictions and found no evidence of motor, sensory, or reflex abnormality. These contradictory medical assessments provide evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d that Lei-big retained the ability to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy. <em>See Reefer v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 376, 379 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Leibig also contests the ALJ\u2019s determination that \u201cthe medical record does not support that [Leibig\u2019s] impairment/s are/is as severe as he contends.\u201d Appendix 4i. In our view, however, the assessments of Drs. Punjabi and Sachs provide substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Leibig\u2019s subjective allegations were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Finally, Leibig argues that the ALJ committed error at step three of the analysis by concluding that Leibig had not met or equaled every element of Listing 1.04A. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 1.04A (2005). That listing requires an inability to ambulate effectively or an inability to perform fine and gross movements effectively. <em>Id. </em>\u201cFor a claimant to show that his impairment matches a listing, it must meet <em>all </em>of the specified medical criteria.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 U.S. 521, 530-31, 110 S.Ct. 885, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990). Here, however, Dr. Sachs found no evidence of motor, sensory, or reflex abnormality. Dr. Punjabi found that Leibig possessed normal motor power, grip strength, station, and gait. And, as the District Court noted, there was no evidence of atrophy. These findings provide substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Leibig did not meet or equal Listing 1.04A.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">.
