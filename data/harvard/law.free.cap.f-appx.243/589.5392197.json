Silva-Nava argues for the first time on appeal that section 911 violates the First Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\">Where no timely objection was made in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Plain error consists of (1) error (2) that is plain (3) and affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201c[A]n error cannot meet the \u2018plain\u2019 requirement of the plain error rule if it is not \u2018clear under current law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1319 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-23\">Silva-Nava contends that the district court plainly erred when it approved his conviction for false impersonation of a United States citizen because section 911 is overbroad and unconstitutional on its face. The challenged language of section 911 provides, \u201cWhoever falsely and willfully represents himself to be a citizen of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911. Silva-Nova\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has held that section 911 is over-broad. Our sister circuits that have addressed overbreadth challenges to the statutory language of section 911 have uniformly rejected the challenges. <em>See United States v. Esparza-Ponce, </em>193 F.3d 1133, 1137 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Achtner, </em>144 F.2d 49, 52 (2d Cir.1944) (rejecting challenge to predecessor statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 746(a)(18)). The district court did not plainly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Silva-Nava\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b611-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
