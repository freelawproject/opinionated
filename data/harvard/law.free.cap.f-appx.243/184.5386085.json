She appeals her 18-month prison sentence for conspiring to use interstate facilities to aid a racketeering enterprise and conspiring to commit money laundering. Bang argues that the district judge was unaware of his discretion to impose a sentence outside of the guidelines\u2019 range and failed to consider the statutory sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because the district court freely chose the sentence after meaningfully considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and because Bang\u2019s sentence is reasonable, we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-18\">Bang owned and operated the Osaka Spa in Rockford, Illinois from October 2004 until February 27, 2005. She told a United States probation officer that when she purchased the spa she thought it was a legitimate massage therapy business, but, after taking title, she discovered that it was actually a front for prostitution. Bang says she tried various tactics to make the business legitimate, including shutting down the spa at times, seeking a buyer, and attempting to recruit actual massage therapists. Nevertheless, she continued to run the Osaka Spa, knowing that her employees were selling sex, because she needed the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-19\">Bang pleaded guilty to two counts: conspiring to use interstate facilities to aid a racketeering enterprise, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1952(a), and conspiring to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). Because the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>counts caused essentially the same harm, the sentencing court grouped them together and calculated her sentence based only on the racketeering-conspiracy conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.2(b), 3D1.3(a). The court then properly calculated her advisory guidelines sentencing range: with a base offense level of 14, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2E1.2, 2G1.1, a 4-level adjustment for being an organizer or leader of criminal activity involving five or more persons, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a), and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, her adjusted offense level was 15; with a criminal history category of I, her guidelines range was 18 to 24 months, <em>see id. </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Bang did not challenge the guidelines calculation. But at sentencing her attorney asked the court to \u201cconsider a variance downward,\u201d arguing that Bang was unaware that Osaka Spa was a prostitution ring when she purchased it, that she attempted to legitimize business there, and that she allowed the prostitution to continue only because of her difficult financial situation. Her attorney noted that Bang had no prior criminal history, felt deep remorse, and was training to become a therapist at a sleep apnea clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Although the district judge described the guidelines\u2019 range as \u201cadvisory,\u201d he began his sentencing decision by echoing Bang\u2019s attorney\u2019s language: \u201cI first have to consider whether I ought to grant a variance from the guideline range of 18 to 24 months, which is presumed to be reasonable.\u201d He then said that he had \u201clooked at the statutory factors under [section] 3553(a).\u201d The judge discussed the fact that Bang did not have a prior criminal record, expressed remorse, and had engaged in the criminal conduct only for a short time. He also discussed Bang\u2019s control over the illegal operation, the exploitation of the women who worked for her, and the need to deter Bang and others from committing the same crime in the future. The district judge concluded that \u201cthe guideline range is reasonable considering all of the factors that are set forth in [section] 3553(a),\u201d and selected a sentence at the low end of the guidelines\u2019 range. The court imposed concurrent sentences of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for each count, as well as three years\u2019 supervised release, a $100 fine, and a $200 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">On appeal, Bang argues that the district judge gave undue weight to the guidelines\u2019 range and did not adequately consider other sentencing factors, as \u00a7 3553(a) requires. Specifically, Bang argues that the court failed to consider \u201cmitigating factors,\u201d including her ignorance of Osaka Spa\u2019s true services when she bought it, her attempts to legitimize the business, the fact that she never forced her employees to engage in sex acts, and the fact that she did not turn a profit in the months she owned Osaka Spa. She also argues that the court ignored the disparity between her sentence and her co-conspirators\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Since this appeal was argued, the Supreme Court held in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), that, although appellate courts may accord a presumption of reasonableness to guidelines sentences, \u201cthe sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2465; <em>United States v. Schmitt, </em>495 F.3d 860, 864 (7th Cir.2007); <em>see United States v. Demaree, </em>459 F.3d 791, 794-95 (7th Cir.2006) (explaining that district court may not presume that guidelines sentence is correct). Rather, the sentencing court must subject the sentence to the \u201cthorough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2465. As we have recently explained, that procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>demands that the court \u201csentence based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) without any thumb on the scale favoring a guideline sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Sachsenmaier, </em>491 F.3d 680, 685 (7th Cir.2007). \u201cIf, however, a district court freely decides that the guidelines suggest a reasonable sentence, then on appellate review the defendant must explain why the district court was wrong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">A fair reading of the district court\u2019s decision shows that, while the judge acknowledged our presumption of reasonableness, he sentenced Bang based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cwithout any thumb on the scale favoring a guideline sentence,\u201d <em>Sachsenmaier, </em>491 F.3d at 685. Although the judge used loose language\u2014he echoed Bang\u2019s attorney\u2019s discussion about whether to \u201cgrant a downward variance,\u201d and he said that the guidelines are \u201cpresumed to be reasonable\u201d\u2014we are unconvinced that it made a substantive difference in this case. <em>See United States v. Dale, </em>498 F.3d 604, 611 n. 6 (7th Cir.2007) (ignoring district court\u2019s reference to \u201cdepartures\u201d where court applied correct sentencing procedure); <em>cf. United States v. Griffin, </em>493 F.3d 856, 868 (7th Cir.2007) (vacating sentence and remanding where district court <em>actually applied </em>rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to guidelines range). The district judge acknowledged that the guidelines are advisory and explained that he chose a sentence within the guidelines\u2019 range because he thought it would best comport with the statutory sentencing factors\u2014not because he thought a guidelines sentence was presumptively \u201ccorrect,\u201d <em>Demaree, </em>459 F.3d at 794-95. <em>Cf. Schmitt, </em>495 F.3d at 864-65 (vacating sentence where judge\u2019s remarks indicated that he thought his discretion was constrained). Indeed, rather than indicating a \u201cpresumption\u201d to sentence within the guidelines, the transcript shows that the district judge based the sentence on Bang\u2019s history and personal characteristics, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the nature and circumstances of the offense, <em>see id., </em>the need to provide just punishment for a serious offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). The court acknowledged that Bang operated the spa for a \u201crelatively short duration,\u201d that she had no prior criminal record, and that she expressed remorse. But the district judge explained that Bang \u201chad to know as the owner that this was going on, and she could have shut it down right then and there, but she did not,\u201d despite knowing that the women who worked there were being exploited. Additionally, the district judge explained that, although he believed that Bang would not commit the crime again, a sentence of imprisonment would deter others. Based on these considerations, the court reasonably concluded that a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate. And, as we have said repeatedly, we will not reweigh the statutory sentencing factors here. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Baker, </em>445 F.3d 987, 991-92 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 686-87 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Bang\u2019s other argument\u2014that the district court failed to consider the disparity between her and her co-conspirators\u2019 sentences, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6)\u2014has been squarely rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Babul, </em>476 F.3d 498, 501-02 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Boscarino, </em>437 F.3d 634, 638 (7th Cir.2006). Section 3553(a)(6) is intended to reduce unjustified disparity in sentences across districts rather than among defendants in a particular case, and a within-guidelines sentence \u201ccannot be treated as unreasonable\u201d with respect to this sentencing factor. <em>Boscarino, </em>437 F.3d at 638. In any event, the district court explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Bang deserved her sentence because, as the owner, she had ultimate control over Osaka Spa and the power to cease the illegal activity. Thus, any disparity between the sentence imposed for her and for her co-conspirators would be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
