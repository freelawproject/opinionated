In response, the government argues that Saint Cyr did not raise these issues pertaining to credibility, relocation, or changed country conditions in his appeal to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">We agree with the government that we lack jurisdiction to review Saint Cyr\u2019s claims, as he did not raise the claims made here before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lacked jurisdiction to consider a claim where it was not raised before the BIA, despite the BIA having addressed the claim <em>sua </em>sponte).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
