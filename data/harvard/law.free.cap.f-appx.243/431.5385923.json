He was sentenced to 262 months in prison, which was at the high end of the guideline range as determined by the court. His plea agreement states that he \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with this prosecution, conviction, and sentence.\u201d Mot., Ex. 1 at K 10. The agreement further explains \u201c[i]n other words, the defendant waives his right to appeal the conviction in this case and waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this case except to the extent, if any, the Court departs upward from the applicable Guideline range determined by the Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Chavez-Vargas appealed from his conviction and sentence and the government has moved to enforce his appeal waiver under <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We grant the motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Under <em>Hahn, </em>we will enforce an appeal waiver if (1) \u201cthe disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights\u201d; (2) \u201cthe defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights\u201d; and (3) \u201cenforcing the waiver would [not] result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Mr. Chavez-Vargas contends his appeal does not fall within the scope of his appellate waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Mr. Chavez-Vargas does not explain the nature of his appeal, but he argues that his appeal does not fall within the scope of his appellate waiver because the waiver is ambiguous. Although he acknowledges that the language from his plea agreement quoted above is \u201cadmittedly quite plain,\u201d he asserts that the following language \u201ccasts ambiguity into the analysis.\u201d Resp. at 3. That language states: \u201c \u2018The defendant is aware that Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 affords a defendant the right to appeal the conviction and sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Mot., Ex. 1 at K10). Mr. Chavez-Vargas argues that \u201c[although [he] has plainly and knowingly waived his right to appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, this Court could reasonably find that the plea agreement\u2019s silence on the question of whether [his] appeal waiver includes a waiver of appeal rights under [28] U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 1291 creates an ambiguity which must be construed against the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This argument is frivolous. Section 1291 does not confer any substanfive appellate rights upon Mr. Chavez-Vargas so there was nothing for him to waive; this provision simply states that \u201ccourts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the [federal] district courts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The absence of language in the plea agreement regarding \u00a7 1291 does not make Mr. Chavez-Vargas\u2019 appellate waiver ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Next, Mr. Chavez-Vargas argues that a portion of the plea colloquy \u201ccould be construed to contain ambiguity.\u201d Resp. at 4. He contends that the following language is ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">Q. Bottom line of what you have done in Paragraph 10 [of the plea agreement] is, for all intents and purposes, or certainly <em>more likely than not, whatever sentence this court gives you is going to be the sentence you\u2019re going to serve. </em>Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 4 (quoting Mot., Ex. 2 at 17). Mr. Chavez-Vargas asserts that the district court\u2019s reference to \u201c\u2018more likely than not,\u201d\u2019 could be read to mean that his appeal options are \u201climited but not completely foreclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He argues that this ambiguity should be construed against the government and that this court should find that his appeal does not fall within the scope of his appellate waiver. This argument is also frivolous. The plea agreement does contain two exceptions that would allow Mr. Chavez-Vargas to appeal his sentence: (1) if \u201cthe Court departs upwards from the applicable Guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>range determined by the Court\u201d or (2) \u201cif the United States exercises its right to appeal the sentence imposed as authorized by Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 8742(b).\u201d Mot., Ex. 1 at K10. Because of these exceptions, the district court\u2019s language that \u201cmore likely than not, whatever sentence this court gives you is going to be the sentence you\u2019re going to have serve,\u201d Mot., Ex. 2 at 17, is not ambiguous or inconsistent with the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Because there was no ambiguity in the plea agreement or plea colloquy and because this appeal does not fall within either of the two exceptions identified in the plea agreement, we conclude that Mr. Chavez-Vargas\u2019 appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of his appellate rights. Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-14\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">. Tenth Circuit Rule 27.2(A)(3) provides that \"[i]f possible,\u201d a motion to enforce a plea waiver \"must be filed within 15 days after the notice of appeal is filed.\u201d Rule 27.2(A)(1)(d) requires that the government attach copies of the plea agreement and transcripts of the plea hearing and sentencing hearing. The government notes that it did not file its motion within fifteen days of the filing of the notice of appeal as required by 10th Cir. R. 27.2(A)(3) because it was waiting for the necessary transcripts to become available. The rule provides that a motion may be filed out of time upon a showing of good cause. <em>Id. </em>Because the government filed its motion within fifteen days after receiving the transcripts, we conclude that there was good cause for the government\u2019s late filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
