In accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000), Washington was sentenced by the district court to life imprisonment without release. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-22\">On appeal, Washington first contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for a jury instruction on mere presence. The decision whether to give a jury instruction, and the content of that instruction, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Burgos, 55 </em>F.3d 933, 935 (4th Cir.1995). \u201cThis court reviews jury instructions in their entirety and as part of the whole trial\u201d to determine \u201c \u2018whether the court adequately instructed the jury on the elements of the offense and the accused\u2019s defenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number><em>ed States v. Fowler, </em>932 F.2d 306, 317 (4th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Thus, a district court\u2019s refusal to provide a requested instruction will only constitute reversible error \u201cif the instruction: \u2018(1) was correct; (2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important, that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Camejo, </em>929 F.2d 610, 614 (11th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Based on the evidence presented at trial, we conclude an instruction on mere presence was not warranted. The district court\u2019s jury instructions, viewed in their entirety, adequately addressed the elements of the offense and relevant definitions. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Next, Washington contends his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because his prior convictions were found by the district court rather than submitted to a jury. However, as Washington concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 224 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006), which determined that \u201c[b]ecause [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000)] permits judicial factfinding on a defendant\u2019s prior convictions, it falls within the prior conviction exception\u201d to the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. Moreover, we have consistently held that a district court may enhance a sentence based on the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d regardless of whether or not it was admitted to by the defendant or found by a jury. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1005, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Washington finally contends that his sentence of life imprisonment without release under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) violates the Eighth Amendment because it is disproportionate to the offense committed and deprives him of his right to an individualized sentence. As conceded by Washington, we have previously considered and rejected a similar challenge in <em>United States v. Kratsas, </em>45 F.3d 63 (4th Cir.1995). In <em>Kratsas, </em>we applied the three-part test of <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 8001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which examines: \u201c(1) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty, (2) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction, and (3) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Kratsas, </em>45 F.3d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Under the first prong of the <em>Solem </em>test, it is clear that the gravity of Washington\u2019s offense is great. He was not only found to have possessed with the intent to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base in the instant offense, but has also been previously convicted of four felony drug offenses. As to the second and third prongs of the <em>Solem </em>test, this court has previously held that a life sentence without release for a major drug violation is not disproportionate in comparison with other sentences under the Guidelines or sentences imposed by states within the Fourth Circuit. <em>See id. </em>at 68; <em>see also United States v. D'Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 613 (4th Cir.1994). Thus, we conclude Wash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ington\u2019s sentence is not constitutionally disproportionate. Moreover, we conclude Washington\u2019s contention that the mandatory nature of his sentence renders it unconstitutional is unavailing under this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Kratsas, 45 </em>F.3d at 69; <em>see also D\u2019Anjou, </em>16 F.3d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\"> Though the applicability of the <em>Solem </em>test was called into some doubt by the three separate and somewhat conflicting opinions issued by the Supreme Court in <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (plurality opinion), this court has continued to apply the <em>Solem </em>test in conducting proportionality review. <em>See Kratsas, </em>45 F.3d at 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
