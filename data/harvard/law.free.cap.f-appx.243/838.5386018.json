For the reasons that follow, we REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">A 1996 airplane crash in West Virginia spawned a series of lawsuits that give rise to this appeal. David Board operated a flight-instruction school in West Virginia. One of Board\u2019s students was injured in an airplane crash during a training flight on July 16, 1996. The injured student pilot sued Board in West Virginia state court for his personal injuries. Board was insured under a commercial general liability policy through Ranger Insurance Company (\u201cRanger\u201d). Board filed a claim with Ranger, seeking both indemnification and defense in the action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Prior to Board\u2019s filing of a claim, Ranger and petitioner-appellant HCC Aviation Insurance Group, Inc. (\u201cHCC Aviation\u201d) had entered into a Management Agreement, dated July 1, 1992, whereby HCC Aviation would underwrite and service the West Virginia aviation policies issued in Ranger\u2019s name.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> HCC Aviation\u2019s subsidiary, petitioner-appellant Universal Loss Management, Inc. (\u201cUniversal\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was HCC Aviation\u2019s elaims-handling facility and processed the claims on the Ranger policies that HCC Aviation underwrote. Universal processed the claim that Board had submitted under his policy with Ranger and denied it pursuant to an exclusion in Board\u2019s policy. But a West Virginia state court later determined that Board\u2019s claim was covered under his policy and that Ranger therefore should have indemnified and defended him. Board and the student pilot then filed a separate action against Ranger for insurance bad faith for failing to defend and indemnify Board. This bad-faith action was settled for $4.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">Ranger\u2019s reinsurer, respondent-appellee Employers Reinsurance Corporation (\u201cEmployers Reinsurance\u201d), funded the settlement payout. Ranger\u2019s reinsurance coverage with Employers Reinsurance was detailed in a General Aviation, Agricultural Aviation and Airport Liability Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (\u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) dated October 1, 1994. Article 13 of the Reinsurance Agreement, titled \u201cExtra-Contractual Obligations,\u201d provided coverage for wrongful denial of claims under Ranger\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>pursuant to Article 13 of the Reinsurance Agreement that Employers Reinsurance funded the settlement of the bad-faith action against Ranger for Universal\u2019s wrongful denial of Board\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In an effort to recover its payout of the $4.3 million settlement, Employers Reinsurance brought an action in West Virginia state court in 2001 against HCC Aviation and Universal alleging that it was their negligence that caused Ranger\u2019s wrongful denial of Board\u2019s claim. Ranger was also a plaintiff in this action. Employers Reinsurance and Ranger asserted two pertinent claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, they alleged that HCC Aviation and Universal\u2019s conduct in denying Board\u2019s claim constituted a breach of the Management Agreement between Ranger and HCC Aviation. Although Employers Reinsurance was not a party to the Management Agreement, it asserted the claim for breach of this agreement as Ranger\u2019s subrogee. Second, they alleged that under the Reinsurance Agreement, HCC Aviation and Universal owed Employers Reinsurance \u201can implied duty of the utmost good faith\u201d and that their conduct in denying Board\u2019s claim violated this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">HCC Aviation and Universal moved to dismiss Employers Reinsurance\u2019s suit in the West Virginia state court for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. With respect to Ranger\u2019s claims, HCC Aviation and Universal argued that the complaint specified that the claims belonged to Employers Reinsurance, not Ranger, and that there was no basis for Ranger to recover. With respect to Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claims, HCC Aviation and Universal contended, inter alia, that they were insured parties under the Reinsurance Agreement, even though Universal was not a signatory to the agreement. They argued that Employers Reinsurance agreed to provide coverage in Article 13 of the Reinsurance Agreement for HCC Aviation\u2019s claims-handling facility. Consequently, they asserted, Employers Reinsurance could not recover from them because an insurer has no legal right to reimbursement from its own insured or from any person whose risk-producing conduct was borne by the insurer in the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">In an order dated July 29, 2002, the West Virginia trial court dismissed certain claims and permitted others to proceed. The court dismissed all of Ranger\u2019s claims against both HCC Aviation and Universal. As to Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claim for breach of the Management Agreement, the court dismissed the claim against Universal because Universal was not a party to the Management Agreement, but the court permitted the claim against HCC Aviation to proceed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">The claim of [Employers Reinsurance] for Breach of Management Agreement may be maintained against HCC [Aviation], but not against [Universal], as [Universal] was the agent of HCC [Aviation], but not a party to the agreement. HCC [Aviation] will be responsible for acts that [Universal] committed while acting within the scope of its authority for HCC [Aviation].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">As to Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claim for breach of the duty of good faith under the Reinsurance Agreement, the court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the motion to dismiss vis-\u00e1-vis both HCC Aviation and Universal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-5\">This Court is frank to say that it is not conversant with the concept of \u201cutmost good faith.\u201d The Plaintiff, [Employers Reinsurance], does make a good case for the application of \u201cutmost good faith\u201d as it applies to a reinsured and agents of a reinsured, and the concomitant duty to the reinsurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">The Court cannot accept the proposition that [Universal] is a party under the [Reinsurance] Agreement just because it is an agent of HCC [Aviation],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">The Court finds that [Employers Reinsurance] is entitled to present a case for equitable subrogation as to [Universal] ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-8\">The Court also finds that [Employers Reinsurance\u2019s] claim against [Universal] for \u201cNegligent Claims Handling\u201d should not be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">On December 2, 2002, the West Virginia trial court issued an order staying the proceedings for binding arbitration pursuant to arbitration clauses in both the Reinsurance Agreement and the Management Agreement. The court ordered \u201c[a]ll the legal and equitable claims remaining between the parties as ordered, adjudged, and decreed by [the] Court\u2019s Order dated July 29, 2002, [to] be stayed and submitted to one arbitration panel for binding arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">The parties exchanged correspondence prior to arbitration concerning the scope and terms of the arbitration. Employer Reinsurance\u2019s May 28, 2003, letter to HCC Aviation and Universal\u2019s counsel described the scope of the arbitration as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9E\">All legal and equitable claims remaining between the parties set forth in the West Virginia Court\u2019s Order dated July 29, 2002 will be subject to binding arbitration. These issues include whether HCC [Aviation]/[Universal] was negligent in their claims handling of the [Board claim], whether the Management Agreement was breached, and whether HCC [Aviation]/[Universal] breached its duty of utmost good faith to [Employers Reinsurance], the reinsurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">All three entities\u2014Employers Reinsurance, HCC Aviation, and Universal\u2014participated in the arbitration proceedings in Dallas, Texas. HCC Aviation and Universal argued to the arbitration panel that, inter alia, Employers Reinsurance could not seek reimbursement from them because their conduct was insured under Article 13 of the Reinsurance Agreement. Employers Reinsurance maintained that the West Virginia court had already ruled that coverage was unavailable under Article 13 and that the panel was bound by this determination as the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">The arbitration panel denied Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claims in a Final Award dated April 8, 2005. The panel concluded that \u201c[i]t was the original intent of the [p]arties to include the claims handling facilities of [HCC Aviation],\u201d i.e., Universal, \u201cunder the extra-contractual obligations (ECO) coverage provided under <em>ARTICLE 13 </em>of the ... REINSURANCE AGREEMENT.\u201d Consequently, Employers Reinsurance was obligated to fund the settlement of the bad-faith action and could not recover against HCC Aviation and Universal.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">HCC Aviation and Universal filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award in the Northern District of Texas, and Employers Reinsurance filed a motion to vacate the award. The district court vacated the arbitration award, concluding that the arbitration panel exceed its authority by reaching the issue of coverage under Article 13 for Universal\u2019s conduct. The district court reasoned that \u201c[b]y necessary implication, the [West Virginia court\u2019s] July 29, 2002 Order holds that coverage under Article 13 is unavailable to [Univer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>sal],\u201d and that \u201c[i]n light of the trial court\u2019s implicit conclusion, the indemnification argument should not have been revisited by the arbitration panel.\u201d The district court also concluded that in their pre-arbitration correspondence, \u201cthe parties agreed\u201d that \u201c[Universal\u2019s] indemnification argument under Article 13 ... would not be revisited in arbitration.\u201d Consequently, the district court vacated the arbitration award and remanded the ease \u201cto the arbitration panel to consider those issues properly before it pursuant to the [West Virginia] Court\u2019s July 29, 2002 [order] and the parties\u2019 correspondence.\u201d HCC Aviation and Universal now appeal the district court\u2019s vacatur of the arbitration award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AVu\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s vacatur of an arbitration award, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Hughes Training Inc. v. Cook, </em>254 F.3d 588, 592 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s order in this case was based entirely on legal conclusions; our review of the district court\u2019s order is therefore de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Our review of the arbitration award itself, however, is \u201cexceedingly deferential,\u201d just as \u201c[a] district court\u2019s review of an arbitration award is extraordinarily narrow.\u201d <em>Kergosien v. Ocean Energy, Inc., </em>390 F.3d 346, 352 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cWe must sustain an arbitration award even if we disagree with the arbitrator[s\u2019] interpretation of the underlying contract as long as the arbitrator[s\u2019] decision \u2018draws its essence\u2019 from the contract.\u201d <em>Executone Info. Sys., Inc. v. Davis, </em>26 F.3d 1314, 1320 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Anderman/Smith Operating Co. v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., </em>918 F.2d 1215, 1218 (5th Cir.1990)). \u201cIn other words, we must affirm the arbitrator[s\u2019] decision if it is rationally inferable from the letter or the purpose of the underlying agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Anderman/Smith, </em>918 F.2d at 1218).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The district court vacated the arbitration award in this case on the ground that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority. The Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) does provide for vacatur \u201cwhere the arbitrators exceeded their powers.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4). But \u201c[i]n deciding whether the arbitration] [panel] exceeded its authority, we resolve all doubts in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>Executone Info. Sys., </em>26 F.3d at 1320 (citing <em>Valentine Sugars, Inc. v. Donau Corp., </em>981 F.2d 210, 213 (5th Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Employers Reinsurance asserts that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority when it decided that the parties to the Reinsurance Agreement intended Article 13\u2019s insurance coverage to extend to Universal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Employers Reinsurance argues that the West Virginia court\u2019s orders and the parties pre-arbitration correspondence reflect that this issue was not submitted to the arbitration panel because the court had already decided it. It maintains that HCC Aviation and Universal argued to the West Virginia court in their motion to dismiss that Employers Reinsurance could not recover from Universal because Article 13 legally precluded its recovery under the principle that an insurer may not subrogate against its own insured. But, Employers Reinsurance posits, the West Virginia court implicitly ruled that Universal was not entitled to coverage under Article 13 when it ruled that Universal was not a party to the Reinsurance Agreement and permitted Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claim to proceed. Employers Reinsurance contends that this implicit conclusion was binding on the arbitration panel and that by re-addressing the issue and determining that Article 13 provided insurance coverage to Universal, the panel exceeded its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">We begin our analysis by examining the West Virginia court\u2019s orders and the parties\u2019 pre-arbitration correspondence. The July 29, 2002, order granted in part and denied in part HCC Aviation and Universal\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The significance of this order is that it defined the universe of claims that were permitted to proceed. The court dismissed several claims, including all of Ranger\u2019s claims as well as Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claim against Universal for breach of the Management Agreement, but the court permitted the other claims to proceed. The claims that remained after this order were Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claim against HCC Aviation for breach of the Management Agreement and its claims against both HCC Aviation and Universal for breach of the duty of good faith arising from the Reinsurance Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">In the December 2, 2002, order, the court submitted those remaining claims to binding arbitration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Likewise, the parties\u2019 pre-arbitration correspondence indicated that the scope of issues to be arbitrated consisted of the claims that remained after the July 29, 2002, order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nothing in the language of the December 2, 2002, order or in the parties\u2019 pre-arbitration correspondence indicates that the scope of arbitration was anything less than the entirety of the remaining claims. Nothing in the documents indicates that the panel could not fully arbitrate the claims that were submitted to it, including the threshold question of whether Universal was entitled to invoke Article 13\u2019s coverage. Employers Reinsurance subtly attempts to insert such language in the December 2, 2002, order by asserting that the court submitted only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>those \u201cissues\u201d remaining between the parties; but the order clearly submitted the remaining \u201cclaims,\u201d not merely the remaining \u201cissues.\u201d Moreover, although Employers Reinsurance\u2019s May 28, 2003, letter to counsel for HCC Aviation and Universal enumerated a list of issues to be arbitrated, which did not include the question of Universal\u2019s entitlement to coverage under Article 13, this list was clearly non-exclusive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And although subsequent correspondence between the parties indicated that HCC Aviation and Universal could not arbitrate counterclaims against Employers Reinsurance under Article 13 because the counterclaims were not raised in the West Virginia court (and therefore were not part of the remaining claims), the subsequent correspondence did not indicate that the question whether Universal was entitled to the benefit of Article 13 could not be arbitrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Furthermore, contrary to Employers Reinsurance\u2019s proposed interpretation, we do not read the July 29, 2002, order as conclusively determining that Universal was not entitled to the benefit of Article 13. Instead, we read the order much more narrowly. The court simply determined that Universal was not a <em>party </em>to the Reinsurance Agreement and that Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claim therefore did not violate any rule barring an insurer from subrogating against a party to its own insurance contract. It was clear that Universal was not a signatory to the Reinsurance Agreement and was not mentioned by name anywhere in the agreement. But Employers Reinsurance had admitted that Universal was an agent of HCC Aviation, which was named in and was a signatory to the agreement. What the court determined in the order was that Universal\u2019s agency relationship with HCC Aviation did not necessarily make Universal a party to the agreement: \u201cThe Court cannot accept the proposition that [Universal] is a party under the [Reinsurance] Agreement just because it is an agent of HCC [Aviation].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARl\">The court did not, however, go on to opine about whether Universal (even as a non-party to the Reinsurance Agreement) could invoke the benefit of Article 13 on some other basis. HCC Aviation and Universal argued to the West Virginia court that Employers Reinsurance could not both use the Reinsurance Agreement as the basis for alleging that Universal owed it a duty of good faith and at the same time deny Universal the benefit of Article 13 of the same agreement. Despite its conclusion that Universal was not a party to the Reinsurance Agreement, the court permitted the claim against Universal for a breach of a duty arising from that agreement to proceed. The court expressed no opinion about whether Universal, as a non-party, could use a provision of that agreement, namely Article 13, as a defense to the claim. Instead, the court simply observed that Universal was not a party to the agreement, it permitted Employers Reinsurance \u201cto present a case for equitable subrogation as to Universal,\u201d and it declined to dismiss Employers Reinsurance\u2019s claim against Universal for negligent claims handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Even if our reading of the court\u2019s order is incorrect and the court did conclude that Universal was not entitled to invoke the benefit of Article 13, the arbitrators still did not exceed their authority. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>court\u2019s order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was interlocutory. The court could have reconsidered its prior resolution of legal issues at any point in the litigation before issuing a final judgment. <em>See </em>W. Va. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (\u201c[A]ny order ... which adjudicates fewer than all the claims ... is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d). There is no basis for concluding that the arbitration panel could not also have done so once the court referred the claims in their entirety to it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is especially true given that the arbitration panel was able to consider the scope of Article IB\u2019s coverage on a more complete record than that which was available to the West Virginia court at the motion-to-dismiss stage. The arbitration panel heard evidence regarding the parties\u2019 intent in drafting the Reinsurance Agreement, which the West Virginia court could not have considered without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em>W. Va. R. Civ. P. 12(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Lastly, as we noted, the FAA embodies a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of arbitrability.\u201d <em>Kergosien, </em>390 F.3d at 355 (quoting <em>Waverly Mineral Prods. Co. v. United Steel Workers of Am., AFL-CIO, Local No. 8290, </em>633 F.2d 682, 684 (5th Cir.1980)). \u201cThe [FAA] establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or any allegation of waiver, delay or a like defense to arbitrability.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hasp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983); <em>see also Kergosien, </em>390 F.3d at 355. Because, at the very least, there are significant doubts about whether either the West Virginia court\u2019s orders or the parties\u2019 prearbitration correspondence placed the issue of Universal\u2019s coverage under Article 13 outside the arbitrators\u2019 realm, the district court should have resolved these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>doubts in favor of arbitrability and confirmed the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">For the reasons stated, the district court\u2019s order granting Employers Reinsurance\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award and denying HCC Aviation and Universal\u2019s motion to confirm the award is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for entry of an order confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b861-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

But Employers Reinsurance\u2019s characterization of <em>Morrell I's </em>holding is specious at best. True, the <em>Morrell I </em>court vacated an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority. 708 F.Supp. at 278. But the reason the court did so was not because the arbitrator's decision was contrary to the court's prior ruling but rather because the arbitrator decided an issue that the parties had not submitted to him. <em>See id. </em>at 275-77; <em>see also Morrell II, </em>913 F.2d at 549-50 (\"The district court vacated the award because it held that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by deciding the issue of the legality of sympathy strikes since Morrell had not consented to arbitrate that issue.\u201d). As we have stated, we believe that the question whether Universal was entitled to the benefit of Article 13 was submitted to the arbitration panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\">. Employers Reinsurance\u2019s contention that the West Virginia court actually converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment by considering the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement at the motion-to-dismiss stage is baseless. Under West Virginia law, a trial court\u2019s receipt of evidence outside the pleadings when considering a motion to dismiss requires conversion of the motion into one for summary judgment. <em>See Shaffer v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., </em>199 W.Va. 428, 485 S.E.2d 12, 17 (1997); W. Va. R. Civ. P. 12(b). But contrary to Employers Reinsurance\u2019s argument, the Reinsurance Agreement was not a matter outside the pleadings. Employers Reinsurance had attached a copy of the Reinsurance Agreement to its amended complaint as Exhibit B, and under West Virginia law, \u201c[a] copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.\u201d W. Va. R. Civ. P. 10(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b868-6\">GARZA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AB3\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">This case turns on whether the July 29, 2002 order of the West Virginia state court decided that Universal could not rely on the coverage of the Reinsurance Agreement\u2014namely Article 13. Although the order states that Universal is not a party to the Reinsurance Agreement, it is not clear what legal conclusion was intended to be drawn from that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">What is clear is that the state court allowed Employer\u2019s Reinsurance to pursue its claim against Universal for \u201cnegligent claims processing.\u201d It is equally clear that Employer\u2019s Reinsurance brought this claim against Universal pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreement, as Count VII of the Amended Complaint filed before the state court. By doing so, the state court did not preclude the possibility that Universal was subject to liabilities under the Reinsurance Agreement. Therefore, the arbitration panel was free to decide that the state court did not preclude the possibility that Universal was subject to the coverage of the Reinsurance Agreement\u2014 including Article 13. <em>See Kergosien v. Ocean Energy, Inc., </em>390 F.3d 346, 355 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201c[I]n deciding whether the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, \u2018any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
