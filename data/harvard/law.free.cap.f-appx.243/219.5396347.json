We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial on the merits of a habeas corpus petition, <em>Beardslee v. Woodford, </em>358 F.3d 560, 568 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">Ponce contends that he was denied due process when the trial court failed to excuse a juror who allegedly was biased by Ponce\u2019s physical attack on the victim, his wife, in open court. This contention lacks merit because Ponce has failed to rebut the state court\u2019s presumptively correct finding that the challenged juror could serve fairly and impartially. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Greene v. Georgia, </em>519 U.S. 145, 146, 117 S.Ct. 578, 136 L.Ed.2d 507 (1996) (per curiam) (\u201c[F]ederal courts must accord a presumption of correctness to state courts\u2019 findings of juror bias.\u201d). Nor has Ponce demonstrated that the Washington Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of his jury bias claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Williams v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 567, 626 (9th Cir.2004), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>546 U.S. 934, 126 S.Ct. 419, 163 L.Ed.2d 319 (2005) (\u201cThe Sixth Amendment affords no relief when the defendant\u2019s own misconduct caused the alleged juror partiality and the trial judge employed reasonable means under the circumstances to preserve the trial\u2019s fairness.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Ponce\u2019s habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>corpus petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">To the extent Ponce\u2019s brief raises additional uncertified issues, we construe his arguments as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability, and we deny the motion. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22\u20141(e); <em>see also Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b242-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
