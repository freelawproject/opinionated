We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">I. <em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">The OCC is the bureau of the Department of Treasury that supervises and regulates banks organized under the National Bank Act. In January, 2005, the OCC conducted a regularly scheduled examination of Fort Worth, Texas-based Surety Bank. It discovered, among other irregularities, that the bank had not charged Abrams, the bank\u2019s former Chairman and CEO, the normal transaction fee for executing wire transfers. The OCC prepared an examination report (\u201cthe Report\u201d) in March, 2005, notified Abrams that it was conducting a formal investigation of him, and issued an Order of Investigation (\u201cthe Order\u201d) on June 9, 2005. Under the OCC\u2019s regulations, the Order, as well as any materials developed in connection with it, is confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">Abrams requested a copy of the Order in July, 2005, and the OCC denied his request. On August 2, 2005, Abrams filed a formal request for a copy of the Order pursuant to the FOIA. The OCC again denied his request, stating that the Order is exempt from the FOIA\u2019s production requirements. Abrams formally appealed the OCC\u2019s denial, and on November 18, 2005, the OCC denied his appeal on the basis that the Order is excluded from production under exemption 8. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This lawsuit followed, the case was referred to a magistrate judge, and the OCC moved for summary judgment. After inspecting the Order <em>in camera, </em>the magistrate judge concluded that the motion for summary judgment should be granted because the Order is related to the Report, thus falling within the scope of exemption 8. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, granted the motion for summary judgment, dismissed the case, and entered final judgment. Abrams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">II. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"AO\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Shell Offshore Inc. v. Babbitt, </em>238 F.3d 622, 627 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if the record shows \u2018that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Courts must narrowly construe FOIA exemptions in favor of full disclosure. <em>Dep\u2019t of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 361, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976); <em>Fed. Labor Relations Auth. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Def., </em>975 F.2d 1105, 1111 (5th Cir.1992). When interpreting a statute, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute binds a court. <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enters., </em>489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The FOIA requires government agencies to disclose documents, unless the agencies can demonstrate that the documents at issue fall within the scope of one of the nine exemptions enumerated in \u00a7 552(b) of the FOIA. Exemption 8 provides that the FOIA does not apply to \u201cmatters that are ... contained in or related to examination ... reports prepared by ... or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(8). Abrams argues that the district court erred in finding that the Order falls within the scope of Exemption 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">First, Abrams argues that it is not enough that the Order is related to the Report, and that instead, a direct connection must be shown between the contents of the Report and the contents of the Order. This argument, however, runs afoul of the admonition that courts \u201cnot look beyond the words of a statute if those words are rational and unambiguous.\u201d <em>In re Hammers, </em>988 F.2d 32, 34 (5th Cir. 1993). The statute never mentions contents, and only requires that a matter be related to the Report in order to be exempt from production. <em>See Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Heimann, </em>589 F.2d 531, 532-33 (D.C.Cir.1978) (finding that exemption 8 excludes documents \u201crelating to the extent of compliance\u201d by national banks with Consumer Credit Protection Act from disclosure).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">If Congress meant to require a direct connection between the matter exempted and the Report, it could have easily accomplished that by specifying as much. <em>See, e.g., </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6311(e)(2)(B) (specifying no disclosure of certain financial information unless \u201cdirectly related\u201d to certain matters). Therefore, we only need to find that the Order was related to the Report. In addition to the magistrate judge\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review of the Order, the OCC\u2019s sworn affidavit and the chronology of the investigation support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Abrams also argues that the term \u201cmatters\u201d cannot mean \u201cdocuments,\u201d and instead must solely mean \u201cinformation,\u201d because it is factually impossible for a document to be \u201ccontained in\u201d a report. Exemption 8, however, only requires that the matters be \u201ccontained in <em>or </em>related to\u201d the Report, (emphasis added). The presence of the conjunction \u201cor,\u201d instead of \u201cand,\u201d suggests that Congress meant \u201cmatters\u201d to be a flexible term that can include both documents and information. Abrams\u2019 other arguments are similarly unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">Abrams argues that the district court erred by broadly interpreting \u201cexamination report\u201d to not only include the physical report, but also the period of examination. However, we find no such interpretation in the court\u2019s opinion. Abrams also argues that other federal banking agencies\u2019 policies of disclosing similar investigative orders contradict the district court\u2019s holding, but those policies only attest to the discretion that the FOIA affords to individual agencies. Similarly, Abrams argues that the district court should have required that the OCC redact any confidential information and disclose the remaining, non-exempt Orders. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>der exemption 8, however, the <em>entire </em>Order is rendered confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Finally, Abrams argues that the district court abused its discretion by not conducting <em>in camera </em>review of the OCC\u2019s Report in conjunction with the Order. As stated above, however, exemption 8 does not require a direct relationship between the two documents. The court inspected the Order, and had ample other evidence that the two documents were related, including the OCC\u2019s affidavit and other information concerning the examination and its discoveries. The court did not abuse its direction by not also inspecting the Report <em>in camera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">IV. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b27-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-12\">. Abrams had the opportunity to review the Order, without copying it, during a deposition taken by the OCC on August 16, 2005. The OCC is required to show an order of investigation to any person from whom it requests or compels testimony during the course of a formal investigation. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.183(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
