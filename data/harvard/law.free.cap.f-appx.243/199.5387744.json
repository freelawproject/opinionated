Upon de novo review, <em>see Koehler v. Brody, </em>483 F.3d 590, 596 (8th Cir.2007), we conclude that dismissal was improper because the documents Atakpu submitted to the district court on November 8, 2005, were sufficient to initiate a civil action for purposes of Title VII, and November 8 was within 90 days of August 25, the day Atakpu received a right-to-sue-letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). See <em>42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) (once EEOC has dismissed charge and notified aggrieved person, aggrieved person may bring civil action within 90 days); <em>Page v. Arkansas Dep\u2019t of Corr., 222 </em>F.3d 453, 454-55 (8th Cir.2000) (plaintiffs Title VII action was timely-filed where she timely submitted her EEOC charge and right-to-sue letter to district court, even though court informed her documents were not in proper form and she later submitted amended complaint after 90-day deadline); <em>Huston v. General Motors Corp., </em>477 F.2d 1003, 1008 (8th Cir.1973) (request for appointment of attorney within time limit (then 30 days) is \u201cbringing of the civil action\u201d for purposes of Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\">. We do not consider Atakpu's arguments related to the denials of his motion for a default judgment and motion for relief from judgment because he did not file a proper appeal of those judgments. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (notice of appeal must \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\u201d); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii) (party intending to challenge order disposing of motion after final judgment has been entered must file notice of appeal or amended notice of appeal within time prescribed).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
