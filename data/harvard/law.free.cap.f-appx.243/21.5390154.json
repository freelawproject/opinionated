The brief comes perilously close to failing to preserve any argument for appeal. <em>See United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 612 (5th Cir.2000). His assertions are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The district court was without authority to reduce Espinoza\u2019s sentence in the absence of a Government motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 184-85, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 367-68 (5th Cir.1996). The district court offered to continue the sentencing, but Espinoza did not request it, and he has not alleged, much less shown, that the district court\u2019s failure to sua sponte continue the hearing affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-737, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Finally, Espinoza\u2019s request for a remand is baseless given that the district court is without authority to investigate why the Government failed to file a motion under \u00a7 5K1.1 absent allegations that it did so for unconstitutional reasons. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840; <em>Price, </em>95 F.3d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution counsel that filing frivolous appeals may be sanctioned. <em>United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 223 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
