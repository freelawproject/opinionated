Brown primarily contests the denial of her post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL). AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">In 1993, Brown executed a promissory note and deed of trust to finance her home in Gulfport, Mississippi. The note was for $72,350 (payable monthly, with a final payment due 1 January 2001); it was eventually assigned to Atlantic Mortgage &amp; Investment Corporation (AMIC). On 18 November 1999, ABN AMRO purchased all of AMIC\u2019s stock; the two corporations merged on 14 January 2000. ABN AMRO, as the surviving corporation, became the holder and servicer of Brown\u2019s note.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Between 1998 and 2000, Brown was frequently late with her monthly note payments; she made none after the payment due 1 February 2000. Accordingly, in August 2000, ABN AMRO engaged Morris to foreclose on Brown\u2019s home. Morris took steps toward completing a non-judicial foreclosure, and a foreclosure sale was scheduled for 27 October 2000. Defendants, however, voluntarily ceased foreclosure efforts on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">Brown filed this action that October. At trial in 2004 she asserted, <em>inter alia: </em>claims under the FDCPA and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq. </em>(RESPA); and state-law claims for, <em>inter alia, </em>negligence, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. ABN AMRO counterclaimed for the amount owed under the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">At the close of the evidence, the district court granted JMOL: in favor of ABN AMRO and Morris on Brown\u2019s intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim; and in favor of ABN AMRO on the FDCPA claim, some of the RESPA claims, and its counterclaim, subject to the jury\u2019s finding the amount owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-19\">Subsequently, for all remaining claims, including under the FDCPA against Morris, the jury found for defendants and awarded ABN AMRO approximately $97,000 on its counterclaim. Brown\u2019s post-trial motions for JMOL, or in the alternative, a new trial and remittitur, were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-21\">Primarily at issue are the district court\u2019s JMOL rulings. In the light of these rulings\u2019 <em>not </em>being erroneous, the denial of the alternative motion for a new trial or remittitur is also upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Also at issue is whether the district court erred: in permitting ABN AMRO to pursue its counterclaim; in its jury instructions; and in permitting testimony about settlement discussions. To the extent Brown raises issues regarding her negligent-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim, we do <em>not </em>consider them; Brown voluntarily dismissed that claim. Similarly, we do <em>not </em>consider her inadequately-briefed contentions regarding discovery rulings. Despite Brown\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, these claims are waived. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Brown contests the district court\u2019s close-of-the-evidence and post-verdict JMOL rulings. A JMOL ruling is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Huss v. Gayden, </em>465 F.3d 201, 205 (5th Cir.2006). JMOL is proper when \u201ca party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue\u201d. Fed.R.CivP. 50(a)(1) (as amended effective 1 December 2006; stylistic changes only, <em>see </em>advisory committee\u2019s note). \u201c[A]ll reasonable inferences [are made] in favor of the nonmoving party\u201d. <em>Huss, </em>465 F.3d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">For her FDCPA claims, Brown contests: the close-of-the-evidenee JMOL for ABN AMRO; and the post-verdict JMOL-denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">In granting JMOL to ABN AMRO on Brown\u2019s FDCPA claims at the close of the evidence, the district court held: ABN AMRO acquired Brown\u2019s mortgage by merger, rather than by transfer or assignment; and, accordingly, it was not an FDCPA debt collector, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii) (exempting from the definition any person conducting collection activities \u201cconcern[ing] a debt which was not in default at the time it was obtained by such person\u201d). Brown contends that exemption is inapplicable, maintaining ABN AMRO \u201cobtained\u201d her mortgage while it was in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">Because the FDCPA does not define the term \u201cobtained\u201d, we may look to the act\u2019s legislative history in interpreting it. <em>See, e.g., Goswami v. Am. Collections Enter., Inc., </em>377 F.3d 488, 492-93 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cThe Senate Report accompanying the FDCPA explained that the purpose of the act was \u2018to protect consumers from a host of unfair, harassing, and deceptive debt collection practices without imposing unnecessary restrictions on ethical debt collectors.\u2019\u201d <em>Peter v. GC Servs. L.P., </em>310 F.3d 344, 351-52 (5th Cir.2002) (quoting S.Rep. No. 95-382 (1977), at 1-2, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1695, 1696). That report, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cintended] the term \u2018debt collectorf ]\u2019 ... to cover all third persons who regularly collect debts for others\u201d, S.Rep. No. 95-382, at 3; and stated \u201c[t]he primary persons intended to be covered are independent debt collectors\u201d, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Along that line, our court has at least implicitly interpreted \u201cobtained\u201d to be synonymous with \u201cassigned\u201d. <em>See Perry v. Stewart Title Co., </em>756 F.2d 1197, 1208 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe legislative history of section 1692a(6) indicates conclusively that a debt collector does not include the consumer\u2019s creditors, a mortgage servicing company, or an assignee of a debt, as long as the debt was not in default at the time it was assigned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">ABN AMRO, a mortgage company, was not specifically assigned Brown\u2019s mortgage for debt-collection purposes. Rather, ABN AMRO acquired it through its merg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>er with Brown\u2019s previous mortgage company. Accordingly, ABN AMRO did <em>not </em>\u201cobtain\u201d her mortgage while it was in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The jury found Morris was <em>not </em>a \u201cdebt collector\u201d pursuant to the FDCPA. It defines a \u201cdebt collector\u201d as \u201cany person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another\u201d. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Whether a party \u201cregularly\u201d attempts to collect debts is determined, of course, by the volume or frequency of its debt-collection activities. <em>See Garrett v. Derbes, </em>110 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Morris testified he is involved primarily in non-judicial foreclosures. Brown contends: a non-judicial foreclosure is <em>per se </em>FDCPA debt collection; and, accordingly, Morris is <em>per se </em>an FDCPA debt collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Brown\u2019s contention, however, ignores \u00a7 1692a(6)\u2019s distinction between debt collection and enforcement of a security interest. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1692a(6) (\u201c[f]or the purpose of section 1692f(6) of this title, [\u2018debt collector\u2019] also includes any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests\u201d); <em>Kaltenbach v. Richards, </em>464 F.3d 524, 527 n. 3 (5th Cir.2006) (acknowledging this distinction). Consistent with this distinction, our court has at least implicitly recognized that a foreclosure is <em>not per se </em>FDCPA debt collection. <em>See Kaltenbach, </em>464 F.3d at 527 (where defendant initiated an executory-process foreclosure on plaintiffs home, our court stated the issue as \u201cwhether [defendant] is subject to \u00a7 1692g if he satisfies the general definition of a debt collector, even though he was merely enforcing a security interest in his dealings with [plaintiff]\u201d). Accordingly, Morris is not <em>per se </em>an FDCPA debt collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Brown challenges the JMOL rulings against her remaining RESPA, negligence, and breach-of-contract claims. Regarding the close-of-the-evidence JMOL for ABN AMRO on some of her RESPA claims, Brown does <em>not </em>show the district court erred in concluding, pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 3500.21(d)(l)(i), ABN AMRO was not required to provide her with a post-merger notice of the transfer of servicing rights. Further, Brown fails to point to adequate record evidence establishing she was entitled to a verdict on her negligence, breach-of-contract, and remaining RESPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">Next, Brown maintains the district court erred in granting ABN AMRO leave to amend to pursue its counterclaim because, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court lacked jurisdiction over it. Challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction are reviewed <em>de novo, e.g., Crockett v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>436 F.3d 529, 531 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2945, 165 L.Ed.2d 956 (2006); leave-to-amend rulings, for abuse of discretion, <em>e.g., Triad Elec. &amp; Controls, Inc. v. Power Sys. Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 180, 192 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">Needless to say, ABN AMRO\u2019s counterclaim involves many of the facts relevant to Brown\u2019s other claims, including: Brown\u2019s rights and obligations under the note; her failure to make payments; and defendants\u2019 efforts to obtain payment. Accordingly, the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim and did not abuse its discretion in allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>it to be asserted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367; <em>Plant v. Blazer Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>598 F.2d 1357, 1364 (5th Cir.1979) (holding, in truth-in-lending case, a state debt-collection counterclaim was compulsory because \u201cthe obvious interrelationship of the claims and rights of the parties, coupled with the common factual basis of the claims, demonstrates a logical relationship between the claim and counterclaim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Brown next challenges the jury instructions. Properly challenged instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Fiber Sys. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Roehrs, </em>470 F.3d 1150, 1158 (5th Cir.2006). To establish error, the challenging party must first show the instruction as a whole \u201ccreates substantial doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided\u201d. <em>Green v. Adm\u2019rs of the Tulane Educ. Fund, </em>284 F.3d 642, 659 (5th Cir.2002). Even if the instruction was erroneous, we will not reverse if it \u201ccould not have affected the outcome of the case\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Further, a party challenging the failure to include a requested instruction must show it properly states the law. <em>E.g., Russell v. Plano Bank &amp; Trust, </em>130 F.3d 715, 719 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">For the first time on appeal (mandating plain-error review), Brown asserts error in the jury\u2019s being instructed that, \u201c[ojrdinarily, the mere activity of foreclosing ... under a deed of trust is not the collection of a debt within the meaning of the [FDCPA] unless other actions are taken beyond those necessary to foreclose under the deed of trust, and were taken in an effort to collect a debt\u201d. As discussed <em>supra, </em>a non-judicial foreclosure is not <em>per se </em>FDCPA debt collection. Brown fails to show this instruction \u201ccreates substantial doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided\u201d. <em>Green, </em>284 F.3d at 659. There was no reversible plain error. <em>See Fiber Sys., </em>470 F.3d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Brown next maintains the district court erred in refusing her requested FDCPA instructions. <em>As </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>Brown has not established that a reasonable jury could not have found that Morris was not an FDCPA debt collector. Accordingly, Brown\u2019s requested instructions, which did not pertain to that threshold determination, \u201ccould not have affected the outcome of the case\u201d. <em>Green, </em>284 F.3d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Further, Brown contends the jury should have been instructed that, under Mississippi law, Morris owed her a trustee\u2019s heightened duty of care as to all foreclosure-related matters. Brown fails, however, to provide relevant authority for such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Finally, Brown asserts the contributory-negligence and mitigation-of-damages instructions were erroneous. These instructions, however, \u201ccould not have affected the outcome of the case\u201d, <em>id., </em>because the jury found no negligence, or FDCPA or RESPA violations, by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Brown contends the trial court improperly permitted Morris to testify about settlement discussions, in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 408. Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Hodges v. Mack Trucks, Inc., </em>474 F.3d 188, 198 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103. An erroneous evidentiary ruling is reversible error only if it affected substantial rights of the complaining party. <em>E.g., Hodges, </em>474 F.3d at 199; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Morris\u2019 testimony was: \u201c[T]o this day in every discussion I have had with Ms. Brown she has insisted either through her attorneys or personally that she was not going to pay for this house\u201d. Brown fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>to show its admission affected her substantial rights. The testimony does not refer to settlement discussions. Further, the district court subsequently instructed the jury it was not to consider Morris\u2019 reference to statements made through attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
