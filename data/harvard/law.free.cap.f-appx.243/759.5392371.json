Counsel for Baldwin has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging he has found no meritorious issues for appeal, but stating as a possible ground for appeal the district court\u2019s denial of Baldwin\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Baldwin was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Moreover, we find the Government produced ample evidence to establish police had probable cause to search Baldwin after hearing a gunshot and seeing Baldwin frantically try to shove something into his pants pocket. Accordingly, we find the district court correctly denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-25\">Finding no meritorious issues for appeal, we affirm Baldwin\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Baldwin in writing of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Baldwin requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Baldwin. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-17\"> Baldwin reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
