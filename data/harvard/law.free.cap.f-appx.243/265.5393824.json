The Board dismissed Kumar\u2019s appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The Board conducted a de novo review of the IJ\u2019s oral decision. Our review is therefore limited to the Board\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that the IJ\u2019s opinion is expressly adopted.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review whether the Board\u2019s conclusions are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>We will grant the petition only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">The Board found that, even if Kumar demonstrated past persecution, the government met its burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that internal relocation would be safe and reasonable under all the circumstances. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Kaiser v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 653, 659 (9th Cir.2004) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)). Kumar\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence submitted by the government, collectively, does not compel the conclusion that Kumar\u2019s relocation to Mumbai would be unreasonable. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 659-60 (relocation unreasonable where petitioners received threats in multiple areas of Pakistan); <em>Cardenas v. INS, </em>294 F.3d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.2002) (guerillas threatened petitioner that they would find him wherever he went).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-17\">Because Kumar is ineligible for asylum, he necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">Kumar\u2019s claim for CAT relief also fails. He did not present substantial supporting his belief that he would be unable to live elsewhere in India safely. <em>See Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1123 (9th Cir.2004) (petitioners have burden under CAT \u201cto show that internal relocation is not a possibility\u201d) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b288-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
