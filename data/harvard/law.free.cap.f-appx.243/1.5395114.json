SMITH, WIENER, and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b23-21\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b23-22\">Jessica Yvonne Barrera pleaded guilty of transporting an undocumented alien by means of a motor vehicle for private financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) and (B)(i). On appeal, this court determined that there was sentencing error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), vacated the sentence, and remanded for resentencing. Barrera appeals the sentence imposed on resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-23\">Barrera argues that this court\u2019s rulings since <em>Booker </em>have effectively reinstated the mandatory guideline scheme that was stricken in <em>Booker; </em>she recognizes, however, that this argument is contrary to current Fifth Circuit precedent. She does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>not challenge the guideline range the district court considered in determining her sentence, but she urges that her sentence, which is at the low end of the guideline range, is unreasonable because the court failed properly to weigh the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">The transcript of the resentencing hearing does not support Barrera\u2019s argument. The district court expressly noted that the sentence is based on all the information that was before the court, and the court considered arguments of counsel, Barrera\u2019s statements, and letters that were submitted on her behalf. At the hearing, counsel argued that Barrera had steady employment, that she had behaved well while on bond, and that she was remorseful, and counsel discussed Barrera\u2019s personal circumstances that are set forth in her briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The record thus reflects the district court\u2019s consideration of Barrera\u2019s history and characteristics, as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court not only considered the facts of the offense, but looked beyond those facts and expressed concern regarding Barrera\u2019s motivation for committing the offense. The record thus reflects consideration by the district court of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law and to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A), and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The court also considered \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d and the range set forth in the guidelines, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(3) and (4). Finally, the court ordered Barrera to participate in an education program while in prison so she could receive her high school diploma, as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). The record thus reflects adequate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 262-65, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Barrera contends the district court erred by failing to provide explicit analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In rejecting Barrera\u2019s request for a sentence that was outside the guideline range, the court stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that it understood the factors that it had to consider and that it believed that a sentence within the guideline range was appropriate. The court was not required to provide a more explicit statement of its \u00a7 3553(a) rationale. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Barrera\u2019s sentence is reasonable, <em>see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 262-65, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 518-19, and the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b23-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
