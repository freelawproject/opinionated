The defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting that they were protected from liability under the qualified-immunity doctrine. The district court denied the motion in part, holding that there were genuine issues of material fact on the plaintiffs\u2019 warrantlessentry, excessive-force, and false-arrest claims. The defendants filed this interlocutory appeal on the warrantless-entry and false-arrest claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">We affirm in part and reverse in part. Having had the benefit of oral argument and having carefully considered the record on appeal, we are not persuaded that a lengthy opinion is necessary. As to the plaintiffs\u2019 warrantless-entry claim against Officer Korovic, we AFFIRM for the reasons set forth by the district court. <em>Thorne v. Steubenville Police Officer, </em>463 F.Supp.2d 760, 771-74, 775-77 (S.D.Ohio 2006). On the plaintiffs\u2019 false-arrest claim against Officer Lelies, we likewise AFFIRM for the reasons set forth by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 774-77. As both parties acknowledged during oral argument, however, there is no evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>record that Officer Lelies had any involvement in the warrantless entry of the plaintiffs\u2019 backyard, nor is there any evidence that Officer Korovic participated in the arrest of Daniel Thorne, Jr. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court on those two latter claims and REMAND the case for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
