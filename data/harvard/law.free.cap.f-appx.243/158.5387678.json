Having reviewed the record and the applicable law, and having the benefit of oral argument and the parties\u2019 briefs, we determine that no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a panel opinion and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s opinion. The district court\u2019s decision to disregard Plaintiff Cole\u2019s affidavit was proper under the reasoning announced by this Court in <em>Aerel, S.R.L. v. PCC Airfoils, LLC, </em>448 F.3d 899 (6th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court correctly found that the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs did not support their state law tort claims and that Defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
