We will not get into the extensive procedural and factual background of this case here, as we write only for the parties and, in any event, it is recounted in an earlier decision in this matter. <em>See United States v. Merlino, </em>349 F.3d 144 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-23\">Stated broadly, in his first appeal Lutz challenged the District Court\u2019s calculation of the amount of monetary loss to victims caused by the conspiracy that was properly attributable to him. Initially, the District Court had attributed to Lutz the entire loss charged to the conspiracy ($300,500), going back to its inception in 1992. Pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines, this resulted in a three-level enhancement to Lutz\u2019s base offense level. On appeal, we vacated the District Court\u2019s decision in that regard, holding that the record did not support Lutz\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy at such an early stage. <em>See id. </em>at 157-59. On remand, the District Court determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the record supported a conclusion that Lutz was involved in the conspiracy beginning in December of 1996, and attributed to him the loss, amounting to $159,500, associated with both his direct involvement and that associated with other members of the conspiracy with whom he most closely worked. This amount called for a two-level upward adjustment to the Guidelines base-offense level. Lutz again appeals; this time we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In <em>United States v. Collado, </em>975 F.2d 985 (3d Cir.1992), we explained the scope of co-conspirator liability as it relates to the Guidelines calculation of loss amounts attributable to a particular defendant. Though the scope of accomplice liability as it relates to criminal convictions can be quite broad, <em>see United States v. Turcks, </em>41 F.3d 893, 897 (3d Cir.1994), the Guidelines require a more nuanced approach. For Guidelines purposes, a defendant is liable for those acts of co-conspirators taken \u201c \u2018in furtherance of the ... jointly-undertaken ... activity,\u2019 were \u2018within the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement,\u2019 and were \u2018reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminal activity the defendant agreed to undertake.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collado, </em>975 F.2d at 995 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3). Put another way, the Guidelines are concerned with the scope of a defendant\u2019s agreed-upon involvement in a given conspiracy, not the scope of the conspiracy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In this case the Government argued\u2014 and the District Court found\u2014that Lutz was responsible for the losses that he personally caused as well as those undertaken by others in the conspiracy with whom he regularly associated and closely worked. Taking into account our earlier decision that Lutz was not responsible for losses as early as 1992, the Court began its loss calculation with the first racketeering act charged against Lutz that was found \u201cproven\u201d by the jury (in December of 1996). Lutz, on the other hand, asserted that only those extortions in which he was personally involved should figure into his Guidelines loss calculation. We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">As an initial matter, <em>Collado </em>instructs that the loss amount attributable to Lutz is <em>not </em>necessarily limited only to his own acts. What matters is what losses were reasonably foreseeable as a result of Lutz\u2019s specific agreement with his co-conspirators, even if he did not personally cause those losses. The conspiracy that Lutz agreed to join\u2014and it is evident from the jury verdict that he did so agree\u2014was the wide-ranging, systematic extortion of bookmakers in the Philadelphia area.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">The facts here are analogous to those in <em>United States v. Duliga, </em>204 F.3d 97 (3d Cir.2000), in which the defendant joined a fraudulent telemarketing scam. In holding him responsible for the fraud loss caused by the other co-conspirators, we noted that the defendant knew of the fraudulent nature of the activity, that he employed the same techniques as his co-conspirators, and that he worked in close proximity with them such that he certainly knew the scope of their scamming activities. <em>Id. </em>at 101. Similarly here. Regardless whether Lutz personally participated in each individual act of extortion, when he joined the organized crime conspiracy he certainly knew of its illegal purpose at the outset. In addition, conspiracy members all employed the same techniques, often following up on unfinished \u201cbusiness\u201d begun by another. And most significantly from the standpoint of loss calculation, each co-conspirator helped to arrange the lucrative \u201cChristmas shakes,\u201d in which lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>cal bookmakers were forced to pay substantial sums under threat of violence each year at Christmastime. This aspect of the conspiracy alone accounted for $101,500 of the District Court\u2019s loss calculation, which would be sufficient by itself to sustain the two-level Guidelines enhancement that was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In this context, we affirm the judgment of sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
