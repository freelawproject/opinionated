Evidence of the automobile accident was relevant to determining the speed of Alamilla\u2019s car. Additionally, any prejudice did not <em>substantially </em>outweigh the probative value of the evidence under Federal Rule of Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">2. Although evidence of more than one date of removal was presented at trial, the removal subsequent to Alamilla\u2019s aggravated felony conviction was the focus of the government\u2019s presentation. Thus, if <em>Apprendi </em>error, it was harmless. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>468 F.3d 1182, 1187 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">3. The district court did not err in enhancing Alamilla\u2019s sentence for aggravated assault and serious bodily injury. The record reflects that Alamilla intended to make contact with the pursuing police vehicles. Additionally, no intent is required if the defendant caused \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2A2.2 cmt. n. 1 (2006). The district court\u2019s finding of serious bodily injury was supported by the victim\u2019s need for months of on-going physical therapy and her medical difficulties. Finally, no evidentiary hearing was required because Alamilla was provided a \u201creasonable opportunity to present information to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>court.\u201d <em>United States v. Real-Hernandez, </em>90 F.3d 356, 362 (9th Cir.1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">4. Alamilla\u2019s argument that the district court engaged in impermissible double-counting is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Reese, 2 </em>F.3d 870, 895 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">5. Alamilla\u2019s argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) has been effectively overruled, is also foreclosed by applicable precedent. <em>See Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>468 F.3d at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">6. Alamilla\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s imposition of restitution is unavailing. Section 758 includes the necessary intent under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A to qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Campos-Fuerte, </em>357 F.3d 956, 961 (9th Cir.2004), <em>as amended, superseded by statute on other grounds, see also </em>California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2. Although there was no complete accounting of the victim\u2019s losses, Alamilla objected only to the existence of damages, and the application of \u00a7 3663A, not to the accounting methodology. We therefore review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Zink, </em>107 F.3d 716, 718 (9th Cir.1997). Because there is an equal likelihood that the amount of restitution would increase if remanded, Alamilla has failed to carry this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b237-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. At oral argument, Alamilla challenged the district court\u2019s application of Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 32. Because Alamilla failed to sufficiently raise this contention in his opening brief, it is waived. <em>See Milne v. Hillblom, </em>165 F.3d 733, 737 n. 6 (9th Cir.1999). Additionally, Alamilla specifically argued his factual contentions before the district court, which rejected the arguments throughout numerous sentencing proceedings. Alamilla\u2019s situation is thus distinguishable from <em>United States v. Houston, </em>217 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir.2000), upon which he relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
