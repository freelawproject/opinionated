The district court denied the petition after determining that McBarron could proceed under \u00a7 2241 and that McBarron\u2019s claims lacked merit. McBarron appeals that denial. He argues that his claims have merit and that the district court erred by not giving him sufficient opportunity to respond to Jeter\u2019s answer before denying his petition, by construing his postjudgment motion as a motion to reconsider, and by not ruling on his motion for appointment of expert witnesses. McBarron moves this court for a conference, appointed counsel, and an expedited appeal. He also requests that this court strike the appellee\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-23\">McBarron was not entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claims would not entitle him to immediate release if he prevailed on them. <em>See Spina v. Aaron, </em>821 F.2d 1126, 1127-28 (5th Cir.1987). Consequently, McBarron\u2019s claims are not cognizable in a habeas action. <em>See id. </em>The district court\u2019s denial of relief is AFFIRMED on this alternate basis. <em>See Emery v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1997). All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
