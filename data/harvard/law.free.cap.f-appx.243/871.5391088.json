A <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s brief is entitled to liberal construction. <em>Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Liberally construed, Massay\u2019s brief claims the district court erred in denying him appointment of counsel and granting summary judgment. Massay has not abandoned his appeal. Because the Government has briefed these issues, it is not prejudiced by our accepting Massay\u2019s brief. Massay claims his requests for appointment of counsel should have been granted. The denial of appointment of counsel is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Castro Romero v. Becken, 256 </em>F.3d 349, 354 (5th Cir.2001). Because Mas-say\u2019s case does not present unusual or especially complex issues or facts, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appointment of counsel. <em>See, e.g., Santana v. Chandler, </em>961 F.2d 514, 515-16 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Massay next challenges the summary judgment, claiming it: applied the wrong standard of care; and erred in resolving issues of material fact. A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Guillory v. Domtar Indus., Inc., </em>95 F.3d 1320, 1326 (5th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is proper if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Concerning Massay\u2019s standard-of-care contention, this court has not resolved whether the standard under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042 or the Texas Recreational Use Statute (TRUS) applies to federal prisoners\u2019 FTCA actions in Texas, and we need not do so here. As the district court found, the same result would be reached under the TRUS or \u00a7 4042\u2019s higher ordinary-care standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Massay next contends the court erred in making the factual determination that no BOP employee was grossly negligent. He asserts, <em>inter alia: </em>BOP witnesses offered \u201cperjured affidavits\u201d; his sworn statement and other witnesses refute the BOP\u2019s claim it maintained the yard; and the treating orthopedist\u2019s report indicated his injuries were caused by a hole. Factual controversies are resolved in favor of the nonmoving party, \u201cbut only when there is an actual controversy; that is, when both parties have submitted evidence of contradictory facts\u201d. <em>Guillory, </em>95 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">The Government submitted several sworn statements establishing: the prison recreation yard was inspected daily for defects and hazards; the mechanical lift used on the yard in February of 2003 did not create any ruts; none of the inmate crews reported any ruts during the time surrounding Massay\u2019s accident; and no inmates reported injuries concerning ruts on the yard during that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">To oppose the summary-judgment motion, Massay submitted his own sworn statement, which contained statements by a prison recreation officer and a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>from Ms orthopedist\u2019s report, which was not produced. The officer\u2019s and orthopedist\u2019s statements are inadmissible hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Accordingly, we cannot consider them as raismg a material-fact issue. <em>See Martin v. John W. Stone Oil Distrib., Inc., </em>819 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Massay\u2019s sworn statement also declared that witnesses saw heavy-equipment tires stuck in the mud on the yard and that the BOP forced inmates to play athletics on the field, constantly neglected the field, and caused his injuries. He provided only conclusory assertions to contend the BOP breached its duty and caused his injuries. \u201cA summary assertion made in an affidavit is simply not enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Massay submitted the affidavit of a fellow inmate before the Government moved for summary judgment. Although entitled \u201cSIGNED AND SEALED AFFIDAVIt\u201d and indicating his fellow inmate gave the statement under oath, it is not notarized and does not indicate it was made \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d or that the statements contamed therein were \u201ctrue and correct.\u201d Thus, this document is not competent summary-judgment evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746; <em>Nissho-Iwai Am. Corp. v. Kline, </em>845 F.2d 1300, 1306 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Viewing the competent summary-judgment evidence in the light most favorable to Massay, we cannot reasonably infer the BOP breached its duty or caused Massay\u2019s injuries. For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b895-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
