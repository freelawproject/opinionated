Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), we deny the petition for review in No. 05-75934. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review in No. 06-72634.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Contrary to Rostum\u2019s contention, the record does not compel a finding that the Egyptian government was unable or unwilling to control his assailants. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005) (indicating that failure to inform the government of an incident of persecution committed by a private actor undercuts the conclusion that the government is unwilling or unable to control the private actor\u2019s attempts at persecution). Accordingly, Rostum failed to establish eligibility for either asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>We do not reach Rostum\u2019s contention that his mistreatment rose to the level of persecution. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Rostum did not show it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Egypt. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Rostum\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because Rostum filed the motion nearly six months after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (a motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of final order of removal), and he failed to submit new and material evidence of changed country conditions in Egypt that would excuse the late filing, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945 (requiring circumstances to \u201chave changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution\u201d). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED (No. 05-75934).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part (No. 06-72634).</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b356-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
