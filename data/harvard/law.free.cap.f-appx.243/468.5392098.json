Faced with a sentencing guideline range of 46 to 57 months, the district court sentenced Turturro to serve 48 months in prison. Turturro appeals only his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">While serving a term of imprisonment on a state-law manslaughter charge, Turturro devised a scheme to prepare fraudulent tax returns for fellow inmates using information from bankrupt corporations. Turturro mailed the names and social security numbers to his wife, who prepared the returns, mailed them to the IRS, and received and cashed the refund checks. Turturro instructed his wife where to send the refund money after it arrived and how to look for bankrupt companies to use on the W-2 forms. When his wife withdrew from the scheme, Turturro recruited another woman to prepare the returns in her place.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Turturro argues on appeal that the district court erred when it (1) increased his offense level by four levels after concluding that Turturro was an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d of the fraudulent scheme under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); and (2) ordered Turturro\u2019s federal sentence to run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. After review, we affirm Turturro\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">First, Turturro argues that the district court erred by treating him as an organizer or leader of the fraudulent refund scheme. Turturro says the district court\u2019s factual finding on this issue was erroneous because he was simply a middle man, a mere conduit for information that flowed between his fellow inmates and his wife. We review for clear error a district court\u2019s decision to enhance a defendant\u2019s offense level based on a leadership role in the criminal offense. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir. 2002) . \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">The sentencing guideline relevant to Turturro permits a court to \u201cincrease by 4 levels\u201d a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). According to Application Note 4, courts should consider the following factors in determining whether a defendant was an organizer or leader:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-17\">[T]he exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). To qualify for the 4-level increase, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>dant must have been the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l). An enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1 \u201crequires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The district court did not clearly err in applying the 4-level enhancement based on Turturro\u2019s conduct. Ample evidence supported the court\u2019s factual finding that Turturro was an organizer or leader of the fraudulent refund scheme. The 4-level enhancement was warranted because the scheme involved five or more participants, and because Turturro (1) exercised decision making authority over the details of the scheme, (2) recruited the accomplices, (3) played an integral role in the success of the scheme, (4) planned and organized the particulars of scheme, and (5) exercised control and authority over his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Second, Turturro argues that the district court abused its discretion when, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, it ordered his federal sentence to run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. Turturro says that the imposition of a consecutive sentence unjustly prejudiced him and created an unreasonably and extraordinarily long period of incarceration. We review de novo the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 5G1.3. <em>See United States v. Bidwell, </em>393 F.3d 1206, 1208-09 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201cMultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). In determining whether the sentence to be imposed should run concurrently or consecutively to an earlier-imposed sentence, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b). Those factors include \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d the kinds of sentence and the applicable sentencing range, and any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The sentencing guideline applicable to Turturro, which the district court correctly relied upon in ordering that Turturro\u2019s sentence run consecutively to his state sentence, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A73\">If the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment ... the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a). Application Note 1 echoes the substantive guideline provision, reiterating that \u201c[ujnder subsection (a), the court shall impose a consecutive sentence when the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving an undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The Policy Statement in \u00a7 5G1.3(c) provides that \u201c[i]n any <em>other </em>ease involving an undischarged term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">The district court did not err when it ordered that Turturro\u2019s federal sentence run consecutively to his undischarged, state-imposed manslaughter sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it applied the guidelines in an advisory scheme. The court appropriately imposed a consecutive sentence because Turturro committed the instant offense while he was serving an undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Upon careful review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. We accordingly affirm Turturro\u2019s 48-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
