In June 2002, thirty-five-year-old Beery began working as an at-will quality inspector at the Marion, Ohio warehouse of defendantappellee Associates Hygienic Products, Inc. (\u201cAHP\u201d). On Beery\u2019s application to work as a quality inspector, he checked \u201cno\u201d in response to the question \u201cAre you physically or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the job for which you are applying?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-25\">Beery worked as a Quality Inspector from June to November 2002, which required him to assist the operator and assistant operator in starting and threading diaper machines, inspect the quality of the diapers, identify and hold defective diapers, maintain housekeeping in the area, and assist at the packaging end of the production line.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In November 2002, AHP transferred Beery to work as an Assistant Operator, where he was required to assist the operator with changeover and other issues on the line, load rolls of material onto spindles located on the machines, observe the line to make sure the process was running smoothly, adjust the line if needed by using controls, maintain and clean the machines, clean the line, and make splices to the material running on the line. The assistant operator position also required Beery to \u201clift heavy material with the use of a mechanized crane or pallet jack,\u201d but not to continuously lift over fifty pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In January 2004, AHP assigned Beery to work as a packaging technician, a job that, on some lines, requires the employee to pivot back and forth between the production line and a task called a \u201chorn\u201d substation. As Beery described it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">The horn substation was a position that required an employee to hold an open bag, about chest high, up to a chute, while diapers dropped into the bag. Once the correct amount of diapers dropped into the bag, the employee was required to twist or turn one-hundred-eighty (180) degrees behind the chute, and place the full bag of diapers on a conveyor belt. Because the production levels and speed varied, the amount of twisting varied[;] however, generally an employee working the horn had to twist one-hundred-eighty (180) degrees about every ten (10) to twenty (20) seconds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">On Beery\u2019s first night as a packaging technician, he performed the horn duties for about one hour and the twisting motion aggravated his back condition, requiring him to go to the local hospital\u2019s emergency room and miss the next two days of work. When Beery returned, AHP honored his request to move to a production line that did not have a horn substation and thus did not require that type and degree of repetitive side-to-side twisting motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">After about six months, in July 2004, AHP returned Beery to the assistant-operator position, where he worked until AHP transferred him again to a packaging technician position on the training-pants line in February 2005. AHP told Beery that he would be required to rotate through the \u201chorn\u201d substation for at least half an hour each day. Beery informed his supervisor, David Smith, that working the horn had injured his back in the past and his back condition prevented him from working the horn again. Supervisor Smith told Beery to go home and return with medical documentation to support his assertion that his back condition prevented him from safely working the horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">On February 10, 2005, Beery provided AHP\u2019s human resources (\u201cHR\u201d) manager Peg Keel with a note from Dr. Khozema Rajkotwala, M.D., dated that same day, that. stated, in full, \u201cDue to mechanical back problems Patient cannot twist repeatedly from right to left 2-10-05 thru 3-11-05.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">HR manager Keel took Beery off the horn, suggested that he apply for short-term disability benefits, and told him that he would need further medical documentation if he was going to be unable to work the horn for more than a month. Keel also suggested that Beery ask his doctor whether he could modify the no-twisting restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">On February 17 or 18, 2005, Beery submitted to AHP a short-term disability application wherein he wrote, \u201cI have a ruptured disk. If I twist back and forth it aggravates my muscles and nerves.\u201d Beery simultaneously submitted an Attending Physician\u2019s Statement dated February 17, 2005. Under \u201cRestrictions &amp; Limitations,\u201d the physician stated, without qualification, \u201cNo twisting from side to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>side,\u201d but he also indicated that Beery could return to work the next day, February 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Beery simultaneously gave AHP a Health Care Provider Certification under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), wherein his treating physician, Dr. Rajkotwala, wrote, \u201cPT had appt. 2-10-05 c/o back pain from new job assignment\u2014was given work limitations which were turned down by employer. <em>Pt unable to do repeated work moving from side to side twisting. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added). Dr. Rajkotwala opined that Beery was ready to return to work the next day, February 18, but he cautioned that it would be \u201cnecessary for the employee to take work only intermittently or to work on a less than full schedule as a result of the condition\u201d on one or two occasions. Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s FMLA certification also stated that Beery\u2019s back condition was likely to cause one or two episodes of incapacitation per month, though it is unclear from the context whether this evaluation assumed that Beery would remain in his new position that involved rotating into the horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">HR\u2019s Keel and production manager Bill Yates met with Beery. Keel, production manager Yates, and others concluded that the prohibition on side-to-side twisting meant that Beery was unable to perform not only the training-pants packer position, but <em>any and all </em>positions that were available in the plant. On February 25, 2005, HR manager Keel called Beery and told him that AHP had no work for him consistent -with his treating physician\u2019s stated restrictions and, therefore, was terminating his employment. Beery concedes that he did not submit any subsequent medical documentation that lifted or sufficiently loosened the no-twisting prohibition. AHP\u2019s personnel file asserts, \u201cIn a manufacturing environment there is always going to be \u2018twisting from side to side\u2019 and we had no positions to move Brett to that would be able to meet those restrictions.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Beery sued AHP in Ohio state court, asserting a claim of disability discrimination under O.R.C. \u00a7 4112.01(A) and a common-law claim of unlawful discharge in violation of Ohio public policy. AHP timely removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and filed an answer. Beery moved for leave to amend the complaint; instead of alleging actual disability, he sought to add an allegation that AHP erroneously <em>regarded </em>him as disabled, which can also be a basis for recovery under the Ohio disability discrimination statute. AHP did not file any opposition to Beery\u2019s motion for leave to amend. The district court, however, failed to rule on Beery\u2019s motion for leave to amend. Instead, the district court proceeded to rule on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of AHP on Beery\u2019s original complaint, and Beery timely appealed. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that neither party was entitled to summary judgment on the record thus far developed. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of AHP\u2019s summary judgment motion and affirm the denial of Beery\u2019s summary judgment motion. On remand, the district court must rule on Beery\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The original complaint, which is currently the only complaint in the case, alleges that Beery is actually disabled; it does not allege that AHP erroneously regarded him as disabled. However, at oral argument before this court, Beery\u2019s counsel contended that, because the statute defines disability discrimination to include so-called \u201cregarded-as-disabled\u201d discrimination, the original complaint implicitly encompasses a regarded-as claim. We assume, without deciding, that this is so. We also note that Beery\u2019s summary judgment briefs abandoned any claim that he was actually disabled, instead arguing at some length that AHP fired him because it erroneously regarded him as disabled. At oral argument before this court, AHP\u2019s counsel acknowledged that AHP had adequate notice of Beery\u2019s regarded-as claim and addressed that claim at length in its own summary judgment briefs. Finally, at oral argument before this court, the parties focused entirely on Beery\u2019s claim that AHP fired him because it erroneously regarded him as disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Accordingly, in evaluating the propriety of the district court\u2019s summary judgment rulings, we consider whether there was a genuine issue as to whether AHP erroneously regarded Beery as disabled. That necessarily requires us to consider whether there was a genuine issue as to whether Beery was disabled and was therefore, as AHP claims it believed, unable to perform any available job at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Beery argues that the requirement of establishing a prima facie case, and the familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting that follows, applies only in cases where the plaintiff seeks to establish discrimination through indirect, rather than direct, evidence. He is correct. \u201cDirect evidence and the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>formulation are simply different evidentiary paths by which to resolve the ultimate issue of defendant\u2019s discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Blalock v. Metals Trades, Inc., </em>775 F.2d 703, 707 (6th Cir.1985). \u201cDirect evidence of discrimination, if credited by the fact finder, removes the case from <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>because the plaintiff no longer needs the inference of discrimination that arises from the prima facie case.\u201d <em>Talley v. Bravo Pitino Restaurant, Ltd., </em>61 F.3d 1241, 1248 (6th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Blalock, </em>775 F.2d at 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">In general, Ohio looks to federal regulations and cases applying the ADA for guidance in its interpretation of Ohio law, <em>Columbus Civ. Serv. Comm. v. McGlone, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 569, 697 N.E.2d 204, 206-07 (1998), and the different analyses of direct and indirect evidence cases indisputably obtains in the ADA context, <em>see, e.g., Hopkins v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., </em>196 F.3d 655, 660 (6th Cir.1999). No Ohio case appears to directly address the issue in the specific context of disability discrimination, but the distinction does apply in racial discrimination cases, which arise under the same statute, O.R.C. \u00a7 4112.02. <em>See Grooms v. Supporting Council of Preventative Effort, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 55, 809 N.E.2d 42, 48 (2004) <em>(\u201cAbsent direct evidence of discrimination, </em>an employee must proceed under the burden-shifting, indirect-evidence approach set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">\u201cDirect evidence is evidence that proves the existence of a fact without requiring any inferences.\u201d <em>Rowan v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc., </em>360 F.3d 544, 548 (6th Cir.2004). Clearly, Beery\u2019s proffered evidence is as direct as possible: he was told in no uncertain terms that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>being discharged because AHP could not accommodate his condition. <em>See, e.g., Holiday v. City of Chattanooga, </em>206 F.3d 637, 647 (6th Cir.2000) (withdrawal of employment offer hours after employer learned that employee was HIV-positive, employer\u2019s alleged assertion at the time that its decision was based on that knowledge, and employer\u2019s repetition of that assertion during discovery constitute direct evidence of discrimination). Thus, the district court\u2019s analysis immediately starts down the wrong path.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Where the plaintiff presents direct evidence that his disability was a factor in an adverse employment decision, his burdens are to establish that he was, or was regarded as, disabled, and that he is otherwise qualified either without accommodation, with an inessential job requirement eliminated, or with a reasonable accommodation; the burden then shifts to the employer to establish the business necessity of its decision, or to show that it was justified by wholly legitimate concerns. <em>Todd v. City of Cincinnati, </em>436 F.3d 635, 638 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 273, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). Beery has met his burden, at least enough to withstand summary judgment against him: there is no question that he was, or was regarded as, disabled; and there is ample evidence, in the form of his work history and physician\u2019s comments, that he remained qualified for his job, with reasonable accommodation. Thus, summary judgment against him was inappropriate under a direct evidence analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Rather, to obtain summary judgment on a regarded-as disabled claim, a party must show that there is no genuine issue as to whether the employee\u2019s perceived disability <em>in fact </em>prevented him from doing any available suitable jobs. Neither Beery nor AHP made this showing below.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">On one hand, AHP observes accurately that some of the notes from Beery\u2019s own treating physician, Dr. Rajkotwala, stated without qualification that Beery could not twist repetitively from side to side. It is undisputed that that restriction disqualifies Beery from performing the horn function, which is required of packers on all the <em>training-pants </em>production lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">It is also undisputed, however, that a packer on the <em>diaper </em>production lines need not perform the horn function. Moreover, from the limited record before us, it appears that the quality inspector position likewise does not require performance of the horn function.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">AHP asserts that Beery is restricted from all twisting (despite the conflicting evidence from the three notes of Dr. Rajkotwala) and that it does not have any available jobs that require no twisting. But AHP does not provide adequate evidence to conclusively establish these assertions so as to remove the issue from the province of the jury. In the record thus far provided, AHP officials have not analyzed the duties of each position to explain how the duties of each job require repetitive twisting; they rely instead on general statements such as \u201cRepeated, repetitive\u2014 in a manufacturing environment, it\u2019s all repetitive work.\u201d (Moreover, the joint appendix does not contain any deposition testimony, affidavit, or company document purporting to list the specific positions that were available, if any, in the Marion warehouse at the time of Beery\u2019s termination.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Perhaps most significant, AHP has not conclusively rebutted Beery\u2019s evidence that shortly before his termination, he was able to perform the assistant-operator job\u2014a job that AHP alleges involves side-to-side twisting inconsistent with Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s restriction\u2014with no reported difficulty or injury. It is undisputed that Beery injured himself while working on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>house shortly before his transfer to the training pants line and had to take two weeks off from his work at AHP as a consequence. AHP\u2019s own appellate brief concedes that when Beery returned to work after this absence, he worked with no apparent problem as an assistant operator\u2014a position that AHP\u2019s own production manager, William Yates, described as \u201cthe most physical job position in the production department....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">AHP has not met its burden of identifying evidence that <em>compels </em>(rather than merely permits) the conclusions that (1) the assistant operator position required such side-to-side twisting as to be inconsistent with Beery\u2019s restriction, (2) the quality inspector position required such side-to-side twisting as to be inconsistent with Beery\u2019s restriction, (3) the position of packer on a diaper-production line required such side-to-side twisting as to be inconsistent with Beery\u2019s restriction, or (4) if one of those positions or other positions in the warehouse did <em>not </em>require such side-to-side twisting, no such positions were in fact available at the time of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Moreover, the first of Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s notes, which Beery presented on February 10, 2005, did not state that Beery\u2019s back problem would indefinitely prevent him from working the horn or doing anything else that might require twisting. The first note said only, \u201cDue to mechanical back problems Patient cannot twist repeatedly from right to left <em>2-10-05 thru 3-11-05.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The second of Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s notes, which stated \u201cNo twisting from side to side,\u201d did not contain an explicit time limitation on the restriction. But here the context is important. Beery submitted Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s second note on February 17 or 18 in connection with his application for <em>short-term, </em>disability benefits. A jury could reasonably conclude that the doctor intended to prohibit side-to-side twisting only for the brief duration of the requested benefits, not to opine about Beery\u2019s functional capacity in the future after the benefits expired. Similarly, Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s Attending Physician Statement, which stated \u201cPt unable to do repeated work moving from side to side twisting,\u201d was submitted in support of Beery\u2019s application for FMLA leave. A jury could reasonably find that Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s opinion covered only the period of the requested leave, not some time in the near future when that leave would expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Viewing the substance and context of Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s three documents, a jury could reasonably find that AHP was mistaken in its belief that Beery\u2019s back condition would indefinitely prevent him from doing any available jobs at the warehouse. Accordingly, AHP is not entitled to summary judgment on Beery\u2019s federal and state statutory claims for disability discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Conversely, Dr. Rajkotwala\u2019s unequivocal written restriction on side-to-side twisting, combined with evidence that such twisting was required at least for packers on the diaper lines and perhaps for other positions, could allow a reasonable jury to find that AHP was correct in its belief that Beery was unable to perform any of the positions available at the time of his termination. Accordingly, Beery was not entitled to summary judgment on his federal and state statutory claims for disability discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Finally, neither party was entitled to summary judgment on Beery\u2019s Ohio common-law claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">In Ohio, the four elements of this tort are: (1) a clear public policy existed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>was manifested in a federal or state constitution, statute, or administrative regulation (the \u201cclarity\u201d element); (2) dismissing an employee under the circumstances would violate that public policy (the \u201cjeopardy\u201d element); (3) the plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct (or in this case, a condition) related to the public policy (the \u201ccausation\u201d element); and (4) the employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the \u201coverriding justification\u201d element). <em>White v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 416, 837 N.E.2d 1275, 1278 (2005) (citing <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc., </em>78 Ohio St.3d 134, 677 N.E.2d 308, 321 (1997)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>app. not allowed, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1475, 842 N.E.2d 1054 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">For the same reasons discussed above with regard to Beery\u2019s statutory claims, Beery has shown that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the causation and overriding justification elements of this common-law tort.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Godfredson v. Hess &amp; Clark, Inc., </em>173 F.3d 365, 375 (6th Cir.1999) (Ohio common-law claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy against age discrimination failed for same reason that ADEA claim failed, i.e., the employee\u2019s failure to show a genuine issue as to whether the employer\u2019s stated reason for his discharge was pretextual; \u201cGodfredson acknowledges in his appellate brief that the success of his public policy claim is contingent upon the success of his ADEA claim.\u201d); <em>Sosby v.

On remand, the district court is instructed to expressly rule on Beery\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint.

The lead opinion believes that Beery has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>produced direct evidence that AHP regarded him as disabled. I, however, do not think Beery has presented direct evidence to establish his claim of unlawful employment discrimination, and instead would apply the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting approach. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Direct evidence is evidence that \u201cdoes not require the fact finder to draw any inferences to reach th[e] conclusion\u201d that \u201cunlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Amini v. Oberlin College, </em>440 F.3d 350, 359 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cSuch evidence would take the form, for example, of an employer telling an employee, \u2018I fired you because you are disabled.\u2019\u201d <em>Smith v. Chrysler Corp., </em>155 F.3d 799, 805 (6th Cir.1998). Our circuit has acknowledged that \u201crarely will there be direct evidence from the lips of the defendant proclaiming his or her [discriminatory] animus,\u201d <em>see Robinson v. Runyon, </em>149 F.3d 507, 513 (6th Cir.1998), and I would find that Beery has not presented such evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s summary of the facts acknowledges that AHP \u201cconcluded that the [doctor-imposed] prohibition on side-to-side twisting meant that Beery was unable to perform ... <em>any and all </em>positions that were available in the plant.\u201d Op. at 131. AHP thus \u201ctold [Beery] that [it] had no work for him consistent with <em>his treating physician\u2019s stated restrictions </em>and, therefore, was terminating his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Based on these facts, the lead opinion concludes that \u201cBeery\u2019s proffered evidence is as direct as possible: he was told in no uncertain terms that he was being discharged because AHP could not accommodate his condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at If 19. I do not agree with this conclusion. As recognized in the lead opinion\u2019s own rendition of the facts, AHP did not tell Beery that he was being discharged because AHP could not accommodate his <em>physical condition </em>but, rather, because AHP could not accommodate his <em>doctor-imposed work restrictions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The lead opinion\u2019s analysis erroneously conflates AHP\u2019s perception of the severity of Beery\u2019s physical impairment with AHP\u2019s interpretation of the extent of Beery\u2019s doctor-imposed work restrictions. The former involves AHP\u2019s assessment of Beery\u2019s physical condition, and the latter involves AHP\u2019s assessment of Dr. Raj\u2019s (i.e., Beery\u2019s doctor\u2019s) statements. Beery has not presented any of the former evidence, by alleging, for example, that an AHP decision-maker stated, \u201cI am firing you because I think that you are physically unable to perform any available position in our manufacturing plant.\u201d In contrast, Beery has presented only the latter kind of evidence, establishing that an AHP decision-maker \u201ccalled Beery and told him that AHP had no work for him consistent with his treating physician\u2019s stated restrictions.\u201d Op. at 131. Because the law does not prohibit AHP from firing Beery based on the fact that it did not have any available positions he could perform in light of his work restrictions, I would find that this is not a case involving direct evidence of discrimination. A fact-finder must make at least one inference when starting from this evidence\u2014i.e., AHP\u2019s reliance on Beery\u2019s doctor-imposed work restrictions\u2014and arriving at the conclusion that AHP unlawfully perceived Beery as disabled; namely, the fact-finder must infer that in making the termination decision AHP did not rely merely on the doctor\u2019s statements that Beery could not twist from side to side, but that AHP <em>actually perceived </em>that Beery could not twist from side to side (i.e., that he was physically impaired) and that this perceived inability to twist prevented him from performing a broad category of jobs (i.e., substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>limited a major life activity). <em>See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). Because a fact-finder must draw inferences to conclude that \u201cunlawful discrimination was ... a motivating factor in [AHP\u2019s] actions,\u201d <em>Amini, </em>440 F.3d at 359, I find that this case does not involve direct evidence of disability discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Under both Ohio and federal law, it is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee because the employer irrationally or incorrectly regards the employee as disabled. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 4112.02(A), 4112.01(A)(13); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), 12102(2)(C). The policy underlying these laws is furthered when employers remain well informed concerning their employees\u2019 physical and mental impairments, often conveyed through doctors\u2019 diagnoses, notes, and letters. Accordingly, the law generally encourages employers to ask for, rely on, and comply with doctor-imposed medical restrictions. <em>See Blair v. Honda of America Mfg., Inc., </em>No. 14-01-33, 2002 WL 396531 (Ohio Ct. App. March 14, 2002). In the present case, AHP actively sought to comply with the work restrictions imposed by Dr. Raj and even asked Beery to provide additional documentation lessening, or at the very least clarifying, his work restrictions. Beery, however, refused to provide further documentation, and AHP concluded, based on its interpretation of Dr. Raj\u2019s ambiguous work restrictions, that Beery was unable to perform any available positions. The lead opinion concludes that AHP\u2019s attempt to comply with Beery\u2019s doctor-imposed work restrictions amounts to direct evidence of disability discrimination; this conclusion effectively punishes AHP for attempting to comply with Beery\u2019s work restrictions, which is an unfortunate message to send to employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">To be sure, AHP\u2019s proffered reasons for Beery\u2019s termination\u2014i.e., that, in light of its broad, and perhaps erroneous, reading of Dr. Raj\u2019s restrictions, it did not have any positions that Beery could perform\u2014 provides circumstantial evidence that AHP actually perceived Beery to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working. Based upon this and other evidence, I find that Beery has provided enough circumstantial evidence to withstand AHP\u2019s motion for summary judgment and agree with the lead opinion that this case should be remanded for further proceedings. But I simply do not believe that Beery has produced any <em>direct evidence </em>to establish his claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
