By order entered August 28, 2007, we directed defendant to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the rulings he seeks to appeal are not final and appealable orders. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8145(c) (providing that appeal from decision denying revocation or amendment of detention order is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291); <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>396 F.3d 1280, 1281 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal from magistrate judge\u2019s detention order for lack of jurisdiction). Neither defendant nor his counsel has responded to the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">We conclude that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal and it must be dismissed. Defendant\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw. As a preliminary matter, we appoint him for these proceedings under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, and direct the Clerk to forward to him the necessary voucher materials. Because we are dismissing this appeal, however, counsel\u2019s pending motion to withdraw is DENIED as moot. The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
