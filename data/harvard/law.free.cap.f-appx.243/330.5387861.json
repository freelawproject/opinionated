We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">Where, as here, the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s order de novo, we review the decision of the BIA. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>2005), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chen\u2019s testimony was not detailed enough to support a finding of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998) (requiring credible, direct and specific evidence in the record); <em>Cardoza-Fonseca v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1448, 1453 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201capplicant\u2019s testimony will suffice if it is credible, persuasive, and refers to <em>specific </em>facts that give rise to an inference that the applicant has been or has a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on one of the specified grounds\u201d) (quotations omitted) (emphasis in original). Chen\u2019s declaration and testimony provided no specific information about the location, dates, and content of Chen\u2019s anti-government speeches or the posters he created and displayed. Thus, the evidence does not compel us to reach a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Chen failed to show that he was arrested on account of one of the five enumerated grounds necessary for asylum. The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chen was arrested because he assaulted his supervisor is supported by the letter from Chen\u2019s father and Chen\u2019s testimony that he had \u201cpushed\u201d the team leader and was told later by the police that the team leader was \u201cin ditch\u201d and injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Chen\u2019s due process claim concerning the Id\u2019s decision because he failed to raise the issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that due process challenges that are \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d must be exhausted). Chen\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s decision lacks cogency and rationality is not supported by the record. The BIA considered all the evidence and adequately explained its decision which is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Because Chen failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b353-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
