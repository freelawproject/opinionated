The district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for new trial. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In moving for a new trial, plaintiffs claimed the jury instructions were merely abstract statements of law and did not tie sufficiently to the facts of the case and that the court should have used their proposed instructions on proximate cause. Those proposed instructions explained plaintiffs\u2019 burden to prove proximate causation and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">The defendants, NL Industries, has pled affirmatively that the actual proximate causes of the plaintiffs\u2019 lead poisoning, if any, was one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">1. Lead based paint at 600 Dewey Street not connected with NL Industries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">2. The soil at 600 Dewey Street;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">3. Lead sources at multiple other residences;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">4. Lead sources at a day care center;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">5. Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged extensive family histories of mental retardation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">6. Learning disabilities; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">7. Behavioral problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">Just as the plaintiffs have the burden of proving their case by a preponderance of the evidence, in order for you to find any of these things to be a probable cause, NL Industries must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the thing which it argues is a proximate cause is, in fact, a probable cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">The court rejected the proffered instruction at trial and in its denial of a motion for new trial because, among other things, it did not state the law correctly. In addition to appealing the denial of a new trial, plaintiffs appeal the refusal to permit them to tell the jury that the minor children had guardians who had been appointed to protect their interests and oversee any money awarded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-20\">We review challenged jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>Fiber Sys. Int'l Inc. v. Roehrs, </em>470 F.3d 1150, 1158 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cWhere a party argues on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to give a proffered jury instruction, that party must \u2018show as a threshold matter that the proposed instruction correctly stated the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russell v. Plano Bank &amp; Trust, </em>130 F.3d 715, 719 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>FDIC v. Mijalis, </em>15 F.3d 1314, 1318 (5th Cir.1994)). Once that threshold is met, \u201cthe challenger must demonstrate that the charge [given] creates substantial doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations. Second, even if the jury instructions were erroneous, we will not reverse if we determine, based upon the entire record, that the challenged instruction could not have affected the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Green v. Adm\u2019rs of the Tulane Educ. Fund, </em>284 F.3d 642, 659 (5th Cir.2002) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-21\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-22\">The proposed instruction does not properly state the law: It places the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>den on defendants to prove alternative causes in fact, to use those alternate causes to negate proximate causation. The proposed instruction stated, \u201cNL Industries must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the thing which it argues is a proximate cause is, in fact, a probable cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The Mississippi Supreme Court has squarely rejected this proposition and, instead, places the burden on the plaintiff to disprove other possible causes in fact, not on the defendant to establish them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">Where plaintiff in a negligence action has only presented proof that the actual cause was one of a number of possibilities, to enable an inference to be drawn that any particular cause is probable, the other causes must be eliminated. Thus, when the evidence shows that it is just as likely that accident might have occurred from causes other than defendant\u2019s negligence, the inference that his negligence was the proximate cause may not be drawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\"><em>Miss. Valley Gas Co. v. Estate of Walker, </em>725 So.2d 139, 145-46 (Miss.1998) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We reached the same conclusion in the similar context of intervening causes under Texas tort law. In <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. McCain, </em>414 F.2d 369, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969), the plaintiff posited that \u201cthe trial court should have instructed the jury that intervening cause is an \u2018affirmative defense\u2019 to plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. We rejected that argument: \u201c \u2018The theory of new and independent cause is not an affirmative defense; it is but an element to be considered by the jury in determining the existence or non-existence of proximate cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dallas Ry. &amp; Terminal Co. v. Bailey, </em>151 Tex. 359, 250 S.W.2d 379, 383 (1952)). Because plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instruction incorrectly places the burden on defendants to prove alternate causes, it does not properly state the law, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 other complaint\u2014that the jury instructions were too abstract and not tied to the facts at trial\u2014also fails. Though we look to state law to determine the content and substance of jury instructions, their form is a procedural question determined by federal law. <em>Reyes v. Wyeth Labs., </em>498 F.2d 1264, 1289 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Mississippi law requires that instructions incorporate facts from the case is irrelevant, because we must apply federal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Plaintiffs direct us to <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>592 F.2d 1282, 1286 (5th Cir.1979), and <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>876 F.2d 1113, 1119 (5th Cir.1989), to argue that the federal rules require specific instructions that relate the law to the facts of the case. Neither of these cases, however, announces a <em>per se </em>rule to that effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An instruction does not always have to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the facts a plaintiff requests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because there is no <em>per se </em>rule that instructions contain details from the case, and because plaintiffs point to no specific deficiencies in the instructions, there is no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In three paragraphs at the end of their brief, plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in refusing to allow them to tell the jury that the minor children had guardians to oversee any award. Plaintiffs do not cite the standard to review this evidentiary decision, any supporting authorities for their position, or any references to the record. Though they assert that the \u201crecord is replete with instances of Defense counsel attacking the character, the behavior, and/or the parental qualities of the mothers of the minor children,\u201d plaintiffs cite no instances in the record establishing that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Because the plaintiffs offer only a skeletal recitation of an argument \u201cwithout citing supporting authorities or references to the record,\u201d this claim is \u201cconsidered abandoned on appeal. Notice pleading does not suffice for appellate briefs.\u201d <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>779 F.2d 287, 295 (5th Cir.1986) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
