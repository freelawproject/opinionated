On appeal, Erickson challenges the state court\u2019s jurisdiction and jury instructions. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">This appeal involves three cases adjudicated in Florida state court. In the first case, No. 02-287, Erickson was convicted by a jury on December 16, 2003, for failing to register as a sex offender in Hernando County, Florida between September 19, 2001 and February 13, 2002, in violation of the Florida Sexual Predator Act \u00a7\u00a7 775.21(d), 943.0435(2), (9). In the second case, No. 02-1930, Erickson was charged with one count of submission of false voter registration and eight counts of casting a fraudulent vote. Those charges stemmed from Erickson\u2019s voting activities while he was a convicted sex offender whose right to vote had not been restored. He pleaded nolo contendr\u00e9 to and was convicted of all of the charges in the second case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">In the third case, No. 02-1103, Erickson was again charged with violating the FSPA by failing to register as a convicted sex offender in Hernando County, Florida, this time from July 8, 2002 through November 20, 2002. He pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the charge in the third case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">On January 12, 2004, the state court sentenced Erickson to 32.55 months imprisonment for the charges in the second case (the charges related to his voting activities) and 65.85 months imprisonment for the charges in the first and third cases (the charges for failing to register as a sex offender). Pursuant to his plea agreement, Erickson received concurrent sentences. As part of the plea agreement Erickson agreed to waive his right to appeal his conviction in any of the three cases, but he appealed all of them anyway. His three convictions and his sentences were affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion on February 14, 2006. <em>See Erickson v. State, </em>924 So.2d 824 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">After his convictions were affirmed, Erickson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Erickson raised twelve issues, and the district court denied his petition as to all twelve issues. Erickson appealed, and we granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>(A) Whether, in reference to State Case No. 02-287, the district court erred in concluding that the following claims did not raise any federal claim for habeas relief:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">(1) Application of the statute of limitations violated appellant\u2019s due process and speedy trial rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">(2) Florida\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act violates due process for failing to provide a procedure for designating a defendant a sex offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">(3) The jury instructions regarding the Sex Offender Registration Act unconstitutionally expanded the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction in violation of due process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">(B) If the district court erred in concluding that claim A(l) failed to state a federal habeas claim, the parties should address whether the district court additionally erred in concluding that the appellant was procedurally barred from bringing the claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">(C) If the district court erred in concluding that claim A(2) failed to state a federal habeas claim, the parties should address whether the district court additionally erred in concluding that the appellant waived this claim as to State Case No. 02-1130 by virtue of his guilty plea when the state appeals court, notwithstanding the plea, considered and denied the merits of the claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">(D) Whether, as to State Case No. 02-1130, the district court erred in concluding that the appellant\u2019s collateral estoppel claim, stemming from the Double Jeopardy Clause, did not state a claim under federal law; if so, whether the district court erred in alternatively concluding that appellant\u2019s guilty plea waived such claim when the state appeals court, notwithstanding the plea, considered and denied the merits of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Pruitt v. Jones, </em>348 F.3d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.2003). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law ... or resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d A state court\u2019s decision is contrary to clearly established Federal law if the state court: (1) arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law; or (2) decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. <em>Ventura v. Att\u2019y Gen., Fla., </em>419 F.3d 1269, 1280-81 (11th Cir.2005). Additionally, the AEDPA provides: \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Federal habeas relief is available to correct only those injuries resulting from violations of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(a). \u201cThe writ of habeas corpus was not enacted to enforce State-created rights.\u201d <em>Cabberiza v. Moore, </em>217 F.3d 1329, 1333 (11th Cir.2000) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">The first issue in the COA is whether the district court erred in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Erickson\u2019s claim that the application of the statute of limitations violated his due process and speedy trial rights did not raise a federal claim for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). According to the state\u2019s charging information in the first case, Erickson was charged with violating the Florida Sexual Predator Act. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 775.21(5)(d), 943.0435(2), (9). The relevant portion of \u00a7 775.21(5)(d) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">A person who establishes or maintains a residence in [Florida] and who has not been designated as a sexual predator by a [Florida] court ... but who has been designated as a sexual predator, as a sexually violent predator, or by another sexual offender designation in another state or jurisdiction and was, as a result of such designation, subjected to registration or community or public notification, or both, or would be if the person was a resident of that state or jurisdiction ... shall register in the manner provided in [\u00a7 ] 943.0435.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">According to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 943.0435(2), a sexual offender must register with the sheriffs office in the county in which he establishes a permanent residence within 48 hours of establishing that residence. Under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 943.0435(9), \u201ca sexual offender who does not comply with the requirements of this section commits a felony of the third degree.\u201d A felony of the third degree has a statute of limitations of three years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.15(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Erickson contends that his violation of \u00a7 775.21(5)(d) began, at the latest, 48 hours after Florida\u2019s sexual predator law became effective on October 1, 1997. He therefore argues that the three-year statute of limitations expired on October 3, 2000. However, the state court construed the statute as a continuous offense, with the statute of limitations period beginning after the violation was completed. According to Erickson, the state court\u2019s construction of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.21(5)(d) was incorrect because it does not contain the word \u201ccontinuous,\u201d and the errant construction by the court violated (1) his right to due process by expanding the court\u2019s jurisdiction, (2) the ex post fact clause, and (3) his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">However, \u201c[a] state\u2019s interpretation of its own laws or rules provides no basis for federal habeas corpus relief, since no question of a constitutional nature is involved.\u201d <em>McCullough v. Singletary, </em>967 F.2d 530, 535 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cFederal courts entertaining petitions for writs of habeas corpus must follow the state court\u2019s interpretation of a state law absent a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Tucker, </em>93 F.3d 735, 737 (11th Cir.1996). We conclude that Erickson has not met his burden to show that the Florida court\u2019s construction of a Florida statute violated his federal right to due process. Likewise, because the statute of limitations had not expired when he was charged, the state did not violate Erickson\u2019s right to a speedy trial or the United States Constitution\u2019s prohibition of ex post facto laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">The next issue is whether the district court erred in finding that Erickson failed to state a claim for federal habeas relief when he argued that Florida\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) violates due process because it allegedly does not provide a procedure for designating a person as a sex offender. According to Erickson, before a person becomes subject to the Act\u2019s registration requirements, that person must be ordered to register by a Florida court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Erickson is apparently confusing the statute under which he was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>in the first case. He was convicted of violating Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.21(5)(d), which is not part of SORA, but is instead part of the Florida Sexual Predators Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.21. The specific provision of the FSPA under which Erickson was convicted, \u00a7 775.21(5)(d), applies to persons who have been convicted of sex crimes in other states. It requires those persons to register as sex offenders when they establish a permanent residence in Florida. The FSPA then references the procedure set forth in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 943.0435, which is part of SORA. Although the actual registration procedure that Erickson should have followed was set forth in SORA, he is not arguing that the registration procedure was constitutionally defective. Instead, Erickson is arguing that principles of due process require that a Florida court alert him of the need to register as a sex offender before he can be prosecuted for failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">That argument is unpersuasive. The FSPA does not provide for a formal hearing to advise a person who was previously convicted of a sex crime that he needs to register as a sexual offender. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.21(5)(d). Because Erickson was convicted of a sex crime in California before he moved to Florida, he was required by the FSPA to register when he established a permanent residence in Florida. Furthermore, the transcript of his sentence hearing demonstrates that Erickson was advised when he was released from a federal correctional facility in 1999 that he was required to register as a sex offender. At a minimum, that advice put Erickson on notice that he had been designated as a sex offender and needed to register as one. Therefore, the district court correctly determined that Erickson did not state a valid claim for relief under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The next issue is whether the district court erred in finding that Erickson failed to state a federal claim when he argued that the state court\u2019s jury instructions in the first FSPA case expanded the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction in violation of his due process rights. More specifically, Erickson argues that the jury instructions: (1) were incomplete and inaccurate; (2) denied the theory of his defense by (a) not requiring the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the felonies for which he was designated a sex offender and (b) not requiring the jury to determine the specific date when he established a permanent residence in Florida; and (3) denied him his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We have held that errors in state jury instructions are federal constitutional issues only where they render the entire trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Jones v. Dugger, </em>888 F.2d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.1989). Where the claim is merely that a jury instruction was incorrect under state law, federal habeas relief is not available. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 71-72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 481-82, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Erickson has not shown how the state court\u2019s jury instructions rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Erickson cited an excerpt of the jury instruction that was given, and it shows that the court\u2019s instruction did require the jury to find that Erickson committed a qualifying sex offense. In addition, Erickson\u2019s brief concedes (1) that the state submitted evidence of his prior convictions, and (2) that the trial court included Florida\u2019s statutory definition of the phrase \u201cestablishing a residence\u201d within its jury instruction. A jury instruction is not rendered unconstitutional simply because it is not the jury instruction requested by the defendant. Therefore, Er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ickson has not met his burden on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The final issue in the COA is whether the state court lacked jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea in the third case, the one in which he was charged with violating the FSPA for failing to register as a sex offender between July 8, 2002 and November 20, 2002. As we have already noted, the state court found that Erickson\u2019s failure to resister as a sex offender between October 1997 and February 2002 constituted a single, continuous criminal act. Erickson argues that if we accept the state court\u2019s construction of the FSPA as providing for a continuous offense, then we must likewise accept his argument that the state violated the Double Jeopardy Clause and principles of collateral estoppel by bringing a second charge against him for failing to register as a sex offender between July 8, 2002 and November 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">However, as the state court pointed out during Erickson\u2019s sentence hearing, the state did not bring the second FSPA charge against Erickson until after he persisted in his failure to register even after he had been arrested and charged in the first case. Moreover, unlike the first case, in which Erickson was convicted by a jury, Erickson pleaded guilty in the third case. Erickson has never challenged the validity of the plea agreement. As we have noted, a defense based on the Double Jeopardy Clause is waived by guilty plea. <em>Dermota v. United States, </em>895 F.2d 1324 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201c[Defendant] waived his right to raise a double jeopardy objection by pleading guilty to two separate offenses as a result of a plea agreement he entered into freely, voluntarily and accompanied by his attorney.\u201d). Therefore, the district court correctly found that Erickson was not entitled to habeas relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
