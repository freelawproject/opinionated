(SMC) appeals the adverse judgment of the district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which granted the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss SMC\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. After a de novo review, <em>Kforce, Inc. v. Surrex Solutions Corp., </em>436 F.3d 981, 983 (8th Cir.2006), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-27\">In the early 1990s, SMC loaned funds to Public Safety Group, Inc. (PSG). SMC filed a financing statement in 2001 which indicated PSG provided as collateral for the loan, inter alia: \u201cproceeds from any lawsuit due or pending.\u201d PSG employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Tom and Karen Conley. In 1999, PSG sued the Conleys to recover missing PSG funds. In August 2005, judgment entered in favor of PSG against the Conleys for breach of fiduciary duty. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) later seized PSG\u2019s interest in its judgment against the Conleys.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In February 2006, SMC filed an action seeking a judgment under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1) declaring SMC had an interest superior to the IRS in PSG\u2019s judgment against the Conleys. The district court determined SMC had no interest in PSG\u2019s judgment because under Iowa law security interests in commercial tort claims must be described with greater specificity than simply \u201call tort claims.\u201d The district court found the judgment against the Conleys arose from a commercial tort claim\u2014 breach of fiduciary duty through misappropriation of funds as a result of fraudulent expense claims and unauthorized payment of wages. The district court found the reference to \u201cproceeds from any lawsuit due or pending\u201d as collateral for SMC\u2019s loans to PSG in the 2001 financing statement was a description only by type and an insufficient description under Iowa law.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">On appeal, and after SMC\u2019s opening brief and the United States\u2019 response brief were filed, SMC requested permission to file an amended opening brief, arguing, \u201cthere is a material mistake of fact in the body of the original Complaint that was just discovered by [SMC].\u201d SMC asserted 1124 of its complaint erroneously stated PSG reacquired all PSG assets in 2004 after a third-party buyer, Lee\u2019s Security Agency, defaulted on an installment sale contract between PSG and Lee\u2019s. In its motion, SMC stated the complaint should have alleged SMC, not PSG, acquired Lee\u2019s assets, which included PSG\u2019s judgment against the Conleys.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In its amended brief, SMC abandons its claim of a superior interest in PSG\u2019s judgment. SMC argues instead it <em>owned </em>the judgment outright in 2004, making the language of its 2001 financing statement irrelevant, since its security interest was extinguished after it acquired ownership of the judgment. SMC asserts it failed to argue it owned the judgment in the district court because of the error in H 24 of its complaint but suggests the district court should have overcome the error because other documents attached as exhibits to the complaint showed SMC owned the judgment. The United States counters the exhibits to the complaint show H24 was not \u201cdemonstrably wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">SMC asks us to reverse the district court because, as SMC now alleges, SMC <em>owned </em>PSG\u2019s judgment over thirteen months prior to the filing of the IRS lien on the judgment, and the IRS had no authority to place a lien on SMC property. Despite claiming to have owned the judgment in 2004, SMC\u2019s newly minted theory of the case was not raised in SMC\u2019s complaint, in any other paper filed in the district court, or in its opening brief to this court. Finding no extraordinary circumstances justify SMC\u2019s failure to present its ownership argument below, we decline to consider it on appeal. <em>See Richardson v. Sugg, </em>448 F.3d 1046, 1059 (8th Cir.2006) (noting we do \u201cnot consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal\u201d) (quoting <em>Alexander v. Pathfinder, Inc., </em>189 F.3d 735, 742 (8th Cir.1999)); <em>see, e.g., Snider v. United States, </em>468 F.3d 500, 512 (8th Cir.2006) (declining \u201cto broadly review issues not raised and ruled upon by the district court\u201d); <em>Oti Kaga, Inc. v. S.D. Hous. Dev. Auth., </em>342 F.3d 871, 879 (8th Cir.2003) (affirming district court\u2019s judgment after finding position argued to district court abandoned in favor of a new argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>raised for the first time on appeal where no extraordinary circumstances present).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-18\">.
