Akpojiyovwi\u2019s claim for relief is based on her assertion that she is certain that her adolescent daughters will be subjected to female circumcision, or Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), if she is deported and returns with them to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">The BIA found Akpojiyovwi\u2019s claim for asylum to be time-barred, and it rejected her claims that an exception to the time-bar was warranted. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), this court does not have jurisdiction to review Akpojiyovwi\u2019s assertion that her asylum claim was not time-barred. <em>See Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 527 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Khan v. Gonzales, </em>172 Fed.Appx. 575, 576 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Akpojiyovwi\u2019s claim for asylum is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-15\">Akpojiyovwi also challenges the denial of her claims for the withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. She asserts that the likelihood that her daughters will be subject to FGM is relevant to her own claim for asylum under a theory of \u201cderivative persecution.\u201d Alternatively, she argues that she is entitled to \u201cderivative asylum\u201d because her children will be \u201cconstructively removed\u201d if she is denied relief. Even if this court were to conclude that Akpojiyovwi is entitled to claim relief from the order of deportation based on the threat of persecution to her daughters, substantial evidence supports the determination that Akpojiyovwi failed to show the requisite likelihood that her daughters will be subject to FGM upon their return to Nigeria. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1); Convention Against Torture, article 3. Accordingly, Akpojiyovwi\u2019s petition for review as to these claims is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-16\">The appellate brief is not in compliance with Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9)(A), which requires citation to the record. We caution Akpojiyovwi\u2019s counsel that failure to comply with this court\u2019s rules of appellate procedure could result in the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b36-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
