Nov. 17, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A29 757 760 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 9, 2000). He also challenges a June 29, 2004 order of the BIA denying his motion to reopen. <em>In re Igor Tintor, </em>No. A29 757 760 (B.I.A. June 29, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">A. <em>The BIA\u2019s October 2002 Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review legal issues, and the application of law to fact, <em>de novo. See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). However, we review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">In this case, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude that Tintor demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion or ethnic and religious background. <em>As </em>the IJ noted, Tintor provided very little detail regarding the nature or extent of his political activities in 1988 and 1989, and no detail regarding his arrest, despite repeated probing from his attorney. Because his testimony was insufficient to allow the IJ to determine whether he experienced harm on account of his political opinion, rising to the level of persecution, the IJ properly found the testimony too vague to sustain Tintor\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Cf. Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 151-52 (2d Cir.2003). To the extent he claimed to fear persecution based on his mixed ethnic and religious background, the IJ reasonably noted that he failed to provide any detail regarding harm that he or his parents had experienced on account of his parents\u2019 mixed marriage. Moreover, in light of these testimonial deficiencies, the IJ reasonably faulted Tintor for his failure to provide any corroboration for his claims, particularly when he was granted a continuance for the express purpose of producing witnesses and failed to do so. <em>Cf. Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 289-90 (2d Cir.2000). Accordingly, the IJ reasonably found that Tintor failed to meet his burden or proof for asylum, withholding, or CAT relief, on any factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>B. <em>The BIA\u2019s June 2004 Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Tintor\u2019s motion as untimely, when it was filed over 19 months after the BIA upheld the denial of relief. With certain limited exceptions not relevant here, the regulations require that a motion to reopen be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because the government opposed Tintor\u2019s motion, the untimely filing was a sufficient reason for the BIA to deny the motion. <em>See Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 255-56 (BIA 2002) (noting five independent conditions that must be met in order for the BIA to grant a motion to reopen filed to allow the alien to pursue an adjustment application). The broad challenges Tintor raises to the BIA\u2019s decision in his brief to this Court fail to persuade us that the BIA abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">We have considered all of Tintor\u2019s other arguments raised in his petition for review and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-11\">. Tintor does not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for cancellation of removal in his brief; accordingly, we find that he has waived this claim. <em>See Yueqing Zhang </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
