We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s physical presence determination for substantial evidence, <em>Vera-Villegas v. INS, </em>330 F.3d 1222, 1230 (9th Cir.2003), and review claims of due process violations de novo, <em>see Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the Ochoas\u2019 physical presence stopped accruing on the date they were served Orders to Show Cause and that they failed to establish the requisite seven years of continuous physical presence in the United States prior to that date. <em>See Ram, </em>243 F.3d at 516 (holding that applications for suspension of deportation pending after the enactment of IIRIRA were subject to the stop-time provisions of that Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">The Ochoas\u2019 case was not eligible for administrative closure and \u201cre-papering\u201d because the government opposed closure. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.16 (2006) (the Attorney General has sole discretion over the termination of deportation proceedings for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>purposes of re-papering); <em>see also Matter of Gutierrez-Lopez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 479, 480 (BIA 1996) (\u201cA case may not be administratively closed if opposed by either of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">We are not persuaded by the Ochoas\u2019 contention that the discretion vested in the Attorney General over repapering decisions violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b373-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
