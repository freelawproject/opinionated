Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On appeal, he contends that his sentence is unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-25\">At Price\u2019s original sentence, which took place prior to the decision in <em>Booker, </em>the district court announced two sentences. The first sentence of 151 months was calculated under the mandatory Guidelines scheme. A second sentence, 120 months, which was the statutory minimum, was announced in the event the Supreme Court declared the sentencing guidelines unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-26\">At re-sentencing, the district court, without objection, adopted the original findings and calculations of the probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>officer, resulting in a Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months in prison. The Government argued for a variance sentence above the Guidelines range, proffering new evidence that Price had convinced another inmate (Jimmie Troutman) to commit perjury at Price\u2019s co-defendant\u2019s (Dexter Tyson) trial in order to convict Tyson and exculpate Price\u2019s common law wife, another co-defendant (Sagrario Estevez).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The parties agreed that Troutman had written a letter in which he stated that a \u201cNY nigga\u201d who had a \u201cbeef with his rap buddy, which was his cousin\u201d gave Trout-man information in order to \u201c[t]he play was for me to get on there case, against the cousin, and in return free the wife.\u201d While Troutman\u2019s letter did not directly refer to Price or Tyson, it is undisputed that Troutman testified at Tyson\u2019s trial, that Troutman and Price were housed together in prison, that Price was from New York, that the charges against Sagrario were dismissed, and that Price and Tyson were cousins.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Over Price\u2019s objection, the district court found that Troutman\u2019s letter presented \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence that Price had suborned perjury and imposed a sentence of 168 months in prison. The court noted that, were it not for the additional conduct of suborning Troutman\u2019s perjury, the court would have sentenced Price to 120 months based on his relative lack of culpability, the lack of violence, and the lack of any significant criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Price\u2019s sentence, which was within the correctly calculated guideline range, is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). We review the sentence for \u201creasonableness\u201d. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">Price alleges that his sentence was unreasonable for several reasons. First, he contends that there was insufficient evidence for the court to find that Price suborned Troutman\u2019s perjury. However, since the finding did not support either the Guideline calculation or a variance, Price\u2019s sentence was not enhanced based on the district court\u2019s finding. Thus, any error was harmless. In any event, we find that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Price convinced Troutman to perjure himself was not clearly erroneous, given Trout-man\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">Second, Price states that the district court improperly attempted to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence. <em>Id. </em>(holding that reasonableness is the <em>appellate </em>standard of review, while the district court must instead impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007)). However, a review of the sentencing transcript shows that the district court properly considered the Guidelines and the statutory factors in crafting the sentence. There is no indication in the record, aside from the court\u2019s isolated statement that the sentence was \u201creasonable,\u201d to support Price\u2019s argument that the court applied the wrong standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">Finally, Price contends that the district court should have started with a sentence of 120 months before considering the new evidence of obstruction of justice. This is the sentence that the court stated it would have imposed under the advisory Guidelines scheme in the absence of the new evidence. However, the reasonableness of such a downward variance, which is assumed by Price, is not before us at this time. Moreover, even assuming that a 120-month sentence would have been reasonable based on the facts known at Price\u2019s first sentencing, we would still be free to find that Price\u2019s 168-month sentence was reasonable, even in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>of the new evidence. <em>See United States v. Begay, 470 F.3d 964, 975 </em>(10th <em>Cir.2006) </em>(holding that \u201c[i]n any given case there could be a range of reasonable sentences that includes sentences both within and outside the Guideline range\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 22, 2007) (No. 06-11543).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Thus, Price\u2019s argument that his sentence was enhanced based on the finding that he suborned perjury is not quite accurate and, in any event, is not the focus of our review. Instead, we presume that Price\u2019s Guideline sentence is reasonable. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553 factors, including Price\u2019s background and his relative lack of culpability, as well as his subsequent dealings with Troutman, and determined that a sentence within the Guidelines was appropriate. Neither Price nor the record suggest any information so compelling as to rebut the presumption that a sentence within the properly calculated Guideline range is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Accordingly, we find that Price\u2019s sentence, which was well under the statutory maximum and in the middle of the properly calculated Guideline range, was reasonable. Thus, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
