The BAP affirmed an order (\u201cSanctions Order\u201d) from the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada (\u201cbankruptcy court\u201d), which struck Haugen\u2019s prior filings seeking to reopen her bankruptcy case and imposed a sanction of $100 in accordance with the court\u2019s April 20, 1995 order limiting Haugen\u2019s filings (\u201cpre-filing order\u201d). Haugen contends that the bankruptcy court erred in refusing to reopen her case, enforce a 1994 order, and review certain state court records. Haugen also contends that the court erred in imposing the sanction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-23\">A. Reopening of the Bankruptcy Case, Enforcement of the August 10, 1994 Order, and Review of the State Court Records</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">Under the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, an appeal must be initiated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the filing of a notice of appeal with the clerk. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001. The notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of the issuance of the order being appealed. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In this case, Haugen did not file a notice of appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s September 27, 2005 order, which denied her request to reopen the case and to enforce the bankruptcy court\u2019s August 10, 1994 order. She also did not file a notice of appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s October 7, 2005 order, which denied her request to review the state court records.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The notice of appeal in this case applies only to the Sanctions Order of November 2005. <em>In re Haugen, </em>No. 94-20613 (Bankr.D.Nev. Nov. 15, 2005) (Notice of Appeal). This notice of appeal would be untimely if construed to include the September 27 and October 7 orders. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review these issues. <em>Anderson v. Mouradick (In re Mouradick), </em>13 F.3d 326, 327 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cThe provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 8002 are jurisdictional; the untimely filing of a notice of appeal deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">B. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The pre-filing order complied with the factors outlined in <em>De Long v. Hennessey, </em>912 F.2d 1144, 1147-48 (9th Cir.1990). Haugen received notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond to the estate trustee\u2019s request for a limitation on her filings. She filed a motion opposing the request, and a hearing was held on the matter prior to the court\u2019s issuance of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Furthermore, Haugen\u2019s history of numerous filings is evident from a review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s docket, which shows the frequency of her motions and the court\u2019s denial of or decision to strike almost all of them. The bankruptcy court also made \u201csubstantive findings\u201d regarding the frivolousness of Haugen\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>at 1148. The bankruptcy court found \u201cthat [Haugen] ha[d] filed numerous motions, many of which have been frivolous and have contained \u2018nonsense.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Finally, the pre-filing order was tailored to fit Haugen\u2019s \u201cspecific vice,\u201d <em>id., </em>because it prohibited no more action than what was necessary to limit Haugen\u2019s frivolous filings. The order did not apply to the submission of appeals and did not limit her filing of meritorious claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Before the bankruptcy court imposed the $100 sanction, it warned Haugen of her \u201cpattern of violating rules and orders known and understood by [her].\u201d However, Haugen ignored the warning and sought to file another document without obtaining court approval. By imposing the sanction in response, the bankruptcy court exercised its power to regulate Haugen\u2019s activity in accordance with the prefiling order. In doing so, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b311-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
