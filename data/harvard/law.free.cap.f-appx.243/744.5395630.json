The district court dismissed the Willners\u2019 complaint, holding that it did not have jurisdiction as a result of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In 1989 the Willners acquired title to approximately eleven acres along the Potomac River in Fairfax County, Virginia. In 2002 the Willners\u2019 neighbor, Eugene Leggett, brought an ejectment action pursuant to Va.Code \u00a7 8.01-236 in the Fairfax County Circuit Court <em>(Fairfax </em>I), alleging that he had acquired an ownership interest in a portion of the Willners\u2019 property through adverse possession. The state court determined that Leggett had satisfied the elements of adverse possession and ordered title of the disputed land transferred to Leggett. John T. Frey, the Clerk of the Fairfax County Circuit Court, recorded the court\u2019s final order in the county\u2019s land records. The Willners\u2019 petition for appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Willners then filed a civil suit in Fairfax County Circuit Court against the Commonwealth of Virginia <em>(Fairfax II). </em>The complaint alleged that the Commonwealth took their property for a private use and without compensation and that the taking deprived them of due process of law, in violation of Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Virginia Constitution. The complaint also stated that the Willners \u201creserve the right to all claims over which subject matter presently lies, or which may later become ripe, in the courts of the United States.\u201d J.A. 9. The Fairfax County Circuit Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, holding that Virginia\u2019s adverse possession law did not violate the Virginia Constitution. The court refused \u201cto comment on any federal implications.\u201d J.A. 48c.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The Willners then moved to suspend or vacate the state court judgment in <em>Fairfax II </em>while they pursued their federal takings and due process claims in federal court, or in the alternative, for leave to amend their complaint to include federal claims. The Fairfax County Circuit Court denied the motion. The Willners appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Two days before filing the notice of appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court, the Willners filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against John Frey, the Fairfax County Circuit Clerk. The Willners sought (1) a declaration that the disputed property was taken by Frey, acting in his official capacity, in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States; (2) a declaration that Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-236, as applied to the Willners, violated their right to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) an injunction directing Frey to remove the final order in <em>Fairfax I </em>from the land records of Fairfax County.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">The district court dismissed the Winners\u2019 complaint, holding that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevented the court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction. It held in the alternative that the Willners\u2019 claim for relief was barred by the Commonwealth of Virginia\u2019s sovereign immunity and by Frey\u2019s derivative absolute judicial immunity. The Willners filed a timely appeal, and we review the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo, <em>see Davani v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>434 F.3d 712, 715 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u201cprevents \u2018a party losing in state court ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henrichs v. Valley View Dev., </em>474 F.3d 609, 611 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-06, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994)).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District courts cannot review final state court judgments because Congress has vested appellate jurisdiction over state court decisions with the United States Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a). Thus, a party seeking review of a state court decision must first appeal to the highest court of the state and then seek a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court. The <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine prevents losers in state court from bypassing this appeal process by seeking review in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The Supreme Court has recently narrowed the scope of the doctrine, holding that it applies only when the following conditions are met: (1) the federal court plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff complains of \u201cinjuries caused by state-court judgments;\u201d (3) the state court judgment became final before the proceedings in federal court commenced; and (4) the federal plaintiff \u201cinvit[es] district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>see also Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006) (emphasizing the \u201cnarrowness\u201d of the doctrine). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not apply when the plaintiff alleges a constitutional violation independent of the injury caused by the state court judgment. <em>Davani, </em>434 F.3d at 718-19; <em>Davison v. Gov\u2019t of Puerto Rico, </em>471 F.3d 220, 222 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The district court correctly concluded that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>bars jurisdiction in this case. First, the plaintiffs (the Willners) lost in the <em>Fairfax I </em>state court proceeding. Second, the alleged injury, the unconstitutional taking of their property, was caused by the <em>Fairfax I </em>judgment. <em>See </em>J.A. 33 (alleging that \u201ctitle to the [Willners\u2019 property] has been coercively transferred by the State from the Willners to the Leggetts not for a public use\u201d). Third, the <em>Fairfax I </em>decision became final before the proceedings were commenced in district court. Finally, the Willners\u2019 complaint in federal court would require \u201creexamination of the Fairfax County Circuit Court\u2019s application of the statute [Va.Code \u00a7 8.01-236] in <em>Fairfax I.\u201d </em>J.A. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The Willners urge us to construe their federal complaint as raising an independent claim that would not be barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman. </em>They assert that then-claim is \u201cbased on a violation of their constitutional rights by Frey and the consequence of the state court judgment\u2014not the state court judgment itself.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 13. The Willners argue that their \u201ccomplaint cannot reasonably be construed as inviting the district court to reject the state court judgment\u201d because the state court did not rule on the issue raised in district court. <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">These arguments are without merit. \u201c[A] federal plaintiff cannot escape the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>bar simply by relying on a legal theory not raised in state court.\u201d <em>Hoblock v. Albany County Bd. of Elections, </em>422 F.3d 77, 87 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Davani, </em>434 F.3d at 719 (stating that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>applies \u201ceven if the state-court loser did not argue to the state court the basis of recovery that he asserts in the federal district court\u201d). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>addition to direct challenges to state court judgments, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevents plaintiffs from raising issues in federal court that are so \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court judgment that they would require the district court to review the state court\u2019s ruling. <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). As this court recently explained, the key inquiry is not whether the state court ruled on the precise issue raised in federal court, but whether the \u201cstate-court loser who files suit in federal court seeks redress for an injury caused by the state-court decision itself.\u201d <em>Davani, </em>434 F.3d at 718. Here, the Willners state that they were injured because the <em>Fairfax I </em>court applied Virginia\u2019s statute on adverse possession in a way that resulted in an unconstitutional taking of their property. Indeed, the relief requested, an injunction ordering Frey to remove the state court\u2019s final order from the county\u2019s land records, leaves little doubt that the Willners want the district court to reverse the state court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The Willners\u2019 argument that the injury was caused by Frey, not the state court, is also meritless. \u201c[I]f a third party\u2019s actions are the product of a state court judgment, then a plaintiffs challenge to those actions are in fact a challenge to the judgment itself.\u201d <em>McCormick v. Braverman, </em>451 F.3d 382, 394 (6th Cir.2006). The state court\u2019s issuance of the final order in <em>Fairfax I </em>triggered Frey\u2019s duty to enter that order in the county\u2019s land records. The Willners thus complain of an injury caused by the state court. <em>See also McKithen v. Brown, </em>481 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] federal suit complains of injury from a state-court judgment, even if it appears to complain only of a third party\u2019s actions, when the third party\u2019s actions are produced by a state-court judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In sum, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Willners\u2019 claim that the state court\u2019s judgment violated their constitutional rights. Accordingly, we do not consider the district court\u2019s alternate holdings that the Willners\u2019 claim was barred by the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereign immunity and by Frey\u2019s derivative absolute judicial immunity. The district court\u2019s order dismissing the Willners\u2019 federal complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-5\"> The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is named after two Supreme Court cases, <em>Rooker v.
