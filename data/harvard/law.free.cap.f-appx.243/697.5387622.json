The procedural history of this case and the details of appellant\u2019s claims are well-known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion, and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Thompson alleged in his complaint that he was barred from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting based on his religious beliefs. He alleged that appellees\u2019 actions violated his constitutional rights as well as federal and state statutes. The District Court granted appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and Thompson filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We have jurisdiction under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>Gallo v. City of Philadelphia, </em>161 F.3d 217, 221 (3d Cir.1998). A grant of summary judgment will be affirmed if our review reveals that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review the facts in a light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered. <em>See Coolspring Stone Supply, Inc. v. American States Life Ins. Co., </em>10 F.3d 144,146 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Thompson argues on appeal that the District Court failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. However, he does not specify any accommodation he required which was denied. In the District Court he asked the District Court to stop \u201crushing the proceedings, raising unrelated, irrelevant or confusing issues to distract me\u201d as well as \u201cdenying oral argument or telephone conference.\u201d The docket reflects that the District Court granted Thompson several extensions of time. Thompson has not explained why he was entitled to oral argument; his voluminous filings demonstrate that he was able to communicate with the Court through his written pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">Thompson argues that the appellees are not entitled to immunity under the New Jersey Charitable Immunity Act. However, in its November 14, 2005, letter order, the District Court noted that Charitable Immunity Act only applies to claims of negligence and that Thompson had not raised any negligence claims. The District Court concluded that the Charitable Immunity Act was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">Thompson contends that the appellees were acting as agents of the state when they violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. We agree with the District Court that the appellees are not state actors. <em>See, e.g., Leshko v. Servis, </em>423 F.3d 337, 341 (3d Cir.2005) (regulation and receipt of government funds, without more, does not constitute state action). Thus, Thompson\u2019s claims arising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, \u00a7 1983, and \u00a7 1985 fail. We further agree with the District Court that appellees were entitled to summary judgment on Thompson\u2019s claims arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">Thompson argues that appellees violated his rights under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. However, the District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Thompson\u2019s New Jersey state law claims. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction or in denying Thompson\u2019s motion to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Finally, we address Thompson\u2019s arguments that District Court Judge Pisano and Magistrate Judge Arleo should have recused themselves. A litigant\u2019s displeasure with the District Court\u2019s legal rulings is not an adequate basis for recusal. <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2000). Thompson argues that his filing a lawsuit against Judges Pisano and Arleo is a ground for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">This Court has already addressed this issue in a prior appeal in this case. In <em>Thompson v. Eva\u2019s Village, </em>C.A. No. 05-4618, we thoroughly addressed Thompson\u2019s allegations and informed him that his lawsuit against the Judges did not provide a basis for recusal. Thompson\u2019s unfounded accusations against the District Court Judges and their staff are inappropriate. \u201cLitigants are understandably disappointed when they do not prevail in court, but that does not give them the license to attack the integrity of the judiciary. Such abusive conduct will not be tolerated, not even from a pro se litigant.\u201d <em>In re Mann, </em>229 F.3d 657, 659 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Thompson\u2019s motion for attorneys fees and costs is denied. Thompson is neither an attorney nor the prevailing party. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). Thompson\u2019s motions to strike appellee Greater Paterson Area\u2019s brief and for sanctions are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
