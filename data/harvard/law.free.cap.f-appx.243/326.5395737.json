She petitions on their behalf for review of a final order issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. We deny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">The BIA ruled that Karakhanyan\u2019s claim\u2014that she was detained and beaten by military authorities because she would not divulge the whereabouts of her son (who for religious reasons had fled Armenia rather than face military conscription)\u2014does not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground. We agree. Generally, \u201cpunishment for evasion of military duty ... does not constitute persecution.\u201d <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1187 (9th Cir.2006). Moreover, there is no evidence the mother here was singled out for punishment because of her son\u2019s religion. <em>See id. </em>It is disturbing, of course, that a mother would be detained and beaten for her son\u2019s transgressions. Nonetheless, for purposes of establishing eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, Karakhanyan was required to demonstrate that any persecution, past or future, is \u201con account\u201d of one or more protected grounds. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 479-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). She failed to do so and thus she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>and her husband are not eligible for the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b349-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
