O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">Ezekiel P. Rhoten, appearing <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-23\">On March 2, 2006, Rhoten filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 complaint against several Kansas prison officials alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment and Kansas law. Specifically, he alleged Correctional Officer Brunson, while conducting a pat-down search of his person, \u201cslammed [him] against the wall[,] squeezed [his] nipples real hard [,] squeezed [his] buttocks, and pulled on [his] testicles real hard causing [him] a great deal of discomfort and pain.\u201d (R. Doc. 1 at 7.) He further alleged that when he subsequently sought a pass to seek medical treatment for his pain, Brunson refused to give him one. Rhoten filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>several prison grievances based on Brunson\u2019s conduct. Prison officials investigated the incident. As part of that investigation, Brunson issued a statement. He said he conducted a pat-down search of Rhoten\u2019s person based on Rhoten\u2019s behavior within the unit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Brunson started to conduct the pat-down search at Rhoten\u2019s arm pits, Rhoten turned to face Brunson and told him not to touch him in that manner. Brunson denied touching'squeezing Rho-ten\u2019s buttocks or testicles. Prison authorities found Brunson credible and denied Rhoten relief. They also found Brunson did not deny Rhoten medical treatment but rather advised him to report to sick call, which is the appropriate procedure for non-medical emergencies. Based on the record, Rhoten was seen by a prison doctor two hours after seeking medical treatment. The doctor found no evidence of injury to Rhoten\u2019s genitalia and public area and Rhoten\u2019s groin and scrotum exam was normal. However, because Rhoten complained of pain to the right groin and scrotum, the doctor prescribed Tylenol. The district court dismissed Rhoten\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. It declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construing them, and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Perkins v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999). Dismissal is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an opportunity to amend. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Ex<em>um v. United States Olympic Comm., </em>389 F.3d 1130, 1138 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201c[T]he unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 5, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). To determine whether a prison official\u2019s use of force was \u201cunnecessary and wanton,\u201d we ask \u201cwhether [the] force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995. We consider \u201cthe need for [the use of] force, the relationship between that need and the amount of force used, the threat reasonably perceived by the responsible officials, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 112 S.Ct. 995 (quotations omitted). Although the extent of the inmate\u2019s injury is also relevant, an inmate need not show a \u201csignificant injury\u201d or a certain level or type of injury to state a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 9, 112 S.Ct. 995; <em>see United States v. LaVallee, </em>439 F.3d 670, 688 (10th Cir.2006). However, not \u201cevery malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 9, 112 S.Ct. 995. De minimis uses of physical force are excluded from the cruel and unusual punishment inquiry unless \u201crepugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995; <em>Northington v. Jackson, </em>973 F.2d 1518, 1524 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Here, even accepting Rhoten\u2019s allegations as true, we agree with the district court that Brunson\u2019s use of force does not state an Eighth Amendment violation. Rather, it was de minimis. <em>Norton v. The City of Marietta, </em>432 F.3d 1145, 1156 (10th Cir.2005) (grabbing and twisting of inmate\u2019s neck was not sufficiently objectively harmful enough to establish an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim); <em>Reed v. Smith, </em>No. 97-6341, 1999 WL 345492, at *4 (10th Cir. June 1, 1999) (unpublished) (inmate\u2019s allegations that prison officials grabbed him, tried to ram him into a wall and dragged him while walking him through the prison were insufficient to state a Eighth Amendment excessive force claim).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, although not dispositive, the medical evidence shows Brunson\u2019s use of force did not result in injury, further supporting our conclusion it was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Rhoten\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim based on Brunson\u2019s refusal to give Rhoten a pass to seek medical treatment also fails. Rhoten was not denied medical treatment; in fact, he was seen by a doctor within two hours of seeking treatment. Nor was his pain sufficiently serious. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (holding the Eighth Amendment prohibits \u201cdeliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s <em>serious </em>illness or injury\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the district court correctly dismissed Rhoten\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims, it did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (stating a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if it \u201chas dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Exum, </em>389 F.3d at 1138-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
