He argues that his sentence was unreasonable because this court\u2019s jurisprudence following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has effectively rendered the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory. As Barajas concedes, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-28\">Barajas also asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court placed undue weight on the circumstances of his offense and not his family circumstances. The district court sentenced Ba-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>rajas within a properly calculated advisory guideline range. Such a sentence is given \u201cgreat deference,\u201d and we infer that the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.). Barajas has failed to show that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Finally, Barajas argues that, although he is entitled to the retroactive application of the Sixth Amendment holding in <em>Booker, </em>the remedial portion of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>holding, which made the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, may not be applied in his case without violating the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Constitution. As Barajas concedes, his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598, 599-600 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576-76 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
