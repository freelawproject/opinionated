Sarmiento argues that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based upon a determination that his Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance was a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The district court erred by enhancing Sarmiento\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based upon his prior Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712 (5th Cir.2007). As in <em>Gonzales, </em>the district court\u2019s error is plain, and the sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Sarmiento also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Sarmiento contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Sarmiento properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Accordingly, the conviction is AFFIRMED. The sentence is VACATED and the case REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
