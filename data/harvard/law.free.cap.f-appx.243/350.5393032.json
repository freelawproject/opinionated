We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Luna-Caro\u2019s first motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel because Luna-Caro did not demonstrate prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 899-900.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Luna-Caro\u2019s second motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than two years after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (stating that motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of final order of removal). Luna-Caro also presented insufficient evidence that he was continuously present in the United States from April 9, 1989 to November 24, 1990. <em>See Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850 (9th Cir.2004) (requiring ten years of continuous physical presence to qualify for cancellation of removal as a threshold matter). He therefore did not show prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See INS v. Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 145, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-24\">To the extent Luna-Caro challenges the agency\u2019s hardship determination, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-25\">Luna-Caro\u2019s remaining contentions are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-26\">PETITION FOR R\u00c9VIEW DENIED.
