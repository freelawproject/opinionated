Kirby filed a pro se, in forma pauperis, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 complaint against Lehrer and numerous prison officials, alleging conspiracy, as well as a violation of his constitutional rights concerning his prison classification, his prison unit assignment, various disciplinary proceedings and the punishment that he received, and the denial of adequate medical treatment for a serious condition. Kirby\u2019s notice of appeal served to bring all of his claims against the defendants before this court. <em>See Cates v. Int\u2019l Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp., </em>756 F.2d 1161, 1173 n. 18 (5th Cir.1985). <em>Dismissal of claims as frivolous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">We review the dismissal as frivolous of a \u00a7 1983 complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). To the extent that Kirby challenges the results of disciplinary hearings, he has failed to demonstrate that the decisions resulting from the disciplinary proceedings were reversed or expunged. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648-49, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Kirby\u2019s challenges to his classification status and unit placement are without merit; prison officials exercise sole discretion over inmate classification, and inmates do not have a constitutionally protected interest in housing in certain facilities. <em>See Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996); <em>McCord v. Maggio, </em>910 F.2d 1248, 1250 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Kirby\u2019s allegations of conspiracy are conclusional and are not sufficient to demonstrate a conspiracy. <em>See Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992). Kirby\u2019s challenges to the conduct of various prison officials, with the exception of Lehrer, are insufficient to establish constitutional violations; \u201c[pjersonal involvement is an essential element of a civil rights cause of action.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Steele, </em>709 F.2d 381, 382 (5th Cir.1983). Finally, Kirby asserts that he was denied adequate medical treatment in 2000 because his psychiatric medications were discontinued abruptly without sufficient examination of his medical records and without thorough medical examinations. Kirby\u2019s claims constitute a disagreement with medical treatment rather than a cognizable claim of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Kirby\u2019s claims as frivolous. <em>See Taylor, </em>257 F.3d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">\n<em>Summary judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Kirby asserts that a genuine issue of material fact as to an Eighth Amendment violation exists concerning Lehrer\u2019s discontinuance of Kirby\u2019s psychiatric medications. He argues that the abrupt discontinuance of his medications led to his attempted suicide in 2002. Kirby contends that Lehrer should have known of the adverse effects associated with the sudden discontinuance of such medications. Kirby asserts that based on his prior history of suicide attempts and his outbreak of shingles, Lehrer\u2019s conduct amounted to deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and constituted a violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003). Prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, 501 </em>U.S. 294, 297, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). The facts underlying a claim of deliberate indifference \u201cmust <em>clearly evince </em>the medical need in question and the alleged official dereliction.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Unsuccessful medical treatment, negligence, neglect, and medical malpractice do not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 cause of action, and an inmate\u2019s disagreement with his medical treatment does not establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Varnado, </em>920 F.2d at 321. Likewise, an incorrect diagnosis does not suffice to state a claim for deliberate indifference. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Kirby\u2019s allegations constitute disagreement with Lehrer\u2019s treatment of Kirby\u2019s medical condition, or at most, negligence or medical malpractice, all of which are insufficient to establish a claim of deliberate indifference. <em>See Varnado, </em>920 F.2d at 321. Kirby has not established the existence of a genuine issue for trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Accordingly, Kirby has now shown that the magistrate judge erred by granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Kirby\u2019s challenges to the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motions and discovery requests are without merit. Kirby\u2019s assertion that the magistrate judge did not rule on his motion to appoint counsel is refuted by the record. Kirby\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge failed to rule on his motion for a class action is meritless. Discovery is not a prerequisite to the disposition of a motion for summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Washington v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>901 F.2d 1281, 1285 (5th Cir.1990). Discovery matters are entrusted to the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the district court. <em>Richardson v. Henry, </em>902 F.2d 414, 417 (5th Cir.1990). Kirby has not demonstrate error in the magistrate judge\u2019s rulings on his motions and discovery requests. Kirby challenges the denial of his requests for injunctive relief. The magistrate judge determined that Kirby\u2019s requests for such relief were moot because Kirby is no longer incarcerated at the Robertson Unit and Lehrer is no longer employed by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Injunctive relief is inappropriate when sought to' prevent injury that is speculative at best. <em>See Carter v. Orleans Parish Public Schools, </em>725 F.2d 261, 263 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Accordingly, the judgments of the district court and the magistrate judge are AFFIRMED. Kirby\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b900-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
