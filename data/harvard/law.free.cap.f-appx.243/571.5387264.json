According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Wilson was arrested for assaulting two officers, who were attempting to arrest him, by driving with the officers partially in his car, thereby dragging and injuring them. After the arrest, a firearm was found in the car\u2019s glove compartment. The district court applied a 4-level increase based on the specific offense characteristic of possession of a firearm in connection with another felony, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), but found that, regardless of whether the guideline range reflected the enhancement, in consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the statutory maximum sentence of 120 months was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">On appeal, Wilson argues that the four-level enhancement was improperly applied because: (1) there was no indication that he \u201cwent for his gun\u201d; (2) the firearm was found in the glove compartment several hours after his arrest; and (3) he fled the car on foot without attempting to reach for the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Upon review of the record, PSI, and sentencing transcript, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review, but review[ ] its finding of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The district court must calculate the guideline range accurately. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir.2006). However, harmless error review applies to a guideline miscalculation. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA Guidelines miscalculation is harmless if the district court would have imposed the same sentence without the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the district court explicitly found that consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted the statutory maximum sentence, regardless of whether the guideline range reflected the four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, any error it might have committed was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
