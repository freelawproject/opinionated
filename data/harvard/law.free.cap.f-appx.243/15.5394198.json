Cano-Esparza claims: the district court erred in finding his prior state felony-assault conviction constituted a crime of violence under Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii); and the sentencing-enhancement statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-25\">Although Cano-Esparza objected to the enhancement in district court, he did <em>not </em>do so on the basis presented here. Therefore, our review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Musa, </em>45 F.3d 922, 924 n. 5 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cTo preserve an issue for review on appeal, the defendant\u2019s objection must fully apprise the [district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>court] of the grounds for the objection so that evidence can be taken and argument received on the issue.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 866 (5th Cir.2006) (plain error exists when clear or obvious error affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) authorizes a sentencing enhancement when a defendant was previously deported after committing a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d. That section\u2019s application note defines a crime of violence as, <em>inter alia, </em>any state or federal offense \u201cthat has as an <em>element </em>the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, n. l(B)(iii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Cano-Esparza\u2019s prior assault offense violated Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) and (b)(2) (Vernon 1999), which proscribes \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly caus[ing or threatening] bodily injury to another\u201d. Because use of force is <em>not </em>an <em>element </em>of Texas\u2019 assault provision, the district court committed a clear or obvious error in looking to the conduct underlying the offense to determine it constituted a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 882 (5th Cir.2006) (use of force is not an element of Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(a)(1)), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1351, 167 L.Ed.2d 144 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 257 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cAlthough the actual conduct described in the indictment[ ] could be construed to involve the use of physical force .... [t]he [proper] inquiry ... looks to the <em>elements </em>of the crime, not to the defendant\u2019s actual conduct in committing it\u201d); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d 334, 337 (5th Cir.2005) (only if the statute of conviction contains multiple, disjunctive elements, one or more of which involves the use or threatened use of force as an element, may a court look to underlying conduct to determine which statutory alternative applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction). Obviously, this error affected Cano-Esparza\u2019s substantial rights. Therefore, his sentence is vacated and this case is remanded for resentencing. <em>See Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d at 885; <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In challenging the constitutionality of his sentencing enhancement, Cano-Esparza contends prior felony convictions must be treated as elements of the offense found by a jury, rather than as sentencing factors. Cano-Esparza concedes this challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He raises it here only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b37-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
