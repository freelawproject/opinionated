Nicholson, Sec\u2019y of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. 04-990, 21 Vet.App. 104, 2006 WL 3200368 (Vet. App. July 26, 2006). Finding no error in the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Bergman served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1976 to 1979. In September 1986, the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) granted him service connection for early osteoarthritis of the thoracolumbar spine. When Bergman later received a diagnosis for chronic low-back syndrome, he filed a claim for an increased rating, which the RO denied in March 1995. On appeal to the Veterans Court, in September 1999, that court granted a Joint Motion for Remand so the Board could evaluate the results of an October 1995 nerve conduction velocity test, which had shown some indication of lumbosacral radiculopathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">After further proceedings at the Board and RO, the Board again denied an increased rating for Bergman\u2019s service connected osteoarthritis and denied service connection for a lumbosacral disc syndrome. He again appealed to the Veterans Court, which affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Finally, Bergman timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">On appeal, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because it requires us to review the Veterans Court\u2019s application of law to facts. In response, Bergman argues that the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of the Joint Motion for Remand presents an issue of law and thus allows this court jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court. He also asserts that inherent fact-finding by the Veterans Court exceeded that court\u2019s statutory authority under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The jurisdictional question presented by this case falls in the spectrum defined by <em>Morris v. Principi, </em>239 F.3d 1292 (Fed. Cir.2001), and <em>Cook v. Principi, </em>353 F.3d 937 (Fed.Cir.2003). In <em>Morris, </em>we held that we had jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court\u2019s denial of remand in light of an alleged failure of the Board to discuss Morris\u2019s claim. 239 F.3d at 1296. Specifically, we characterized the appeal as challenging the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(d), which sets forth the requirement for the Board to address \u201call material issues of fact and law presented on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cook, </em>on the other hand, we recognized that <em>Morris </em>does not extend jurisdiction so far as reviewing the Veterans Court\u2019s failure to remand in light of an alleged failure of the Board to consider certain facts in the record. <em>Cook, </em>353 F.3d at 941. Specifically, the Veterans Court had characterized the omitted evidence as \u201cneither favorable nor unfavorable\u201d or presenting only illusory issues, and therefore did not require discussion by the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 938. Therefore, Cook was asking this court to apply the law to the facts of his case. <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Bergman\u2019s appeal challenges the Board\u2019s determination that his claim encompassed \u201centitlement to service connection for lumbosacral disc syndrome\u201d rather than the broader issue: \u201centitlement to service connection for a neurological condition.\u201d Because the scope of Bergman\u2019s claim on remand to the Board depends on the Joint Motion for Remand, any determination of scope presents an issue of law\u2014 construction of the Joint Motion for Remand. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court\u2019s determination. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">As discussed, Bergman asserts that the Veterans Court\u2019s and Board misconstrued the Joint Motion for Remand. That motion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">The record shows that in October 1995, an EMG study showed likely mild lumbosacral radiculopathy in light of right L5 distribution. Whether <em>that </em>neurological impairment is secondary to, and thus part of, the service-connected back disability must be adequately addressed by the Board. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.301(a). <em>If so related, </em>pursuant to <em>Esteban[ v. Brown, </em>6 VetApp. 259, 261 (1994) ], the Board must address the evidence indicating neurological aspects of the veteran\u2019s service-connected disability when assigning its rating.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\"><em>Bergman, </em>2006 WL 3200368, at *3 (emphases added). As the Veterans Court correctly recognized, the Joint Motion for Remand only concerned \u201cthat\u201d neurological impairment\u2014the \u201cmild lumbosacral radiculopathy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the motion only required the Board to address evidence of \u201cneurological aspects\u201d if it found the lumbosacral radiculopathy was part of the \u201cservice-connected back ability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We see no error with the Veterans Court\u2019s straightforward interpretation of the Joint Motion for Remand. Therefore, upon finding no radiculopathy, the Board was correct in not discussing any other potential neurological impairment. We have considered and rejected the appellant\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
