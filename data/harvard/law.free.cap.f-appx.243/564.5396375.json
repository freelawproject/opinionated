Archer argues that the district court erred in determining that he qualifies as a career offender, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1, based, in part, on a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b587-19\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Archer with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B) (count 1), distribution of crack cocaine (count 2), distribution of five or more grams of crack cocaine (counts 3 and 4), and possession with intent to distribute five or more grams of crack cocaine (count 5) all in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1). Archer pleaded guilty to these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-20\">Prior to sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). In the PSI, the probation officer determined that Archer\u2019s prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) and that his prior Florida felony conviction for selling crack cocaine was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), thus making Archer a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The probation officer therefore recommended an enhanced total offense level of 31, after reducing the level for acceptance of responsibility, and an enhanced criminal history category of VI and calculated an advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-21\">At his March 2007 sentencing hearing, Archer objected to the probation officer\u2019s determination that his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The district court overruled the objection and adopted the probation officer\u2019s determination that Archer is a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The district court sentenced Archer to 188 months\u2019 incarceration. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 986, 938 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">A defendant qualifies as a career offender if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as used in subsection (2) is defined in section 4B1.2 as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Archer argues that the crime of carrying a concealed weapon does not sufficiently present a \u201cpotential risk of physical injury to another\u201d to satisfy this definition of crime of violence and that the district court therefore erred in considering him a career offender. Archer concedes, however, that this argument is foreclosed by binding precedent of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">In <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998), this court addressed this very issue and concluded that carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law is a crime of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), and that a prior conviction for such a crime may appropriately determine career offender status for sentencing purposes. This court reiterated that holding in <em>United States v. Adams, </em>316 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.2003) and refused to revisit an issue so definitively decided previously. <em>Adams </em>emphasized that \u201c[t]he law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197 n. 1 <em>(quoting Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">We rely on the established law of this court and conclude that the district court correctly determined that Archer\u2019s previous conviction for carrying a concealed weapon constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and that based on that prior conviction, along with his other prior conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d he may be considered a career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The district court therefore did not err by sentencing Archer as a career criminal pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">For the foregoing reasons, Archer\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
