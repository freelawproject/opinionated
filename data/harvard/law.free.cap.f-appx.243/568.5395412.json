He argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, or alternately, unconstitutional as applied to him. Further, he argues that the district court acted unconstitutionally in increasing his sentence based on prior convictions that were not proven to a jury. As these issues were not raised before the district court, we review them for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We have previously examined the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996). Under the Commerce Clause, Congress\u2019 power to regulate is limited to \u201cCommerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, els. 1 &amp; 3. However, In <em>McAllister, </em>we held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) falls within this regulatory power because it contains a jurisdictional element that links its application to activities that affect interstate commerce. <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390. Similarly, we have upheld \u00a7 922(g)(1) against as-applied constitutional challenges when, as in this case, the government demonstrated at trial that the firearm possessed by the defendant was manufactured out-of-state and thus traveled across state lines in the past. <em>See United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001) (finding that such evidence is sufficient to establish a minimal nexus with interstate commerce). We thus find no error in the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Martin next argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury when it relied on his prior convictions to enhance his sentence. As Martin concedes, his argument is precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Under this binding precedent, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not require the government to allege in its indictment or to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions qualify him for enhanced sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.) (citing <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226, 118 S.Ct. at 1222), <em>cert. </em>denied-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 335, 166 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). Accordingly, we find that Martin\u2019s Sixth Amendment is foreclosed and we affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) states: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person\u2014(1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate of foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
