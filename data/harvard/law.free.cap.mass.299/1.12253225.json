Foley, as he is administrator of the estate of Allan G. Ashton. The declaration as amended alleges in substance that on or about January 12, 1932, the plaintiff, while lawfully using a public highway, was injured as the result of the negligent operation of an automobile by the defendant\u2019s intestate, and alleges further that this \u201caction is brought under the provisions of\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The defendant demurred on three grounds: The first, \u201cThat the matters contained in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration are insufficient in law to enable the plaintiff to maintain his action,\u201d and the third, \u201cThat the plaintiff\u2019s declaration sets forth no allegations of facts entitling him to bring his action under the provisions of\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 12. The defendant also filed a so called \u201cDefendant\u2019s plea and motion for judgment for the defendant\u201d in which he alleges that the plaintiff had brought an action of tort \u201cagainst the defendant in this action for the same cause of action and damage set forth in the declaration in the present case,\u201d that the action was tried and judgment thereon was entered in accordance with a rescript of this court, \u201call of which appears according to the attested copies of the docket entries of said Superior Court, the writ, declaration, defendant\u2019s answer, defendant\u2019s motion to amend answer and rescript hereto annexed,\u201d and \u201cthat the aforesaid judgment is a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action and he cannot recover in this action,\u201d and \u201cmoves that the court enter judgment for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The trial judge sustained the demurrer on the first and the third grounds thereof, and on the same day made an order, \u201cDefendant\u2019s plea in bar is sustained. Case ordered dismissed.\u201d The plaintiff appealed \u201cfrom the order of the court . . . sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer and plea in bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>First. The appeal brings before us for review the order sustaining the demurrer. Such an appeal was specifically authorized by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96, and entry thereof in this court was authorized by that section since the case, except for this appeal, was \u201cripe for final disposition by the superior court\u201d in accordance with the order sustaining the demurrer. <em>Morrill </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>278 Mass. 250, 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The order sustaining the demurrer was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The declaration contains the allegations essential to an ordinary action of tort for negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 147, Form 13. It appears, however, that the action was brought against the administrator for the negligence of his intestate. Such an action must be \u201ccommenced within one year from the time of his giving bond\u201d (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 197, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1933, c. 221, \u00a7 4), with qualifications not here material. But the plaintiff was not required to allege in his declaration that the action was so commenced. The defence, in an action at law, of the short statute of limitations must be set up in the answer if it is to be availed of, though if so pleaded the burden is cast upon the plaintiff of proving that the action was commenced seasonably. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>280 Mass. 222, 228. Even where it appears from the declaration that the action was not commenced within the time limited, the defence cannot be taken by demurrer. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>144 Mass. 470, 472. <em>Hodgdon </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>193 Mass. 327, 330. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>202 Mass. 109, 113. The declaration, therefore, was good against demurrer unless made bad by the reference therein to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 12, provides in part that \u201cIf an action commenced against an executor or administrator before the expiration of one year from the time of his giving bond fails of a sufficient service or return by an unavoidable accident, [or] if the writ in such action is abated or defeated in consequence of a defect in the form thereof or of a mistake in the form of the proceeding . . . the plaintiff may commence a new action for the same cause within one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>year after the abatement or other determination of the original action.\u201d No cause of action arose under this section. It merely authorizes <em>\u201ca </em>new action for the same cause\u201d and extends the time within which such an action may be brought, removing the bar of the short statute of limitations. Allegations of fact which bring the case within the terms of this section are not essential to a statement of the cause of action. Such facts are to be shown to remove the bar of the short statute of limitations if properly pleaded. <em>Hodgdon </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>193 Mass. 327, 330. The reference in the declaration to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 12, was made in anticipation of this defence. This reference, however, did not bring into the declaration allegations of fact showing that the action was not commenced seasonably. But even if it had done so the defence could not be taken by demurrer. And it was not taken by answer. The inclusion of the reference, in anticipation of the defence of the short statute of limitations is not ground for demurrer. <em>Brocklehurst </em>v. <em>Marsch, </em>225 Mass. 3, 6. Where, as here, this defence was not pleaded the reference to said \u00a7 12 was merely surplusage. Consequently it is immaterial whether or not the declaration alleged facts sufficient to meet the defence of the short statute of limitations if it had been set up in an answer. The declaration was not bad on demurrer by reason of the reference therein to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Second. The appeal does not bring before us for review the order relating to the so called \"plea in bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The so called \"plea in bar\u201d contains matter proper for an answer setting up a former judgment in avoidance of the action and, though wrongly entitled (since pleas in bar in actions at law are abolished), is to be treated as an answer in accordance with its true nature. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 22; <em>Foye </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>132 Mass. 105, 109-110; <em>E. S. Parks Shellac Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>265 Mass. 108, 110; <em>DiRuscio </em>v. <em>Popoli, </em>269 Mass. 482, 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">An appeal can be taken from an order of the Superior Court in an action of law only from (a) an order \u201csustaining or overruling a demurrer which alleges that the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>stated in the pleadings demurred to do not in law support or answer the action,\u201d (b) \u201can order for judgment upon a case stated,\u201d or (c) an \u201corder decisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. The order here in question was not an order of any of the kinds here described. It did not sustain or overrule a demurrer. And there was no case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Furthermore, even if the order was \u201cdecisive of the case\u201d it was not \u201cfounded upon matter of law apparent on the record.\u201d The order, \u201cplea in bar is sustained. Case ordered dismissed\u201d \u2014 though not aptly expressed as applied to an action at law \u2014 was in substance an order for judgment for the defendant based on the defence of <em>res judicata. </em>This order \u2014 in the absence, as here, of anything in the record limiting its scope \u2014 imports, not merely that the defence set up was sufficient in law if proved, but that this defence was established as a matter of fact. The order, therefore, was not \u201cfounded upon matter of law apparent on the record,\u201d unless the facts on which it was based were incorporated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The fact essential to establish the defence of <em>res judicata </em>was the existence of a judgment in a former action conclusive upon the parties to the present action. Whether the judgment is conclusive depends, however, on the proceedings in the action in which it was obtained as shown by the record thereof <em>(Farnum </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>269 Mass. 53, 55), which cannot be contradicted or varied <em>(Haskell </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>221 Mass. 49, 53, <em>Bryer </em>v. <em>American Surety Co. </em>285 Mass. 336, 337-338), but which may be explained by extrinsic evidence in an appropriate case. <em>Coyle </em>v. <em>Taunton Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>216 Mass. 156, 160. <em>Wight </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>272 Mass. 154, 156. But the record of the proceedings in a former action, though brought in the same court, is not a part of the record in a later action unless made so in some proper way. Here the record of the proceedings in the former action was not made a part of the record in the pending action unless by the annexation to the so called \u201cplea in bar\u201d of certified copies of the record of such proceedings. Proof of such a record ordinarily is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>made by certified copy. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>218 Mass. 245, 247-248. See <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>163 Mass. 381. The defendant, however, by annexing to the so called \u201cplea in bar\u201d certified copies of the record of the proceedings of the former action, though doubtless thereby incorporating them in the record of the present action for the purposes of pleading, did not thereby incorporate therein, as an established fact, the record of such proceedings, even though such copies, if introduced in evidence, would have been conclusive of the facts shown thereby. See <em>Day </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>173 Mass. 433, 435-436. And it does not appear that the plaintiff admitted the truth of the allegations in the so called \u201cplea in bar.\u201d On the contrary, so far as the record goes, these allegations were denied. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 34. Rule 26 of the Superior Court (1932). The facts on which the order was based, therefore, were not incorporated in the record. And after a trial on the facts, which the order imports was had, a question of the sufficiency of the pleadings, not shown by the record to have been specifically raised or passed upon, is not open for the purpose of reversing the decision of the trial judge. In this respect the plaintiff stands in no better position on appeal than on a report or a bill of exceptions. <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>D. A. Shulte, Inc. </em>275 Mass. 380, 384-385. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Kilpatrick, </em>277 Mass. 237, 241. The sufficiency or insufficiency of the pleadings was not \u201cmatter of law apparent on the record\u201d on which the order was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Where, as here, the facts on which the order was based were not incorporated in the record by admission by pleading or by a statement of agreed facts (see <em>Frati </em>v. <em>Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430, 432), the order could be reviewed only on a report by the trial judge or a bill of exceptions. Appeal does not lie. <em>Powdrell </em>v. <em>DuBois, </em>274 Mass. 106, 108. <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Bambini, </em>295 Mass. 427. <em>Bourget </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>297 Mass. 25, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The question argued at the bar whether the action can be maintained under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 12, if otherwise barred by the short statute of limitations, is not before us on the appeal on either branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Apparently, so long as the order of the trial judge on the so called \"plea in bar\u201d stands, a reversal by this court of the order of the trial judge sustaining the demurrer will avail the plaintiff nothing. Nevertheless, on the appeal from this order \u2014 which is properly before us \u2014 he is entitled to have the order of the trial judge reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\n<em>Appeal from order sustaining \u201cplea in bar\u201d dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
