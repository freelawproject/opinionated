There was a dirt road, averaging about fourteen feet in width and quite rough in spots, for about seven tenths of a mile, after which there was a \u201ctarvia\u201d road about twenty feet wide upon which the accident took place. When starting the defendant \u201cswung out fast on a very sharp curve.\u201d Thereafter he drove over the winding and \u201calmost entirely unlighted\u201d road at a speed \u201cfar greater than was reasonable and proper,\u201d at times reaching from fifty to fifty-five miles an hour, slowing down on curves \u201cjust enough to permit him to negotiate them.\u201d At times he went from side to side scraping the bushes. The accident finally occurred as the result of the defendant driving around a sharp curve at a speed \u201cnot much less than fifty miles per hour,\u201d so that he was unable to avoid a telegraph pole which stood about two feet beyond the edge of the tarvia and which was broken off by the impact. Before starting the defendant asked the owner of the automobile, \u201cHow fast does this baby go?\u201d During the ride the plaintiffs frequently protested at the speed. Several times the female plaintiffs screamed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">These findings tend to show impatience of reasonable restraint and persistence in a palpably negligent course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>conduct over an appreciable period of time, culminating in the accident. They support the conclusion of gross negligence. <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>296 Mass. 15. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Axtman, </em>296 Mass. 512. <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>282 Mass. 518, 522. <em>Channon </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>292 Mass. 316. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>298 Mass. 451. Compare <em>Kohutynski </em>v. <em>Kohutynski, </em>296 Mass. 74. In our opinion the case is stronger for the plaintiffs than <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>275 Mass. 149, <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Donohue, </em>285 Mass. 19, and <em>Desroches </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>285 Mass. 495, upon which the defendant relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In each case the entry will be</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
