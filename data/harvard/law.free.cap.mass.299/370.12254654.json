He was paid compensation until February 8, 1934, when the request of the insurer to discontinue compensation was approved by a member of the Industrial Accident Board. Thereafter a further hearing was had before a member of the board, who on May 15, 1934, dismissed the claim of the employee for compensation for a period subsequent to February 8, 1934, on the ground that his disability ceased on that date. On review, a reviewing board found partial incapacity after that date, ending at the date of its decision, October 16, 1934. On November 19, 1936, the employee filed a petition for rehearing, asserting that instead of being free from disability after October 16, 1934, he grew worse. The \u201cIndustrial Accident Board/\u2019 with three members present, filed a decision signed by two of them, denying the petition \u201cas being frivolous and without merit.\u201d The Superior Court entered a decree dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ing the claim for compensation subsequent to October 16, 1934, and the employee appealed to this court. It appears that the employee asked the Superior Court to decide that the board erred in finding his petition frivolous and without merit, and to recommit the case to the board for hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, questions of the right to compensation and the amount of compensation are assigned to a single member for hearing. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 7. After the decision of the member has been filed, \u201ctogether with a statement of the evidence, his findings of fact, rulings of law, and other matters pertinent to questions arising before him,\u201d either party may within seven days file a claim for review. \u00a7 8. The reviewing board must consist of not less than three members, and is appointed by the chairman of the Industrial Accident Board. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 24, \u00a7 3. The reviewing board commonly determines the facts and makes its decision and order as to compensation upon the evidence reported to it by the single member, although in its discretion it may hear evidence (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 10); and its decision in matters of fact is final. <em>Fountaine\u2019s Case, </em>246 Mass. 513. <em>Savage\u2019s Case, </em>257 Mass. 30. <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 581, 585. <em>Minns\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 459, 462. <em>Schenck\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 526, 530. <em>Ricci\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 67. <em>Lazarz's Case, </em>293 Mass. 538, 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">After compensation has been awarded, \u201cThere can be no doubt of the jurisdiction of the reviewing board or of a single member to modify previous orders not final in their nature concerning compensation as changes occur in the condition of the injured employee. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 12. <em>Kareske\u2019s Case, </em>250 Mass. 220, 224. Likewise, compensation when once begun to be paid may be discontinued with the approval of the Industrial Accident Board or a member thereof. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 29. No time is fixed for making such change. . It may be done after even a brief interval,\u201d and <em>ex parte. Shershun\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 379, 381. <em>MacKinnon\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 37. <em>Korobchuk\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 412, 416, 417. <em>Paglieranis\u2019s Case, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>270 Mass. 368. A proceeding to modify the order or to discontinue compensation does not reopen the questions determined in making the original order, but opens the subsequent continuance and extent of disability. <em>Kareske\u2019s Case, </em>250 Mass. 220. <em>Panagotopulos\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 600, 604, 605. <em>Perkins\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 294, 301. <em>MacKinnon\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 37, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Though an insurer may seek revision of the order or discontinuance of compensation indefinitely, a definite decision of the reviewing board, or of a single member unreviewed, that the employee had fully recovered and that compensation cease, formerly amounted to an adjudication that the employee had no further right, and the proceedings could not be revived. <em>Brode\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 414. <em>Casieri\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 50. <em>Ziccardi\u2019s Case, </em>287 Mass. 588. Compare <em>Hanson\u2019s Case, </em>264 Mass. 300. But St. 1929, c. 246 added to the statute what is now the second paragraph of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 12. It read: \u201cWhen in any case before the board there appears of record a finding that the employee is entitled to compensation, no subsequent finding by the board or by a member thereof discontinuing compensation on the ground that the employee\u2019s incapacity has ceased shall be considered final as a matter of fact or res judicata as a matter of law, and such employee or his dependents, in the event of his death, may have further hearings as to whether his incapacity or death is or was the result of the injuries for which he received compensation; provided, that if the board shall determine that the petition for such a rehearing is without merit and frivolous, the employee or his dependents shall not thereafter be entitled to file any subsequent petition therefor except for cause shown and in the discretion of the member to whom such subsequent petition may be referred . . . .\u201d The present form of the section appears in St. 1932, c. 117, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The employee contends that the \u201cboard\u201d that denied his petition \u201cas being frivolous and without merit\u201d must have been the department of industrial accidents, consisting of the Industrial Accident Board of seven members (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2) to which is entrusted the residue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>power in workmen\u2019s compensation not specifically given to a single member or a reviewing board. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 16. <em>Golden\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 178. He contends that action by the department must be attested by the signatures of at least four members, and that a decision by two members out of three present, is invalid on its face. We need not consider the correctness of that contention. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>236 Mass. 463, 467. <em>Berninger\u2019s Case, </em>253 Mass. 52. Although the record indicates that the three members purported to sit as the \u201cIndustrial Accident Board,\u201d jurisdiction was in a single member or a reviewing board,, and not in the Industrial Accident Board nor in the department of industrial accidents. It is not true that a reviewing board can act only on a review of a decision made by a single member. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 12, providing that \u201cQuestions as to a weekly payment may be heard and decided by the reviewing board or any member of the department\u201d and that if \u201cheard and decided by a member, his decision may be reviewed\u201d by a reviewing board, grants original jurisdiction of such questions equally to a member and a reviewing board. <em>Shershun\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 379, 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The \u201cboard\u201d that may determine \u201cthat the petition for such a rehearing is without merit and frivolous\u201d is a reviewing board. Such a determination naturally will be made only after evidence has been taken upon a petition for a rehearing on the question of continued incapacity, when the matter is before the reviewing board in the exercise of either its original or its appellate jurisdiction. <em>Joos\u2019s Case, </em>267 Mass. 322. No such determination could be made without hearing evidence, at least unless the petition on its face should be plainly without merit and frivolous. The petition in the present case, supported as it was by the statements of two physicians, could not be so pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">No proper decision of the present proceeding was made by a reviewing board before the case came to the Superior Court. The decree of that court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Industrial Accident Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
