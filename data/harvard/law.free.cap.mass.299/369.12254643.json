We find no solid ground on which the case at bar can be distinguished from these cases. The agreements of indemnity in <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>T. Stuart &amp; Son Co. </em>236 Mass. 98, 103, <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad </em>v. <em>T.

See <em>Ortolano </em>v. <em>U-Dryvit Auto Rental Co. Inc. </em>296 Mass. 439, 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">It is unnecessary to deal with the requests for rulings in detail.
