The only question is whether the action is barred because not brought within one year after the cause of action accrued,</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The cause of action accrued when Dominic Barbate was hurt on August 23, 1931. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>288 Mass. 532, 533. In that case it was held that such consequential damages arising out of bodily injury to another (compare <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Rogovin, </em>289 Mass. 549, 550), were not \u201cbodily injuries\u201d within the compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance act, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A (St. 1928, c. 381, \u00a7 4), and that actions to recover such consequential damages were not \u201cactions of tort for bodily injuries . . . the payment of judgments in which is required to be secured by chapter ninety\u201d of the General Laws, within the provision requiring action to be commenced within one year contained in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4 (St. 1925, c. 346, \u00a7 10; G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 260, \u00a7 4). It was accordingly held that action for such consequential damages might be commenced within six years after the cause of action accrued, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 260, \u00a7 2, Second.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Since the statutes discussed in that case, there has been added to the single class of cases of \u201cbodily injuries\u201d then within the protection of the compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance act, a new class consisting of \u201cconsequential damages consisting of expenses incurred by a husband, wife, parent or guardian for medical, nursing, hospital or surgical services in connection with or on account of such bodily injuries.\u201d St. 1930, c. 340, \u00a7 1. St. 1935, c. 459, \u00a7 2. But there has been no comparable change in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4, which still restricts the limitation of one year to \u201cactions of tort for bodily injuries . . . the payment of judgments in which is required to be secured by chapter ninety\u201d of the General Laws. St. 1933, c. 318, \u00a7 5. St. 1934, c. 291, \u00a7 4. St. 1937, c. 385, \u00a7 9. It is still not every action, the payment of the judgment in which is required to be secured under chapter ninety, to which the limitation of one year applies, but only such as may be \u201cfor bodily injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Nothing in the history of legislation enlarges the original meaning of \u201cbodily injuries\u201d in the one-year statute of limitation so as to include such consequential damages. On the contrary, the action of the Legislature in adding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>to the compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance act a second class of damages consisting of such consequential damages, was a recognition of the fact that such consequential damages are not \u201cbodily injuries\u201d within either of the statutes under discussion. The amendment of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, did not affect the language or the construction of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4. So far as one sentence of the opinion in <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>288 Mass. 532, 534, near the bottom of the page, intimates the contrary, we do not follow it. The judge and the Appellate Division were right in holding that the present action was not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
