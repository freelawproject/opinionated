Facts relating to the settlement of this estate are set forth at length in <em>Untersee </em>v. <em>Untersee, ante, </em>417.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-17\">The present petition alleges that the decree erroneously allowed interest at six per cent on the value of the legacy as ascertained instead of at four per cent in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 20, and it is now contended in argument that the legacy was a specific and not a pecuniary one, and that no interest at all should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The Probate Court had jurisdiction in equity to enforce the rights of the legatees. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 19. There appears to have been a full hearing upon the original petition. The judge\u2019s findings of fact show that the final decree was not entered through mistake or clerical error, but that it was entered in pursuance of rulings of the judge deliberately made. If there was error of law in the decree, upon which we intimate no opinion, the easy remedy was by seasonable appeal from that decree under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 9. There was no error in dismissing this petition. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Goulding, </em>5 Allen, 81. <em>Untersee </em>v. <em>Untersee, </em>293 Mass. 132, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
