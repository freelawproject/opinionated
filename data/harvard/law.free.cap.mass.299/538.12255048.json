The cases were tried together before an auditor whose findings of fact were not final. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>In each case the auditor filed a report, and the plaintiff and the defendant each made a motion for judgment upon the report. Rule 88 of the Superior Court (1932). The judge in each case denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion, allowed the defendant\u2019s motion, and ordered judgment for the defendant. The cases come before us on the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The auditor\u2019s reports were identical except as to the description of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and the amounts of damages found.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">There was no error in the orders of the trial judge in each case unless the auditor\u2019s report required, as matter of law, a finding that the defendant operated the automobile in a grossly negligent manner. Such a finding was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The auditor found that each plaintiff \u201cin the exercise of due care received bodily injuries ... as a result of the gross negligence, carelessness and unskilfulness of the defendant in the operation of his . . . [automobile].\u201d Since there was no evidence before the trial judge other than the auditor\u2019s report, this general finding required a finding for the plaintiff unless the subsidiary findings of the auditor were necessarily inconsistent with this general finding or warranted the inference, contrary to the general finding, that the defendant was not grossly negligent. <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>283 Mass. 336, 338. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>294 Mass. 236, 238, 246. <em>Savin </em>v. <em>Block, </em>297 Mass. 487, 490, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The subsidiary findings warranted the inference that the defendant was not grossly negligent. The subsidiary findings may be summarized as follows: The defendant, operating his automobile with the plaintiffs as passengers, shortly after midnight of September 4, 1933, was travelling easterly on Mountain Park Road toward Holyoke, intending to turn north on Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road at the intersection of these roads. Each road had a macadam surface eighteen feet wide. At the junction of the roads Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road \u201cspreads out in a fan shape . . . with a triangular green in the center, bordering Mountain Park Road, twentyfour . . . feet long, and three or four . . . inches high, the westerly and easterly ends extending out so that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>are almost level with the road. The westerly and easterly ends of the green overlap the westerly and easterly side lines extended of the Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road at points on either side.\u201d Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road at each side of the green is eighteen feet wide. \u201cThese roads are heavily wooded on each side from a point ten . . . feet from the road except, near the intersection and west of the green .... Here there is a clearance of over fifty . . . feet from the road and this clearance extends up the Mountain Park Road on its northerly side for one hundred . . . feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The defendant, before reaching the junction of the roads, was driving down a \u201csteep grade, of about five hundred . . . feet from the top of the grade to a point opposite the point of accident\u201d at a speed of forty-five miles an hour. The road was wet and slippery. There were no road lights. The headlights of the defendant\u2019s automobile were lighted and in working order. There were no other automobiles or other traffic on the road. There was no conversation between the defendant and the plaintiffs. The defendant failed to see Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road \u201con the left as he came down the grade,\u201d but \u201cmade a quick, sharp turn cutting across the easterly end of the grass triangle with his two left wheels and entered the easterly intersection of the Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road.\u201d The automobile, after travelling sixty feet, \u201cjust avoided hitting a telephone pole standing five . . . feet in from the easterly side of the Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road,\u201d struck a tree about thirty feet beyond, \u201cstanding eighteen . . . inches in\u201d from the easterly side of the macadam, and \u201cstopped about a foot back and one foot to one side\u201d of another tree. The shoulder of the road in which the telephone pole and these trees stood was about six feet wide, of \u201ctrap rock with grass growing through it and not as firm as the road way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The \u201cdefendant did not apply his brakes or make any effort to slacken his speed or stop his automobile from the time he turned on Mountain Park Road until he\u201d struck the tree, though he \u201chad time to apply his brakes from the time he turned on Mountain Park Road to the time he struck\u201d the tree. After he turned, his lights were in direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>line of the tree. The automobile skidded just before it struck the tree. And \u201cthe skidding was in part due to the speed at which the defendant was driving.\u201d The automobile struck the tree \u201cat or near the forward door and on the right hand side.\u201d The \u201cright front fender about six . . . inches up from the running board, the right running board, the rear fender, the rear end, the starter and the windshield were broken.\u201d The defendant \u2014 according to his own testimony as recited in the auditor\u2019s report \u2014 \u201cwhen he went on the soft shoulder . . . didn\u2019t think it was necessary to apply his brakes\u201d but \u201che took a chance to avoid the tree by not applying the brakes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Whether there is gross negligence in the operation of an automobile depends upon all the circumstances of the case. While gross negligence may be found though no single element of the operator\u2019s conduct is sufficient to warrant such a finding, the particular elements of his conduct are proper matters for consideration in determining whether his conduct as a whole was grossly negligent. In these cases the conclusion was warranted that the defendant\u2019s attention was not at any time diverted from the operation of the automobile, and that he did not act in defiance of warnings from his passengers. Compare <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>284 Mass. 205; <em>MacEachern </em>v. <em>Stieler, </em>289 Mass. 346. Nothing by way of act or omission on the part of the defendant, considered by itself, even if negligent, warranted a finding of gross negligence on his part prior to the time when he turned into Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road. Compare <em>Adamian </em>v. <em>Messerlian, </em>292 Mass. 275; <em>Kohutynski </em>v. <em>Kohutynski, </em>296 Mass. 74, 76-77. And inferences were warranted that, after he discovered that he had gone so far that he could not turn into Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road at the usual place, he could not have slackened speed materially before turning except by applying the brakes, and that on the wet and slippery road application of the brakes, even if he had time to apply them, would have been unsafe. Similar inferences could have been drawn with respect to the time after he had so turned. See <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Brereton, </em>261 Mass. 238, 241-242; <em>Hiller </em>v. <em>Desautels, </em>269 Mass. 437, 440-441. The crucial question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>whether, in view of the speed of the automobile, the condition of Mountain Park Road, the necessity of crossing the \u201cgrass triangle\u201d in order to turn into Smiths' Ferry Road and the uncertainty as to conditions on that road after the turn was made, the defendant was grossly negligent in turning into Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road with the result which followed. Clearly the inference was warranted that this result, if not foreseeable in its precise form, was, in its general nature, a probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s action. See <em>Perlman </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>270 Mass. 182, 184; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Boston, Revere Beach &amp; Lynn Railroad, </em>289 Mass. 241, 244; <em>Goyette </em>v. <em>Amor, </em>294 Mass. 355, 357; <em>Engel </em>v. <em>Boston Ice Co. </em>295 Mass. 428, 435. But on the other hand, the inference could have been drawn that this result was not so highly probable that the defendant\u2019s disregard of the risk of turning into Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road amounted to such \u201cindifference to present legal duty,\u201d such \u201cutter forgetfulness of legal obligations so far as other persons may be affected,\u201d as constitutes gross negligence. See <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588, 591. And the inference could have been drawn that the defendant\u2019s conduct after making the turn into Smiths\u2019 Ferry Road, though not to any extent excusing prior fault (see <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Middlesex &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>276 Mass. 29, 33), was not in itself grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We need not decide whether the subsidiary facts found warranted a finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, was grossly negligent. The subsidiary facts found were susceptible of different inferences. It was the duty of the trial judge, as trier of fact, to determine what inferences should be drawn. We cannot say, as matter of law, that a conclusion \u2014 contrary to the general finding of the auditor \u2014 that the defendant was not grossly negligent was not warranted by the subsidiary facts found and permissible inferences therefrom. Most cases relating to gross negligence which have come before this court are distinguishable on the ground that in those cases, unlike the present case, the question presented was whether the evidence warranted \u2014 not whether it required \u2014 a finding of gross negligence. See, however, <em>Kohutynski </em>v, <em>Kohutyn</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>ski, </em>296 Mass. 74, 79; <em>Savin </em>v. <em>Block, </em>297 Mass. 487. And, even apart from this distinction, in no case was the evidence closely similar to the evidence here. But see <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>275 Mass. 149; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Donohue, </em>285 Mass. 19; <em>Lefebvre </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>288 Mass. 253. Cases relied on by the plaintiffs <em>(Manning </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>261 Mass. 494, <em>McCarron </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>270 Mass. 39, <em>Dzura </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>275 Mass. 283, <em>Schusterman </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>280 Mass. 582, <em>Caldbeck </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>281 Mass. 360, <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>282 Mass. 518, <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Comerford, </em>283 Mass. 589) are distinguishable. See also <em>Savin </em>v. <em>Block, </em>297 Mass. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
