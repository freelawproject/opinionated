It caught the plaintiff\u2019s heel, which was a low one. The jury had the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>to accept the testimony of the plaintiff, and to reject the impressive mass of evidence for the defendant that there was no defect. Although the plaintiff placed the defect at her right at some time, and her left heel was caught, there was evidence that the step was defective \u201cwhere she fell,\u201d and the defect could be found the cause of the fall. Even if the jury believed that screws, not nails, were used as fastenings, they could find the plaintiff merely mistaken in describing the fastenings as nails. There was evidence for the defendant that \u201cthe slots in screws will wear smooth and look like nails.\u201d The existence of the defect for sufficient time to enable the defendant, if due care were used, to discover and correct it before the accident, could have been found upon the foregoing description of the defect in connection with testimony for the defendant that the nosings were put on about ten months before the accident, that \u201cthey start looking at nosings two or three weeks after they are put down,\u201d that the stairways were inspected every day, and that when a nosing is worn it will start to pull from the screw and will get jagged if left long enough. There was no error in submitting the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
