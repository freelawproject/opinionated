Claim by the plaintiff for a jury trial was indorsed on the writ. The defendant also claimed a jury trial. The defendant filed on the same day a demurrer on the sole ground that the declaration \u201cdoes not set forth sufficient facts to entitle the plaintiff to maintain his action,\u201d a so called \u201cplea in bar\u201d setting up the defence of adjudication by a previous case, and an answer denying generally the allegations of the declaration. The demurrer was overruled and the defendant appealed. A motion by the defendant to amend its \u201cplea in bar\u201d was allowed and the plaintiff appealed. The \u201cplea in bar\u201d as amended was \u201csustained\u201d \u2014 as appears from a copy of the docket entries transmitted to this court (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 231, \u00a7 135, <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>239 Mass. 443, 445-446) \u2014 and the plaintiff appealed. The defendant moved in this court that the appeal last referred to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Neither of the plaintiff\u2019s appeals is properly before us. Appeals in actions at law are authorized only by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. That section obviously is not applicable to either of these appeals, unless it is an appeal from an \u201corder decisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record.\u201d The order allowing an amendment to the \u201cplea in bar\u201d was not such an order. Nor was the order sustaining the defendant\u2019s amended \u201cplea in bar.\u201d This so called \u201cplea in bar\u201d as amended was in substance an answer setting up the defence of <em>res judicata </em>and must be treated in accordance with its true nature, though the defendant filed also a general denial. See <em>DiRuscio </em>v. <em>Popoli, </em>269 Mass. 482, 486. The order sustaining the \u201cplea in bar\u201d imports a finding by the judge that the defence thereby set up was established as matter of fact. But the facts upon which the finding was based are not incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>in the record. In the absence of such facts no \"matter of law\u201d on which the order was \"founded\u201d is \"apparent on the record.\u201d Consequently, though the order was \"decisive of the case,\u201d it cannot be reviewed on appeal. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Foley, ante, </em>1. The plaintiff argues, however, that he was deprived of the right of jury trial to which he was entitled. But if he ever had any right to trial by jury on the issue raised by the \"plea in bar\u201d he would have waived it by going to trial thereon before a judge without objection. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 348. The facts on this point are not incorporated in the record, so that no \"matter of law\u201d with respect to this point is \"apparent on the record.\u201d Moreover, an order for trial by a judge rather than by a jury, considered by itself, would not be \"decisive of the case.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s remedy, in the absence of a report by the trial judge, was by a bill of exceptions in which evidence or facts found could have been incorporated. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Foley, ante, </em>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">The defendant\u2019s appeal is not before us. It does not appear to have been entered in this court by the defendant, though papers relating to it are included in the printed record of the plaintiff\u2019s appeals. The plaintiff alone \u2014 as the docket entries disclose \u2014 has taken steps to bring the case here. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135. Compare <em>Barrell </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>268 Mass. 99, 103-105, where, unlike this case, there was a combined bill of exceptions. See also <em>Hamilton Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>274 Mass. 477, 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s appeals dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
