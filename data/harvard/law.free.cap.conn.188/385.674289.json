The record indicates that there have been a number of post judgment motions over the years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">This appeal is from the trial court\u2019s action, on May 5,1980, (the 1980 judgment) on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify judgment for child support and alimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Some background should be set out at this point. At the time of the 1980 judgment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff had been under an order, temporary in nature since August 11, 1978, to pay $100 per week in alimony, $75 per week in support for the child Scott<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the monthly mortgage payment of $195 on the family home owned by the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>South Windsor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This 1978 order was to persist until the court had before it the financial data, particularly of the plaintiff\u2019s circumstances, upon which to enter a permanent order on the defendant\u2019s motion for modification of child support and alimony which was pending at that time, that motion having been filed on August-19, 1977. This motion for modification alleged in part that \u201cthere has been a material change in the financial circumstances of the parties, and that the defendant has incurred medical bills because of cancer surgery in the past and cancer surgery that she must undergo in the near future.\u201d After a hearing on this motion, the court, on August 11, 1978, also ordered \u201cthat an accountant selected by Mr. Colucci of the Family Relations office be appointed to determine if Mr. Cersosimo\u2019s salary is commensurate with his business\u2019 profits. That Mr. Cersosimo is to make his last two tax returns [available]. That Mr. Cersosimo pay the accountant appointed by Mr. Colucci.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On February 27, 1979, another hearing was held. At that time, Colucci reported that he had selected an accountant, one Jerome Bascom. The family relations officer also reported that Bascom had had an opportunity to examine the books of the plaintiff\u2019s business and the corporate and individual tax returns and had mailed him (Colucci) his report of September 12, 1978, of which he had also given the defendant a copy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As matters developed during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that hearing, it appeared that Colncci had not personally seen the plaintiff\u2019s personal income tax returns and the court continued that hearing to assure that these returns were properly reflected in Bascom\u2019s report as well as to chock further on the defendant\u2019s claim that perhaps a motor vehicle and a piece of real estate were not properly reflected in the materials then before the court. The court, concerned that these matters be investigated further, continued the hearing for that purpose. The court went on to indicate to Colucci that he was to examine the personal tax returns, that the parties ought to be present with him, that he would answer any questions he could that the defendant had and, if he were satisfied that the information was there, then this was to be done \u201cwithout having to have a physical examination of the return by Mrs. Cersosimo.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Upon hearing this, the defendant inquired whether the court was stating that she was \u201cnot entitled to look at those returns.\u201d The court replied: \u201cI\u2019m saying that I\u2019m going to let the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Official examine the returns and compare them with the affidavit, extract from that what is the income and answer any questions you might have, relative to his expenses and income.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant maintained that \u201cas a pro se litigant representing myself, Your Honor, I really object to the fact that I am not allowed to look at these records.\u201d Thereupon, the court said: \u201cYou may make a formal objection for the record at such time as the report is made to the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">On May 5, 1980, another hearing was held at which the court had a copy of the accountant\u2019s report. At that time, the defendant asked for \u201c$500.00 a week alimony, and $300.00 a week for child support for my son Scott, and I would like to send him to school.\u201d She argued that these figures were not out of line with the plaintiff\u2019s income \u201cwhich Mr. Coluchi [sic], I believe, read off in his office as $85,000.00 or $87,000.00 for [each of] the past three years ...\u201d and that that would he \u201cfair and equitable\u201d and \u201cbring me up to a situation where I can live in the same life style that he does.\u201d In making this claim, she read to the court article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>first, \u00a7 20 of the Connecticut constitution, maintaining that that \u201cstatute requires that an individual at my age and position in life has a right to that kind of an income.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court entered the orders on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify child support and alimony which generated this appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant excepted to this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The defendant claims that the court erred in failing (1) to hear her motion for production, disclosure and examination and her objection to the court\u2019s denying her access to the plaintiff\u2019s personal income tax returns; (2) to consider that the divorce decree of the parties was granted under the law extant in 1966; (3) to apply the criteria for modification of alimony and support set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86; (4) to adhere to the criteria for awarding alimony set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82; (5) to consider article first, \u00a7 20 of the Connecticut constitution in passing upon her motion for modification of alimony; and (6) to allow her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>to give her \u201csummarizing argument\u201d after allowing plaintiff\u2019s counsel to do so, thus depriving her of the opportunity to rebut the argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel by stating her dissatisfaction concerning the disposition of the financial matters involved and to raise claims under the sixth, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We take up initially the defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred in failing to hear her motion for production, disclosure and examination of the plaintiff\u2019s personal income tax returns and her objection to the \u201ccourt [\u2019s] denying defendant access to plaintiff\u2019s personal income tax returns.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>refers to the court\u2019s direction that a meeting be held between the family relations officer, the defendant, the plaintiff, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cso that Mr. Colucci could read to the Defendant the Personal Income Tax of Louis J. Cersosimo, Plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It also maintains that \u201cPro se litigants, representing themselves have all the rights and privileges of counsel\u201d and sets out her objection to. the \u201cCourt\u2019s failure to allow Defendant access to these reoerds [sic], and requests the Court order the Income Tax Records given to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The issue raised here is whether the defendant, as a pro se litigant, is entitled to the same access to the materials sought as an attorney representing her would have if she had had counsel. The transcripts, fairly read, indicate that if the defendant had had counsel, then counsel would have had an opportunity to examine the plaintiff\u2019s personal income tax returns.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">It is \u201cour established policy to allow great latitude to a litigant who, either by choice or necessity, represents himself in legal proceedings, so far as such latitude is consistent with the just rights of any adverse party . . . .\u201d <em>Bitonti </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>162 Conn. 626, 627, 295 A.2d 545, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 851, 93 S. Ct. 62, 34 L. Ed. 2d 94 (1972). This does not, however, mean that we will entirely disregard the established rules of procedure, adherence to which is necessary so that the parties may know their rights and the real issues in controversy may be presented and determined. See <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>DiFasio, </em>177 Conn. 34, 39n, 411 A.2d 8 (1979); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>103 Conn. 744, 745-46, 131 A. 736 (1926). \u201cIt is a well-settled principle of law that a party to a civil action may appear either pro se or through counsel. See 7 Am. Jur. 2d, Attorneys at Law \u00a7 6, p. 46; Annot., 67 A.L.R.2d 1102, 1103; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>United States Bank, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 829, 6 L. Ed. 204 (1824); and <em>Abernethy </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>206 N.C. 370, 173 S.E. 899 (1934).\u201d <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Frerking, </em>4 Kan. App. 590, 592, 609 P.2d 682 (1980); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 (as amended 1949); see also <em>Faretta </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). Where a defendant acts as his own counsel, as he has every right to do, \u201chis rights are subject to and will receive the same consideration as if he had been represented by an attorney.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>188 Neb. 393, 397, 197 N.W.2d 388 (1972). Such a litigant is bound by the same rules of evidence and procedure as those qualified to practice law. See <em>Hutter Northern Trust </em>v. <em>Door County Chamber of Commerce, </em>467 F.2d 1075, 1079 (7th Cir. 1972); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank of Clovis, </em>244 F.2d 511, 512 (10th Cir. 1957); <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>511 S.W.2d 442, 443 (Mo. App. 1974); <em>In re Ralph Brewster, </em>115 N.H. 636, 638, 351 A.2d 889 (1975); <em>State ex rel. State Highway Commission </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>82 N.M. 316, 318-19, 481 P.2d 104 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">It is apparent that the trial court denied the defendant physical access to the plaintiff\u2019s personal income tax returns solely because of the defendant\u2019s pro se status. This was error because the defendant had the same right to discovery as any other party represented by counsel would have had subject to the principle that all rulings for discovery are subject to the discretion of the trial court. See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>147 Conn. 321, 331, 160 A.2d 745, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 833, 81 S. Ct. 70, 5 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1960); <em>Kiessling </em>v. <em>Kiessling, </em>134 Conn. 564, 568, 59 A.2d 532 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We must now determine whether the trial court\u2019s error was so prejudicial as to constitute harmful error. See <em>Kosko </em>v. <em>Kohler, </em>176 Conn. 383, 387, 407 A.2d 1009 (1978); <em>Casalo </em>v. <em>Claro, </em>147 Conn. 625, 630, 165 A.2d 153 (1960). We are not persuaded from what is before us, that the court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion and make physically avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>able to the defendant all or part of the personal income tax returns sought so prejudiced her that she was effectively hampered in the preparation and presentation of her case. See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>supra, 332; <em>Kujaca </em>v. <em>Kujaca, </em>159 Ind. App. 6, 15, 304 N.E.2d 870 (1973). The court had a fund of financial information available to it concerning both parties. It had ordered the parties to meet with Colucci concerning this financial information and this was done on more than one occasion. The defendant had had the plaintiff on the witness stand earlier on July 28, 1978, and had cross-examined him. The defendant herself agreed that her examination in court of the plaintiff was \u201cvery . . . lengthy.\u201d On February 27, 1979, when the defendant claimed that certain information had apparently not been ascertained by her, the court pointed out if the desired information was based on his statements under oath, then the defendant should pin down that response so it could be further elaborated upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Although he resided in Rhode Island, there is no claim that the plaintiff did not personally appear in Connecticut for these proceedings. The accountant Bascom was in court, at least on one occasion, and, although he had access to the tax returns, the defendant did not call him to the witness stand nor ask that he be called. She also had an \u201cextended conversation\u201d with the accountant on the telephone. Colucci, the family relations officer, offered to testify under oath but there is no indication that he was ever asked to. Just prior to entering the orders for support and alimony, the court stated that it had basically intended the \u201cexamination by the parties with the accountant to assure ourselves that the [plaintiff\u2019s] financial affidavit was, in fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>correct and with that, we have pinned his income at the figure that represents $85,000 . . . <em>.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>No objection was made concerning this figure. A review <em>\u00fai </em>the record satisfies us that under all the circumstances, the court\u2019s failure to permit the defendant\u2019s physical access to the plaintiff\u2019s personal income tax returns was not harmful error.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The defendant next claims that the court erred when it failed to consider article first, \u00a7 20 of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in acting on her motion for modification of alimony. She argues that neither General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 nor any other statute \u201cstate [s] exactly that the court must take into consideration the unpaid contribution that the wife has made to the accumulation of marital property.\u201d Alleging that she spent fifteen of the most productive years of her life at home so as to provide a comfortable lifestyle for the parties and their children, she claims that several years prior to the divorce, with the family savings and a loan, the plaintiff was able to open a drug store in Rhode Island that has proven to be profitable and that in turn provided him the means of opening another drug store in that state. She points out that legislatures and courts are beginning to recognize how much a woman gives up when she leaves the work world for the home.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thereafter, she goes on to say \u201cthat at no time either during the time of the divorce or on any of the subsequent modifications has the unpaid service of the wife as homemaker been considered in the award\u201d and that the amount awarded is \u201cdiscriminatory and unequi-table [sic].\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>We cannot even reach what seems to be a gender-based claim of discrimination because the record before us provides an inadequate basis for considering it. There is simply no evidence that either the court at the time of the divorce in 1966 or the court involved in any of the \u201csubsequent modifications\u201d did or did not consider the \u201cunpaid service of the wife as homemaker.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We do note that the divorce was granted in 1966 as an uncontested matter.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Over the years the defendant\u2019s alimony payments have been increased from $37.50 per week in 1966 to $125 per week in 1980. An examination of those transcripts which have been filed demonstrates that the trial judge on the modification appealed from explored and considered all the practical concerns that were evident. Facts supporting the claim must appear. <em>Williston </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>76 Conn. 497, 503, 57 A. 170 (1904); see Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 310. Although the defendant makes the claim with reference to herself, the lack of a factual predicate to frame the constitutional issue properly presents, in effect, an abstract question. It is apparent that \u201c[qjuestions of constitutional law presented in abstract rather than concrete form are not susceptible of proper determination.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>171 Conn. 691, 693, 372 A.2d 102 (1976). This claim is, therefore, not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In accordance with the parties\u2019 manner of presentation, we treat in combination the next three claims of error. These include the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>claims that the court erred when it failed: (1) to consider the fact that the original divorce was granted in 1966 prior to the enactment into law of the No Fault Divorce Law, Public Act No. 73-373; (2) to adhere to the criteria set out in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 for awarding alimony; and (3) to apply the criteria for modification of alimony and child support set out in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The argument that the court committed error when it failed to consider that the original divorce decree was granted in 1966 before the advent of No Fault would require that we accord retroactive effect to Public Act No. 73-373. The defendant points out that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> was not in effect when the parties were divorced in 1966. She goes on to say that this statute provides that among the factors that a court shall consider in \u201cfixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned . . . are the opportunity of each [party] for future acquisition of capital assets and income . . . [and] the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d The defendant then claims that at the time of the 1966 divorce she \u201cdid not receive an equitable share of the accumulated material wealth even though the divorce was granted under the fault concept.\u201d She also maintains that, with the advent of No Fault divorce and the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Connecticut constitution, the \u201c \u2018ground rules\u2019 in awarding alimony and child support have changed\u201d and \u201c[i]t is now assumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>marriage is more of an equal partnership whereby each spouse has the same equal opportunity to secure their rights under the law.\u201d The circumstances of this case, including the fact that the original decree has had subsequent modifications including the present one, do not require that we answer the question as posed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We do, however, point out that this court has consistently expressed its reluctance to construe statutes as having retrospective application. See, e.g., <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>174 Conn. 219, 222, 384 A.2d 378 (1978); <em>East Village Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>173 Conn. 328, 332, 377 A.2d 1092 (1977). \u201cGenerally, a statute effecting substantial changes in the law or an amendatory act which causes changes in existing statutes is not to be given a retroactive effect unless it clearly and unequivocally appears that such was the legislative intent . . . .\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>177 Conn. 327, 331, 416 A.2d 1201 (1979). Chapter 815j of the General Statutes is entitled \u201cDissolution of Marriage, Legal Separation and Annulment\u201d and encompasses 46b-40 through 46b-88. Section 46b-69<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> of Chapter 815j is entitled \u201cStatutes appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>cable to matrimonial actions\u201d and concerns the operative dates of various statutes with reference to the institution and pendency of certain appeals, actions and motions including \u00a7 46b-86 (\u201cModification of alimony or support orders and judgments\u201d) and \u00a7 46b-82 (\u201cAlimony\u201d). There is nothing in \u00a7 46b-69 which indicates a legislative intent that the statutes relevant to this appeal have the retrospective effect the defendant seems to claim. See also <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>165 Conn. 777, 784n, 345 A.2d 5 (1974); <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>165 Conn. 742, 748n, 345 A.2d 21 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">We do not want to leave this branch of this issue without pointing out that while it is true that \u00a7 46b-81 was not in effect in 1966 as the defendant states, \u00a7 46-21 of the 1958 revision of the General Statutes (repealed, Public Acts 1973, No. 73-373, \u00a7 43) permitted alimony to take the form of not only an award of periodic payments from income, but also an assignment of a part of the husband\u2019s estate or both. <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>171 Conn. 213, 215, 368 A.2d 202 (1976). Alimony and property assignments, however, are now, unlike the situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>prior to the enactment of Public Act No. 73-373, covered by two separate statutes, i.e., \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82. See <em>Dubicki </em>v. <em>Dubicki, </em>186 Conn. 709, 713-14, 443 A.2d 1268 (1982); <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Pasquariello, </em>168 Conn. 579, 582-83, 362 A.2d 835 (1975). The standards by which courts determine the amount of property assigned and alimony awarded are the same. \u201cIn assigning marital property . . . \u2018the trial court must also consider the liabilities of the parties, \u201cthe opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income . . . [and] the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).\u201d\u2019 <em>Dubicki </em>v. <em>Dubicki, </em>supra, 714-15. Despite the fact that this language was not explicitly contained in \u00a7 46-21 in 1966, \u201c[u]nder the former statutes, we have repeatedly held that the trial court, in a divorce action, has wide discretion in the type and amount of alimony awarded; <em>Krieble </em>v. <em>Krieble, </em>168 Conn. 7, 8, 357 A.2d 475 [1975]; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>166 Conn. 476, 488, 352 A.2d 277 [1974]; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wood </em>[supra, 783]; and property transferred. <em>LaBella </em>v. <em>LaBella, </em>134 Conn. 312, 318, 57 A.2d 627 [1948].\u201d <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Pasquariello, </em>supra. The trial court in 1966 thus had the authority to fashion relief that was just and equitable and to consider the factors later explicitly set out in \u00a7 46b-81 even though \u00a7 46b-81 had not yet been passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court eried in failing to adhere to the criteria for awarding alimony as set out in \u00a7 46b-82 and to consider the criteria for awarding alimony and child support as set out in \u00a7 46b-86. We do not agree. The defendant argues that \u201cthe information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>put before the court was sufficient to show there had been a drastic change in the circumstances of the parties <em>since the time of the divorce \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) She claims in her brief that the financial affidavits of the parties filed in August, 1977, her \u201cextensive cross examination of the plaintiff\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> on July 28, 1978, and the report of the court-appointed accountant dated September 12, 1978, have proven a wide disparity between her income and that of the plaintiff. The orders entered, she continues, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s extensive income and holdings, constitute an abuse of judicial discretion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The defendant is correct in stating that there is a \u201cwide disparity\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> between her income and that of the plaintiff but she is incorrect in arguing that a drastic change in the circumstances of the parties since the time of the divorce is the standard the court should have followed in making its determination under \u00a7\u00a7 46b-82 and 46b-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u201cIt is well settled in this state that a \u2018modification [of alimony] is not warranted unless there has been a substantial change in the circumstances of either party, occurring subsequent to the entry of the original decree, and not contemplated by the parties at that time.\u2019 <em>Sanchione </em>v. Sanchione, 173 Conn. 397, 407, 378 A.2d 522 (1977); see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86(a); <em>Bunche </em>v. <em>Bunche, </em>180 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>285, 290, 429 A.2d 874 (1980); <em>Grinold </em>v. <em>Grinold, </em>172 Conn. 192, 195, 374 A.2d 172 (1976).\u201d <em>Noce </em>v. <em>Noce, </em>181 Conn. 145, 147-48, 434 A.2d 345 (1980). \"Where, however, there has \"been any modification granted since the entry of the original decree, a subsequent modification, such as the one before us, would depend upon changed circumstances arising not since the original decree, but since the date of the earlier modification. See <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>187 Conn. 380, 383n, 446 A.2d 796 (1982); <em>Theonnes </em>v. <em>Theonnes, </em>181 Conn. 111, 114, 434 A.2d 343 (1980). \u201c[A] broad range of circumstances is relevant in deciding whether a decree of alimony may be modified. <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 264, 413 A.2d 854 (1979); <em>Sanchione </em>v. <em>Sanchione, </em>173 Conn. 397, 401-402, 378 A.2d 522 (1977).\u201d <em>Cummock </em>v. <em>Cummock, </em>180 Conn. 218, 221, 429 A.2d 474 (1980). Having found a change in circumstances, the trial court, based on a number of hearings, an assessment of the parties, a large quantity of input on the financial aspects and its articulated concerns demonstrating its awareness of the statutory criteria, entered the orders which are the subject of this appeal. Without repeating the circumstances again, we conclude that the record reveals that the trial court properly considered the criteria of \u00a7 46b-82 and that it could reasonably have concluded as it did. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>187 Conn. 144, 146, 444 A.2d 1377 (1982); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>187 Conn. 142, 143, 444 A.2d 1376 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Much of what we have said in our discussion about the claim of error directed to the order on alimony also can be applied to that portion of the motion to modify insofar as it applies to child support. The claim that the court erred in this respect is not addressed at any length in the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>brief. The one child, aged seventeen in 1980,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> who is still in the custody of the defendant, must be provided for and the parties appear to be desirous of doing so.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u201cIt is elementary that, before an order as to custody or support of children may be modified, or support terminated, there must have been a \u2018substantial change of circumstances\u2019 after the order was issued. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a); <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>161 Conn. 452, 459-60, 289 A.2d 909 (1971); <em>Tippin </em>v. <em>Tippin, </em>148 Conn. 1, 3, 166 A.2d 448 (1960); 24 Am.

On this motion for modification of child support, we are satisfied from all the circumstances that the court considered the statutory criteria and that it could reasonably conclude as it did. <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>supra; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court erred by failing to allow her to give-her \u201csummarizing argument\u201d after the plaintiff\u2019s attorney gave his, thus depriving her of an opportunity to rebut his argument, to state her dissatisfaction about the way the financial matters were concluded and to raise claims under the sixth, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. This claim is without merit. The defendant does not set out in her brief any citations to the transcript demonstrating that she was prevented from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>making any such argument.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (b), (c) (3).

Mrs. Cersosimo told the court that she had telephoned Bascom and the court questioned her as follows: \u201cThe Court: You have indicated Mrs. Cersosimo, that his [Baseom\u2019s] statement to you was that he had not examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>personal returns?\u201d The defendant answered: \u201cAccording to what he said to me on the phone, no, and the only thing that he had examined were the tax returns from Granite Drug, Incorporated, of Westerly and Granite Drug of Coventry, and I did not see either of those . . . .\u201d The defendant maintained that she understood she was to see them. The family relations officer told the court that \u201cMr. Cersosimo has regularly stated reservations about showing the personal income tax return to Mrs. Cersosimo. He says he will show it to me, he will show it to another accountant, but he feels that certain aspects I suppose relative to \u2014 I\u2019m guessing, this is relative to his wife\u2019s income or whatever. So what should be the ground rules? . . .\u201d Thereupon, the court asked the defendant: \u201cAre you totally pro se, Mrs. Cersosimo, you don\u2019t have another counsel of record?\u201d Her answer was, \u201c[n]o, not at this point.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> The court\u2019s direction to Mr. Colucci was as follows: \u201cThe Court: I think at this point, the Court, because this has been a ease of long standing and it\u2019s been quite problematic, I would be inclined to have the parties present with you. I would have you examine the personal tax returns.

This is incorrect. On February 27, 1979, sometime after the court had ordered the appointment of an independent accountant and after he had submitted a written report dated September 12, 1978, of which the defendant had a copy prior to February 27, 1979, the court heard the defendant\u2019s concerns with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s financial situation. At that time, the court ordered another meeting to address those concerns including those appearing to arise from the plaintiff\u2019s income tax returns. After the court indicated that Colucci would try to answer her questions at that time from these personal income tax returns, the defendant objected that \u201cas a pro se litigant representing myself, Tour Honor I really object to the fact that I am not allowed to look at these records.\u201d The defendant did not file, according to the record before us, the motion for production, disclosure and examination and the objection we now address until over a year later, i.e., on April 24, 1980, shortly before the final hearing of May 5, 1980. We do, however, address the motion and the objection because the court, on February 27, 1979, did respond to her pro se statement that \u201c[y]ou may make a formal objection for the record at such time as the report is made to the Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\"> On February 27, 1979, the court, while listening to the report of Colueei concerning the accountant\u2019s report, did say: \u201cAs to the personal tax return ... if Mrs. Cersosimo herself had counsel, counsel would have an opportunity to examine those tax returns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b408-5\"> The defendant, in her preliminary statement of issues, alleges that the court erred \u201cin not enforcing requirement according to section 380 [now section 463] of the Conn. Practice Book [financial affidavits].\u201d It is the only one of her preliminary statement of issues not set out as an \u201cissue\u201d in her brief. There is no meaningful discussion of the cursory allusion to financial affidavits in her brief let alone any discussion of how she was at all prejudiced. It is not discussed in the plaintiff\u2019s brief very probably because it was not pursued on appeal. \u201cWhere an assignment of error is to be pursued, it must be briefed. Any other rule would work an injustice and hardship on the adverse party. <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>148 Conn. 631, <em>633, 173 </em>A.2d 543 <em>[1961].\u201d Fleischer </em>v. <em>Kregelstein, </em>150 Conn. 158, 160, 187 A.2d 241 (1962). Assignments of error are deemed to be abandoned where they are merely mentioned in the brief without any discussion of the particular issues involved. See <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>163 Conn. 345, 349, 307 A.2d 146 (1972) ; <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>162 Conn. 89, 109, 291 A.2d 721 (1971).
