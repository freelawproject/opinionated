Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aqj-dedup-0\">The defendant, Juan Corchado, was tried by a jury and found guilty of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1). He was sentenced to a term of not less than five years and not more than ten years. In this appeal, the defendant alleges three claims of error:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) that the court erroneously instructed the jury on the law of self-defense; (2) that the court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal in that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence; and (3) that the court erred by not instructing the jurors that they could infer that the defendant was innocent because he summoned the police and surrendered to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">From the evidence presented at trial the jury could have found the following facts: The defendant lived at 1196 State Street in Bridgeport, where he was the superintendent of the building. The defendant\u2019s job required him to collect and to carry rent money. For his protection he owned a gun for which he had a permit. He had been separated from his wife for five years. In the interim, he had lived with another woman, Luz Bosco, for approximately four to five years. He had two children by her whom he raised along with a third child of Bosco\u2019s. At the time of the incident, Bosco was living at 29 Russell Street in Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The incidents leading directly to the victim\u2019s death occurred on November 17, 1979. The defendant had been in Hartford on that day. He left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Ms gun at Bosco\u2019s house on Russell Street because two of his guns had previously been stolen from his State Street residence. Upon returning to Bosco\u2019s house at approximately 11 p.m., he noticed a car owned by Raphael Ventura parked outside. The defendant suspected that Ventura had been seeing Bosco and had talked to him about it on a few previous occasions. When he knocked on the door it took Bosco a few moments before she opened it. She seemed upset and nervous. After seeing Ventura\u2019s coat in the house, the defendant went outside. He saw Ventura, who had gone out the back door, trying to get into his ear. The defendant approached Ventura and asked him whether he had been \u201cfooling around\u201d with Bosco. Ventura then pulled out a gun and pointed it at him. The defendant turned around and ran back into the house. Once inside, Bosco grabbed hold of him and told him not to go outside again. He pushed her away and started looking for his gun, which Bosco had hidden under her mattress. Shortly thereafter, he found his gun and his shoulder holster, which he put on underneath his coat. At this point, Bosco managed to calm him down. They sat down, had coffee and talked. Neither the defendant nor Bosco called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Within a half hour after Ventura had first pointed a gun at the defendant, the defendant decided to go back to his house, but he told Bosco that he was first going to get some beer out of his car to leave for Bosco\u2019s brother. By that time he thought Ventura had left. When he went outside, however, he heard Ventura call him. Ventura was seated in his car which was parked in the middle of the road, about twenty to thirty feet from the front of Bosco\u2019s house, with its lights on and the motor running. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>defendant went over to the ear and asked Ventura if he was fooling around with Bosco. Ventura did not answer but merely made a \u201cmean smile.\u201d The defendant then slapped Ventura in the face with the back of his hand through the driver\u2019s side window which was open. Ventura then took out a gun with his right hand, pulled it across his chest and pointed it at the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the same time, he began to get out of the ear. Upon seeing Ven-tura\u2019s gun, the defendant, who testified that he knew he was going to be shot, immediately pulled out his gun and fired a shot at Ventura. At this point, Bosco, who had been observing the situation, went inside to try and contact the police. Ventura fell back after being shot and then started to get out of the car again. The defendant did not see whether Ventura still had his gun, although he testified that he felt he did, and proceeded to shoot him three or four more times.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ventura managed to get out and to walk to the rear of the car where he fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The defendant then went inside Bosco\u2019s house where he emptied his gun and telephoned the police. When the police arrived, he gave himself up and stated that the shooting was in self-defense. He was taken to the police station where he gave two statements. Bosco also went to the police station to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred in its instructions to the jury on the law of self-defense and provocation. He argues that error was committed because the court gave certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>instructions pursuant to a request to charge submitted by the state<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was substantially different from the Connecticut law on this matter. He points to those instructions he claims are erroneous, setting out that the court told the jury that \u201cany direct personal assault made in anger by the accused, upon the deceased, of course, renders the accused the aggressor, and when he kills the person assailed, precludes him from pleading self defense\u201d; that \u201ca person is the aggressor when he leaves a quarrel to go to his home to arm himself, and then returns to the scene of the quarrel and kills the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>other person\u201d;<footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that homicide is justifiable when the defendant \u201cis without fault and is attacked and reasonably believing that he is in danger of death or great bodily harm kills his attacker to defend himself.\u201d Additionally, the defendant claims that \u201ceven if the no fault law and other contentions requested by the Prosecution and given to the jury by the Court\u201d had been the common law of this state, it is \u201caxiomatic that the Connecticut statutes now take precedence over the common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The state, referring to the instructions objected to, together with instructions which immediately followed, states that \u201c[t]he above portion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the jury instructions while not in the exact language of the statute [General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19] certainly did convey its meaning and its application to this case to the jury.\u201d Moreover, it claims that the instructions \u201cmet the test of being correct in law and sufficient to guide the jury.\u201d It also claims that because there is \u201cno discernible constitutional issue properly encompassed by this appeal,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>test to be applied to the court\u2019s instruction, which it agrees must be considered as a whole, is whether it is \u201creasonably probable\u201d that the jury were misled by the attacked instructions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>182 Conn. 262, 268, 438 A.2d 80 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>167 Conn. 408, 422, 356 A.2d 147 (1974). Referring to <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>185 Conn. 372, 441 A.2d 561 (1981), the state also disagrees with the defendant\u2019s claim that the statutes on self-defense take precedence over the common law. It argues that where jury instructions are based on a statute, the statute \u201cundiluted\u201d is not all that is to be given the jury, but also common law or materials from texts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find error in the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We begin our analysis by determining the proper standard of review to be applied to the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>instructions. \u201cIn appeals not involving a constitutional question the court must determine whether it is reasonably probable that the jury were misled; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tropiano, </em>158 Conn. 412, 427, 262 A.2d 147, cert. denied, 398 U.S. 949, 90 S.

Ed. 2d 241 (1967).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>182 Conn. 262, 268, 438 A.2d 80 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We have said that \u201c[a] fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974). This fundamental constitutional right includes proper jury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (a).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">\u201cTo determine whether an error in a charge constitutes reversible error, the court must consider the whole charge. <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.

In considering the charge as a whole we eschew critical dissection; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>172 Conn. 223, 226, 374 A.2d 203 (1977); thereby not passing upon the instructions attacked in \u201cartificial isolation\u201d from the whole charge. See <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S. Ct. 396, 38 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1973); <em>Mazzucco </em>v. <em>Krall Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>172 Conn. 355, 357, 374 A.2d 1047 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>172 Conn. 65, 69, 372 A.2d 154 (1976). The charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 269; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 226; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>153 Conn. 540, 544, 219 A.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In addressing the codification of the self-defense principle in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we have noted that \u201c[t]he statutes which enumerate the situations where the use of force is justified \u2018attempt to restate the common law. They should be read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>in the light of their common law background, and the fact that an individual section does not fully state the relevant common law rule, with all its possible applications, exceptions or implications, should not prevent a court from reading it as incorporating the full body of common law rules relevant thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>185 Conn. 372, 379, 441 A.2d 561 (1981), quoting the Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Connecticut Penal Code, comments 5-6 (1972). In referring to <em>Shaw, </em>the state argues that \u201cthe law of self-defense embraces not only the statutes but also the common law,\u201d and that \u201c [i] f the statutes and/or the common law interpreted in conjunction with each other substantiate the jury instructions they would be in harmony with the law.\u201d While these arguments, as general statements, generate a superficial appeal, that appeal becomes specious insofar as it refers to <em>Shaw </em>as authority for \u201csubstantiating\u201d the instructions attacked in this ease. <em>Shaw, </em>which involved a completely different factual pattern from this case, drew on Connecticut common law for support; there is no real indication that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>did so here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Shaw, </em>the instructions in this case are so different from the statute that they blunt to the point of reversible error those provisions of \u00a7 53a-19 critically significant on the law and to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The self-defense statute, i.e., General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19, in subsection (a) provides in part, subject to the exceptions in subsections (b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (c): \u201ca person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself . . . <em>from what he reasonably believes </em>to be the use or imminent use of physical force, and he may use such degree of force <em>which he reasonably believes </em>to be necessary for such purpose . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute focuses on the person, here the defendant Corchado, claiming self-defense. It focuses on what <em>he </em>reasonably believes under the circumstances and presents a question of fact. This subsection also makes clear that such a person may not use \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> unless he <em>reasonably </em>believes that the other person is either \u201cusing or about to use deadly physical force\u201d or is \u201cinflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d This statutory emphasis upon the defendant further demonstrates the function of the jury in their evaluation of the self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The same statute, in subsection (c), provides that \u201c [n] otwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a person is not justified in using physical force when (1) <em>with intent </em>to cause physical injury or death to another person, he <em>provokes </em>the use of physical force by such other person, or (2) he is the <em>initial aggressor </em>. . . (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (c). This defendant, therefore, cannot avail himself of the justification provisions of subsection (a) where, under (c), he is proven to have acted with the requisite intent to provoke under (c) (1) or he is proven to be the initial aggressor under (c) (2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether the defendant did, in fact, act with such intent and whether he was the initial aggressor are critical circumstances in the jury\u2019s evaluation of his claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The court told the jury, quoting from the state\u2019s request, that \u201c [h] omicide is classified as justifiable when the defendant is without fault and is attacked and reasonably believing that he is in danger of death or great bodily harm kills his attacker to defend himself.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We believe that the words \u201cwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>out fault,\u201d coming as they did at the start of the challenged instructions in combination with the other challenged instructions, as they impacted the jury, even in the context of the whole charge, erroneously deprived the defendant of the fair intendment of \u00a7 53a-19. The term \u201cwithout fault\u201d was neither explained nor defined. The statute does not provide that a person be \u201cwithout fault\u201d to come within its reach. It is not difficult to visualize self-defense situations where, as here, there is some fault on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Much is made of the slap given the victim by the defendant just before the fatal shooting, after the former had made a \u201cmean smile.\u201d The slap, of course, is to be viewed not only as a response to the \u201cmean smile\u201d but also in light of the earlier altercation in which the victim had pointed a gun at the then unarmed defendant after the defendant had accused him of \u201cfooling around\u201d with Bosco. Thus, to a layman on a jury, there was some \u201cfault\u201d on both sides. Yet \u201cwithout fault,\u201d open ended as it was in context, propounded an absolute for the jury while the statute does not. Its use served, at the very least, to dilute the right of the jury to assess the defendant\u2019s conduct, including his intent, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>what reasonably appeared to him under the circumstances. Instructions should be reviewed, inter alia, in terms of their effect upon the jurors who heard them; see <em>Hally </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>162 Conn. 352, 360, 294 A.2d 305 (1972); and so are to be read \u201cto convey normal meanings to juries in the context of the case in which they are given\u201d; <em>City of Aurora </em>v. <em>Woolman, </em>165 Colo. 377, 382, 439 P.2d 364 (1968); and \u201cas the jury might reasonably understand . . . [them].\u201d <em>Lazzari </em>v. <em>State Marine Corporation of Delaware, </em>230 Or. 372, 377, 369 P.2d 693 (1962); see <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 517-19, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); <em>Frankovitch </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>185 Conn. 14, 23, 440 A.2d 254 (1981); 89 C.J.S., Trials \u00a7 427. The plain meaning of \u201cwithout fault\u201d interposed a bar- to consideration by the trier of fact whether, on balance, the defendant was without that degree of fault which precluded his invocation of \u00a7 53a-19. See <em>Gaulton </em>v. <em>Reno Paint &amp; Wallpaper Co., </em>177 Conn. 121, 127, 412 A.2d 311 (1979); <em>Slepski </em>v. <em>Williams Ford, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 18, 23, 364 A.2d 175 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We take up now the balance of the instructions attacked. The court charged the jury that \u201c[a]ny direct personal assault made in anger, by the accused, upon the deceased, of course, renders the accused the aggressor, and when he kills the person assailed, precludes him from pleading self-defense.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the court told the jury that \u201c[i]t has been held that self-defense may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>claimed by one who deliberately places himself in a position where he has reason to believe his presence would provoke trouble.\u201d Moreover, it also instructed the jury that \u201c[i]t is also a concept of our law, lady and gentlemen, that a person is the aggressor when he leaves a quarrel to go to his home to arm himself, and then returns to the scene of the quarrel and kills the other person.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Initially, we note that singly, and certainly collectively, these instructions, fairly construed, foreclosed the defendant from his right to have the jury pass upon his claim of self-defense under \u00a7 53a-19. This is principally, if not entirely so, because the instructions, in effect, made bim the initial aggressor not only because of the slapping incident<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but also because he returned to the scene after arming himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The state argues in its brief that the defendant\u2019s argument concerning the slap \u201cis not relevant to this case since it did not provoke Ventura to use physical force. And even if the slap did provoke Ventura to the use of physical force the subsequent shooting was not justified since Corchado was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>initial aggressor.\u201d We disagree for several reasons. First, it was relevant because it clearly had a bearing on the existence of facts the jury were ultimately required to determine, i.e., on the issue of self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belanger, </em>148 Conn. 57, 59, 167 A.2d 245 (1961); see <em>Delmore </em>v. <em>Polinsky, </em>132 Conn. 28, 31, 42 A.2d 349 (1945). Second, it was relevant to the claim that the slap did not provoke Ventura to the use of physical force; immediately thereafter Ventura did point his gun at the defendant. From the viewpoint of the defendant under \u00a7 53a-19 (a) \u201cfrom what he [the defendant] reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of . . . force ...\u201d a question of fact for the trier arises on the issue of provocation including the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent under \u00a7 53a-19 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">These instructions, therefore, include some \u201cdirected verdict\u201d language, i.e., \u201ca person is the aggressor when he leaves a quarrel to go to his home to arm himself, and then returns to the scene of the quarrel and kills the other person,\u201d which serves to preclude the jury not only from determining Corchado\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d under \u00a7 53a-19 (c), but also from determining what he \u201creasonably believes\u201d under \u00a7 53a-19 (a), including the propriety of the quantum of force he employed \u2014 all of which went to the issue of justification of his conduct. The instructions did not inform the jury that they might distinguish between force which is deadly yet reasonable and force which, although not deadly, is unreasonable. The instructions also prevented the jurors from knowing that it was for them to decide whether the defendant, by slapping the victim or returning to the scene after arming himself, intended to cause physical injury or death as well as whether he reasonably believed his action would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>provoke the grave response of being threatened with a gun (which he had no reason to know was inoperable).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">While certain instructions and the applicable principles of law on self-defense were correctly stated, intermixed with these were material instructions, to which we have alluded, which were clearly erroneous. <em>Natale </em>v. <em>White, </em>158 Conn. 618, 619, 262 A.2d 184 (1969); <em>Gaul </em>v. <em>Noiva, </em>155 Conn. 218, 220, 230 A.2d 591 (1967); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 404-405, 435 A.2d 1002 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1086, 101 S.

The defendant filed a request to charge which first pointed out that the flight of one accused of crime is one circumstance, which considered with all the facts, may justify an inference of guilt. It then went on to request the following charge: \u201cTherefore, if you find that Juan Corchado, after shooting Raphael Ventura, immediately called the police, waited for them and surrendered to them then you may infer, when considering these facts with all the other facts of the case, that Juan Corchado is innocent.\u201d The court did not grant the request and an exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The defendant argues that \u201c[i]f the law allows an instruction that flight may imply guilt then it is only fair that the law provide an instruction that surrender implies innocence and that a Defendant who surrenders is telling the truth.\u201d The failure to give this instruction, the defendant continues, violates his due process right to a fair trial and to equal protection of the laws under both the United States and the Connecticut constitutions. The defendant cited no authority at all in his request. See Practice Book \u00a7 852. Moreover, neither in his request to charge nor in his exception in the trial court after the charge did the defendant give any indication of the constitutional claims he now makes for the first time on appeal. \u201c \u2018The general rule against considering claims not raised at trial, Practice Book \u00a7 3063, applies also to constitutional issues. <em>Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>178 Conn. 640, 425 A.2d 124 (1979); <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Valley Investors, </em>174 Conn. 77, 84, 384 A.2d 321 (1977).\u2019 \u201d <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>186 Conn. 490, 505, 442 A.2d 911 (1982), quoting <em>Burritt Mutual Sav</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>ings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 377, 439 A.2d 396 (1981).

At oral argument before this court, counsel for the defendant abandoned this claim as being a distinct issue.
