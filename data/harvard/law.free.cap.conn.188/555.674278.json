Section 8-8 of the General Statutes, effective in pertinent part on September 1, 1971, provides that in the case of appeals to the Superior Court in zoning matters, \u201cthere shall be no right to further review except to the supreme court by certification for review . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The issue before us is to determine what effect the 1981 enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 51-197d (11) has had on the certification procedure of \u00a7 8-8. Section 51-197d (11) provides, for appeals brought to the Superior Court on or after July 1, 1981, that the Appellate Session of the Superior Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction of appeals from any final judgment or action in . . . any appeal taken ... to the superior court . . . from an administrative decision of an officer, board, commission or agency of the state or any political subdivision thereof.\u201d The instant appeal was brought to the Superior Court after July 1,1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">\u201cWhen two legislative enactments are in conflict and cannot reasonably be reconciled, the later one repeals the earlier one to the extent of the repug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>nance.\u201d <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>North Branford, </em>174 Conn. 556, 565, 392 A.2d 456 (1978). \u201c[T]he general rule is that a subsequent act will be found to have repealed the first by implication.\u201d <em>State ex rel.
