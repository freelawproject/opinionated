The defendants claim that, notwithstanding our recent decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 450 A.2d 828 (1982), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>178 Conn. 67, 420 A.2d 1153, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 950, 100 S. Ct. 423, 62 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1979), because they have entered pleas of nolo contendere and have been sentenced in the federal court on charges arising from the same underlying transaction, the state is barred from bringing them to trial in Superior Court by the principles of double jeopardy, equal protection and due process of law. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Both the state and federal prosecutions were instituted as a result of the defendants\u2019 alleged scheme to defraud the state of Connecticut by the use of improper bidding practices on state contracts. On October 17, 1978, the defendant McKenna was arrested and charged with a total of thirty counts of larceny in the first degree, larceny in the second degree, larceny by extortion and conspiracy. On the same day, the defendant DiMartino was also arrested and charged with thirty-four counts of the same offenses. On November 28, 1978, the defendants were indicted in federal court by way of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>joint indictment alleging thirty-five counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1342,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>and conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The defendants\u2019 cases first came to trial in federal court in May of 1979.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both defendants eventually filed pleas of nolo contendere.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 28, 1979, the defendant DiMartino, who had entered his plea to two of the counts of mail fraud in the indictment, was sentenced to concurrent terms of thirty days in jail on each count, given two years probation, and was ordered to pay a $2000 fine. The defendant McKenna, who had entered his plea to thirty-four counts of the indictment, was sentenced to one year in prison, suspended after four months incarceration, given eighteen months probation, and was ordered to pay a fine of $1000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The eases pending against the defendants in the state court were placed on the trial list in July of 1980. On November 13, 1980, the state filed a substitute information against each defendant charging twenty-seven counts of larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> two counts of larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>\u00a7 53a-123 (a) (2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit larceny in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On November 19, 1980, the defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss. They claimed that any further trial of either defendant, after the federal charges had been disposed of, would violate the double jeopardy clause of the United States constitution applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment; see <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969); which right is also implicit in the common law of Connecticut. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>178 Conn. 67, 77, 420 A.2d 1153 (1979).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They also claimed that the successive prosecutions would violate their rights to equal protection under the law and would amount to cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After a hearing on the matter, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, but granted their motion to stay the trial in order for them to take an interlocutory appeal. It is the trial court\u2019s decision denying the defendants\u2019 supplemental motion to dismiss that is now before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>This appeal is controlled by the cases of <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 450 A.2d 828 (1982), which had not been decided at the time the parties filed their briefs, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>snpra. In <em>Haskins, </em>we reaffirmed onr holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>supra, that \u201cneither federal nor state law barred sequential prosecution in our state courts for an offense for which the defendant had been acquitted or convicted in a federal court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 472. In effect, the concept of \u201cdual sovereignty\u201d; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 473, quoting <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 29, 98 S. Ct. 81, 54 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1977); renders the principles of double jeopardy inapplicable to this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Although the issue of equal protection is not properly before us, in the interests of judicial economy we will address it. The principle of dual sovereignty is also dispositive of the defendants\u2019 claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>that their rights to equal protection under the law will be violated if the state follows through with their prosecutions. The defendants in their brief argue that \u201c[i]t is <em>only </em>because there are two sovereigns . . . that these defendants are now threatened with the loss of their double jeopardy protection.\u201d (Emphasis added.). The defendants\u2019 argument misses the point. It is precisely because two sovereigns are involved that there is no equal protection violation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both the state of Connecticut and the federal government have \u201cthe power, inherent in any sovereign, independently to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>what shall be an offense against its authority and to punish such offenses, and in doing so each \u2018is exercising its own sovereignty, not that of the other.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>435 U.S. 313, 320, 98 S. Ct. 1079, 55 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1978).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the class of similarly situated individuals who are to be treated equally; see <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>179 Conn. 627, 636, 427 A.2d 830 (1980); is limited to persons charged with a crime in the state courts of Connecticut. As is evident from what we have said, any such person in Connecticut is equally subject to a state court prosecution regardless of whether that person has previously been convicted or acquitted in federal court. Therefore, there is no equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In oral argument before this court, counsel for the defendants vigorously contended that, despite the decision in <em>Haskins, </em>there was an alternate basis for holding that the defendants\u2019 prosecution in state court should be barred. His position was that it was fundamentally unfair to bring these defendants to trial again after serving sentences resulting from similar federal charges. Therefore, he argues that this court accept responsibility for supervising what occurs in the trial court prosecution in this case and to dismiss the prosecution. No law was cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>as to this court\u2019s authority to undertake such action; their claim, however, is that the concept is rooted in the <em>Haskins </em>decision. The defendants also argue in their brief that we reach beyond <em>Moeller, </em>and therefore, <em>Haskins, </em>to make the \u201cequitable analysis\u201d we are empowered to make and \u201cgrant these defendants the protection against double jeopardy offered them by the United States Constitution and the common law, and Article First, Section 8 of the Connecticut Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We have already held that the doctrine of \u201cdual sovereignty\u201d renders the principles of double jeopardy inapplicable to this case. Moreover, as will be seen, we cannot accept their claim that the state prosecution violates the \u201cdue process clause\u201d of article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, bottomed, as it is, on their \u201cfairness\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In <em>Haskins </em>we recognized that the problem of sequential prosecution \u201cdoes not arise in the federal courts because there the Attorney General of the United States, out of consideration of fairness to defendants and out of regard for efficient and orderly law enforcement, has foreclosed federal prosecutions once a person has been tried and acquitted or convicted in a state court for an offense that is also an offense against the United States. <em>Petite </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 U.S. 529, 80 S. Ct. 450, 4 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1960).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 472. We then went on to say: \u201cWere a similar policy to be adopted by the several state\u2019s attorneys as a matter of reciprocity as well as a matter of fairness, judicial assistance for the implementation of this policy would seem to be indicated. <em>Rinaldi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>v. <em>United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 29, 98 S. Ct. 81, 54 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 472-73. We are not aware that any such policy has yet been adopted and we are not empowered to dictate one. The court went on to note that the state\u2019s attorneys have broad discretion in deciding what crimes to charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 473-74, see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 289, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 664, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977). \u201cSo long as he acts within the jurisdiction of his office it is not appropriate for a court to set policy for the performance of his prosecutorial function.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 474, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 608, 610-11, 376 A.2d 74 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">This does not leave the defendants unprotected from the vagaries of prosecutorial discretion. \u201cThe primary duty of a prosecutor is to seek justice, not to merely convict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>180 Conn. 443, 455, 429 A.2d 936 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 568, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973); see also Code of Professional Responsibility, EC 7-13, Practice Book, p. 37. A state\u2019s attorney does not, however, overstep the bounds of propriety unless it is shown that the decision to prosecute is based primarily upon vindictiveness towards the defendant, or upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, sex, religion or other arbitrary classification. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 474; <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>supra, 664; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-7), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 338, 340, 420 A.2d 910 (1980).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> No such show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ing has been made in this case; the defendants did not present any evidence on this claim at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. Rather, the record merely contains a bald assertion that the motive of the chief state\u2019s attorney in bringing this case was that he was dissatisfied with the sentences the defendants had received in federal court. Even if this allegation were true, it would not, in and of itself, provide a basis for the relief requested on the record before us. See <em>Oyler </em>v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S. Ct. 501, 7 L.
