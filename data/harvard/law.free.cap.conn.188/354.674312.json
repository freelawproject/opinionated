The plaintiff husband in a dissolution action was adjudged the father of a child born to the defendant wife although both parties denied his paternity. He now appeals that judgment to this court on both evidentiary and constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Although the record below is sparse, the following evidence was available to the state trial referee sitting as trier of fact. Vicki Hill and Timothy Holland were married in February, 1976 and had one child, born later that year, whose paternity is not at issue. A second child was born to Vicki Holland on September 7, 1979 after a full term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>pregnancy. At the time surrounding the probable conception of this child, the plaintiff was incarcerated in Montville Community Correctional Center, where he remained from February 24, 1978 until February 1, 1979, except for a furlough on Christmas Day of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The plaintiff testified that he and the defendant last had sexual relations in February, 1978. He further testified that he spent his Christmas Day furlough at the home of his aunt, Mrs. Cardillo, in New London and had no contact with the defendant; Mrs. Cardillo and Vicki Holland both corroborated this account. The only meeting between the Hollands during the plaintiff\u2019s incarceration consisted of a visit by the defendant to the correctional center during which, according to the defendant, the parties sat and talked. The defendant testified that the father of the child was a man named Joseph Thomas who had first acknowledged and later disclaimed paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Although no further evidence of paternity was offered, the attorney representing the child submitted a report to the court in which he requested a finding that the plaintiff was the child\u2019s father. That request was based in part on an interview conducted by the child\u2019s counsel at which the plaintiff apparently at first falsely denied having received any furlough from prison. At trial no questions were asked of the plaintiff concerning this interview or his alleged denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In a brief oral memorandum of decision the trial court found both the defendant\u2019s children to be issue of the marriage, awarded custody to her, and ordered the plaintiff to pay child support of $20 per week for each child. On this appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>plaintiff raises two related claims of error: the insufficiency of the evidence to support the court\u2019s finding of paternity and the constitutional impropriety of the presumption of paternity in its allocation of the burden of proof.\" The defendant, although nominally the appellee, in fact supports the plaintiff\u2019s position and joins him in attacking the court\u2019s finding of paternity. The appeal is defended by the state of Connecticut, a mandatory party to the divorce action because at the time of the hearing it was contributing toward the support of the defendant and her older child, (xeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-55 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The younger child\u2019s counsel did not file an appellate brief, appear at oral argument, or otherwise participate in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">This court has only recently determined that \u201cin Connecticut there is a presumption that a child bom during lawful wedlock is the child of the husband, which presumption may be rebutted only by clear, convincing, and satisfactory proof that the child is illegitimate.\u201d <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>187 Conn. 224, 226, 445 A.2d 589 (1982); see <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Stimpson, </em>79 Conn. 617, 623, 66 A. 166 (1907); <em>Coffman </em>v. <em>Coffman, </em>121 Ariz. 522, 523, 591 P.2d 1010 (1979); <em>Happel </em>v. <em>Mecklenburger, </em>101 Ill. App. 3d 107, 112, 427 N.E.2d 974 (1981); <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>198 Neb. 401, 404, 253 N.W.2d 42 (1977); <em>Joan G. </em>v. <em>Robert W., </em>83 App. Div. 2d 838, 839, 441 N.Y.S.2d 709 (1981); <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>54 Ohio App. 2d 25, 30-31, 374 N.E.2d 654 (1977). In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>states, the presumption of paternity may be rebutted by different, more or less stringent, evidentiary showings. See <em>Vincent B. </em>v. <em>Joan R., </em>126 Cal. App. 3d 619, 622-23, 179 Cal. Rptr. 9 (1981) (conclusive presumption of legitimacy); <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>396 So. 2d 1024, 1026 (Miss. 1981) (beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Borchers </em>v. <em>McCarter, </em>592 P.2d 941, 944 (Mont. 1979) (preponderance of the evidence); see generally McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1972) \u00a7 343; 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed. 1940) \u00a7 2527. As applied to the facts of this case, the presumption of paternity requires the plaintiff to prove non-access to the defendant at the time of conception by evidence rising to the prescribed standard of clear, convincing and satisfactory proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The plaintiff first objects that the trial court misapplied the existing law in finding paternity where all the evidence offered at the hearing factually supported the opposite conclusion. Although it is true that both the plaintiff and the defendant testified without contradiction to the plaintiff\u2019s lack of access, neither party disputes the factfinder\u2019s role as arbiter of witness credibility. <em>Arbour </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>186 Conn. 280, 286, 440 A.2d 980 (1982); <em>Kukanskis </em>v. <em>Jasut, </em>169 Conn. 29, 32-33, 362 A.2d 898 (1975). In the event that the trier rejected their testimony as unworthy of belief, the presumption of legitimacy, which shifts the burden of persuasion to the proponent of illegitimacy, would require a finding that the plaintiff is the child\u2019s father. See <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>Amodeo, </em>118 Conn. 58, 64, 170 A. 486 (1934); <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>28 Conn. Sup. 348, 353, 261 A.2d 287 (1968); see generally F. James &amp; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1977) \u00a7 7.9; McCormick, supra, \u00a7 345, p. 826; Morgan, \u201cInstructing the Jury upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Presumptions and Burden of Proof,\u201d 47 Harv. L. Rev. 59 (1933); note, \u201cPresumption of Legitimacy of a Child Born in Wedlock,\u201d 33 Harv. L. Rev. 306 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In his second claim of error, the plaintiff argues that the presumption of legitimacy cannot constitutionally shift the burden of persuasion to him because paternity proceedings in Connecticut are sufficiently criminal in nature to invoke the constitutional doctrine that \u201cin criminal cases, the ultimate test of any device\u2019s constitutional validity in a given case remains constant: the device must not undermine the factfinder\u2019s responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by the State, to find the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 [90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 368 <em>(1970)]; Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. [684, 702-703 n.31, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975)].\u201d <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 156, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1979); see <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 524, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 582, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982) and cases cited therein. Without the presumption, he argues, there is no evidence of his paternity, and he has therefore been deprived of both liberty and property interests without due process of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The cornerstone of the plaintiff\u2019s argument is the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. 1, 101 S. Ct. 2202, 68 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1981), which held that Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>icut must pay the cost of blood tests for an indigent putative father in a paternity action. Id., 16. That decision rested in part on the following discussion of our paternity proceedings: \u201cThe nature of paternity proceedings in Connecticut also bears heavily on appellant\u2019s due process claim. Although the state characterizes such proceedings as \u2018civil,\u2019 see <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Apuzzo, </em>170 Conn. 367, 372-73, 365 A.2d 824, 827-28, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 852, 97 S. Ct. 142, 50 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976), they have \u2018quasi-criminal\u2019 overtones. Connecticut Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46b-171 (1981) provides that if a putative father \u2018is found <em>guilty, </em>the court shall order him to stand charged with the support and maintenance of such child\u2019 (emphasis added); and his subsequent failure to comply with the court\u2019s support order is punishable by imprisonment under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 46b-171, 46b-215, and 53-304 (1981). Cf. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>45 Ohio App. 2d 275, 278, 344 N.E.2d 159, 161 (1975); <em>People </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>261 App. Div. 86, 87, 24 N.Y.S.2d 821, 823 (1941).\u201d Id., 10. The plaintiff reads this language to mean that a paternity determination within a dissolution action must be accompanied by all the procedural safeguards required for a criminal prosecution. We reject this reading as overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Although we agree that a finding of paternity under the present circumstances entails both a loss of property in the form of support payments and a potential loss of liberty in the form of statutory sanctions for nonsupport, we do not view these consequences as sufficient under <em>Little </em>to transform a civil dissolution action into a criminal proceeding. We can see no relevant distinction under our statutes between the plaintiff\u2019s vulnerability and that of any spouse who upon dissolution is assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>comparable support obligations. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-82, 46b-84.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline to extend <em>Little\u2019s </em>characterization of paternity actions under General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-160<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> et seq., offered for the limited purpose of assigning to the state the cost of blood tests, to all civil actions with attendant statutory sanctions. The \u201c \u2018quasi-criminal\u2019 overtones\u201d detected by Chief Justice Burger echo too faintly in the present dissolution action to preclude the use of a burden-shifting presumption grounded in a universally accepted public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Although we therefore conclude that the trial court could properly apply the presumption of legitimacy to shift the burden of persuasion to the plaintiff, we find no indication in the record that it actually did so. In its brief and conclusory oral memorandum of decision, the trial court simply stated its finding that both children were issue of the plaintiff\u2019s marriage. Under ordinary circumstances we would seek to clarify the basis of decision by a remand for articulation. We are, however, troubled as well by the singularly barren evidentiary record before us, which leaves unanswered several relevant questions raised at the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also of importance that this case was decided shortly before the issuance of <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra. At oral argument counsel for the parties agreed that no blood tests were taken because both husband and wife were indigent at the time of the dissolution action, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceded that he elected to pursue an appeal rather than press a motion for court-ordered blood tests at the state\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">A decision attributing paternity is no less weighty than one terminating parental rights. See <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 758-59, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982); <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 13; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 581 (1972); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 10155), </em>187 Conn. 431, 435, 446 A.2d 808 (1982). We are therefore reluctant to act upon a seriously inadequate evidentiary record when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>authority now exists to secure highly probative blood test evidence for indigent parties. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 8; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 550, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1982). Consequently, we remand this case for the submission of additional evidence by the parties and for a fully articulated memorandum of decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-55.
