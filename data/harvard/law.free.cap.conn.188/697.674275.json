Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aru\">The issue on this appeal, as framed by the defendant, is whether the defendant Ricky Shockley was denied any federal or state constitutional right, statutory right or right prescribed by rule of court to be tried by a jury where he has been tried by a court after the trial judge accepted his election of a court trial without first advising him that he had an absolute right to be tried by a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>In order to pnt this issue in context certain factual circumstances must he set out. On July 24, 1978, the defendant was arrested and charged in a three count information with kidnapping in the second degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94a; sexual assault in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70a and burglary in the second degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At his arraignment on August 8, 1978, the defendant pleaded not guilty to each of the three counts and elected to be tried by a jury of six. On May 9, 1980, the defendant, represented by a public defender, had a hearing on his motion to suppress identification before the court, <em>D. Shea, J. </em>Prior to the court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress, the defendant withdrew all his pleas and elections on the three counts of the original information. He then entered, and the court accepted, a plea of guilty under the doctrine of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), to a substituted information which charged him with one count of sexual assault in the first degree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to accepting his <em>Alford </em>plea, the court informed him of the rights he would forego by his plea of guilty, including the right to have a trial and to have a jury decide his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>On June 18,1980, the defendant, then represented by recently retained private connsel, again appeared before the court, <em>D. Shea, J., </em>and moved for permission to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>plea. The defendant testified at the hearing on this motion and acknowledged that at the time he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea he was told that he was entitled to have a jury make the decision on his case. The court granted the motion, ordered that all \u201coriginal counts\u201d be reinstated and that all \u201coriginal pleas of not guilty\u201d be reentered and assigned the case for trial. At the request of the defendant, however, the court permitted him to defer his election of a court or jury trial until he could discuss that matter with his new attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On Friday, July 11,1980, the defendant appeared before the court, <em>A. Armentano, J., </em>with his private counsel at which time the state told the court: \u201c[I]n conferring with defense counsel, it is my understanding that there will be a change in the election; but, perhaps, your Honor could [sic] care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>to inquire.\u201d Defense counsel told the court that \u201c[i]t is my understanding Ricky Shockley would like to withdraw his jury election and \u2014 and have a trial to the Court, your Honor. I don\u2019t know whether your Honor would like to inquire; but that\u2019s my understanding.\u201d At that time the defendant pleaded not guilty to each of the three counts and elected a court trial on each count. The court then spoke to the defendant concerning his election.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that time the defendant acknowledged he knew he was entitled to a jury trial, that he could still have one if he wanted one, that he had a constitutional right to a jury trial, that a trial by court is by one judge and that he discussed it with his lawyer and \u201cwant to change to a Court, which is one judge . . . .\u201d In saying he understood that he had a constitutional right to a jury trial, he answered in the affirmative to the court\u2019s next question: \u201cYou can have it any time you want as you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>probably know.\u201d Thereafter, the court asked the defendant: \u201cDo yon have any questions whatsoever?\u201d The defendant answered \u201c[n]o.\u201d The court made a finding that the \u201c [d] efendant knowingly, willingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial and elected a trial by a Court, which is one judge . . .\u201d and also declared that the \u201c[c]ase is on trial now. . . .\u201d The case was then continued until Monday, July 14, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On July 14, 1980, just prior to calling the first witness, the state moved to file an amendment to the information adding two more counts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The proposed fourth count charged kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94 and the fifth count charged sexual assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2). In arguing that the motion be granted the state observed that both of these statutes permitted the charging and prosecution of a defendant both with and without a firearm, that both of such counts while includable under the existing counts could arguably, in the absence of a concession by the defense,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> not be lesser offenses because they were of the same degree. The court, <em>A. Armentano, J., </em>questioned the necessity of the amendment pointing out that the defendant \u201ccertainly can\u2019t be found guilty\u201d on the first and fourth counts at the same time and on the second and fifth counts at the same time because of the element of a firearm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court, however, granted the state\u2019s motion and directed that the defendant be put to plea on the added fourth and fifth counts. After he pleaded not guilty to each count, the following took place: \u201cThe Clerk: You elect a trial by court or by jury? The Defendant: Court: The Court: May we proceed? Anything else, Mr. Crowley? Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Gaffney?\u201d to which, counsel for the state and the defendant answered \u201c[n]o.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On July 15, 1980, after the state had rested its case, the court granted defense motions for judgment of acquittal on each of the three counts of the original information. Thereafter, on July 16, 1980, the defendant was found guilty on each of the counts added by the amendment of July 14, 1980. On August 18,1980, the court denied the defendant\u2019s written motion for a new trial and his written petition for a new trial<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and imposed sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendant essentially claims that he was denied his rights to a trial by jury under the United States and Connecticut constitutions, under state statute and under rule of court. He argues that he was entitled to a trial by jury under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, and under General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Furthermore, he claims that the mandatory procedure required by \u00a7 54-82b and Practice Book \u00a7 839<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in making his election of a court trial were not followed by the trial judge. Accordingly, he argues, there was no valid waiver demonstrated by the record of his right to trial by jury because of this \u201cplainly erroneous\u201d action of the trial court and a remand for a new trial is required. The state maintains that the record amply demonstrates that the defendant validly waived his right to a jury trial. In doing so, it claims that the defendant\u2019s arraignment on July 14, 1980, on the two added counts was unnecessary because these two counts were \u201csimply lesser included offenses of two of the original three crimes\u201d upon which he had already waived a jury trial. Alternatively, the state takes the position that even if an arraignment and election on July 14,1980, on the added counts was necessary, the record, nevertheless, still demonstrates a valid waiver by the defendant of his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Under both the United States and Connecticut constitutions the defendant was entitled to a trial by jury on the charges upon which he was presented and in fact tried. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491, reh. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>392 U.S. 947, 88 S. Ct. 2270, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1412 (1968) ;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7\u00a7 8, 19 <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> State </em>v. <em>Olds, </em>171 Conn. 395, 408, 370 A.2d 969 (1976). Any defendant may waive that right but only if he does so knowingly and intelligently. <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 237-38, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); <em>Singer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 U.S. 24, 34, 85 S. Ct. 783, 13 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1965). In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938), the United States Supreme Court articulated a classic definition of waiver in stating that it was ordinarily \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d We have said that \u201c[a] valid waiver of a constitutional right . . . must be knowing and intelligent, accomplished with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 293, 386 A.2d 243 (1978); see <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>U.S. 742, 748, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1970). \u201c \u2018[C]ourts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights and . . . \u2018do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra. In addition, a waiver of a fundamental constitutional right is not to be presumed from a silent record. See <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Even under this strict standard governing the waiver of constitutional rights the record in this case clearly demonstrates a knowing and voluntary waiver. This finding is not based solely on a reading of the events that transpired on July 14, 1980, immediately prior to the presentation of evidence. Rather our conclusion is based upon the whole record, particularly that of July 11, 1980, and July 14, 1980. \u201c[W]hether or not there is an intelligent, competent, self-protecting waiver of jury trial by an accused must depend upon the <em>unique circumstances of each case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 278, 63 S. Ct. 236, 87 L. Ed. 268 (1942) (Frankfurter, J.). The \u201cdetermination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver . . . must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra; see <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We are not faced with a silent record such as that found in such cases as <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Zerbst. </em>We have already chronicled this defendant\u2019s experiences and exposure in this case to the entering and withdrawal of pleas and elections. In addition, he was twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>three years old at the time of trial and had completed two years of high school. Prior to this case the defendant, charged with burglary, had pleaded guilty, under a substitute information, to a misdemeanor for which he was given probation. He had also pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct. His involvement with the law dated back to 1974. The defendant was not a novice in the criminal justice system on July 14, 1980. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>204 Kan. 418, 421, 463 P.2d 1020 (1970). Nor can it fairly be said that the record presents a picture of a defendant \u201cbewildered by court processes strange and unfamiliar to him . . . .\u201d See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>O\u2019Grady, </em>312 U.S. 329, 334, 61 S. Ct. 572, 85 L. Ed. 859 (1941). After the public defender ceased to represent him, private counsel was retained and appeared in court with him not only when he withdrew his <em>Alford </em>plea on June 18,1980,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but also on July 11,1980, and July 14, 1980. We do not take the position that the presence of retained counsel automatically means that the defendant\u2019s interests and rights are protected. It has been held, however, that \u201c[t]he fact of counsel being present and having advised the defendant is a factor to be considered in determining the question of the need for or sufficiency of any admonition given by the court.\u201d <em>Neller </em>v. <em>State, </em>79 N.M. 528, 534, 445 P.2d 949 (1968); see <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 647, 96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1976). On July 11, 1980, when the defendant changed his election from a jury trial to a court trial, the trial court asked the defendant if he was doing so <em>after </em>he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>talked to Ms lawyer, and the defendant so indicated. At that time the court asked him this <em>twice. </em>The defendant also indicated <em>twice </em>that he understood that he was changing his election to a court trial. Quite apart from the presence of counsel, the election of a court trial on July 14, 1980, to the added fourth and fifth counts, both in the inquiry of the trial court and the election by the defendant, must be viewed in context, especially with reference to the colloquy of July 11,1980, between the defendant and the same judge. Under these circumstances, we find that the defendant understood the consequences of his election of a trial to the court, and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his constitutional rights to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Our finding that the requirements of the state and federal constitutions have been fully complied with, however, does not put an end to our inquiry. The trial court did not follow the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b and Practice Book \u00a7 839. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b provides in part that \u201c[i]n criminal proceedings the judge shall advise the accused of his right to trial by jury at the time he is put to plea and, if the accused does not then claim a jury, his right thereto shall be deemed waived . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b (b). The Practice Book rule likewise provides that \u201c[t]he defendant in a criminal action may demand a trial by jury of issues which are triable of right by jury. If at the time he is put to plea, he elects a trial by the court, the judicial authority shall advise the defendant of his right to a trial by jury. If the defendant does not then elect a jury trial, his right thereto may be deemed to have been waived.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 839. In regard to these requirements, the defendant argues there is only \u201cone reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>interpretation [and that is that] at the same proceedings at which the defendant is put to plea, the judge must ask him if he wants a trial by jury or by the court.\u201d Accordingly, he concludes that the failure of the court so to advise him requires the reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We begin our analysis of this prong of the defendant\u2019s claim by pointing out that in the context of guilty pleas there is no constitutional requirement that the trial judge advise the defendant personally eo nomine as to each right the defendant is giving up by pleading guilty \u2014 one of those being the right to a jury trial. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L. Ed. 2d 749 (1970). The true substantive question is whether the election was in fact intelligently and voluntarily made and the record so demonstrates. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>169 Conn. 38, 46, 362 A.2d 499 (1975); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>264 Ark. 329, 333, 571 S.W.2d 591 (1978). The same concern must be relevant to this ease. The fact that the record does not disclose a waiver at the very moment of the election does not, per se, mandate reversal in this case. To do so here is \u201cto ignore the record and reality.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>431 U.S. 181, 188, 97 S. Ct. 1814, 52 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1977). We, therefore, hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendant validly waived his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>While the better practice is to have the record at the time of election literally disclose the inquiries of the court and the answers of the accused, a valid waiver may still be found in a given case if the record affirmatively discloses that the defendant intelligently and knowingly did waive his right to a trial by jury. See <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504, 392 N.E.2d 1186 (1979). Such a conclusion is not inconsistent with such cases as <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 522, 441 A.2d 41 (1981), where we determined the word \u201cshall\u201d in Practice Book \u00a7 594 was mandatory and not directory. In <em>Cook </em>we stated that \u201c[i]t has long been recognized that penal statutes and rules of criminal procedure are to be strictly construed to protect the fundamental constitutional right to liberty\u201d and accordingly applied the rule of strict construction to Practice Book \u00a7 594. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 522. While a penal statute<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> is subject to strict construction, we have also said that \u201c\u2018[t]he rule that penal statutes are to be strictly construed need not be applied so tightly that an obvious legislative purpose or intent is stifled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>103 Conn. 138, 141, 130 A. 96 [1925]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>118 Conn. 267, 273, 171 A. 660 [1934].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cataudella, </em>159 Conn. 544, 556, 271 A.2d 99 (1970); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Pastet, </em>169 Conn. 13, 21-22, 363 A.2d 41, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 937, 96 S. Ct. 297, 46 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sober, </em>166 Conn. 81, 91, 347 A.2d 61 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>153 Conn. 209, 215, 214 A.2d 903 (1965); <em>State </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>146 Conn. 605, 607-608, 153 A.2d 451 (1959). Moreover, \u201c[s]ound rules of statutory interpretation exist to discover and not to direct the Congressional will.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>United States ex rel. Marcus </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 542, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443, reh. denied, 318 U.S. 799, 63 S. Ct. 756, 87 L. Ed. 1163 (1943). It is a fair inference that the rule of narrow construction has a core interest in the concern of the law for individual rights. See <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S. Ct. 1262, 39 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In the present case, the \u201cevident design of the lawgiver\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pastet, </em>supra; whether the right here was based on constitutional or statutory grounds or on the rules of court, was obviously to protect the defendant as well as to foster the broad interest of society in the finality of such proceedings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>66 Ohio St. 2d 473, 478, 423 N.E.2d 115 (1981). We have already indicated that the constitutional rights of the defendant were amply protected when he chose a trial to the court. The defendant\u2019s rights are not protected only by adhering to a predetermined ritualistic form of making the record. \u201cMatters of reality, and not mere ritual, should be controlling.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 467-68 n.20, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969), quoting <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 F.2d 16, 17 (6th Cir. 1968); see <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>14 Ariz. App. 594, 595, 485 P.2d 583 (1971); <em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>7 Md. App. 657, 660, 256 A.2d 821 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>supra, 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The narrowness of our opinion can be emphasized by distinguishing this case from <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-8), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 551, 421 A.2d 867 (1980). There, the court noted that the record did not indicate \u201cthat the [trial] court at <em>any time </em>advised the defendant of his right to a jury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 554. In fact, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>actually made a motion for a jury trial which was denied by the trial court as being untimely.

I cannot, however, join the majority because when a statute or Practice Book rule is mandatory, it is clearly error for a court not to comply with it. General Statutes \u00a7 54-821)(b) provides, in relevant part: \u201cIn criminal proceedings the judge <em>shall </em>advise the accused of his right to trial by jury <em>at the time he is put to plea </em>and, if the accused does not <em>then </em>claim a jury, his right thereto shall be deemed waived. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)

When construing statutes, words are to be given their ordinary meaning. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1. \u201cUnless the text indicates otherwise, the word \u2018shall\u2019 must be assumed to have been used with full awareness of its ordinary meaning. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>181 Conn. 367, 371, 435 A.2d 996 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra; see also <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 426, 428-29, 226 A.2d 380 (1967). These rules of construction apply both to statutes and to the rules of practice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 839 is particularly applicable to the facts of this case. As mentioned above, that section states that if \u201cat the time he is put to plea, [the defendant] elects a trial by the court, the judicial authority shall advise the defendant of his right to a trial by jury.\u201d The rule describes exactly the situation confronting the trial court on July 14, 1980. The defendant was put to plea on two new counts, and he elected a trial to the court. The trial court, however, did not follow the mandate of the Practice Book and of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b(b) at the time of taking the pleas, because it did not inform the defendant of any rights at that time. On that day, only the court clerk addressed the defendant concerning his election of either a court or a jury trial. Because the trial court ignored the clear mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b(b) and Practice Book \u00a7 839, it committed error. Any attempt by this court to rationalize such clear error threatens to abrogate the meaning of the word \u201cshall\u201d in both the statute and the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The error committed here, however, does not require that we order a new trial. The majority opinion demonstrates that the trial court addressed the defendant in detail at the July 11, 1980 plea hearing, and received answers from him which clearly indicate that his choice of a court trial and waiver of a jury trial were knowingly and intelligently made. Under the unusual circumstances of this case, I agree that we should not find reversible error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
