The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in its charge to the jury by instructing them that they should consider the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case when weighing his credibility as a witness. The defendant duly excepted during trial and claims on appeal that this portion of the charge was inconsistent with the presumption of innocence and denied him his right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim of error is utterly without merit. \u201c \u2018The rule is well settled in this state that the court may advise the jury that in weighing the credibility of an accused\u2019s testimony they can consider his interest in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Guthridge, </em>164 Conn. 145, 151, 318 A.2d 87 (1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 988, 93 S.
