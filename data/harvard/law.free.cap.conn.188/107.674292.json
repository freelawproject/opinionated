When all the evidence was in, the court directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff appeals from the final judgment and assigns as error the court\u2019s action in directing the verdict and in refusing to set the verdict aside. \u201cIn reviewing the action of the trial court, in first directing and thereafter refusing to set aside the verdict, we consider the evidence, including inferences which reasonably may be drawn from this evidence, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Pinto </em>v. <em>Spigner, </em>163 Conn. 191, 193, 302 A.2d 266 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Tlie jury could reasonably and logically have found the following facts: In November, 1974, the plaintiff was a real estate builder and developer in the town of Middlebury. He had been in that business for twelve years and had built fifty-seven homes. At this time, the plaintiff was also the owner and developer of a shopping center known as the Middlebury Hamlet (hereinafter the Hamlet) that he had constructed on route 64 in Middlebury. The land for this development was purchased in May, 1973, after the plaintiff had applied to the Middle-bury planning and zoning commission (hereinafter the commission) for a permit to relocate a brook on the property. This permit was granted and the site plan was approved by the commission in March or April, 1973, provided that the plaintiff fulfill three conditions: (1) that he install riprapping; (2) that he establish an effective settling basin; and (3) that he take all other necessary measures to prevent erosion. The commission also required the plaintiff to post a contractor\u2019s bond to ensure the fulfillment of these conditions, and a bond having an expiration date of May, 1974, was subsequently posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Construction began in August, 1973, and was substantially completed by April, 1974. About this time, however, the commission became concerned about a drainage problem caused by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to fulfill the conditions of the permit. The plaintiff appeared before the commission in June and represented that he was working on the problem and that it was 80 percent solved. The commission\u2019s continuing concern led it to request the assistance of the United States Department of Agriculture-Soil Conservation Service (hereinafter U.S.D.A.-S.C.S.), as well as to pass a resolution at its September meeting that set November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>7 as the deadline for completing the settling basin. When it met on November 7, the commission approved the recommendations of the U.S.D.A.S.C.S., which established new compliance deadlines of December 5,1974 and May 15,1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">At the time of this meeting, approximately 37 percent of the available rental space in the shopping center was occupied. Mechanic\u2019s liens totaling $60,486.38 had been filed against the Hamlet, as well as a suit claiming a brokerage commission for the placement of mortgage financing. The plaintiff was in default under his construction mortgage, which was subsequently foreclosed. Finally, the commission had met with police officials concerning traffic problems that had developed on route 64 after construction of the Hamlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The defendant\u2019s reporter, Mary Kane Skowron-ski, was assigned to cover news exclusively in Mid-dlebury. After attending the commission meeting of November 7, she wrote articles about the Hamlet that were printed in the defendant\u2019s newspaper on November 8 and 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff requested in writing that the defendant retract certain statements in the articles, but no retraction was made. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought the present suit against the defendant for libel and invasion of privacy, to which the defendant raised the defense of truth and the privilege of \u201cfair comment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We begin with the critical determination of whether, as a matter of law, the allegedly libelous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>assertions can reasonably be characterized as either a fact or an opinion, since this determination will guide our analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 282-87, 94 S. Ct. 2770, 41 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1974); <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corporation, </em>17 Cal. 3d 596, 601, 552 P.2d 425 (1976); <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, Inc., </em>42 N.Y.2d 369, 381, 366 N.E.2d 1299 (1977). A statement can be defined as factual if it relates to an event or state of affairs that existed in the past or present and is capable of being known. See generally 1 Harper <em>&amp; </em>James, Torts \u00a7 5.28, p. 458 n.11, \u00a7 7.8, p. 560; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979); Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969). In a libel action, such statements of fact usually concern a person\u2019s conduct or character. 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 565. An opinion, on the other hand, is a personal <em>comment </em>about another\u2019s conduct, qualifications or character that has some basis in fact. Id., \u00a7 566, p. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">This distinction between fact and opinion cannot be made in a vacuum, however, for although an opinion may appear to be in the form of a factual statement, it remains an opinion \u201cif it is clear from the <em>context </em>that the maker is not intending to assert another objective fact but only his personal comment on the facts which he has stated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ibid. Thus, while this distinction may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201csomewhat nebulous . . . [t]he important point is whether ordinary persons hearing or reading the matter complained of would be likely to understand it as an expression of the speaker\u2019s or writer\u2019s opinion, or as a statement of existing fact.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 1 Harper &amp; James, op. cit., \u00a7 5.28, p. 458; <em>Mashburn </em>v. <em>Collin, </em>355 So. 2d 879, 885 (La. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In a civil action for libel, where the protected interest is personal reputation, the rule in Connecticut is that the truth of an allegedly libelous statement of fact provides an absolute defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>170 Conn. 520, 538, 368 A.2d 125 (1976), citing <em>Cox Broadcasting Corporation </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 489-90, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1975). Contrary to the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>rule <em>that </em>required <em>the </em>defendant to establish the literal truth of the precise statement made, the modem rule is that only substantial truth need be shown to constitute the justification. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>117 Conn. 599, 601-602, 169 A. 619 (1933); <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>4 Conn. 17, 33 (1821). \u201cIt is not necessary for the defendant to prove the truth of every word of the libel. If he succeeds in proving that The main charge, or gist, of the libel\u2019 is true, he need not justify statements or comments which do not add to the sting of the charge or introduce any matter by itself actionable.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Gatley, Libel and Slander (2d Ed.) p. 178; see Eldredge, The Law of Defamation (1978) \u00a7 71; <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Argus-Press Co., </em>586 F.2d 1108, 1112 (6th Cir. 1978). The issue is whether the libel, as published, would have a different effect on the reader than the pleaded truth would have produced. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Clemow, </em>28 Conn. Sup. 109, 111, 251 A.2d 415 (1968), citing <em>Fleckenstein </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>266 N.Y. 19, 23, 193 N.E. 537 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Upon examining the statements complained about by the plaintiff, we note that three of them are clearly factual: (1) \u201cOn the surface, the Middle-bury Hamlet is an attractive colonial-type shopping complex located about two miles from the Four Corners business district\u201d; (2) \u201cHarold K. Goodrich, owner and developer, faces close to $100,000.00 in liens and lawsuits against the property, and possibly another lawsuit from the town\u2019s Planning and Zoning Commission\u201d; (3) \u201cA plumbing and heating firm, a lumber company, and a paving company have filed a total of $60,486.00 in liens against the Hamlet developer. And a $30,000.00 suit was filed against Goodrich for failure to pay a brokerage commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>on the Hamlet\u2019s mortgage financing.\u201d We need not inquire further, however, since the plaintiff conceded during direct examination that these statements were true, and this concession creates an absolute bar to his claim of libel as to these statements. <em>Cox Broadcasting Corporation </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>supra; <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The remaining allegations of libel consist of statements of fact combined with opinions or comments based upon those facts. Although some authorities have applied the defense of truth in such circumstances; <em>Commercial Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>149 F. 704, 706-707 (6th Cir. 1907); Gatley, op. cit., p. 177; Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 116, pp. 796-97; others have expressly limited the defense of truth to justify only statements of fact. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>New York Times Co., </em>313 F.2d 354, 356 n.2 (2d Cir. 1963); Eldredge, The Law of Defamation (1978) \u00a7 63, p. 323; 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 581A. We need not choose between these authorities, however, for \u201c[w]here the comment or opinion deals with matters of public interest, the privilege of \u2018fair comment\u2019 is involved which affords an immunity of considerably wider latitude.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 1 Harper &amp; James, op. cit., \u00a7 5.20, p. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The privilege of \u201cfair comment,\u201d which was one of the most important privileges realized at common law, was a qualified privilege to express an opinion or otherwise comment on matters of public interest. <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>142 Conn. 605, 615, 116 A.2d 440 (1955). \u201cTraditionally, fair comment concerned persons, institutions or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>groups who voluntarily injected themselves into the public scene or affected the community\u2019s welfare, such as public officials, political candidates, community leaders from the private sector or <em>private enterprises which affected public welfare . </em>. . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>Mashburn </em>v. <em>Collin, </em>supra, 882. The privilege was elevated to constitutional status, however, by a number of United States Supreme Court cases starting with <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964), and those cases govern our inquiry. See Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 115, p. 792, \u00a7 118, p. 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In <em>New York Times Co., </em>the court (p. 280) rejected the common law standard of malice and held that media defendants were not liable for defamatory statements of fact or opinion about a public official absent proof that a statement was published with \u201c <em>\u2018actual </em>malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or not.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The constitutional privilege was first extended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>public figures ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 154-55, 87 S. Ct. 1975, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1094 (1967) (plurality opinion); and later to private individuals who became involuntarily associated with matters of \u201cpublic or general concern.\u201d <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc., </em>403 U.S. 29, 48, 91 S. Ct. 1811, 29 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1971) (plurality opinion). In both of those cases, the plaintiff was still required to prove the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard of <em>New York Times Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The <em>Rosenbloom </em>rationale was ultimately rejected, however, in <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974). In so doing, the court noted that to apply this standard to public figures merely on the basis of their involvement in matters of \u201cpublic or general interest\u201d would inadequately serve the competing values at stake, namely, the societal interest in \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u201d debate on public issues; id., 340, quoting <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 270; and the \u201clegitimate state interest . . . [in] the compensation of individuals for the harm inflicted on them by defamatory falsehood.\u201d Ge<em>rtz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>supra, 341. \u201cOn the one hand, a private individual whose reputation is injured by defamatory falsehood that does concern an issue of public or general interest has no recourse unless he can meet the rigorous requirements of <em>New York Times </em>[Co.] .... On the other hand, a publisher or broadcaster of a defamatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>error which a court deems unrelated to an issue of public or general interest may be held liable in damages even if it took every reasonable precaution to ensure the accuracy of its assertions.\u201d <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>supra, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Gertz, </em>therefore, reestablished the <em>New York Times Co. </em>approach of varying the level of constitutional privilege for defamatory falsehood according to the <em>status </em>of the person defamed. 3 Dooley, Modern Tort Law (1977) \u00a7 36.07. The court held that \u201cso long as they do not impose liability without fault, the states may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of a defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual.\u201d Ibid, citing <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>supra, 347. We need not define this standard here, however, for a close reading of <em>Gerts </em>reveals that the court \u201cwas speaking in terms only of libelous misstatements of <em>fact </em>and that the mere comment or opinion on public matters, even though defamatory, enjoys the <em>unqualified </em>protection of the First Amendment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Mashburn </em>v. <em>Collin, </em>355 So. 2d 879, 884 (La. 1977), citing Hanson, Libel and Related Torts (Sup. 3 1976) \u00a7 141. \u201cUnder the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas. <em>But there is no constitutional value in a false statement of fact.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>supra, 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">As a general rule, therefore, an opinion is privileged as fair comment \u201conly when the facts on which it is based are truly <em>stated </em>or <em>privileged </em>or otherwise <em>known </em>either because the facts are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>common knowledge or because, though perhaps unknown to a particular recipient of the communication, they are readily accessible to him.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 Harper &amp; James, op. cit., \u00a7 5.28, p. 459; 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 566 (\u201cpure\u201d opinion is absolutely privileged). If the facts that are criticized or commented upon are <em>not </em>stated <em>or </em>known, however, then fair comment is no defense. The reason for this distinction is as follows: an opinion must be based upon facts; if the facts are neither known nor stated, then a defamatory opinion implies that there are undisclosed defamatory facts which justify the opinion. 1 Harper &amp; James, op. cit., \u00a7 5.28, pp. 458-59; 3 Restatement (Second), op. cit., \u00a7 566 (\u201cmixed\u201d opinion); <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Peerless Publications, Inc., </em>461 F. Sup. 1206, 1209 (E.D. Pa. 1978). The damage of such an implication is that the person defamed becomes the victim of the prejudiced and distorted judgment of not only the defamer, but also of everyone who hears and believes the opinion without knowing that it is based on incorrect and untrue facts. The precise contours of the privilege of fair comment have never been fully articulated, since the United States Supreme Court chose to lay down broad rules of general application rather than opt for an ad hoc resolution of the competing interests in each case. <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>supra, 343. Our review of the case law from <em>New York Times Go. </em>through <em>Gertz, </em>however, leads us to conclude that expressions of \u201cpure\u201d opinion (those based upon known or disclosed facts) are guaranteed virtually complete constitutional protection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>pressions of \u201cmixed\u201d opinion, however, are privileged only where made (1) by members of the press or news media; (2) about matters of public interest or concern; and (3) without knowingly or recklessly distorting the facts upon which they are based.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, although not clearly articulated in his brief, appears to be that the articles were not privileged as fair <em>comment </em>because they contained a number of disparaging <em>factual </em>assertions: that the Hamlet was a \u201cghost town\u201d and \u201ca mere shell of a shopping center\u201d and that the Hamlet was \u201cplagued\u201d by a \u201chost of traffic, conservation and financial worries\u201d and was \u201cup to its rooftop in troubles.\u201d He states, arguendo, that even if the privilege were applicable, it was abused because the articles were \u201cdesignedly or unnecessarily or negligently excessive\u201d and constituted \u201cfictionalized or misrepresented news reports.\u201d Finally, he argues that the defendant\u2019s reporter conducted an irresponsible and reckless investigation of the facts, including her failure to interview him personally, and that this created a question of fact as to liability which the court usurped by directing a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Whether the two newspaper articles are privileged as fair comment is an issue of law. <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>supra, 615; accord <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>New York Times Co., </em>211 F. Sup. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>99, 107 n.9 (D. Conn. 1962), aff\u2019d, 313 F.2d 354 (2d Cir. 1963). We conclude that the privilege applied here since the articles involved a matter of public interest. <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>supra. The plaintiff was clearly-engaged in a \u201cprivate enterprise which affected the public welfare\u201d; <em>Mashburn </em>v. <em>Collin, </em>supra; namely, the construction of a shopping center. <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Argus-Press Co., </em>586 F.2d 1108, 1116 (6th Cir. 1978). Whether this privilege was abused, however, is an issue of fact; <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>New York Times Co., </em>supra; <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>supra; and we examine these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">As in the defense of truth, the privilege of fair comment requires us to read the allegedly libelous articles in their totality, in the context in which they were published.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Information Control </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>Genesis One Computer Corporation, </em>611 F.2d 781, 784 (9th Cir. 1980); accord <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Boston Magazine Co., </em>380 Mass. 336, 342, 403 N.E.2d 376 (1980); \u201cIn order for a statement to be defended as fair comment it must be recognizable by the ordinary reasonable person as opinion and not as a statement of fact.\u201d <em>Mashburn </em>v. <em>Collin, </em>supra, 886. In applying this test, however, \u201cLt]he court must consider all the words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence. In addition, the court must give weight to cautionary terms used by the person publishing the statement. Finally, the court must consider all of the circumstances surrounding the statement, including the medium by which the statement is disseminated and the audience to which it is published.\u201d <em>Information Control </em>v. <em>Genesis One Computer Corporation, </em>supra, 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Applying these standards, we note that the defendant newspaper covered news of interest to Middlebury residents, as evidenced by reporter Skowron,ski\u2019s exclusive assignment to that town. In covering the problems surrounding the Hamlet, which was an item of interest to the local residents, she personally attended the meeting on November 7, 1974 and learned the facts that became the basis of her two articles. In writing these articles, the reporter was not limited to a dry recitation of the bare facts but was constitutionally permitted to use colorful expressions in a figurative, rather than literal, sense. See <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>448 F.2d 378, 384 (4th Cir. 1971); <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>299 F. Sup. 582, 585 (E.D. Pa. 1969). Taking the articles as a whole, we conclude that a reader would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>reasonably understand the expressions \u201csore spot,\u201d \u201cghost town,\u201d \u201cup to its rooftop in troubles,\u201d \u201cmere shell of a shopping center\u201d and \u201cplagued by a host of traffic, conservation and financial worries\u201d not as statements about an existing state of affairs-that is, as facts-but as colloquial and figurative expressions used to embellish facts that are disclosed in the articles.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Furthermore, we note that the United States Supreme Court has not found actionable a number of words similar to the words herein which, \u201cif ,not cliches, do have colloquial, figurative meanings.\u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Boston Magazine Co., </em>supra, 343. In <em>Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bresler, </em>398 U.S. 6, 90 S. Ct. 1537, 26 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1970), for example, the court held that the word \u201cblackmail\u201d was nondefamatory where \u201ceven the most careless reader must have perceived that the word was no more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet.\u201d Id., 14, cited in <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Capital Cities Communications, Inc., </em>576 F.2d 495, 508 (3d Cir. 1978); see also <em>Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 284, 94 S.

Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the reporter investigated these news articles recklessly, her mere failure to interview the plaintiff personally, in light of the articles she wrote, is not in itself such \u201chighly unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers.\u201d <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 155, 87 S.

The origins of this right, which was not expressly recognized at common law, can be directly traced to an 1890 article written by Samuel Warren and Louis Brand\u00e9is entitled \u201cThe Right to Privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the early cases were divided,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the right became widely accepted after it was recognized by the American Law Institute in 1938. 4 Restatement, Torts \u00a7 867. In reviewing the body of privacy law today, we note that tort actions for invasion of privacy have been judicially recognized, in one form or another, in approximately three quarters of the states.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 5 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652 (Appendix); 3 Dooley, op. cit., \u00a7 35.01. On the other hand, the courts which have refused to recognize this right of action have concluded that this issue was more properly one for legislative determination. <em>Kalian </em>v. <em>People Acting Through Community Effort, Inc., </em>408 A.2d 608, 609 (R.I. 1979); <em>Brunson </em>v. <em>Ranks Army Store, </em>161 Neb. 519, 525, 73 N.W.2d 803 (1955). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">There is substantive support today for the conclusion that privacy is a basic right entitled to legal protection. <em>Cox Broadcasting Corporation </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 487, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(1975); see also <em>Galella </em>v. <em>Onassis, </em>487 F.2d 986, 995 n.12 (2d Cir. 1973). In recognizing this cause of action for invasion of privacy in Connecticut, we quote with approval the language used by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma when it recently recognized the right of privacy: \u201cAlthough there was no distinctive tort of invasion of privacy in early common law, it has evolved in most jurisdictions based on common law principles sometimes compared to trespass. It is unnecessary for the Legislature to enact a law to create this tort in abrogation of the common law. The common law . . . refers not only to the ancient unwritten law of England, but also to that body of law created and preserved by decisions of courts. The common law is not static, but is a dynamic and growing thing and its rules arise from the application of reason to the changing conditions of society.\u201d <em>McCormack </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Publishing Co., </em>613 P.2d 737, 740 (Okla. 1980). Indeed, as the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 530, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884), \u201c[t]his flexibility and capacity for growth and adaptation is the peculiar boast and excellence of the common law,\u201d and this reasoning has been followed by a number of courts that have recognized the privacy right of action. See, e.g., <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>436 F. Sup. 967, 978 (E.D.N.Y. 1977), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 588 F.2d 319, 325 (2d Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In recognizing this right of action today, we note that the law of privacy has not developed as a single tort, but as a complex of \u201cfour distinct kinds of invasion of four different interests of the plaintiff, which are tied together by the common name, but otherwise have almost nothing in common except that each represents an interference with the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>of the plaintiff \u2018to be let alone.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 117, p. 804. The four categories of invasion of privacy are set forth in 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652A as follows: (a) unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another; (b) appropriation of the other\u2019s name or likeness; (c) unreasonable publicity given to the other\u2019s private life; or (d) publicity that unreasonably places the other in a false light before the public.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, these four categories have been adopted by a number of courts that have recognized the privacy right of action. See <em>Cox Broadcasting Corporation </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>supra, 493 n.22; <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>572 S.W.2d 212, 214 (Mo. App. 1978) (noting that Restatement categories are useful, if not critical, to privacy analysis); <em>McCormack </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Publishing Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Count three of the plaintiffs complaint raises a claim for publicity which unreasonably placed him in a false light before the public. To the extent that freedom of the press is involved in this claim, federal law is relevant. <em>Varnish </em>v. <em>Best Medium Publishing Co., </em>405 F.2d 608, 611 n.3 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 987, 89 S. Ct. 1465, 22 L. Ed. 2d 762, reh. denied, 395 U.S. 930, 89 S. Ct. 1769, 23 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1969). The United States Supreme Court first considered the parameters of false light invasions of privacy in <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 87 S. Ct. 534, 17 L. Ed. 2d 456 (1967). In construing New York\u2019s statutory right of privacy against the requirements of the first amendment,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the court held that the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard of <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>was applicable to privacy actions. \u201cWe hold that the constitutional protections for speech and press preclude the application of the . . . statute to redress false reports of matters of <em>public interest </em>in the absence of proof that the defendant published the report with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 387-88; see also annot., 57 A.L.R.3d 16. Thus, matters of public interest were considered newsworthy and a media defendant could not be found liable for a false light invasion of privacy of a private person resulting from erroneous statements that were innocently or even negligently made. <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 388. The court noted, however, that \u201c[t]his limitation to <em>newsworthy </em>persons and events does not of course foreclose an interpretation ... to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>damages where \u2018[rjevelations may he so intimate and so unwarranted in view of the victim\u2019s position as to outrage the community\u2019s notions of decency.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 383 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The rule announced in <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill </em>was followed in the next false light case before the court, <em>Cantrell </em>v. <em>Forest City Publishing Co., </em>419 U.S. 245, 249, 95 S. Ct. 465, 42 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1974). Because <em>Cantrell </em>was decided after <em>Certs, </em>it raised the question of whether a state may constitutionally apply a more relaxed standard of liability than \u201cactual malice\u201d to media defendants against claims of private persons for false light invasions of privacy. <em>Cantrell </em>v. <em>Forest City Publishing Co., </em>supra, 250-51. Since the court had no occasion to consider this issue under the facts presented, the actual malice standard still applied under the public interest analysis announced in <em>Hill, </em>despite the rejection of this principle in the libel area.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>supra, 346 (rejecting public interest test of <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc., </em>403 U.S. 29, 91 S.

Ct. 1029, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">A number of state and federal courts have applied the Restatement rule that a false light invasion of privacy occurs if \u201c(a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.\u201d 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652E; see <em>Varnish </em>v. <em>Best Medium Publishing Co., </em>supra; <em>Logan </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>447 F.

This form of invasion of privacy protects one\u2019s interest in not being placed before the public in an objectionable false light or false position, \u201cor in other words, otherwise than as he is.\u201d 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652E, comment b. The essence of a false light privacy claim is that the matter published concerning the plaintiff (1) is not true; ibid; and (2) is such a \u201cmajor misrepresentation of his character, history, activities or beliefs that serious offense may reasonably be expected to be taken by a reasonable man in his position.\u201d Id., comment c.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Applying these standards to the present case, we note that the plaintiff conceded during direct examination that the published statements concerning his financial affairs were true, and this defeats his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>claim for a false light invasion of privacy. Nor can he recover for the claim made in count three of the complaint that \u201c[d] espite the truth of such statements there exist additional circumstances which when expanded, cast the plaintiff in a <em>more favorable light </em>more in keeping with reality.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To allow recovery upon such a claim would violate the defendant\u2019s first amendment rights, since \u201c[t]he choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials-whether fair or unfair-constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.\u201d <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S. Ct. 2831, 41 L. Ed. 2d. 730 (1974); see also <em>Virgil </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>527 F.2d 1122, 1129 (9th Cir. 1975) (\u201cprivate facts\u201d privacy case). Under the first amendment, a media defendant can be liable for a false light invasion of privacy only where it publishes highly offensive material without regard to its falsity, and to the false impression relayed to the public. <em>McCormack </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Publishing Co., </em>supra. As long as the matter published is substantially true, the defendant was constitutionally protected from liability for a false light invasion of privacy, regardless of its decision to omit facts that may place the plaintiff under less harsh public scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Finally, although the complaint appears to allege only a false light invasion of privacy claim, to the extent that the publications involved matters of public interest, this claim overlaps that for unreasonable publicity given to one\u2019s private life. 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652D. This claim is also governed by first amendment principles. <em>Cox </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Broadcasting Corporation </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>supra, 493-94. Such a \u201cprivate facts\u201d claim is actionable only if the matter publicized is of a kind that \u201c(a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) is not of <em>legitimate concern </em>to the public.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652D, p. 383. A media defendant is constitutionally permitted to publicize facts concerning an individual\u2019s private life so long as those facts are newsworthy; <em>Virgil </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>527 F.2d 1122, 1128-29 (9th Cir. 1975); and in conducting this inquiry we consider \u201c[1] the social value of the facts published, [2] the depth of the article\u2019s intrusion into ostensibly private affairs, and [3] the extent to which the party voluntarily acceded to a position of public notoriety.\u201d <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn., Inc., </em>4 Cal. 3d 529, 541, 483 P.2d 34 (1971), quoting <em>Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, </em>1 Cal. 3d 20, 36, 459 P.2d 912 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Applying these principles here, we note that the construction of the Hamlet was clearly a matter of legitimate interest to the community. The articles published financial facts that were relevant to the completion of the mall, and did not intrude into his otherwise private affairs. Lastly, the plaintiff voluntarily injected himself into the public eye by engaging in an enterprise which affected the public welfare. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is not necessary that persons actively seek publicity in order to be found in the \u2018public eye.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adreani </em>v. <em>Hansen, </em>80 Ill. App. 3d 726, 730, 400 N.E.2d 679 (1980) (publicity about condemnation proceedings brought against builders did not constitute false light invasion of privacy where proposed use of the real estate was a matter of public interest). Accordingly, the right of privacy must give way when balanced against the pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>lication of matters of public interest, in order to insure the \u201cuninhibited, robust and wide-open\u201d discussion of legitimate public issues. <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We hold that the right to publicize newsworthy matters would, as a matter of law, extend to the general subject of these articles and that reasonable minds could not differ that the specific financial facts published were also newsworthy. <em>Virgil </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>supra, 1131. Furthermore, the articles here merely published information about the plaintiff\u2019s finances that were already matters of public record, such as liens and lawsuits filed against him, and this fact defeats the claim that his privacy was invaded by their publication. <em>Cox Broadcasting Corporation </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>supra, 494-95. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in directing a verdict as to this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The November 8, 1974 article was printed under the headline <em>\u201cLegal Action Threatened: Developer Told To Complete Work,\u201d </em>and is set out below with italics designating the allegedly libelous assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u201cMIDDLEBURY-Legal action may face the developer of the Middlebury Hamlet if he does not complete work to prevent erosion and sedimentation problems in the Fenn\u2019s Pond area.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">\u201cThe Planning and Zoning Commission voted Thursday night to order Harold K.

When we wrote to the bonding company, they informed us that the bond they referred to was one regarding another matter,\u2019 Titus said. \u2018By then, Goodrich\u2019s bond on the drainage work had expired, and there we were.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u201cIn May, Goodrich said he would ask for an extension on the bond, but Comsr. James Kennerly said that, as far as he knew, \u2018he never asked for a renewal or an extension.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u201cAt several meetings following the bond\u2019s expiration, the planners have argued, set deadlines and talked endlessly with Goodrich about the problem. Mix-ups and misplaced letters further complicated the commission\u2019s apparent drive to get the matter cleared up.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u201cGoodrich has claimed that the drainage system is just about complete, but continued erosion and sedimentation into the brook has so unnerved both the planning and Conservation Commissions that neither one is willing to look beyond the silt.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\u201cA soil conservationist from the U.S. Department of Agriculture had been called in on the problem, and had made six recommendations. Last week the planners gave Goodrich until Dec. 5 to comply with four of them, or possibly face court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>\u201cTraffic problems, too, plague the Hamlet. </em>A number of residents have commented that the development is in a badly situated spot on heavily traveled Boute 64, and drivers going the maximum speed limit ride by the Hamlet without ever realizing it\u2019s there.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u201cPolice Commissioners and the police chief have asked the planning commission to look into the traffic problem, while a letter from the Traffic Commission warned the planners that the development is in violation of a state statute because of the way the exit and entrance are situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u201cSiltation of Fenn\u2019s Pond and three aggravated commissions are only one-half of the entire problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\n<em>\u201cA plumbing and heating firm, a lumber company, and a paving company have filed a total of $60,486 in liens against the Hamlet developer. And a $30,000 suit was filed against Goodrich for failure to pay a brokerage commission on the Hamlet\u2019s mortgage financing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u201cOn top of that, Goodrich is finding it difficult to attract tenants, particularly for the development\u2019s second story offices. To date, only one firm has rented an office, while the remainder of the sizeable space is going unused.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u201cAccording to the developer\u2019s son, Kenneth Goodrich, the vacant stores on the ground floor are the fault of the planners.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\u201c \u2018First they turned down an application for a liquor store, then another for an ice cream and sandwich shop,\u2019 he said. \u2018They base their decisions on whether the town needs these stores, but they\u2019re not there to decide whether the town calls for a given store.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>\u201c \u2018If they keep turning us down, we can start talking a hardship ease,\u2019 he said. \u2018The zoning board seems to think that they\u2019re the Supreme Court.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u201cAccording to the younger Goodrich, his father has been agreeable to all the town\u2019s demands, \u2018but it takes time to get the job completely done. I don\u2019t know what they expect.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u201cEventually a supermarket chain store will move into the Hamlet, he said, adding that the would-be liquor store owner is still paying rent for a space he cannot occupy.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u201cMrs. Bernice Boyd, former chairman of the Conservation Commission, says the major problem is non-enforcement of town ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u201c \u2018Had the laws been enforced\u2019 at the Hamlet, she said, \u2018none of this would have happened.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\u201cThe town, she said, enacted \u2018good ordinances and regulations which were approved by the town to protect townspeople\u2019s interest.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u201cMrs. Boyd cited both the excavation and landfill regulations, which, she said, \u2018are not being enforced. And members of the town commissions are not enforcement officers.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">\u201cAnd unless the laws are enforced, \u2018they serve no useful purpose,\u2019 she said. The town should have a \u2018qualified authority empowered to enforce these laws where violations exist,\u2019 Mrs. Boyd said.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">\u201c \u2018The regulations are the results of eight year\u2019s work of the commission,\u2019 she added. \u2018Since we\u2019ve had two different administrations, it\u2019s not the fault of either party.

Similarly, \u201cghbst town\u201d and \u201cmere shell of a shopping center\u201d are figurative terms referring to the vacancies that existed in the unfinished shopping center, as disclosed in the articles. Finally, the terms \u201cplagued by a host of traffic, conservation and financial worries\u201d and \u201cup to its rooftop in troubles\u201d were figurative expressions to describe the myriad problems that existed in completing the Hamlet, as learned by the reporter at the November 7 meeting and as disclosed in the articles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b135-5\"> Although the Supreme Court decided this ease on the basis of federal labor law and did not consider the first amendment arguments advanced by the appellants; <em>Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 283 n.15, 94 S.
