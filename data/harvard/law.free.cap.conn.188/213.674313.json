Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">This appeal arises from the Superior Court\u2019s denial of four items contained in the plaintiff\u2019s substituted bill of costs. The underlying action involved a suit for damages to the plaintiff\u2019s automobile which were sustained in an accident' with the defendant\u2019s automobile on November 25, 1973. The complaint was filed in November, 1975, seeking $12,000 in damages. On February 1, 1979, the defendant filed an offer of judgment in the amount of $3044.21, which the plaintiff rejected. On January 30, 1980, the plaintiff received a jury verdict of $3044.21 in damages, plus $1317.10 in interest, for a total of $4361.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a substituted bill of costs with the clerk\u2019s office in which he sought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>among other things, the costs for three appraisers who assessed and testified to the damages to his automobile and his attorney\u2019s fees of $350. These items were denied by the assistant clerk. This decision was upheld by the Superior Court upon appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Superior Court ruled that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-257 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 52-260 (f),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> costs were limited to those fees incurred for testimony of an expert on the value of land or an appraiser of real estate. It also ruled that the costs for attorney\u2019s fees were precluded under General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00a7 52-195<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as amended by Public Acts 1979, No. 79-250, \u00a7 2. It interpreted that portion of the statute which states \u201c[s]uch costs may include reasonable attorney\u2019s fees . . .\u2019\u2019as referring only to the award of a defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees by way of costs in situations where the plaintiff\u2019s verdict is less than the defendant\u2019s offer of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The plaintiff has raised two issues on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, he claims that the Superior Court erred in its interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-257. His position in this regard is that that statute provides an independent basis for awarding appraisal fees in cases where real estate appraisers are not involved. As the basis for this contention, he cites the portion of \u00a7 52-257 which provides that \u201c[i]n <em>difficult </em>or <em>extraordinary </em>cases in the superior court . . . the court may, in its discretion, make a further allowance to the prevailing party, not to exceed two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>hundred dollars.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff claims that this is a \u201cdifficult or extraordinary\u201d case which would justify such an award of costs. The plaintiff also takes issue with the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation of the language of General Statutes \u00a7 52-195. His claim is that the portion of that statute which provides that \u201c[s]uch costs may include reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars\u201d is applicable to both plaintiffs and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The first issue we address is the plaintiff\u2019s claim for real estate appraisers\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. \u201cCosts are the creature of statute ... and unless the statute clearly provides for them courts cannot tax them.\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Macken, </em>100 Conn. 407, 413, 124 A. 5 (1924), appeal dismissed, 273 U.S. 646, 47 S. Ct. 244, 71 L. Ed. 820 (1926); see also <em>Stradmore Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>173 Conn. 112, 119, 376 A.2d 1095 (1977); <em>Bissing </em>v. <em>Turkington, </em>113 Conn. 737, 739, 157 A. 226 (1931); <em>Lew </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>81 Conn. 213, 217, 70 A. 628 (1908); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>30 Conn. Sup. 244, 251, 309 A.2d 844 (1973); <em>Drive In &amp; Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redevelopment Agency, </em>24 Conn. Sup. 390, 391, 191 A.2d 345 (1963); 3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 67.09. In the present action, the statute pursuant to which the plaintiff is seeking his costs for appraisal fees; General Statutes \u00a7 52-257; explicitly states that \u201c[i]n difficult or extraordinary cases in the superior court . . . the court may, in its discretion, make a further allowance to the prevailing party . . . .\u201d A plain reading of this provision of the statute indicates that it is for the trial court, in the first instance, to determine in its discretion whether a particular case is \u201cdifficult or extraordinary\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>therefore, one warranting a further allowance of two hundred dollars to the prevailing party. A review of the record in this case reveals that the first time that the plaintiff raised the issue that this case was \u201cdifficult or extraordinary\u201d was in his oral argument before the Superior Court upon appeal from the clerk\u2019s denial of costs for appraisal fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3063, this court is not bound to consider any claim of error unless it was distinctly raised and decided by the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>184 Conn. 258, 271, 439 A.2d 983 (1981); <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 377, 439 A.2d 396 (1981); <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Valley Investors, </em>174 Conn. 77, 84, 384 A.2d 321 (1977). Moreover, the plaintiff has not included this claim in his preliminary statement of issues as required by our rules of practice. Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a); see <em>Presutti </em>v. <em>Presutti, </em>181 Conn. 622, 626, 436 A.2d 299 (1980). Under the circumstances, this claim is not properly before us and will not be considered. Practice Book \u00a7 3063.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The second issue raised by the plaintiff is that the Superior Court erred in not awarding him attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-195. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe plaintiff, unless he recovers more than the sum named in [the defendant\u2019s Offer of Judgment], with interest from its date, shall recover no costs accruing after he received notice of the filing Of such offer, but shall pay the defendant\u2019s costs accruing after said time. Such costs may include reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars.\u201d The determinative issue for the purpose of this appeal is whether the sentence beginning with the phrase \u201c[s]ueh costs may include reasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d modifies only the term \u201cthe defendant\u2019s costs\u201d in the immediately preceding clause in the statute, or whether it implies that the plaintiff may also receive costs when he recovers more than the defendant\u2019s offer of judgment. Pursuant to the former interpretation, which was adopted by the trial court, the only party entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under this statute would be a defendant who has submitted an offer of judgment which was rejected by the plaintiff and which offer was eventually determined to be greater than the judgment awarded by the trier of fact, with interest accruing from the date of the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The plaintiff claims that the portion of the statute concerning attorney\u2019s fees modifies the entire sentence immediately preceding it, and not just the preceding clause dealing with the defendant\u2019s costs. Adopting this position would allow a plaintiff to be eligible for attorney\u2019s fees in any case where a defendant has made an offer of judgment that the plaintiff has rejected which turns out to be less than the judgment awarded by the trier of fact. We hold, to the contrary, that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 52-195 was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>A fundamental tenet of statutory constiuction is that \u201cstatutes are to be construed to give effect to the apparent intention of the lawmaking body.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 561, 429 A.2d 960 (1980); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>178 Conn. 634, 638, 425 A.2d 128 (1979); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 223, 226, 377 A.2d 299 (1977); <em>McAdams </em>v. <em>Barbieri, </em>143 Conn. 405, 415-16, 123 A.2d 182 (1956). Where the words of a statute are clear, the task of a reviewing court is merely to apply the directive of the legislature since \u201cwhere the wording is plain, courts will not speculate as to any supposed intention because the question before a court then is not what the legislature actually intended but what intention it expressed by the words that it used.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>supra, 6; see also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 68, 392 A.2d 491 (1978) <em>(Bogdanski, J., </em>dissenting); <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 634, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>432 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 2953, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (1977); <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, 147, 358 A.2d 150 (1975); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948); 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 45.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The intent of the statute in question is not immediately apparent from its language since the term \u201c[s]uch costs\u201d could possibly apply to both plaintiffs\u2019 <em>and </em>defendants\u2019 costs. \u201cWhen two constructions are possible, courts will adopt the one which makes the statute effective and workable . . . .\u201d <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Conn. 325, 331, 142 A.2d 524 (1958); see also <em>Stoni </em>v. <em>Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 376, 426 A.2d 774 (1979); <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979) ; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 506, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973). \u201cA statute should he construed so that no word, phrase or clause will he rendered meaningless. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>[supra, 7]; <em>State ex rel.

The factors that this court looks to in construing a statute include \u201cits legislative history, its language, the purpose it is to serve, and the circumstances surrounding its enactment.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>supra, 8; see also <em>Nationwide Ins.

In each instance, this court indicated that it could not rely solely on the dictionary meaning of the word outside of the context of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>LaProvidenza </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>mission, </em>supra, 28; <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>supra, 556; <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>v. <em>Katona, </em>supra, 420; see also <em>Wrinn </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>186 Conn. 125, 137, 440 A.2d 261 (1982). This concern is particularly relevant here, since the issue is not whether the term is used to modify a portion of the statute \u201calready specified,\u201d hut which portion: the immediately preceding clause or the whole preceding sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The words of the statute read as a whole, however, do shed light on the issue. Nowhere is there any affirmative language referring to the award of the plaintiff\u2019s costs. Rather, the statute describes the circumstances in which a plaintiff <em>cannot </em>recover costs. In contrast, the statute does affirmatively set forth the circumstances when the plaintiff \u201cshall pay\u201d the defendant\u2019s costs. This distinction must be compared with the provisions for costs set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (b) which also deals with the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees after a rejection of an offer of judgment. \u201c[W]here there is a reasonable field of operation for each statute which does not impinge on the domain of the other, it is the court\u2019s duty to give them concurrent effect.\u201d <em>Budkofsky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>177 Conn. 588, 592, 419 A.2d 333 (1979); see also <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 642-43, 410 A.2d 475 (1979); <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>169 Conn. 613, 621, 363 A.2d 1038 (1975); <em>Taminski </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>168 Conn. 324, 328, 362 A.2d 868 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Section 52-192a (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the court ascertains from the -record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>greater than the sum certain stated in his \u2018offer of judgment,\u2019 the court . . . may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars . . . Unlike \u00a7 52-195, this statute does make an affirmative provision for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The implication of this legislative scheme is that the legislature intended \u00a7 52-192a (b) to govern the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, while \u00a7 52-195 governs the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees when the opposing party has rejected a reasonable offer of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">That this was the intended legislative scheme becomes clearer when considering the purpose behind the two statutes and the circumstances surrounding their enactment. Both statutes, as they currently exist, had their genesis in Public Acts 1979, No. 79-250, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Attorney\u2019s Fees in Cases \"Where the Judgment Exceeds the Offer.\u201d The history of the bill indicates that the stated legislative intent was \u201cto provide an incentive for both parties to bargain reasonably and in good faith and to settle close cases . . .\u201d;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 22 H. R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1979 Sess., p. 1683; thereby reducing the delay in civil jury cases. Id.; see also 22 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1979 Sess., p. 944 (\u201c[T]his type of legislation would hopefully . . . unclog the congested docket.\u201d). The incentive to settle is provided by an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cofferor\u201d party if the opposing party rejected a reasonable offer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>judgment made by that \u201cofferor.\u201d 22 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1979 Sess., p. 944; 22 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1979 Sess., pp. 1281-82; 22 H. R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1979 Sess., p. 1683. This history is consistent with the legislative scheme whereby General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (b) governs offers of judgment made by plaintiffs and \u00a7 52-195 governs offers made by defendants. In other words, for a plaintiff to recover attorney\u2019s fees, he has an affirmative obligation pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (b) to make a reasonable offer of judgment which must then be rejected by the defendant. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention in this case, it is not enough for a plaintiff merely to reject an unreasonable offer of judgment made by the defendant and then expect to recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-195. To reward the plaintiff in this latter situation would be to impose absolutely no burden on that party to bargain in good faith. This would be contrary to the intent and purposes of this legislation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In summation, we find that the statutory language and scheme, as well as the legislative intent and history, lead to the same conclusion. We hold that the phrase contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-195, which states \u201c[s]ueh costs may include reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d modifies only the term \u201cdefendant\u2019s costs\u201d in the immediately preceding clause of the statute. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot recover costs for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 52-195 where he has obtained a judgment from the court that is greater than the amount stated in the defendant\u2019s offer of judgment which the plaintiff rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-5\"> Both parties appealed from the elerk\u2019s decision. The plaintiff claimed error in the denial of his costs for motor vehicle reports, subpoenas, expert and appraiser fees and attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant claimed error in the denial of his costs for the trial of an issue of fact; Practice Book \u00a7 344; and in the granting of costs to the plaintiff for the trial of an issue of fact.

The plaintiff failed to flle a motion to rectify the trial court record pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3082 and 3096 (5). We also note that the plaintiff has not set out this issue in his preliminary statement of issues. Moreover, nowhere in his brief does he give any citation to the transcript where he claims to have made this claim before the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> The common definition of the word \u201csuch\u201d includes \u201chaving a quality already . . . specified ... of the sort . . . previously indicated or implied . . . previously characterized or specified\u201d; and \u201caforementioned.\u201d Webster, Third Now International Dictionary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> The whole preceding sentence is the very first sentence of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> Wo have recently noted that \u201c[i]n construing a statute and determining the legislative intent, wo may take judicial notice of the discussions on the floor of the General Assembly although such discussions are not controlling on statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Nationwide Ins.

R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1979 Sess., p. 1682; see also 22 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1979 Sess., p. 944. These comments would be more persuasive if the act in question; Public Acts 1979, No. 79-250; had only amended General Statutes \u00a7 52-195. However, this was not the case. General Statutes <em>\u00a7 </em>52-192a (b) makes no reference to the recovery of defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Yet the end result of the plaintiff's interpretation of the legislative history would be that since there are references to both plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in that history, both \u00a7 52-192a (b) and \u00a7 52-195 would award attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant. This would clearly be contrary to the language of \u00a7 52-192a (b) which has absolutely no provision for the award of defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
