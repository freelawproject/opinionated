He was injured very seriously on March 10, 1971, when the construction had gone up at least twenty-five stories.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">The present case arises because of Armstrong\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9, permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ting the recovery of double compensation by an \u201cemployee . . . injured by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer or of any person regularly intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence. \u201d The claim under \u00a7 28 was filed on May 9, 1977, and received by the Industrial Accident Board (the Board) on May 11, 1977. Two principal issues thus are presented: (1) whether the injuries were caused by serious and wilful misconduct attributable to Carlyle, and (2) whether basis existed for finding (a) that there was reasonable cause for failure to file a claim under \u00a7 28 within the one-year limitation provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, or (b) that Carlyle and its insurer were not prejudiced by the delay in filing the \u00a7 28 claim. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The \u00a7 28 claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was heard by a single member at some sixteen sessions spread out from December 20,1977, to August 9, 1981. The single member\u2019s report was not filed until March 22, 1982. The \u201cfindings and decision\u201d allowing Armstrong compensation under \u00a7 28, contained in that report, were adopted by the reviewing board on January 20, 1983. Enforcement in the Superior Court of the reviewing board\u2019s decision was denied on October 6, 1983. Armstrong has appealed. We reverse the action of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\n<em>The Circumstances of Armstrong\u2019s Injury.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On the difficult issue whether Carlyle was guilty of serious and wilful misconduct, the single member made essentially the findings set out below. We treat them as adequate but note that the subsidiary findings should have been more complete and much more incisively and clearly stated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>On the ground floor of one tower (Tower II) of the Harbor Towers project were a rental office and some model apartments. From this office a walkway ran to Atlantic Avenue. This walkway, shortly before Armstrong was injured, had been covered by a \u201cweight bearing structure\u201d (hereafter \u201cthe bridge\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to protect visitors from materials falling from the towers, which were rapidly growing higher. Prior to the accident, debris from the building had broken planks on the bridge, and it was decided by senior representatives of Carlyle to place four inches of concrete on the surface of the bridge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Armstrong, on the morning of the accident, was sent by the cement mason foreman in Tower I, at the instruction of the latter\u2019s own foreman, Victor Leo, to Tower II to undertake this work. It could be found that three other employees already had refused to go because of the danger from falling debris. Armstrong initially refused to go, but eventually did proceed to Tower II. \u201cStripping\u201d operations (i.e., tearing out wooden molds for concrete) were proceeding on the upper floors of Tower II and debris had been falling from its upper floors and from materials being hoisted from one floor to another by an overhead crane used in the course of hazardous modem highrise constmction. Armstrong was climbing a ladder to the top <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>of the bridge, when he was hit on the head by a four by four inch timber about eight feet long. His hardhat was shattered, his skull was broken, and he was permanently and totally disabled. The single member expressly found that, after Armstrong was injured, \u201ccarpenters and laborers worked overtime\u201d that day to install safety netting on Tower II.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The single member then found that Carlyle \u201crecognized the . . . danger to their employees during the stripping operation, and . . . ordered safety nets several weeks prior to March 10, 1971,\u201d and that these nets, although \u201con the premises\u201d on that day, \u201cwere not secured to the towers.\u201d The single member concluded that, because of Carlyle\u2019s \u201cfailure to erect the safety nets,\u201d Armstrong was injured, and that he would not have been injured \u201cif the proper netting had been in place.\u201d The single member referred to testimony about complaints, made before Armstrong\u2019s injury, by union officials about falling debris. Some complaints were said to have been made at safety meetings held by Carlyle. The single member also found that \u201cfailure to have . . . nets in place prior to . . . the accident\u201d was a violation of safety Bulletin #12 of the State Department of Labor &amp; Industries \u00a7\u00a74.3 Overhead Hazards, and 4.4 Overhead Construction, as in effect in 1971. This was a matter which, although by itself not conclusive even if the single member correctly interpreted the bulletin, reasonably could be taken into account by the single member. The single member\u2019s ultimate finding was that \u201cto have ordered<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> . . . [Armstrong] to work on . . . the \u2018bridge\u2019 without safety nets being in place and without shutting down operations in Tower I and Tower II demonstrates such disregard for the probable consequences ... as to constitute serious and wilful misconduct on the part of\u201d Carlyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">What constitutes \u201cserious and wilful misconduct,\u201d sufficient to support double compensation under \u00a7 28, has been discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>in many cases. See for examples of the more recent decisions (which amply refer to the earlier cases), <em>Scaia\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 432, 434-435 (1946, where, per Qua, J., it was held \u201cthat the evidence [concerning the inadequacies of a chain which broke] fell short of enough to warrant a finding of an easily perceptible danger coupled with the high degree of likelihood that harm would result which is required to carry a case across the line from negligence or gross negligence into the territory of wanton and reckless conduct\u201d); <em>O\u2019Leary\u2019s Case, </em>367 Mass. 108, 114-117 (1975, dangerous work on steel beams with shear connectors attached, ordered, with somewhat more of a threat, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>than in the present case, could be found to be serious and wilful misconduct and involve conduct of a quasi criminal nature). See also <em>Memmolo\u2019s Case, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 407, 412 (1984). Compare a somewhat analogous case under c. 152, \u00a7 27, <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102, 109-110 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Although the evidence was conflicting on many points, we conclude that it could be found to establish (a) that Carlyle and its officers, supervisors, and foremen knew that there was a dangerous condition of falling debris necessitating further protection for persons walking under the bridge; (b) that the bridge required substantial strengthening; and (c) that Armstrong was assigned to the work without Carlyle\u2019s taking adequate and effective precautions (as was done when the carpenters built the bridge, see note 4, supra) to ensure that no debris would fall while he was exposed to risk. The single member\u2019s conclusion that there was serious and wilful misconduct by Carlyle (adopted by the board) was warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>Late Filing of Claim Under \u00a7 28; Absence of Prejudice.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The single member\u2019s findings concerning late filing of the \u00a7 28 claim (which also suffer from the serious defects mentioned in note 2, <em>supra) </em>include the following findings and recitals supported by evidence: (a) Armstrong has no memory of the accident. A deposition received in evidence from the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tor at Massachusetts General Hospital who took care of him shortly after his injury and periodically thereafter shows the original seriousness of his injuries, the consequent \u201cretrograde amnesia,\u201d and Armstrong\u2019s slow but very remarkable improvement from what his initial condition had been, (b) Armstrong at first had counsel, retained for him by his union business agent, of whose representation of him Armstrong first learned approximately two years after his injury. He met this attorney only twice at the Board\u2019s offices in connection with a disfigurement claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36. This lawyer died, probably (although this is not clear from either the single member\u2019s report or the evidence) before Armstrong\u2019s present counsel appeared in the case in May, 1977. Armstrong, beginning in 1975, for about a year, talked to a personal friend, a lawyer, about his injury, but it was not shown that the friend entered any appearance for him or represented him. (c) Armstrong could be found to have been seriously impaired mentally for a considerable period and to have required at least five years of direct treatment for a severe permanent brain injury, including at least twenty-one hospitalizations and some seventeen operations. He was under treatment by a psychiatrist for a year or more about 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The single member may have intended to find, as appropriately could have been done, that these circumstances amounted to \u201creasonable cause\u201d for delay in filing the \u00a7 28 claim. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 49; <em>Wheaton\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 504, 508-509 (1941); <em>Whitlock\u2019s Case, </em>361 Mass. 878 (1972). In any event, the single member concluded in effect that the insurer and Carlyle were \u201cnot prejudiced by the delay\u201d (see c. 152, \u00a7 49). On the issue of prejudice, reference was made to the following circumstances: (a) Epstein, an officer of Carlyle, was on the Harbor Towers premises when the accident occurred. He went at once to the accident scene and then with associates to the top of Tower II and walked down through eight to ten lower floors, where work was proceeding, in an effort to discover the source of the timber. The employer had \u201cclear opportunity ... to investigate and . . . did investigate the accident immediately following\u201d it. (b) \u201cThe insurer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>. . . [Carlyle] were well aware of the circumstances of the accident,\u201d and the insurer\u2019s safety inspector investigating \u201ctwo days after the accident . . . was shown netting . . . [then] being installed.\u201d There then was stripping going on at the eighteenth and nineteenth floors, (c) At the many hearings before the single member, a substantial number of pertinent records (as well as witnesses who testified as to their observations of the site at the time of the accident) were produced by the employer. Because of the dilatory manner of conduct of the hearings before the single member, Carlyle, of course, had ample opportunity between hearings to search its records and to try to find any missing witnesses really important to its case. These circumstances<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> persuaded the single member \u201cthat neither . . . [Carlyle] nor the insurer have been prejudiced.\u201d The single member recognized that Carlyle\u2019s safety engineer did not testify and that the minutes of only three safety meetings held prior to Armstrong\u2019s accident could be produced. The record shows that the foreman in Tower I (who sent Armstrong to Tower II) did testify, as did Carlyle\u2019s general construction superintendent on the job, and various fellow employees and foremen on duty on the day of the accident. One masonry superintendent, Victor Leo, reported as out of the country, did not testify. We cannot say that the single member did not have support in the evidence and in what witnesses and records were available at the hearings for the conclusion that Carlyle and its insurer were not prejudiced by the late filing of the \u00a7 28 claim. See <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 41-46 (1962, where, however, no contention was made that witnesses had become unavailable because of the delay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The judgment is reversed. A new judgment is to be entered in the Superior Court upholding the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> After the accident Armstrong received the usual worker\u2019s compensation benefits from the insurer, and his extensive medical bills have been paid. The present case involves only questions relating to his claim to double compensation under \u00a7 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> The single member, to an undue extent, \u201cimproperly recited . . . testimony without clearly making findings about it as . . . [the single member] should have done.\u201d See <em>Messersmith\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 117, 119 (1959); <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1068, 1069 (1982). See also <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102, 109-110 (1949); <em>Herson\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 402, 406-408 (1960). The form of the single member\u2019s recitals, however, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>summarized testimony (including that of representatives of Carlyle) to which she gave \u201ccredit,\u201d suggests that the recitals were intended essentially as subsidiary findings. See and compare <em>Petition of Catholic Charitable Bureau to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 656, 662 (1984). Carlyle does not seem to argue that the subsidiary findings were inadequate so we do not remand the single member\u2019s report to the Board for more suitable findings, which would cause inappropriate further delay as the single member is no longer on the Board. The recitals of evidence at least serve as general references to evidence which the single member thought supported the ultimate findings. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 583, 585-586 (2d ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\"> An overhead wooden protection, extending about twelve feet from the perimeter of each tower building, was erected near ground level by Carlyle when the towers had reached three stories in height. This overhead protection is not shown to have extended over the area where Armstrong was injured, and is mentioned only as an instance where Carlyle took steps to protect persons on the ground from falling objects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\"> The single member found that the bridge had been built by the carpenters on a Saturday when no other project work was in progress above them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\"> The evidence did not indicate that Armstrong was threatened or coerced into doing the work. We interpret the word \u201cordered\u201d as meaning no more than that he was assigned by his foreman to that dangerous task during which he was injured. Cf. <em>O\u2019Leary\u2019s </em>Case, 367 Mass. 108, 115 (1975, where the foreman\u2019s words amounted to an order).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b175-5\"> Epstein\u2019s testimony about the investigations made after the accident and the rapid efforts by him promptly to provide safety nets to prevent a recurrence, all justified a conclusion that he knew the extent of Armstrong\u2019s injuries, and it could have been found that (from his construction experience) he had reason to expect that a \u00a7 28 claim was probable, or at least a strong possibility. There was evidence also casting doubt on the vigor and imagination of the search by Carlyle for missing witnesses and documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> We recognize that the burden of proving lack of prejudice with respect to delay in filing a claim is on the employee. <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680, 682 (1956). <em>Herson\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 402, 406-407 (1960). Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the burden has been satisfied is a question of fact for the Board. See <em>Lupia\u2019s Case, </em>347 Mass. 678, 680 (1964), and cases cited. In the somewhat unusual circumstances of the present case, and taking account of all the findings and the evidence, viewed as a whole, the single member properly could conclude that any inference of prejudice from the late filing had been rebutted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
