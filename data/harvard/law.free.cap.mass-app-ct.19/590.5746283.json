The judge then permanently enjoined the defendants and any persons acting in their behalf or \u201cclaiming under them . . . from interfering with said use by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact. The disputed premises are the parking area owned by the defendants at the rear of 56-58 Greenough Street in Brookline. In 1950 the Stagmans purchased a house (with an adjacent parking space) at 44 Stanton Road in Brookline. As the Stanton Road house had no frontage on that road or any other, the Stagmans \u201ccommenced their use of the passageway [in question] ... for access to and egress from their home and Gorham Avenue.\u201d The Stagmans did, however, have access to their parking space pursuant to a record right of way. The record right of way provided easy access on foot,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but, as a practical matter, \u201cvehicular access over the record right of way\u201d was made difficult by a \u201cfence maintained in the area of the walkway.\u201d Customarily, therefore, the Stagmans walked or drove to Gorham Avenue \u201cby traversing the defendants\u2019 passageway and parking area.\u201d The Stagmans\u2019 tenants and third parties furnishing services to the Stagmans likewise used this route from Gorham Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Access to the parking space next to the Stagmans\u2019 house was rarely blocked by parked cars before 1971, though trash collection from the Stagmans\u2019 premises was discontinued, at least for a time, because access was impeded. In 1971 one Barth, the defendants\u2019 predecessor in title, acquired the disputed premises. The Greenes, owners prior to Barth, had only one tenant and took care to insure that cars did not obstruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>passage from Gorham Avenue. After Barth acquired the property, often both authorized and possibly unauthorized cars parked on the lot behind 56-58 Greenough Street and blocked the Stagmans\u2019 access to the parking space on their property. Accordingly, they began renting a parking space from Barth which \u201cthey sometimes used, if they thought they might be blocked from leaving their own front yard.\u201d In 1980, Estelle D. and Charles R. Adams, trustees of Dean Realty Trust, acquired record title to 56-58 Greenough Street, including the parking area, and converted the property to condominium units. In June, 1980, they notified the Stagmans that their rented parking spaces<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would no longer be available; later, however, the condominium trust offered extra space, to which offer the Stagmans failed to respond. They continued to drive through the defendants\u2019 lot to reach the parking space on their own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The judge found that the essential prerequisites to a prescriptive easement \u2014 open, uninterrupted, and adverse use for a period of not less than twenty years \u2014 had been established. See <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Poch, </em>321 Mass. 321, 323 (1947); <em>Mastandrea </em>v. <em>Baressi, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 54, 55 (1974). There is ample evidence to support this finding. See <em>Norton </em>v. <em>West, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 350 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Notwithstanding the defendants\u2019 failure to point to anything in the record which might show that the judge\u2019s findings are not warranted on the evidence, we address in summary fashion the specific contentions the defendants have put forth in an effort to persuade us that the judge\u2019s decision should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">(1) In support of the defendants\u2019 claim that the Stagmans\u2019 use was interrupted, the defendants point out that during the crucial twenty-year period \u201creality dictate[d]\u201d circumstances which necessarily caused access to be blocked occasionally. The judge found that neither the owners of the Greenough Street premises nor anyone with their approval or on their behalf had taken any steps prior to 1980 to bar use of the premises for access to the Stagmans\u2019 residence. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>finding, or evidence to the effect, that the Stagmans\u2019 usual route was ever deliberately obstructed. See <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. 251, 263-264 (1964). See also <em>Ivons-Nispel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>347 Mass. 760, 763 (1964). \u201c[T]emporary intrusion or occasional trespass by a stranger does not interrupt the running of the statute in behalf of an adverse occupant.\u201d <em>Dorntee </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>224 Mass. 256, 260 (1916). We are in agreement with the trial judge that the servient owners \u201cdid not \u2018effectively block the easement.\u2019\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Sneider, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 329, 332 (1980), quoting from Ryan v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">(2) Nor does the defendants\u2019 assertion that the Stagmans drove over the route (during the earlier part of the period) only on weekends \u201crequire a finding that the adverse use of the way was not continuous.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Heebner, </em>343 Mass. 770 (1961). See <em>Kershaw </em>v. <em>Zecchini, </em>342 Mass. 318, 321 (1961). To the contrary, the judge specifically found on adequate evidence that \u201ca pattern of regular return by car for the weekends was established.\u201d In light of that finding a determination of continuous use is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">(3) The fact that the Stagmans rented two parking spaces in the defendants\u2019 parking area from 1971 to 1980 is unavailing for the reason, if no other, that the judge found that by 1971 the plaintiffs \u201chad acquired a prescriptive right to use of the passageway.\u201d The judge made the correlative finding that there has been no showing that the Stagmans intended \u201cto surrender the prescriptive right of access.\u201d See <em>Parlante </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>363 Mass. 879, 880 (1973) (mere nonuse does not itself constitute abandonment). Both findings have ample support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">(4) As to the defendants\u2019 contention that the plaintiff\u2019s claim must fail because the route across the defendants\u2019 land varied, we need say only that we have no basis for disagreeing with the judge that \u201cthe evidence proves otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">(5) Likewise, we agree with the judge that the Stagmans\u2019 paving their property and a portion of the route in question did not constitute a trespass. It is settled law (see, e.g., <em>Guillet </em>v. <em>Livernois, </em>297 Mass. 337, 340 [1937], and cases cited) that the owners of the dominant tenement have a right reasonably to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>improve the surface of the way over which they have the right to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">(6) As to the defendants\u2019 claim that loches bars the plaintiff\u2019s action, we think the judge was warranted in finding that there was \u201cnothing in the evidence to show unreasonable delay in commencing this action which caused substantial prejudice to the defendants.\u201d See <em>Mastandrea </em>v. <em>Baressi, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\"> Nathan Stagman. died after the institution of the action, and his widow, Catherine Stagman, succeeded to his interest as the surviving tenant by the entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> For example, the judge found that the record right of way was \u201cthe route used by the mailman in making his daily rounds.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> The Stagmans had rented a second parking space for their tenant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
