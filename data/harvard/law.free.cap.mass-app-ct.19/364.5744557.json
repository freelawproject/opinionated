By the terms of that judgment, Henry was ordered to pay $40 per week for the support of the parties\u2019 two minor children, custody of whom was given to Ann, and $10 per week as alimony for a period of two years. In addition, Henry was ordered to convey to Ann his interest in the marital home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>1978, Ann filed a complaint for modification, which was twice amended. On March 5, 1981, she filed a complaint, later amended, seeking assignment of marital property under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. The actions were tried together. The judge filed comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. A judgment of modification was entered ordering, among other things, Henry to pay $125 per week for the support of the minor children<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and lump sum alimony of $15,000. A second judgment was entered ordering Henry to pay Ann $45,000, \u201cas a division of marital property,\u201d and $13,500 as counsel fees. Henry has appealed from the latter judgment, from so much of the former which awards Ann lump sum alimony, and from the denial of his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">1. <em>The Judgment of Modification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Henry says that the judge\u2019s findings show clear error in three respects. First, he argues that the judge placed undue emphasis on the fact that Henry was a life income beneficiary (in the discretion of the trustees) of an unfunded trust under the will of his mother. The judge\u2019s findings clearly indicate that she considered that the trust was not funded and might never be. Moreover, Henry\u2019s current circumstances, as found by the judge and not disputed, apart from any future income which he might receive from the trust, fully support the amount of the award made. Henry next contends that the judge failed to take into account income which Ann earned as a private duty nurse in the finding as to her average weekly earnings. That finding involved an assessment of the credibility of Ann\u2019s testimony, which was for the judge to make. Henry\u2019s final claim \u2014 that there was clear error in the judge\u2019s finding that Ann had no opportunity for the future acquisition of income other than through her earnings as a registered nurse \u2014 is patently without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The detailed findings of the judge are more than sufficient to establish the material change in circumstances necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>support a judgment of modification under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37. <em>See Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>343 Mass. 247, 249 (1961); <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981); <em>Pagar </em>v. <em>Pagar, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 2 (1980). The award of $15,000 as lump sum alimony was well within the judge\u2019s broad discretion. See <em>Surabian </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>362 Mass. 342, 348 (1972); <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, supra </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">2. The <em>Judgment Under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">(a) <em>Res judicata. </em>Henry argues that Ann was precluded from seeking an assignment of property by the judgment of divorce. We have no record of the divorce proceedings other than the judgment of divorce nisi, entered March 4, 1976, in which Henry was ordered to pay child support and alimony, and to convey his interest in the marital home to Ann. The judge who heard the divorce action made no findings of fact, undoubtedly because the judgment was entered before the Supreme Judicial Court suggested, and then required, findings on the statutory factors set forth in G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. See <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. 420, 423 (1976); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 402-403 (1977); <em>King </em>v. <em>King, </em>373 Mass. 37, 40 (1977). See also <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 15 (1977); Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 52(a), (c) (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201c[Wjhere the property rights of the parties have not been previously adjudicated, the Probate Court, upon consideration and findings relative to the statutory criteria, . . . may assign property pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34 . . . after a judgment of divorce has become absolute\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Maze </em>v. <em>Mihalovich, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 323, 324 (1979). <em>See Hay </em>v. <em>Cloutier, </em>389 Mass. 248, 252 (1983). \u201c[A] judgment of divorce only settles those \u2018matters which were necessarily involved and all issues which were actually tried and determined. \u2019 \u201d <em>Maze </em>v. <em>Mihalovich, supra </em>at 326, quoting from <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, 325 </em>Mass. 28, 31 (1949). As the <em>Maze </em>and <em>Hay </em>cases make clear, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, issues are not \u201cnecessarily involved\u201d in a judgment of divorce. From the record we are unable to determine whether any question of the assignment or division of the property of the parties was litigated in the divorce proceeding. We know that the judge could have ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the conveyance of Henry\u2019s interest in the marital residence on traditional alimony principles. See <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Crossman, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 966, 968 (1982). As will be seen in the discussion which follows, the judgment did not deal expressly with all of the property interests of the parties. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We conclude, as did the probate judge, that the judgment of divorce did not preclude litigation of the issues raised in the subsequent complaint for the assignment of property under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">(b) <em>Property subject to </em>division.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ann\u2019s amended complaint alleged that at the time of the divorce Henry had (1) an irrevocable remainder interest under a testamentary trust of his deceased father which had, at the time of the complaint, vested in possession, and (2) an expectancy, under the will of his mother, which had ripened into an inheritance at the time of the complaint. There is no dispute as to the judge\u2019s findings that at the time of trial Henry had received distributions from his father\u2019s trust of about $141,000 and tangible personal property from his mother\u2019s estate with a value of about $44,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also not in question that the judge considered at least these assets to be subject to division under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Henry contends that since these assets did not come into his possession until after the judgment of divorce absolute, they constituted \u201cafter acquired\u201d property and were thus not part of his \u201cestate\u201d and subject to division under \u00a7 34. Ann counters that the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398 (1977), foreclosed the issue by declaring that \u00a7 34 \u201cgives the trial judge discretion to assign to one spouse property of the other spouse <em>whenever and however </em>acquired\u2019 (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 400. Thus, the argument goes, since the \u00a7 34 case was heard subsequent to the divorce under the holding in <em>Maze </em>v. <em>Mihalovich, supra, </em>the interests in question were subject to division.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Our consideration of the issue thus framed, one not heretofore considered by our appellate courts, begins with an examination of the nature of the rights afforded spouses under \u00a7 34. Without rehearsing in detail what has been said in our appellate cases which have treated the differences between traditional alimony and new division of property concepts (see e.g., <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. 420 [1976], and <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 10 [1977]), there is no question that the purpose and effect of \u00a7 34 has been, since its revision by St. 1974, c. 565,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to provide for the equitable division of the property interests of partners in a marriage. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, supra </em>at 401<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, supra </em>at 13. In making such a division \u201cthe court may award to the wife a portion of the husband\u2019s separate estate in recognition of the vital and substantial, although nonmonetary, contribution which she has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>made to the marital partnership. . . . The value of the property to be assigned is dependent on those circumstances which warrant division of property in recognition of the marital partnership concept. . . .\u201d Inker, Walsh &amp; Perocchi, Alimony and Assignment of Property: The New Statutory Scheme in Massachusetts, 10 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 1, 8 (1975).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he right to equitable division of property is fundamentally based on a partnership model.\u201d Inker &amp; Glower, Towards a New Justice in Marital Dissolution: The Massachusetts Statutory Scheme and Due Process Analysis, 16 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 907, 931 (1982). See Clark, Domestic Relations \u00a7 14.8, at 449 (1968); Ginsburg, M.G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 34 \u2014 Some Observations about the Division of Property Leading to Predictability and Consistency, 25 B.B.J., 10 (Jan. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">None of the cases construing \u00a7 34 involved property interests . acquired after the dissolution of the marital partnership. The language in <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, supra </em>at 400, \u201cwhenever and however acquired,\u201d in context referred to separate property acquired by the husband before the marriage and as gifts during the marriage. <em>Id. </em>at 399-400. To hold that property interests acquired after the dissolution of the marriage are subject to division under \u00a7 34 would be contrary to the marital partnership concept on which \u00a7 34 is founded. See Inker et al., 10 Suffolk U.L.Rev. 4, n.10. We conclude, therefore, that the property interests of Ann and Henry which were subject to division under \u00a7 34 were to be identified as of the time of their divorce.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>We turn then to the interests (as they existed at the time of the divorce) which Ann identified in her amended complaint under \u00a7 34, and on which the parties seem to have focused at trial: (1) Henry\u2019s remainder interest under his deceased father\u2019s testamentary trust; and (2) Henry\u2019s expectancy under the terms of his living mother\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">At the time of the divorce in 1976, the following were the operative facts. Under the terms of the testamentary trust of Henry\u2019s father, Henry\u2019s remainder interest would be distributed free of trust when his mother died and when he reached age 35. Henry was about 33 years old and his mother was alive. The trustees were empowered \u201cin their uncontrolled discretion\u201d to invade principal for the benefit of Henry\u2019s mother. The value of the remainder interest was, therefore, uncertain and actuarial calculations would be to no avail. In addition, the remainder was subject to a valid spendthrift clause and could not have then been reached by Ann in satisfaction of any judgment or claim. See <em>Bucknam </em>v. <em>Bucknam, </em>294 Mass. 214 (1936); <em>Burrage </em>v. <em>Bucknam, </em>301 Mass. 235 (1938); <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Pemberton, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 9, 18-22 (1980). Under Henry\u2019s mother\u2019s will, executed on December 20,1975, Henry would receive certain tangible personal property and he would have a life estate under a trust.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">While \u201c[pjroperty concepts have not become immaterial,\u201d <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 15, implicit in our appellate decisions is the rejection of the notion that the content of the estates of divorcing parties ought to be determined by the wooden application of technical rules of the law of property. We think an expansive approach, within the limits of the marital partnership concept, is appropriate. The purpose of \u00a7 34 is to \u201cempowerf ] the courts to deal broadly with property and its equitable division incident to a divorce proceeding. Such broad discretion is necessary in order that the courts can handle the myriad of different fact situations which surround divorces and arrive at a fair financial settlement in each case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>We conclude that Henry\u2019s remainder interest under his father\u2019s testamentary trust, while it may have been at the outer limits, constituted a sufficient property interest to make it a part of his estate for consideration in connection with a property division under \u00a7 34. Henry\u2019s right to the remainder was fixed at the time of the divorce in 1976 (Henry\u2019s father died about 1968. The record does not show when his will was admitted to probate.), subject only to the conditions of survivorship. We do not think that either the uncertainty of value or the inalienability of the interest, in themselves, are sufficient to preclude consideration of the interest as subject to division.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>We do not, of course, suggest that a judge must divide such an interest or assign it to the ledger of the holder in making a division of property. The determination whether to include a particular interest in the property to be divided lies within the sound discretion of the judge after consideration of all of the \u00a7 34 factors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Henry\u2019s expectancy at the time of the divorce under the will of his mother stands on a different footing. The mother was alive (she died on January 30, 1979) and could have changed her will. There are practical reasons for a rule that generally excludes such expectancies from the definition of property subject to division under \u00a7 34. An attempt at some determination of the usual speculative quantum of an expectancy might well involve the lengthy trial of issues collateral to the \u00a7 34 action: the validity of a will, current and future testamentary capacity, valuation of the estates of others, familial relationships, and so forth. See <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>174 Conn. 361, 365 (1978). The record in this case shows no extraordinary circumstances which would support treating Henry\u2019s expectancy as a part of his estate for consideration in connection with a property division under \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event, the expectancy might be considered by the judge, having been mindful of the evidentiary constraints which should deflect secondary considerations, under the \u00a7 34 criterion of \u201copportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income\u201d in determining what disposition to make of the property which <em>is </em>subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>division. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, supra </em>at 402; <em>Belsky </em>v. <em>Belsky, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 852, 853 (1980). See also <em>In re Marriage of Smith, </em>100 Ill. App. 3d 1126 (1981) (Even where governing statute excluded inheritances from definition of marital property, it was proper to consider wife\u2019s inheritance as a factor bearing on division of property). Compare <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>443 N.E.2d 847 (Ind. App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The judge\u2019s findings indicate that she may have considered after-acquired property in determining Henry\u2019s estate. She listed, for example, the home which Henry owned with his wife and tangible personal property which he inherited from his mother, and assigned values to them. It would have been helpful if the judge had separated her findings in the modification action from those in the \u00a7 34 action. (We urge judges to do so in the future.) To the extent that she considered after-acquired property in the \u00a7 34 action, there was error. See <em>Hay </em>v. <em>Cloutier, </em>389 Mass. at 250 &amp; n. 3. Since we cannot determine whether there were improper considerations, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">(c) <em>The G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34 factors.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As of what date are the \u00a7 34 factors to be applied? For the reasons discussed in part 2(b) above, we think that the marital partnership concept embodied in \u00a7 34 dictates that in this case the factors be examined as of the date of the divorce.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The focus of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>commentators and, to some degree, our appellate cases, has been on the recognition by \u00a7 34 of a wife\u2019s service contributions to the marital partnership. The underpinning of any order for division of property under \u00a7 34 is, however, the judge\u2019s consideration of the contributions, in the statutory terms, of each spouse, as well as other factors in existence at the dissolution of the partnership which have been traditionally applied in determining alimony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. at 422-423; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 14-15; Inker &amp; Clower, 16 Suffolk U.L. Rev. at 913-918.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The judge made findings on many of the \u00a7 34 factors, for example, age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, estate, liabilities, needs, and opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets and income, on the basis of the situation of the parties at the time of trial. The conclusion is inescapable that the judge in substantial part based \u00a7 34 relief on those findings. To the extent that she did so, there was error; and the judgment must be reversed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">(d) <em>Valuation of property subject to division. </em>Where the division of property under \u00a7 34 takes place, as here, after the divorce, the property subject to division is to be valued as of the date of the order for division. Henry does not argue to the contrary. Thus, the parties equitably share in any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the property. The results are no different from those which follow from a division at the time of a divorce, except that in the latter case each spouse may have some control oyer the economic vicissitudes of the property which is assigned to him or her. Of course, the principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>which apply to after-acquired property may come into play with respect, for example, to improvements to real estate to which an increase in value may fairly be attributed, or additions to stock holdings, as opposed to stock splits or dividends. No such considerations have been shown to exist here. The judge was correct in valuing Henry\u2019s remainder interest under his father\u2019s testamentary trust on the basis of the distributions from the trust which Henry had received at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">3. <em>The Motion for Mistrial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Henry\u2019s wife, Donna, was called as a witness by Ann; Donna had not been subpoenaed. She testified on direct examination on May 19 and June 9, 1981. On June 25, 1981, Ann filed a motion to join Donna as a defendant, pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 19(a) (1975). Thereafter, Donna\u2019s attorney advised her not to return to Massachusetts from Maryland, where she lived with Henry, and she did not do so. On July 14, 1981, Henry\u2019s motion for a mistrial, on the ground of his inability to cross-examine Donna, was denied. The trial ended on July 15, 1981. On September 17, 1981, Ann\u2019s motion to join Donna as a party was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Since there must be a new trial on the complaint under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, we consider the denial of the motion for mistrial only as it related to the action for modification. In this respect, Henry\u2019s argument on appeal that Donna\u2019s testimony formed the basis for the judge\u2019s findings as to his \u201cfinancial situation\u201d ignores the ample evidence from other sources, including Henry\u2019s own testimony, on which the judge could have based her findings on material change of circumstances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Henry did not seek relief less drastic than mistrial, as, for example, the striking of Donna\u2019s direct testimony. In the almost ten months which elapsed from the denial of the motion to join Donna as a party and the entry of judgment, Henry did not move to reopen the trial for the purpose of cross-examining Donna. Moreover, Henry points to no particular prejudice from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Donna\u2019s direct testimony. The word \u201cmistrial\u201d is used to denote \u201csuch fundamental errors in a trial as to vitiate the result.\u201d <em>C.W. Hunt Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>217 Mass. 319, 321 (1914). \u201cThe declaration of a mistrial is within the sound judicial discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 444 (1980). There was no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">4. <em>Counsel Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Henry\u2019s only argument on this point is that the judge abused her discretion in ordering him to pay $13,500, as counsel fees for Ann, because he \u201clacks the financial status\u201d to pay that amount. He does not argue that the record was inadequate reasonably to evaluate the services of Ann\u2019s counsel, or that the award was not commensurate with the value of the services rendered. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 38-39 (1982). Contrast <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 582 (1983). The judge\u2019s well supported findings clearly show that Henry has the \u201cfinancial status\u201d to satisfy the award of counsel fees. In her conclusions of law the judge expressly recognized the guidelines for determining such awards. See <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>326 Mass. 587, 596-597 (1950); <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (1982). \u201c[T]he award [of counsel fees] may be presumed to be right and ordinarily ought not to be disturbed.\u201d <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, supra </em>at 39, quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>361 Mass. 733, 738 (1972). See <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1032, 1035 (1984). There was no abuse of discretion in the award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">However, since the award was made as a part of the judgment under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, and since we may assume it was based, at least in part, on the result which Ann\u2019s counsel obtained in that action, we also reverse the judgment in this respect, so that the matter may be reconsidered in light of this opinion, and after a new trial on the \u00a7 34 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The judgment of modification is affirmed. The judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-13\"> Henry did not do so. Mortgage payments were substantially in arrears, and the mortgagee bank foreclosed a few days after the entry of the judgment of divorce nisi. Subsequently, Ann was \u00bflowed to repurchase the home with funds borrowed from her father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> A temporary order had been entered on January 11, 1979, increasing child support to $90 per week. The judgment also ordered Henry to pay an arrearage of $3,815 under that order at the rate of $25 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> Res judicata is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded, Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 8(c) (1975). The docket entries do not indicate that an answer to or motion to dismiss the original or amended complaint for assignment of property was filed. No such pleading appears in the appendix. An answer was, of course, required. Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 7(a), 8(b) (1975). (There is no provision in the Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure for summary judgment). See <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 786, 789 n.9 (1984). The record does not show that the question of issue preclusion was argued to the judge, but we assume that such was the case, since the judge addressed the issue in her conclusions of law. In any event, the judge did not rest her decision on the affirmative defense of res judicata, and so it is unnecessry to apply the principles discussed in <em>National Medical Care, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zigelbaum, </em>18 Mass.

We intend no suggestion of a rule fixing any of those dates, or excluding some earlier time in appropriate circumstances, e.g., the date of the separation of the parties, as determinative in identifying divisible property. We think the development of the law in this respect is best left to a case-by-case analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> See part 1 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b394-5\"> Other jurisdictions vary in their determinations as to what interests constitute property subject to division at divorce. (The starting point for analysis of any of the cases is the statute under which equitable division is allowed. See note 13, <em>infra.) </em>For instance, some States include nonpossessory remainders which are not subject to divestment. See e.g., <em>McCain </em>v. <em>McCain, </em>219 Kan. 780 (1976) (vested remainder, in land, which could be transferred, alienated or mortgaged subject to division); <em>In re Marriage of Hill, </em>197 Mont. 451 (1982) (although right to possession postponed, vested remainder divisible at divorce). This approach is not uniform. See, e.g., <em>Frank G.W. </em>v. <em>Carol M.W., </em>457 A.2d 715 (Del. 1983) (vested trust interests not acquired for purposes of equitable distribution until beneficiary obtains possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Similarly, jurisdictions differ as to whether interests subject to contingencies may be equitably distributed. Some States exclude this species of interest as speculative and remote. See, e.g., <em>Kroha </em>v. <em>Kroha, </em>265 Ark. 170 (1979) (trust corpus, which could not be mortgaged, assigned or sold, distributed in monthly payments to beneficiary during life until depletion, not divisible property); <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>261 Ind. 193 (1973) (vested remainder subject to condition subsequent not divisible asset); <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Storm, </em>470 P.2d 367 (Wyo. 1970) (beneficiary\u2019s right to trust corpus conditioned on survivorship is \u201cmere expectancy\u201d not subject to division). Other courts have not hesitated to define such interests as divisible property. See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Bentson, </em>61 Or. App. 282 (1983) (whether vested or contingent, husband\u2019s interest in trust divisible at divorce); <em>Trowbridge </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>16 Wis.2d 176 (1962) (dictum: under Wisconsin law, remainder interest in trust subject to conditions of survivorship, depletion of corpus, and spendthrift clause, part of marital estate subject to division at divorce).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">There have also been cases dealing with the question whether a chose in action accruing during marriage constitutes property divisible at divorce. See and compare <em>Postill </em>v. <em>Postill, </em>116 Mich. App. 578 (1982) (right of action constitutes property suitable for division in divorce), with <em>Fries </em>v. <em>Fries, </em>288 N.W.2d 77 (N.D. 1980) (personal injury claim too speculative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>for inclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">For other cases which have considered interests with uncertain or speculative value, see and <em>compare Richardson </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>280 Ark. 498 (1983) (value of stock options included), with <em>In re Marriage of Moody, </em>119 Ill. App.3d 1043 (1983) (unexercised stock options found not to constitute marital property); and see and compare <em>In re Marriage of Stewart, </em>59 Or. App. 713 (1982) (accounts receivable of husband\u2019s veterinary practice included in property division), with <em>Dogu </em>v. <em>Dogu, </em>652 P.2d 1308 (Utah 1982) (husband\u2019s accounts receivable excluded in property division).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">This court has recognized that nonvested pension rights constitute property subject to division at divorce. <em>Dewan </em>v. <em>Dewan, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 97 (1983). Such has been the trend in both common law and community property jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Van Loan </em>v. <em>Van Loan, </em>116 Ariz. 272 (1977); <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal. 3d 838 (1976); <em>Robert C.S. </em>v. <em>Barbara J.S., </em>434 A.2d 383 (Del. 1981); <em>In re Marriage of Fairchild, </em>110 Ill.

App. 672 (1978). As to vested but unmatured pension rights, see Golden, Equitable Distribution of Property \u00a7\u00a7 6.13 - 6.14 (1983); Meyer, Vested but Unmatured Pensions as Marital Property: Inherent Valuation, Allocation and Distribution Problems in Equitable Distributions, 14 Rutgers L.J. 175 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\"> As will be seen later in this opinion, the question of valuation presents no problem in this case, since the division was made at a time when the remainder interest had vested in possession. In the case of such an interest which has not vested in possession at the time of trial of the \u00a7 34 issues, and where there is no spendthrift or other limitation and actuarial evidence as to valuation is available, guidance in crafting creative judgments may be found in cases dealing with pension interests. See <em>Dewan </em>v. <em>Dewan, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 97 (1983), and cases cited. In situations where it is not feasible to fashion an equitable judgment because of legal or practical impediments, the judge may, in the careful exercise of discretion, balancing the competing considerations of finality and fairness, decide to reserve, in whole or in part, the question of division of property, and retain jurisdiction. Cf. <em>In re Marriage of Fairchild, </em>110 Ill. App. 3d 470, 476 (1982). In all instances, the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in these respects will be influenced by consideration of the criteria enumerated in \u00a7 34.
