The effect of the provisions of town by-law 38 (see \u00a7\u00a7 3[h] [1] and 9A) and of the board\u2019s regulation 29 was, at the times here relevant, to condition such removal upon the owner\u2019s securing, as applicable, either a \u201cremoval permit\u201d or an \u201cexemption.\u201d With enumerated exceptions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits were granted in the exercise of the board\u2019s discretion, of which it is only necessary to say, for the purposes of the present case, that a preference was allowed (and generally accorded) to a purchaser who lived in the same building in a unit other than that which was the subject of the sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An exemption was available where the purchaser was an \u201cexisting tenant\u201d (as defined) of the unit to be sold.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">At dates between July, 1982, and April, 1983, the board granted the plaintiff Aronson, as owner, a permit with respect to one unit at 1080 Beacon Street, and exemptions covering eleven other units in the same building. It appears that the board made these decisions entirely, or at least in material part, on the basis of submissions by the plaintiff consisting of his testifying on oath and producing purchase and sale agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">By May 31, 1983, the board, evidently aided by a staff investigation, had come to suspect that there might have been misrepresentation or fraud in the plaintiff\u2019s submissions on which it had acted; and on that date it voted to reopen the removal hearings on all twelve units \u201cin order to determine,\u201d as it stated in its notice to the plaintiff and others, \u201cwhether the subject units were, in fact, sold to existing tenants.\u201d By a board subpoena of June 23, 1983, the plaintiff was directed to appear on June 27 to give evidence on this matter<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>duce various documents. The hearing was continued at the plaintiff\u2019s request to July 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">On July 6, 1983, the plaintiff commenced the present action seeking, in substance, a declaration and an injunction forbidding the board to reopen its proceedings. After the board filed its answer, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the pleadings. The judge denied the motion; and, upon the pleadings with their annexed exhibits, and after \u201ctrial\u201d consisting of statements and arguments of counsel which supplied some additional material, the judge made findings, rulings, and an order for judgment. The essential facts, as outlined above, may be drawn from the findings with some references to the record. Judgment entered on January 18, 1984, \u201cgranting] authority\u201d to the board (more properly, confirming the board\u2019s authority) \u201cto re-open its \u2018removal hearings\u2019 with respect to the housing units ... for the sole purpose of determining whether or not fraud or misrepresentation was perpetrated upon the board in the granting of removal permits or exemptions . . . . \u201d This judgment is here on review, and, with it, a previous protective order in the action allowing the board\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">1. While the plaintiff challenges the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the board to reopen its hearings, there is a more immediate question of the authority of the Superior Court to entertain the present action. By St. 1970, c. 843, \u00a7 <em>4, </em>the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, is made applicable to the board \u201cas if said rent board were an agency of the commonwealth,\u201d including expressly \u201cthose provisions relating to judicial review of an agency order.\u201d By \u00a7 14 of c. 30A, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, it is \u201cany person. . . aggrieved by a final decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding\u201d who \u201cshall be entitled to a judicial review thereof.\u201d But there has been no final agency decision in these adjudicatory proceedings; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>is the purpose of the action to interdict such a decision. This would seem to deprive the plaintiff of \u201cstanding\u201d to maintain the action or, otherwise stated, to oust the Superior Court. See <em>Duato </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>359 Mass. 635, 637-638 (1971); <em>Group Ins. Commn. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>381 Mass. 199, 202 &amp; n.3 (1980); <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Brookline Realty &amp; Inv. Corp., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 66 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Nevertheless, within cautious limits, an original action may lie to test whether an agency has exceeded its powers or \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or is aiming to do so, and to this extent the \u201cfinal decision\u201d or \u201cexhaustion\u201d principle may be pushed aside. Caution is indeed called for, as the history of administrative law shows, because attacks, mounted ostensibly under the banner of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d have on occasion been used to delay, if not to abort, legitimate agency undertakings. Decisions in this Commonwealth have allowed the rather anomalous original action in some situations where there was a credible claim that an agency was going beyond its bounds, the question appeared to be a general one whose settlement might be of value to many in addition to the immediate parties, and the case involved no or little fact finding (as where it reduced to statutory interpretation on agreed facts). See <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>356 Mass. 563, 564-565 (1970); <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 450-452 (1973), and cases cited; <em>Lahey Clinic Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., </em>376 Mass. 359, 369 (1978). Cf. <em>Murphy v. Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-222 (1979). Although we have misgivings whether the present claim can be ranked as credible, we cannot say that the judge committed error in entertaining the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">2. There is no express provision for reconsideration of a board decision in the statute, by-law, or regulation, nor is there any provision on this matter in c. 30A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet, where the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>by statute, by-law, and its own regulation has expansive regulatory responsibility over a subject, with considerable leeway regarding substance and procedure,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and where, moreover, it deals on an adjudicatory basis with many ex parte applications requiring prompt action, the possibilities of misprisions are so obvious that a power to take corrective steps after decision would seem necessary and therefore implicit; and especially so, for instances where fraud or other overreaching is suspected.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">To be sharply distinguished are questions of agency power to reconsider an adjudicatory decision in order to apply fresh judgment or an altered substantive policy to an otherwise closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>proceeding. Such are the cases on which the plaintiff seeks to rely.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We deal here with a supposed imposition on the board that would result in a tainted decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">It is not in the least astonishing that courts have found many times that a power to reopen proceedings on grounds of fraud is inherent in the administrative process and needs no specific authorization by statute or regulation. <em>See Baggett Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>206 F. Supp. 835, 842 (N.D. Ala. 1962); <em>Redding </em>v. <em>County Commrs. for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>263 Md. 94, 111 (1971); <em>Anchor Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Bongards Co-op. Creamery Assn., </em>253 Minn. 101, 104-107 (1958); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>24 Wash. App. 357, 361-363 (1979).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Other decisions look to some authorization for the reopening of final agency action, but tend to make an exception for fraud or to read vague, liberal grants of adjudicatory power to include inferentially the authority to reopen on account of error. See <em>Kephart </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>219 F. Supp. 801, 823-828 (W.D. Tex. 1963), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 350 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1965); <em>Modine Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Pollution Control Bd., </em>40 Ill. App. 3d 498, 501 (1976).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Professor Davis appears to assume that the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>of express authorization for reopening administrative proceedings does not preclude it; on that basis he has identified the factors that agencies ought to consider in deciding in given situations whether they should, upon reopening, undo earlier decisions. Two of the factors mentioned are of interest also on the anterior question of the power to reopen: \u201cthe degree of care or haste in making the earlier decision, and the general equities of each problem.\u201d Davis, Administrative Law Text \u00a7 18.09, at 370 (3d ed. 1972).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As noted, under the practice indicated by the present record, the board, possibly for reasons of expedition, acted altogether or mainly on the faith of the presentation made by the owner, without \u2014 so far as appears \u2014 any serious independent check. That argues for a right to take a backward look, and the equities in cases of fraud argue to the same conclusion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We add, as a final consideration, that if courts with their elaborate formal procedures require an avenue for \u201crelief from judgment or order,\u201d among other reasons, for \u201cfraud . . . , misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\u201d (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 60[b], 365 Mass. 828 [1974]), administrative agencies with their generally looser, less stringent procedures need such a backup even more.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>To answer other points urged by the plaintiff. He argues that, perhaps peculiarly in a case where fraud is or may be involved, the board, if it has any recourse, must proceed as a complainant in a court, and not through reopening its own proceedings. The usual appearance of an agency as a plaintiff in court is to enforce orders eventuating from its administrative proceedings. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 12(5); St. 1970, c. 843, \u00a7\u00a7 2, <em>5(b); </em>by-law 38, \u00a7\u00a7 10(b), 12(c); regulation 29, \u00a7 11(b). If the board has any capacity for pursuing a fraud case by an original court action, a question that need not be decided here, we would not see this as necessarily excluding the alternative of a reopening of the agency proceeding, which seems to us to be more suitable in any event.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Of course the fact that fraud may have ultimate penal consequences, see by-law 38, \u00a7 12; regulation 29, \u00a7 11(a), (b), is irrelevant to the issue at bar.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Assuming that reopening by the board is available in cases of suspected fraud, the plaintiff says it should be initiated within ten days of the ruling to be reexamined, this period corresponding to the time limited by c. 30A, \u00a7 14, for initiating judicial review of a final decision of an agency. We do not see a convincing connection: as well might one argue that the rule 60(b) period should correspond with the period for taking an appeal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s suggested period would be unfortu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>nate as a practical matter for dealing with fraud cases. We agree \u2014 and the cases suggest \u2014 that it may be desirable to prescribe reasonable time limits for reopenings.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The time intervals in the present case, ranging from two to ten months from the dates of the several decisions granting removals, seem not unreasonable; compare the limit of one year allowed for fraud under rule 60(b).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We suggest that the question of time limits should be thought of as initially for decision (or adoption of regulations) by the agency itself. Cf. <em>Lahey Clinic Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., </em>376 Mass. at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Last, the plaintiff urges that the undoing of removals earlier allowed could involve prejudice to interests innocently acquired and relied on. Neither the record nor the arguments of counsel give us an insight into the legal or practical consequences of a finding of fraud; such questions must abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We observe, in conclusion, that the board has been scrupulous to say that, short of reopening and continuing the adjudicatory proceedings, it has no adequate basis for an opinion whether the plaintiff was in fact guilty of any misconduct. If misconduct should be found, the final decision of the board concluding the reopened adjudicatory proceeding will be subject to judicial review on the part of the present plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed. Since the action fails, the protective order striking the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-16\"> Amended in a respect not here relevant by St. 1971, c. 673.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> By-law 38, \u00a7 9A(c), (d), (g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> Regulation 29, \u00a7 6(f)(1).

(The plaintiff then unsuccessfully petitioned a single justice of this court to stay that order and the underlying judgment.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\"> By G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1978, c. 60, the Commissioner of Administration may promulgate standard rules of adjudicatory procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>which are to apply to \u201call [SJtate agencies within the executive offices,\u201d except such of those agencies as have secured the Commissioner\u2019s approval of additional or substitute rules for their own adjudicatory proceedings. On this appeal, evidently for the first time, the plaintiff argues that the standard rules apply to the board. Without reaching that question, we observe that the standard rules pointed to, 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(10)(o) &amp; (p) (1979), appear to be irrelevant to our case. Section 1.01(10)(o) deals with the introduction of new evidence before a tentative or final decision is issued. Section 1.01(10)(p) says reconsideration may be obtained by a party upon motion made within ten days of the issuance of a decision. There is no attempt here, we suggest, to deal with the problem where a party is suspected of having defrauded the tribunal \u2014 a situation seldom likely to arise so quickly. Compare Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(b), 365 Mass. 827 (1974) (time for new trial motion), with 60(b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974) (time for motion for relief from judgment).

It is noteworthy, however, that \u201c[t]his rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action ... to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.\u201d In the latter case, there is no definite limit of time; equitable notions of loches or the like would control.
