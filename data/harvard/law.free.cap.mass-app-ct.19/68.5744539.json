DeMello. A Probate judge held she was not and entered summary judgment for the defendants. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">Jacintha C. DeMello left all of her property in trust as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201cTo pay the income to my children \u2014 Manuel C. De-Mello, Angelo C. DeMello, Joseph C. DeMello, John C. DeMello, Clementina C. DeMello, and Mary C. Rodrigues \u2014 equally during the life of each; and upon the death of each to add his/her undistributed income to his/her share of the principal and pay the net income of said child to his/her surviving widow or widower who is living at the time of my death during his/her widowhood;. . ..\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. Jacintha died in February, 1961, leaving six children. Her will was executed in April, 1953, at a time when Clementina, one of her children, was unmarried.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 24, 1963, after Jacintha\u2019s death, Angelo, a son of Jacintha, whose first wife had died in Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ber, 1962, entered into a second marriage with the plaintiff, Kathleen. He died in 1982. Kathleen was a life in being at the time of Jacintha\u2019s death. The trustee made some payments to Kathleen after Angelo\u2019s death but has ceased to make such payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Jacintha\u2019s intent must be ascertained from the entire instrument, giving \u201cdue weight to all its language, considered in the light of the circumstances known to [her] at the time of its execution . . ..\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Aldrich, 326 </em>Mass. 630, 632 (1951). <em>Stryker </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>339 Mass. 373, 377 (1959). All parties acknowledge that the purpose of the clause \u2014 \u201cwho is living at the time of my death\u201d \u2014 which modifies the words \u201cwidow or widower\u201d was to guard against violation of the rule against perpetuities. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Aldrich, 326 </em>Mass, at 632; Leach, Perpetuities in a Nutshell, 51 Harv. L. Rev. 638, 644 (1938) (\u201cA provision in the will that the life estate to the widow is dependent upon her being bom in the life of T[estator] saves the remainder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Relying on the following language in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Aldrich, 326 </em>Mass, at 633, the defendants argue that the term \u201cwidow\u201d does not include Kathleen. \u201cWhere an estate is given to a person described by relation either to the testator or to other devisees, on a contingency that may or may not happen, and a person is in being at the time of the execution of the will, to whom, on the happening of the contingency, the description would apply, it is a safe general mie to hold such person as intended to be the devisee.\u201d <em>Id. In Hill, </em>language similar to that used by Jacintha<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was construed to exclude a widow of a child of the testatrix who married a second time after the death of the testatrix. In <em>Stryker </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>339 Mass, at 378, however, the Supreme Judicial Court referred to the role in <em>Hill </em>as being \u201cone of construction, not one of law,\u201d and said, \u201cA role of this character must yield whenever a testator or settlor expresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>an intention to dispose of property in a manner inconsistent with the result obtained by the application of the rule.\u201d The <em>Stryker </em>court found such a contrary intention in a provision for the settlor\u2019s grandchildren which made reference to a \u201csucceeding wife\u201d of her son. A widow of a subsequent marriage was held entitled to take under language providing an income interest to a widow of the settlor\u2019s son.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We think the fact that Clementina was unmarried at the time Jacintha executed her will indicates that she did not intend to limit the term \u201cwidow or widower\u201d to mean those persons who were married to her children at the time of the execution of her will. Nor is there any indication in the instrument that she intended to benefit only those persons who were married to her children at the time of her death. For example, it would make no sense to exclude a spouse of Clementina if Jacintha had died before Clementina\u2019s marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">As we construe her will, Jacintha intended to benefit the widows and widowers of her children. Since not all her children were married at the time she drew her will, we hold, as in <em>Stryker </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>that Jacintha\u2019s intent is not consistent with the rule of construction applied in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Aldrich. </em>Accordingly, the judgment dismissing the complaint is reversed, and a new judgment is to enter declaring that the plaintiff is a beneficiary entitled to income under the will of Jacintha.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\"> The remaining dispositive terms of the trust are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u201c. . . and upon the death of each child and remarriage or death of his/her said widow or widower to distribute said child\u2019s share of the principal together with all undistributed income to the then living sons and daughter [sic] of said child who attain the age of 21 years when each attains said age and if any of said grandchildren of mine die before reaching the age of 21 years his/her share of the principal shall be distributed to his/her brothers and sisters who are 21 years of age at that time at the time of his/her death.
