Count one was for breach of contract; count two was for fraud; count three alleged a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 7N, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 761, \u00a7 3; and count four sought treble damages and an attorney\u2019s fee under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, as amended through St. 1979, c. 72, \u00a7 2. The defendant expressed its displeasure with the plaintiff by counterclaiming for fair and reasonable charges for storage of the truck since the date of its return by the plaintiff. All four counts and the counterclaim were tried together, the first three counts and the counterclaim to a jury and the fourth count to a judge. A verdict was directed for the defendant on count three,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the jury found for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>plaintiff on counts one and two and on the counterclaim. The judge awarded the plaintiff double damages and an attorney\u2019s fee under count four. The defendant appealed from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The only question of any substance arises out of the judge\u2019s failure to make explicit findings under Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), with respect to count four. See <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 311-317 (1983); <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 91-92 (1983); <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Nashawaty, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 310, 311, 315 (1981). So far as here material, the judge appears to have contented himself with a statement to the effect that the jury had returned verdicts for the plaintiff on counts one and two,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with a three-line summary of facts the jury could have found, and with a statement that he \u201caccept[ed] the jury\u2019s verdict[s].\u201d The only material findings the judge himself made were that the plaintiff, in purchasing the truck, had relied on a false representation by the defendant that the truck was \u201croad-ready\u201d and that the conduct of the defendant \u201cwas a violation of [c. 93A, \u00a7 11<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] in that the defendant was guilty of deceptive acts and practices.\u201d The judge moved directly from there to an award of double damages and an attorney\u2019s fee<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> without any express finding that the violation had been either \u201cwillful\u201d or \u201cknowing\u201d within the meaning of the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 11. That elision invites an inquiry as to whether, in the circumstances of this case, it would be proper to infer a finding of either wilful or knowing action on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The answer to that inquiry turns on the proper construction of the words \u201cwillful\u201d and \u201cknowing\u201d as they are employed in \u00a7 11<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> whenever a cause of action depends for its existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>on a false representation. As the defendant all but concedes, a misrepresentation known to be false when it is made can be found to be a \u201cknowing\u201d violation of \u00a7 2. See <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Center, Inc., </em>392 Mass. 228, 232, 235, 236 (1984). The problem is with the proper construction of the word \u201cwillful.\u201d The defendant points out that the jury were instructed that they could find for the plaintiff not only if the defendant knew its representation (\u201croad-ready\u201d) was false when made but also if the defendant should have known the representation was false or if the representation was made recklessly without regard to whether it was true or false.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>355 Mass. 117, 118-119 (1969), and cases cited. The argument is, in effect, that there cannot be a \u201cwillful\u201d violation unless the representation was known to be false when made; that the jury did not specify the basis for their verdict on count two (see note 2, <em>supra); </em>that the judge, in \u201caccepting] the . . . verdict\u201d on that count, made no finding that the misrepresentation was knowing rather than wilful; and, therefore, that the award of double damages cannot stand because it may rest on an erroneous legal premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We do not agree. Although neither of our appellate courts has had occasion to consider the ramifications of the word \u201cwillful\u201d in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9(3) and 11, as applied to a false representation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> those ramifications have been explored and carefully considered by Judge Keeton of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in his well reasoned opinion in the case of <em>Computer Sys. Engr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Qantel </em>Corp., 571 F. Supp. 1365, 1373-1375 (1983), in which, after a review of the relevant Massachusetts cases, the following conclusions were reached: \u201cTo prove that the defendant committed a knowing violation by fraud, the plaintiff may show that agents of the defendant knew that the fact they represented to be true was not true. Similarly, to prove that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>defendant committed a willful violation by fraud, the plaintiff may prove that agents of the defendant knew they did not know whether the fact represented was true or false \u2014 that they made the representation without knowing whether it was true or false and with reckless disregard for whether it was true or false. Though not the equivalent of proving the state of mind of knowing the falsity of the fact represented, this is nevertheless proof of a culpable state of mind \u2014 the state of mind of willful disregard for truth or falsity of the fact represented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed in these words: \u201cWe accept Judge Keeton\u2019s comprehensive and scholarly analysis, and affirm his interpretation of the language \u2018willful or knowing violation\u2019 on the basis of his opinion.\u201d <em>Computer Sys. Engr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Qantel Corp., </em>740 F.2d 59, 68 (1st Cir. 1984). We add our endorsement to that of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">It follows that there is no obstacle to our inferring that the judge\u2019s award of double damages in this case was based on either of two permissible premises, that the misrepresentation in question was wilful or that it was knowing. It matters not which. Indeed, it could have been both, depending on whether one looks at the misrepresentation made by the defendant\u2019s salesman or at the subsequent conduct of the defendant\u2019s sales manager. In the circumstances, and in the absence of any motion by the defendant under Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(b), 365 Mass. 817 (1974), for clarification of the judge\u2019s findings, we see no unfairness to the defendant in sustaining the award of double damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Other questions of lesser importance are considered in the appendix hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The judgment is to be modified so as to include therein an attorney\u2019s fee for the plaintiff in connection with this appeal in such reasonable amount as may be determined by the trial judge,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">1. The judge did not err in shutting off the line of questions concerning the contents of the Federal income tax return which the plaintiff had filed for the tax year in which he had purchased the truck. The inquiry was not relevant to any issue in the case, as the plaintiff, at the outset of the trial, had waived any claim for damages except the one for the return of the agreed purchase price of the truck. There might have been something in the return which would have contradicted some statements the plaintiff had made in an affidavit he had filed in support of his motion for a speedy trial, but it does not appear that there was anything in the return which would have contradicted any of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony at trial. Indeed, the adjusted gross income figure (which is all that was revealed to the judge) would not have contradicted any of the testimony which is now adverted to for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">2. The first objection to the line of questions as to whether the defendant had given the plaintiff a certificate of title to the truck came too late to require us to consider the point now argued. Indeed, the plaintiff had testified the previous day, without objection, that he had never received such a certificate. We note that the title documents that were produced from the defendant\u2019s files disclosed that its vendor, whom the defendant had called as a witness in its behalf, had owned the truck for only a fraction of the period to which he had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">3. There was no abuse of discretion or other error of law in the order by which the trial judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion in limine concerning expert testimony which might be offered by the defendant. It was open to the judge to find (i) from the defendant\u2019s late-filed original answers to the interrogatories that had been put to it under Mass.R.Civ.P. 26 (b) (4), 365 Mass. 774 (1974), (ii) from the fact that the defendant had ignored the plaintiff\u2019s written request under Mass.R.Civ.P. 26 (e) (1) (B) and (3), 365 Mass. 776, 777 (1974), for supplementation of the original answers for more than nine months, (iii) from the facts that the supplemental answers were not served on the plaintiff until four days prior to the Monday on which the trial was to start or filed in court until the day of trial, and (iv) from the face of the supplemental answers themselves, both that the defendant had acted in bad faith and that the plaintiff could well be prejudiced by the actions of the defendant unless the trial were to be delayed in order to allow the plaintiff to depose the supposed experts, who ultimately turned out to be the very employees of the defendant with whom the plaintiff had dealt when he purchased the truck. Compare <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em>528 F.2d 395, 403-404 (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 823 (1976); <em>Minnkota Power Coop. </em>v. <em>Manitowoc Co., </em>669 F.2d 525, 528-529 (8th Cir. 1982).
