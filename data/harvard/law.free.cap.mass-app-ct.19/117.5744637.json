L. c. 266, \u00a7 16), Martin was sentenced to a term of imprisonment at a house of correction. On appeal, Martin claims that the judge erred (1) in failing to give an instruction on the effect of impeachment by prior inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>statements; and (2) in failing to give an instruction on \u201cconsciousness of innocence.\u201d Timely objections were preserved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">1. The relevant background to the first issue may be summarized as follows. At trial, the prosecution\u2019s eyewitness, Leonard Peterson, testified that about midnight on June 26, 1983, he was driving by a convenience store in Worcester when he heard glass breaking. Peterson stated that he slowed down his automobile and observed Martin and another man holding a trash bag and pulling it out from a broken glass window at the store. (Two trash bags containing fifty-three cartons of cigarettes valued at $465 were later recovered by the police.) Peterson was impeached on cross-examination, first by his testimony at the bench trial that a \u201csharp noise\u201d had drawn his attention to the store but that he could not distinguish what the noise was; and second, by his previous testimony that all that he had seen was a broken window and two people standing in front of the store. Peterson also testified on direct examination that he had observed the two plastic bags \u201cbeing brought back by another police officer from around the comer of the store.\u201d On cross-examination, however, he was reminded by defense counsel that he had testified at the bench trial that he was not present when the bags were returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In closing argument, defense counsel pointed out that Peterson had \u201ctestified . . . that he heard glass breaking. Now, if he testified in another courtroom that he didn\u2019t know what that noise was, I submit to you that this is an inconsistent statement.\u201d Later in his argument, defense counsel questioned whether \u201cwe want to believe Mr. Peterson who says that at one time ... he heard a window breaking and then at another time he said he didn\u2019t know what the noise was that he heard. Another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>interesting point. He testified here today he saw Mr. Martin taking out a bag as he drove by. My last set of questions to him [was], \u2018When you testified before didn\u2019t you say that when you looked toward the window you just saw Mr. Martin standing there, and that\u2019s all you saw?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s what I said.\u2019 I submit to you that that\u2019s another prior inconsistent statement. He also testified that he remained there in that area and saw the police officers bring two plastic bags back. I asked him, \u2018Well, didn\u2019t you testify in another time that you didn\u2019t see the police officer come back with any bags?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes, I did testify to that earlier. \u2019 So I submit to you that [those were] three inconsistent statements made by this man.\u201d Defense counsel also pointed out that a police officer had testified that the hole in the window was too small for Martin to have fit through but \u201cwe have Mr. Peterson for whatever reasons, saying that he saw this man doing something which was physically impossible for him to do.\u201d For his part, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether Peterson\u2019s testimony appeared credible. The prosecutor pointed out, \u201c[W]hy wouldn\u2019t he tell you the truth? He doesn\u2019t even know the defendant.\u201d He went on to refer to the conflicts between Peterson\u2019s prior testimony and his testimony before the jury without attempting to explain them, finally urging the jury to find that Peterson was doing his job as a citizen in reporting the crime and that his testimony was truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">As previously noted, the judge, although seasonably requested by defense counsel, gave no instruction to the jury about the effect of impeachment by means of prior inconsistent statements. However, the judge did inform the jury that \u201cin a criminal case, such inferences as a jury may draw must be based upon facts established beyond a reasonable doubt by trustworthy and credible evidence.\u201d The judge also gave the instructions, set forth in the footnote, on measuring the credibility of witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>It was error for the judge not to charge on the evidentiary effect of prior inconsistent statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>354 Mass. 757 (1968). Even apart from the requested instruction, the judge had the duty to state the applicable law to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcione, </em>364 Mass. 611, 618 (1974). In the circumstances, however, the error was harmless. The closing argument of defense counsel brought to the jury\u2019s attention, in a forceful and direct manner, that Peterson\u2019s testimony was \u201cat best but one of two or more inconsistent tales authored by him from time to time.\u201d Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 141 (5th ed. 1981). The judge\u2019s instructions on the role of trustworthy and credible evidence as a prerequisite to accurate fact-finding, and his explanation of the standards for determining credibility, served to focus the jury, in light of the testimony and final arguments of counsel, upon the credibility of Peterson\u2019s trial testimony as the central issue. Moreover, by reason of the omission of the requested instruction the defendant acquired a tactical advantage which he was otherwise not entitled to, namely possible jury consideration of the prior inconsistent statements of the crucial prosecution witness for their substantive truth. That the jury did not do so does not turn harmless error into reversible error. We can say with assurance that the judge\u2019s error could not have influenced the jury in reaching their verdict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>2. There was evidence that a police officer driving past the scene observed Martin and a woman standing in front of the store and a second man crossing the street in a direction away from the store. As the officer approached the store to investigate, Peterson stopped him and talked to him. The officer parked his cruiser and approached Martin, who \u201cdid not run\u201d. The officer questioned Martin about the hole in the window and the condition of the inside of the store, which was seen by the officer to contain the trash bags full of cigarettes and which was by him described as a \u201cmess.\u201d Martin was informed by the officer that there had been a witness to the incident. Martin denied any responsibility and claimed that he had seen \u201csome kid in a football shirt run away with the bag.\u201d The officer noted in his report, which was admitted in evidence, that Martin \u201cdid not give me a hard time\u201d during the questioning at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The foregoing evidence led defense counsel to request the instruction set forth in the footnote on what he referred to as \u201cconsciousness of innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The requested instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tracks, with an appropriate change in wording, a once commonly used instruction on inferring consciousness of guilt from flight.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The whole question of the probative value of evidence of flight was discussed at length in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 584-585 (1982). Such evidence was characterized in <em>Toney </em>(at 585) as \u201cequivocal [in] nature,\u201d and, in general, circumspection was urged with respect to jury instructions on the topic. <em>Id. </em>at 584-585.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">All of the problems inherent in the admission of evidence of flight as evincing consciousness of guilt, and more, are present in the admission of evidence of the absence of flight as demonstrating consciousness of innocence. The primary battle concerning evidence of the absence of flight has been fought over whether the evidence ought to be admitted at all. Representative of the reasoning of many jurisdictions which refuse admission is an early California decision, <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>53 Cal. 576 (1879). <em>In Montgomery, </em>the defendant sought to prove, as circumstantial evidence of innocence, that while confined in jail awaiting trial he had an opportunity to escape but declined to do so. The court in <em>Montgomery </em>held that evidence that a defendant did not flee when he had the chance was of little value because there are many plausible reasons why a guilty person might also refrain from flight. Said the court (at 577-578): \u201cHe may very naturally have been deterred from making an effort to escape from a fear that he would be recaptured, and that his fruitless attempt to escape would be evidence of guilt; or he may have felt so strong a confidence of his acquittal, for want of the requisite proof of his guilt, that he deemed it unnecessary to flee.\u201d California has recently reaffirmed the holding in <em>Montgomery, </em>expanding upon the reasons stated in that case for exclusion of the evidence by adding that the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by its tendency to cause prejudice, confuse the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>and mislead the jury. <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, </em>27 Cal. 3d 1, 36-39 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">There is, however, an important distinction to be made between admission of evidence of absence of flight and instructing the jury about it. On the one hand, admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s behavior at the time of arrest gives the jury a look at the complete picture and usually comes in quite naturally, as it did in this case, in testimony describing the defendant\u2019s conduct. On the other hand, instruction of the jury may divert their attention from more central issues by an unnecessary attempt at explaining what has been described as \u201cextraordinarily complex action, potentially prompted by a variety of motives other than guilt [or innocence] of the actual crime.\u201d <em>Austin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>414 F.2d 1155, 1157 (D.C. Cir. 1969). We think Wigmore provides a useful general guideline on the subject in the following observation: \u201cLet the accused\u2019s whole conduct come in; and whether it calls for consciousness of guilt or for consciousness of innocence, let us take it for what it is worth, remembering that in either case it is open to varying explanations and is not to be emphasized.\u201d 2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 293, at 232 (Chadboum rev. 1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Testimony describing Martin\u2019s conduct at the scene was admitted without objection and his counsel was given substantial latitude in final argument (again without objection) to contend that absence of flight was consistent with Martin\u2019s claim of innocence. Relegating the subject to the give and take of argument was appropriate in the circumstances and the refusal of a jury instruction avoided the overemphasis about which Wigmore cautions. We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>elude, where testimony of absence of flight is permitted by the trial judge, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>that the inference like the one sought by Martin ought not to \u201cbe elevated above any other inference that might be argued to the jury, and given the status of being particularly significant by being enshrined in an instruction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Telfaire, </em>469 F.2d 552, 558 (D.C. Cir. 1972). It was not error to deny the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> Written requests for both instructions were seasonably filed by defense counsel prior to closing arguments but were not acted upon by the judge. At the conclusion of the charge, the judge refused to allow defense counsel to approach the bench while the jury were present. The judge did permit defense counsel to put his objections on the record after the jury had retired to consider their verdict. The judge\u2019s refusals to rule on the requested instructions and to consider objections to the charge before the jury retired were in violation of the requirements of Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"> \u201cNow, because you are the sole judges of the facts, in order to find the truth, it necessarily follows that you are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u201cIn determining the credit that you will give a witness and the weight and value you will attached to his testimony, take the following into consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>eration: The conduct and appearance of the witness on the stand; the interest of the witness, if any, in the result of the trial; the motive of the witness in testifying, the probability or the improbability of the witness\u2019 statement; the opportunity that the witness had to observe or to be informed as to matters which such witness is testifying; and lastly, the inclination of the witness to speak the truth or otherwise as to matters within the knowledge of such witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201cYou should take all these matters into consideration with all the facts and circumstances in the case given in evidence.

If you find that Mr. Martin, prior to being arrested, had a significant opportunity to flee and passed up that opportunity, then you may find that Mr. Martin\u2019s behavior indicated a \u201cconsciousness of innocence\u201d \u2014 namely, that Mr. Martin evidently thought he had committed no crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">\u201cYou may consider the lack of flight ... as one circumstance tending to show feelings of innocence, and you may also consider feelings of innocence as evidence tending to show actual innocence.
