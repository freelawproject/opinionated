In the District Court, DiGiovanni successfully argued that a petition he submitted to the board on February 12, 1982, was constructively granted because the board did not act upon it within the statutory time limit. The judge also accepted his alternative argument that the board acted arbitrarily in denying him all the relief requested in a second, March 5, 1982, petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The relevant facts may be summarized as follows. In 1978, DiGiovanni obtained a variance from the board to construct a cluster development on Rowe Point in Rockport. This variance was granted for a development \u201cas shown by the plans submitted to (and on file with) this Board.\u201d At subsequent meetings, DiGiovanni asserts, he showed the board plans (\u201c1980 plans\u201d) that disclosed modifications of the 1978 plans, including, among other things, changes in the location, orientation and design of the buildings. DiGiovanni concedes, however, that he never specifically called these modifications to the board\u2019s attention. Later, the Rockport building inspector issued foundation and building permits on the basis of the 1980 plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">After DiGiovanni had poured eighteen foundations and substantially completed four units, the building inspector issued a stop work order. The building inspector\u2019s letter explained that the order was issued because construction was not in accordance with DiGiovanni\u2019s 1978 plans. It went on to state that DiGiovanni could request a modification of the 1978 variance or appeal the stop work order to the board pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The form the board provides for zoning-related matters contains four \u201cboxes.\u201d Applicants mark a box to indicate whether they are seeking a special permit or a variance or are taking \u201e an appeal from an <em>attached </em>decision. For the uncertain, a fourth box, marked \u201cand such other and further relief as the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>deems appropriate,\u201d is provided. On February 12, 1982, Di-Giovanni filed with the town clerk a form that requested \u201cand such other and further relief as the Board deems appropriate.\u201d Specifically, he asked that the board grant \u201cfurther relief from the plans that are on file with the Board of Appeals\u201d concerning \u201cKnowlton\u2019s Field.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He did not attach the building inspector\u2019s stop work order to the form (as is required for \u201cappeals\u201d), nor did he specify what \u201cfurther relief\u2019 he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">On February 23, 1982, DiGiovanni met informally with the board. The substance of the discussion, as reflected by the minutes, was that DiGiovanni felt he was in substantial compliance with the 1978 plans. The board, however, apparently felt that a public hearing and modification of the variance would be required before he could continue construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">On March 5, 1982, DiGiovanni filed a second application with the town clerk. Although he checked none of the boxes on this application, he specified therein that this version was a \u201c[p]etition ... for modification of [a] variance ... so that the building configurations and placements can be as shown on the [modified] plan . . . attached hereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">What subsequently became of the February 12 application was the subject of conflicting testimony at trial. The town clerk recalled that he had returned the application to DiGiovanni on March 5. DiGiovanni had no such recollection. The board\u2019s secretary testified that her files contained no February 12 form. The town clerk testified that the log he kept of zoning-related applications contained no record of the February 12 application. He further stated that no copy of the form remained in his office after he returned the February 12 application to Di-Giovanni. The clerk admitted that he did not usually return such documents to applicants. DiGiovanni had two copies of the February 12 application in his possession. One bore the clerk\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d stamp, the other was a photocopy. The town clerk could not remember whether DiGiovanni had submitted two copies and had both stamped or whether there was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>one stamped copy of which a photocopy was made for Di-Giovanni\u2019s records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On March 30, 1982, the board held a hearing on Di-Giovanni\u2019s March 5 application. In the course of that meeting DiGiovanni\u2019s lawyer stated that \u201c[w]e have appealed the decision of the Building Inspector.\u201d Later, the lawyer asserted, \u201cWe are asking for relief. We did miscalculate. There\u2019s no question about it.\u201d The board\u2019s decision, filed May 12, 1982, treated DiGiovanni\u2019s application as a petition for modification of the 1978 variance. The board granted some relief but denied several of DiGiovanni\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, DiGiovanni appealed to the District Court. The trial judge found, in substance, that Di-Giovanni\u2019s February 12 application was an appeal of the stop work order, and was constructively granted because the board failed to act upon it within the time limit specified by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15. He found that the board\u2019s secretary picked up applications once a week on Friday and that DiGiovanni\u2019s February 12 application was found in a board file folder. The judge further found that even if the February 12 application had been a request for modification of the 1978 variance, DiGiovanni was entitled to the variance as a matter of right. He also found that the 1978 plans were <em>not </em>made a part of the 1978 variance, that DiGiovanni was not bound to follow the 1978 plans exactly, and that Rockport was \u201cestopped\u201d to contest changes in setback that resulted from the requirements of the town\u2019s conservation commission. The judge found that changes in the orientation of the buildings were not substantial or significant deviations from the 1978 variance and that the changes were in any event available for the board\u2019s consideration, if not impliedly approved, in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Based on these findings, the trial judge ruled that the building inspector\u2019s stop work order should not have been issued because it was not based \u201con any substantial evidence\u201d; that the March 5 application was unnecessary and a \u201cnullity\u201d; and that the board\u2019s May 12 decision was \u201carbitrary and not supported by fact or law.\u201d The judge, in effect, ordered the building inspector to reissue building permits and ordered vacated \u201cany order, decision, condition, or requirement\u201d of the town of Rockport subsequent to the stop work order.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We review the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). Findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous, that is, when there is no evidence to support them or when, \u201calthough there is evidence to support [them], the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Building Inspector of Lancaster </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>372 Mass. 157, 160-161 (1977), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). The judge\u2019s conclusions of law are not binding on this court. <em>Newburyport Soc. for the Relief of Aged Women </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>287 Mass. 530, 532-533 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">1. <em>Order Reinstating Building Permits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">It is well settled in Massachusetts that a \u201ccourt hearing an appeal from the grant or denial of a variance or a special permit is without administrative discretion .... [A court may not substitute] forms of relief different from those originally asked for ... .\u201d <em>Geryk </em>v. <em>Zoning Appeals Bd. of Easthampton, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 683, 684-685 (1979). The only relief Di-Giovanni requested from the board was a modification of his 1978 variance. The trial judge\u2019s characterization of Di-Giovanni\u2019s February 12 application as an appeal from the building inspector\u2019s stop work order is erroneous. If a somewhat ambiguously worded document is understood by all concerned to be a request for a specific form of relief, the notice requirements of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, are satisfied. We do not exalt form over substance in such a case. See <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>344 Mass. 547, 553-554 (1962); <em>Spalke </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 683, 685 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>(1979). Here, however, DiGiovanni\u2019s February 12 application cannot be construed as an appeal founded on the theory that the building inspector\u2019s stop work order was wrong as matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The form of relief he requested was \u201cand such other and further relief as the Board deems appropriate,\u201d and \u201cfurther relief from the plans that are on file with the Board of Appeals.\u201d No \u201crelief\u2019 from the previously filed plans would have been needed if DiGiovanni had intended to assert that his present construction was in substantial compliance with the 1978 variance and that the building inspector had erroneously revoked his permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The statutory requirement that \u00a7 15 appeals from the decisions of building inspectors \u201cspecify[ ] the grounds thereof\u2019 we understand as mandatory rather than directory. Generally, boards of appeals are without power to act upon appeals in the absence of public hearings of which the public has been previously notified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The board cannot undertake to notify the public of a hearing unless the board itself has adequate notice of the form of relief petitioners request.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because neither the February 12 nor the March 5 petition was an appeal from the building inspector\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the trial judge lacked the power to rescind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>in effect, the building inspector\u2019s stop work order. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 14, gives the board only the \u201cpowers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.\u201d If there is no appeal, the board is without power; if the board has no power, the reviewing court likewise has none. \u201cThe board\u2019s decision may not [on appeal] be treated as if it were a decision in an appeal [from the building inspector\u2019s decision].\u201d <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Leominster, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 58., 61 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">This same reasoning also prevents a too vaguely worded application from being constmctively granted in accordance with G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15. \u201cZoning relief granted constructively is not beyond judicial review. The relief so granted may be tested on appeal under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, to determine whether facts exist which would have enabled the board to grant the relief. Were it otherwise a board of appeals could, through nonaction, put flagrantly unlawful zoning relief beyond judicial review.\u201d <em>Girard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Easton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 338 (1982). Because boards cannot grant unrequested relief, and because DiGiovanni\u2019s February 12 application was not an appeal from the building inspector\u2019s decision, a constructive grant of this unrequested relief cannot survive appellate review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>2. <em>Nullification of the Board\u2019s May 12 Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The trial judge\u2019s primary reason for nullifying the board\u2019s May 12 decision was that no modification of the 1978 variance was necessary because DiGiovanni had substantially complied with it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This conclusion was based on his determination that the 1978 plans were not incorporated by reference into the 1978 variance, but that the 1978 variance, which was \u201cthoughtfully and deliberately worded,\u201d contained \u201c[only] seven conditions.\u201d The judge\u2019s decision was \u201cpredicated solely on documentary evidence [and] permits the appellate court to draw its own conclusions from the record.\u201d <em>Edwin R. Sage Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 26 (1981). The 1978 variance contained the following language: \u201c[T]he siting of the buildings . . . will vindicate the purposes of the building separation and setback requirements .... Accordingly, a variance is granted so as to permit a \u2018cluster\u2019 development of eighteen units as shown by the plans submitted to (and on file with) this Board 99</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">We think it axiomatic that when a variance is granted for a project \u201cas shown by . . . plans\u201d that on their face give no indication that they are preliminary plans,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the variance re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>quires strict compliance with the plans, at least as far as the site location and the bulk of buildings are concerned. In granting a variance, a board may \u201cimpose conditions, safeguards and limitations both of time and of use, including the continued existence of any particular structures.\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. Given that no one has a legal right to a variance, <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wrentham, </em>352 Mass. 301, 303 (1967), we conclude that the language of a variance is to be construed against the individual requesting the variance, rather than against the granting authority.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial judge erred in finding that DiGiovanni\u2019s site plans were not of themselves a \u201ccondition\u201d imposed by the 1978 variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Because the 1978 plans were incorporated by reference in the 1978 variance, and because the development (as built according to the 1980 plans) differs from that shown on the 1978 plans,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it remains only to determine whether portions of Di-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Giovanni\u2019s request for modification of the 1978 variance were appropriately denied by the board.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The board\u2019s decision states that the board was \u201cunable to find any substantial legal hardship due to circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape or topography of the land or unique to this land.\u201d The board further found that DiGiovanni himself created the financial hardship of which he now complains. The trial judge is required to review the board\u2019s decision de nova and determine the legal validity of its decision on the facts as found by him. <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, 558-559 (1954). <em>Garvey </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Amherst, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 856, 856 (1980). The judge (hypothetically) found that even if DiGiovanni had needed a variance, \u201c[t]he reassertion of all [1978] findings of the Board from which there has been no change plus the additional hardship of being required in effect by the Conservation Commission to increase the setback from the top of the ledge is sufficient to support the continuity of the originally granted relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">This finding is erroneous in several respects. Because we have already determined that the 1980 plans were not in substantial compliance with the 1978 variance, the board\u2019s 1978 \u201chardship\u201d findings cannot be used to justify the changes Di-Giovanni made. Moreover, a variance becomes for some purposes part of a town\u2019s zoning by-law. The hardships justifying the grant of a variance no longer exist precisely because a variance <em>has </em>been granted. DiGiovanni may not argue that the conservation commission\u2019s setback requirements constituted a hardship that justified his unilateral departure from the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of the 1978 variance. The hardship from which he now suffers is the cost of correcting the unlawful siting of his buildings. If the commission\u2019s requirements prevented him from complying with his 1978 plans, it was for the board, not DiGiovanni, to provide relief.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, while we agree that it is a misfortune that DiGiovanni has built buildings where they ought not to have been built, this is not the type of hardship that justifies a variance. <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Quincy, </em>341 Mass. 118, 122 (1960). <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Northampton, </em>345 Mass. 158, 163 (1962). <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Scituate, </em>347 Mass. 755, 759 (1964). See <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>356 Mass. 37, 41 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, a trial judge is instructed to annul a board\u2019s decision if he finds it \u201cto exceed the authority of [the] board.\u201d \u201cThe judge\u2019s function on appeal was to ascertain whether the reasons given by the . . . [board] had a substantial basis in fact, or were, on the contrary, mere pretexts for arbitrary action or veils for reasons not related to the purposes of the zoning law.\u201d <em>Vazza Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Woburn, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 312 (1973). The fact that DiGiovanni\u2019s 1980 plans and construction violated the 1978 variance \u201cwas sufficient explanation for denial of a variance, especially on a record which falls well short of establishing facts which would have authorized the board to grant a variance.\u201d <em>Gamache </em>v. <em>Acushnet, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 220 (1982). The denial of a variance is in excess of a board\u2019s authority only when the variance has been denied <em>solely </em>on a legally untenable ground or when the decision is \u201cunreasonable, whimsical, capricious, or arbitrary.\u201d <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. at 557, 559-560. Whether a variance <em>ought </em>to be granted is an administrative decision. <em>Ibid. </em>The board\u2019s finding that no hardship exists is a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>reason for denying a variance. The board did not act unreasonably or arbitrarily in requiring DiGiovanni to conform some aspects of his construction to the express terms of the 1978 variance. \u201c[T]he burden rests upon the person seeking a variance ... to produce evidence at the hearing in the Superior Court that the statutory prerequisites have been met and that the variance is justified.\u201d <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>344 Mass. at 555-556. DiGiovanni has not satisfied this burden. Therefore, nullification of the board\u2019s decision as being in excess of its authority was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The judgment declaring the board\u2019s May 12, 1982, decision a nullity is reversed. The order requiring that DiGiovanni and Rowe Estates, Inc., be restored to their position prior to February 4, 1982, is vacated. The order vacating \u201cany order, decision, condition, or requirement of . . . Rockport\u201d and the order reinstating permits and rights to build are likewise vacated. A judgment is to be entered stating that the board\u2019s decision did not exceed its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> Appeals from the District Court in G.

When we write of an appeal from the building inspector\u2019s order in the present case, we refer to an appeal in which the appellee takes the position that he is entitled to a building permit as matter of right under the zoning regulations and that such a permit has been wrongly denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> A reviewing court may, of course, remand cases to boards for amplification or clarification of their findings or orders.

The board refused to accept this thesis. The remainder of the hearing was devoted to the question of what sort of variance DiGiovanni needed. We do not confuse matters of strategy at a public hearing with the evident and primary subject matter of the hearing. The board plainly understood that the hearing concerned a variance, not an appeal from the building inspector\u2019s decision. This view is strengthened by the fact that DiGiovanni met informally with the board and building inspector on February 23 and pressed the fact that he had \u201csort of complied\u201d with the 1978 variance. The minutes of the February 23 meeting leave us with the impression that DiGiovanni had been put on notice that an appeal of the building inspector\u2019s decision would likely not succeed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> There is an alternative ground for disposing of DiGiovanni\u2019s claim that his February 12 application was constructively approved. We conclude that the trial judge\u2019s findings that the February 12 application was found in a board file folder and that the board\u2019s secretary received applications from the town clerk once a week are clearly erroneous. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>These erroneous findings may have unduly influenced the judge\u2019s consideration of the credibility of the town clerk, who testified that he returned the February 12 application to DiGiovanni on March 5. \u201cThe credibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>witnesses, particularly, is a preserve of the trial judge upon which an appellate court treads with great reluctance. . . .

There can be no constructive approval of applications voluntarily withdrawn from the board\u2019s consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> The judge\u2019s determination that Rockport is estopped to assert deviations from the site plan occasioned by the town\u2019s conservation commission requirements is incorrect as matter of law. \u201cThe right of the public to have the zoning by-law properly enforced cannot be forfeited by the action of its officers.\u201d <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of No. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 675 (1968). See also <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Northampton, </em>345 Mass. 158, 162 (1962). Likewise, neither the board nor the building inspector can approve nonconforming plans \u201cby implication.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\"> \u201cExamination of the plans . . . show[s] them to be complete and comprehensive portrayals of the proposed development in sufficient detail to permit determination by the board of all issues of real substance .... The plans were very much more than mere schematic outlines of the proposal.\u201d <em>Balas </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 995, 996 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> Where noncompliance amounts to a matter of inches, we might reach a different conclusion. However, a substantial shift in building locations and near obliteration of the sea view of residents across the street from the locus cannot be trivialized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> The board described the major discrepancies as follows: <em>\u201cFirst, </em>whereas we had approved four clusters separated by no less than 15 feet, the four buildings and fourteen other foundations ... are in six clusters, two pairs of which are separated by 6 feet 2 inches at the farthest and 3 feet 4 inches at the closest. <em>Second, </em>one extremely important feature of the [approved 1978 plans] ... is a 30 foot space between the clusters at the end of the point. That space preserves a view of the ocean from Granite Street. As built, the four buildings are only 15 feet from the adjacent foundations, and the buildings and foundations are at an angle to Granite Street that would further narrow the view. <em>Third, </em>according to the [1978 plans,] the buildings on the north and south ... are arranged in an irregular manner .... [T]hey were \u2018designed so as to give a sense of separation which tends to compensate for the lack of actual separation. \u2019 In contrast, the foundations built by [DiGiovanni] are in rows more typical of traditional highway motel designs. <em>Fourth, </em>according to the [1978 plans], all buildings are to be at least 275 feet from Granite Street, and our 1978 decision placed great importance on \u2018the resulting open space\u2019 as a factor compensating for the lack of building separation and setbacks .... It is therefore of grave concern that one of the foundations built by [DiGiovanni] comes within 260 feet of Granite Street.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> The board, while expressly finding no statutory hardship, purported to grant a variance, which we have not been asked to review, for \u201ca modified plan changing the siting of the buildings so long as it preserves both the separations, between clusters and the [275 foot] public open space between the project and Granite Street. In other words, the modified plan must provide a minimum of 15 feet between any buildings or groups of buildings that are not immediately adjacent .... [T]he modified plan must leave enough open space at the end of the point to provide a visual corridor peipendicular to Granite Street and at least 30 feet wide (measured parallel to Granite Street) at its narrowest point.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\"> The board ultimately denied relief from the 1978 setback requirements. A comment at the 1982 hearing by a member of the conservation commission was to the effect that the commission had neither required nor \u201capproved\u201d a decrease in the setback from Granite Street. The board was, we think, entitled to find that a decrease in the 1978 setback was not required by the topography of Rowe Point. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
