In September, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1981, a vacancy for a position to be filled of \u201cTemporary Assistant to the Principal, Peabody Veterans Memorial High School\u201d (memorial high school) was posted. Greehy applied for the position, as did Joseph Gu\u00e1rante, who had less seniority than Greehy. The applicants were interviewed and the committee chose Gu\u00e1rante for the vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">(2) Because of declining enrollments and fiscal constraints, an elementary school of which William Russell was principal was closed in 1982. Russell was removed from his position as principal and, as a nontenured teacher, then was dismissed. Russell in September, 1982, applied for the permanent position of assistant to the principal of the memorial high school, but Gu\u00e1rante was selected for the post. Russell had more seniority in the Peabody school system than either Greehy or Gu\u00e1rante.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Article IV of the collective bargaining agreement (the agreement), in force between the committee and the defendant (the union) at all times pertinent to the present controversy, contained the language set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Article VII of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>agreement governed the question of grievances, i.e., complaints \u201cthat there has been a violation ... or inequitable application of any of the provisions of\u2019 the agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Greehy and Russell filed a grievance with respect to the failure to appoint them, respectively, Greehy to the temporary vacancy and Russell to the permanent vacancy. In due course the matters were referred to an arbitrator. At hearings before him, the committee took the position that the grievances were not arbitrable because the right to make specific appointments was not properly the subject of collective bargaining. The union contended in effect that the whole controversy was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The arbitrator concluded (1) the matter was \u201cboth procedurally and substantively\u201d arbitrable because it had \u201cimpact . . . upon the . . . rights of . . . Greehy and . . . Russell\u201d and involved the procedure affecting specific appointment determinations as well as \u201cthe Committee\u2019s failure to adhere to the . . . procedural requirements of\u2019 art. IV of the agreement; (2) that the \u201ccommittee did not violate . . . the . . . Agreement when it demoted and . . . dismissed . . . Russell\u201d; (3) that the committee\u2019s action in appointing Gu\u00e1rante to the position of assistant to the principal of the memorial high school was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>violation of art. IV, \u00a7 B(4), see note 2, <em>supra;</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(4) that Greehy (because Russell did not apply for the temporary appointment in 1981) should have been appointed to the temporary position for the 1981-1982 school year and is entitled to be made whole for the wages and benefits lost by failure to appoint him to the temporary position; and (5) that Russell should have been appointed (in view of his approximately twenty years in the Peabody school system) to the permanent position of assistant to the principal of the memorial high school, and is entitled to lost compensation (above other earnings) and restoration of seniority and other benefits lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Before confirmation of the award was sought, Russell had retired from the school system. Accordingly, the union did not ask for confirmation of the whole arbitrator\u2019s award directing Russell\u2019s appointment to the position of assistant to the principal of the memorial high school. Instead, the union moved only for partial confirmation of the award to make Russell whole for the compensation (above other earnings) and for benefits he would have received if appointed until his retirement. The union\u2019s motion came before a judge of the Superior Court, who on January 24, 1984, allowed partial confirmation of the award by endorsement on the motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From the order and the judgment (February 17, 1984), the committee has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Problems concerning the powers of school committees with respect to appointments of principals and other supervisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>personnel continue to recur. The proper solution to some such problems remains uncertain under the decided cases. Unlike the trial judge, we are of opinion that this case largely is controlled by <em>Berkshire Hills Regional Sch. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Berkshire Hills Educ. Assn., </em>375 Mass. 522, 524-529 (1978). That decision, in a somewhat comparable factual situation, deals (at 525) with an area of \u201cexclusive managerial prerogative entrusted to a school committee by G. L. c. 71\u201d which is \u201cnot subject to delegation, interference or control by collective bargaining agreements or provisions therein for arbitration.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Other decisions dealing with nondelegable functions of school committees are collected in <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Rel. Commn., </em>388 Mass. 557, 563 &amp; n.4, which (at 564 and n.5) also lists decisions in which <em>procedural </em>provisions of collective bargaining agreements have been sustained even though, in some degree, they may have \u201crelated to exclusive nondelegable functions of a school committee.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>386 Mass. 197, 213 (1982), where <em>\u201ctheprocedures </em>[emphasis original] set forth in a collective bargaining agreement,\u201d including those dealing with \u201cthe timing of layoffs and the number and identity of the employees affected are proper subjects of collective bargaining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We think that the arbitrator was authorized to consider and decide whether the laying off of Russell was in compliance with <em>procedures </em>contained in the agreement and whether the committee had taken reasonable steps to ensure consideration in good faith of the qualifications of Russell and Greehy to fill, permanently or temporarily, a vacant position in the school system for which they met the posted qualifications. There is no contention here that there was any failure to follow appropriate procedures with respect to Russell\u2019s layoff and dismissal. The problem, however, arises with respect to the arbitrator\u2019s decision on Russell\u2019s recall to fill a position which (so far as this record shows) he and Greehy had not previously occupied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and for which the committee theretofore had not found them qualified. Compare <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>373 Mass. 53, 57-60 (1977), where it was held that an arbitrator could direct compliance with past practices (protected by the collective bargaining agreement) for the <em>transfer </em>of an incumbent principal (already accepted as qualified as a principal by the school committee) to a vacant principal position, apparently of the same level in the school system as the position already held by the incumbent principal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Article IV, \u00a7 B(4), contained (by its very terms) a judgment factor in the words, \u201c[wjhere other factors are the same among a number of candidates.\u201d We perceive nothing in the agreement<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which requires the committee to treat all principals, assistant principals, and other supervisors, regardless of level (e.g., elementary, secondary, high school), as essentially fungible and interchangeable, beyond the particular classification (under art. IV, \u00a7 E, note 2, supra) to which any particular school system employee may belong. In any event, on a vacancy at the senior high school level, it has not been shown that the committee has surrendered and delegated to any arbitrator its prerogative of choice, granted to it by G. L. c. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The matter is not free from doubt, but we think that the arbitrator by his decision has intruded \u201cinto the . . . committee\u2019s exclusive domain.\u201d See <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 114 (1977). The arbitrator (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>has purported himself to decide the relative qualifications of Russell, Greehy, and Gu\u00e1rante. That decision, as we view this record, was one for the committee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The union contends that the arbitrator\u2019s award of compensation to Russell and Greehy may stand apart from his erroneous intrusion into the area of the committee\u2019s prerogative. He treated the committee\u2019s failure to appoint either of the two rejected applicants as a violation of art. IV, \u00a7 B(4). The arbitrator has mentioned no other violation of the agreement by the committee. The case, in this respect, is unlike <em>School Comm. of New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford Educators Assn., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 793, 798-799, 801-802 (1980), where the opinion also rested in part on a procedural violation of rules regarding posting of vacancies (in the course of the appointment made by that school committee). This arbitrator\u2019s awards of compensation were based very directly on his unauthorized conclusion that Greehy and Russell (and not Gu\u00e1rante) \u2014 on their respective merits \u2014 should have been appointed. We think that the awards as a whole fall. Compare <em>School Comm. of Lynnfield </em>v. <em>Trachtman, </em>384 Mass. 813 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. If the union within sixty days after the receipt of the rescript in the Superior Court does not indicate in written form some proper basis for remanding the case for further arbitration, the award is to be vacated and judgment is to be entered (a) vacating the award, and (b) for the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-15\">These changes are different from the changes considered in <em>School Comm. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Peabody Federation of Teachers Local 1289, </em>17 Mass.
