Ashmead </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad\">He contended that this case is ruled in their favor by the following decisions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-12\">Maffit <em>vs. </em>Clark, 6 <em>Watts Berg. </em>258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-13\">Father seized of land, died intestate, leaving two children, infants, one of whom soon after died, and afterwards, the other, unmarried, and without issue, the mother living. <em>Held, </em>that the brothers of the father took the estate by descent, under the 9th sec. of the act of 8th April, 1833, and not the mother.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-14\">Lewis <em>vs. </em>Gorman, 5 <em>Barr </em>166, (a branch of this case.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-15\">Per Bell, Prest., affirmed by Supreme Court. \u201cHe who claims an estate descended to an intestate, must show himself heir to him from whom it descended as perquisitor.\u201d Page 161. \u201cAnn Thomas, the mother of the intestate, is not the ancestor from whom the estate descended, or by whom it was given. To find him, we must go back to Peter Jones, the grandfather, if not to Thomas Jones, the great-grandfather.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-16\">See pedigree at page 164, and cases cited by Judge Bell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-17\">The plaintiffs below therefore cannot claim, not being of the blood of Peter or Thomas Jones.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-18\">They are not aided by the 11th sec. of the act of 8 April, 1833, for its meaning is said to be that the heir at common law shall not exclude others of the same consanguinity; and also, it is intended only to meet cases \u201cnot expressly provided for by this act,\u201d and therefore does not clash with the 9th section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-19\">The defendants in error have not shown nor does the case stated show that Thomas Jones left no kindred, the language of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>stated being, \u201cso far as the parties know,\u201d the meaning of wMch is, that the parties know nothing one way or the other. The defendants in error therefore hare not made out a complete case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-7\"><em>E. Darlington </em>and <em>Edwards </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ath\">That the defendants below were mere occupiers; that the statement, as to the non-existence of heirs, is sufficient; that the <em>12th. </em>section of the intestate act of 1833 used the words, <em>\u201cknoivn heirs or </em>Icindred, in default of whom the estate shall escheat; \u201d from which it may be inferred, that where the heirs or kindred are not known to persons who have long been acquainted with the family, it is sufficient evidence to be referred to a Jury.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AiR\">April 18,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b46-9\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXS\">It is conceded that Lewis <em>vs. </em>Gorman, 5 <em>Barr </em>164, rules the ease in favor of <em>the </em>plaintiffs below, as next of kin of Peter Thomas, the last tenant; provided the case stated sufficiently ascertains that, by his death, a failure of the lineal and collateral kindred of his ancestor, Thomas Jones, has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The case states, \u201cBy the death of the said Peter Thomas, the lineal and collateral relations of the said Thomas Jones became extinct, <em>so far as the parties hereto know.\u201d </em>Now the parties hereto are the parties litigant, whose respective rights hang upon this very fact; and it is therefore fair to presume they, and more especially the defendants, whose continued possession depends upon it, took some pains to inform themselves upon this subject. In considering the value of the admission made, we must therefore regard the respective parties in the light of witnesses, having knowledge of the family, from which the disputed estate is derived, and interested in ascertaining the truth. Suppose then, on the the trial of an issue directed to ascertain, whether, by the death of Peter Thomas, the kindred of Thomas Jones became extinct, such witnesses testified, from all they have heard and known, being conversant in the neighborhood, where the family resided, they believed the fact to be so; would not this be esteemed, at least <em>prima facie </em>evidence, sufficient to cast the burden of proof upon the antagonist party ? Most certainly it would. It is every day\u2019s practice and experience to show, by such testimony, the extinction of kindred and the failure of issue. And it would be strange, indeed, if this were not permitted. Take this very case, by way of illustration; Thomas Jones, the prepositus, died in 1727, nearly a century and a quarter ago; he is known to have left to survive him but one son, Peter Jones, who died leaving but one daughter, Ann Jones, who in her turn, left but one son, Peter Thomas, the last owner, who died unmarried and childless, at the age of 83 years. Now it is out of the question, at this day, to procure witnesses who personally knew Thomas Jones, and therefore, from necessity, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>parties interested are compelled to rely on the information of persons, who, acquainted with the family, never heard of other relations than those enumerated in the case stated. The result of that information is distinctly enough set out. If it be not for the purposes of this action, it is certainly sufficiently stated to work an escheat of the land, for our statute of descents would give it to the commonwealth, in default of \u201cknown heirs or kindred.\u201d And the statute of escheats provides for cases where persons die seized, \u201cwithout heirs or any known kindred.\u201d So that, if the plaintiff in error be right, upon just such an admission as we have here, the estate might be escheated, as late of Thomas Jones, while the acknowledged next of kin of his descendant, Peter Thomas, stood by powerless, because they could not, after the lapse of a period whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, expressly and distinctly prove the kindred of the acquirer of the property to be extinct. Such an absurdity, of itself, sufficiently disproves the soundness of the position assumed here by the plaintiff in error. But, I repeat, that in cases like this, it is always deemed sufficient to shew by witnesses likely to know, they believe a particular line or family to be exhausted, in order to shift the onus.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">It was insisted on the argument that the plaintiff below should have instituted an inquiry in England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales, in one of which countries it is probable the family of Jones had its origin, and where, in all likelihood, relatives may yet be found. The record does not disclose whence the family originally came; and if it did, the possibility of discovering relatives in Europe after the lapse of probably two centuries\u2019 sojourn in this country, is too remote to impose such a duty on the plaintiffs. If such an inquiry is to be made, it would rather seem to be incumbent on the defendants, (who shew no title,) under the <em>prima facie </em>case, established by their opponents.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We are satisfied enough is admitted to justify the judgment pronounced by the Court of Common Pleas; where, indeed, this point of evidence does not seem to have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
