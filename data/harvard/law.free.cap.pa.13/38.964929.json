How could the judgment of revival be retrospect in its operation? How could the sheriff\u2019s sale divest Dengler\u2019s title when no process in the sheriff\u2019s hands bound such title ? But the whole point stated in the syllabus in Kiehner <em>vs. </em>Dengler, 1 <em>Watts, </em>424, has been overruled by two recent decisions, viz: Mitchell <em>vs. </em>Hamilton, 8 <em>Barr </em>486, and Helfrich <em>vs. </em>Byler decided at December term, 1849, not yet reported.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-11\"><em>Looser </em>for defendant in error, Kiehner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av6\">That the <em>scire facias </em>was properly served on Dengler, who claimed to have the title in fee of the debtor, in the judgment. 1 <em>Barr </em>101, Dohner\u2019s appeal; Geiger <em>vs. </em>Hill, 1 <em>Barr </em>509-10; Filbert <em>vs. </em>Kiehner, 1 <em>Watts </em>424. That Mitchell <em>vs. </em>Hamilton did not apply to this case; that there, defendant claimed under an independent title; and that in Helfrich <em>vs. </em>Byler, the <em>scire facias </em>was <em>quare executio non, </em>and not to revive, as in this case.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2G\">April 20,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b42-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b42-13\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALJ\">This case is simple in its elements. A judgment creditor has a right to call on a terre tenant of land, purchased by him from the debtor, while it was bound by the judgment, to shew why the debt ought not to be levied of it; and the terre tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>having sl^pt his time, being warned, is concluded as to every thing he might have made matter of defence to the <em>scire facias. </em>But the creditor must, at least, have laid a <em>prima facie </em>case: he must show that he, whom he calls a terre tenant, actually stood in the relation of one; else there will not have been such privity between them, as would estop the latter, by the judgment. But who is a terre tenant ? Not every one who happens to be in possession of the land. There can be no terre tenant, who is not a purchaser of the estate, mediately or immediately, from the debtor, while it was bound by the judgment; and when he has taken a title, thus bound, he must show how the lien of it has been discharged, whether by payment, release, or efflux of time. These are matters of defence which may be precluded. True, we have a statute which directs notice to be given to occupants; but only to let the lessee of a terre tenant into a defence, which his landlord may have neglected to make, for his protection. ' The facts of this case are, that the estate had been bound by the judgment, but that the lien of it had expired when the ancestor of the plaintiffs purchased it. It had ceased to be a judgment of greater effect against the land than it was against the debtor\u2019s chattels; and the purchaser\u2019s title was paramount to it. He was not a terre tenant, or the lessee of a terre tenant; and as he had not a day in court, the judgment being <em>inter alios, </em>was not an estoppel. The case is clearly within the principle of Mitchell <em>vs. </em>Hamilton, and is ruled by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
