March 14, 1848, a replication was filed by plaintiff, and on the same day, judgment entered for said garnishee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-15\">In the meantime William W.

Pennell, defendant, and Edward Grubb and A. Bates Grubb, garnishees, was issued; and the same was afterwards returned as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-17\">\u201c June 26th, 1848, writ executed as per schedule annexed.

HARTMAN, Sheriff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-21\">On the 10th day of March, 1848, Edward Grubb and Clement B. Grubb, partners in trade, under the name' and firm of Edward &amp; C. B. Grubb, obtained a judgment against James H. Pennell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>for a real debt of $635, which was duly entered in the Common Pleas of Lancaster county, No. Ill, January Term, 1848..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-6\">On the 26th day of June, 1848, the same-day when the attachment issued, the following entry was made, and appears on the docket, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-7\">\u201c June 26,1848. This judgment stands for the use of E. &amp; C. B.'Grubb. - E. &amp; O. B. GRUBB.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-8\">Opinion of the court, Lewis, President.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-9\">An attachment was issued and served upon the above named' garnishees on the 26th June, 1848. On the same day, the garnishees became the owners of a judgment against James H. Pen-' nell for an amount greater than their indebtedness to him. There was no evidence to shew which of these acts was first in the order-of time, the service of the attachment or the purchase of the judgment \u2014 both having occurred on the same day. There is no legal presumption that the service of the attachment was -first. It is necessary to the plaintiff\u2019s case to prove his attachment was served before the garnishees, indebtedness was satisfied' by the judgment acquired. Failing in this, the judgment must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-10\">Judgment for the defendants upon the case stated. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acb\">- Error assigned. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-11\">The court erred in entering judgment for the defendants on the ease stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-12\">The case was argued by <em>Ford </em>for the administrators, plaintiffs in-error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-13\">First, The fiction and doctrine- that in law there is no fraction of a day, when, it becomes essential, for the purposes of justice, to ascertain the exact hour or minute, no longer prevails.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-14\">3 <em>Chit. Gen. Prac. </em>110, 111; 1 <em>East, </em>154, Fields <em>vs. </em>Jones; 3 <em>Burr. 1434, </em>per Ld. Mansfield.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-15\">Second, The presumption in this case is, that the attachment was issued and served first; and after being so issued the garnishees procured this assignment of the judgment of E. &amp; C. B. Grubb to them. This is not therefore such a claim as may be either legally or equitably set off in this case, under the \u201c Act for Defalcation, 1704.\u201d 2 <em>Ed. Dunlop\u2019s Laws, 45.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-16\">Because the claim must have been due and obtained before the suit in which it is offered to be set-off is brought; Reed <em>vs. </em>Ingraham, 3 <em>Dal. </em>505,-506 \u2014 per curiam; Sparks <em>vs. </em>Garrigues, 1 <em>Bin. </em>158, per Yeates, J.; Richter <em>vs. </em>Selin, 8 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>436, per Duncan, J.; Marshall <em>vs. </em>Sheridan, <em>et ux. </em>10 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>268, per Gibson, J.; Morrison <em>vs. </em>Moreland, 15 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>62, per Huston, J; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Stewart <em>vs. </em>The U. S. Ins. Co. 1 <em>W. </em>126, per Kennedy, J.; Huling <em>vs. </em>Hugg, 1 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>418, per Rogers, J.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-6\">In the ease last cited, it is'expressly laid down, that \u201c a debt or demand to be set-off under the statute must be an existing debt or demand at the time of the commencement of the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-7\">Now in the case under consideration, there is no pretence that the garnishees had this judgment assigned to them at- the time of the issuing of the writ. On the contrary, the facts admitted show that they-did not get it, nor was' there any transfer or assignment made, until after the suit had been commenced, and the writ had issued.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-8\"><em>T. </em>Stevens, with whom was <em>S. Stevens, </em>for the Messrs. Grubb.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-9\">Defendants deny that they owe James H. Pennell any thing, but that he is indebted to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-10\">That the attachment was not effectual against them till it was <em>served; </em>and that E. &amp; A. B. Grubb were the <em>Iona fide </em>assignees of the judgment of E. &amp; C. B. Grubb <em>vs. </em>James H. Pennell, before the <em>service </em>of the attachment, subject to every equity which existed in the judgment debtor at the time of the assignment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b556-12\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL9L\">The question in this case arises on the onus. It is doubtful on the admission of the parties whether the assignment of the judgment to the garnishees, or the service of the attachment was prior in time, and in the absence of inference or presumption on either side, which of the parties was bound to furnish the proof? A cross demand against the defendant in an attachment may be' set-off by the garnishee, as it may by a defendant in -any other suit, but subject to the same rules and restrictions; and a defendant may not set-off a demand acquired after the action was instituted. Nor may a plaintiff give evidence in a cause of action incomplete at the impetration of the writ. But set-off is in substance a cross action; and a cross demand also must have been complete when the action was instituted. In this respect the parties stand on equal ground. Neither is allowed to get the whip hand and souse the other in costs, by starting before he was ready. But who is to prove that the cross demand was not subsequently acquired? Certainly, he who asserts the fact. There is no presumption in the case; and he is bound to support his allegation with proof. A plaintiff would not be admitted, to prove a cause of action, without proving, if there were any doubt about it, <em>when </em>it accrued; and for a similar reason, a garnishee, may not set-off a cross demand without proving that it was acquired before the attachment was laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Judgment of the court below reversed and judgment rendered here for the plaintiffs on the case stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
