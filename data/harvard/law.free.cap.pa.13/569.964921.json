He died in the month of August, 1847; on the 30th day of August, 1847, the said will and codicil were admitted to probate before Wm. G-leim, Esq., Begister of Lancaster county. Letters testamentary were granted to Peter Fahnestock and David Boyer, who took an inventory of the goods and chattels of the deceased, and filed the' same in the Begister\u2019s office of Lancaster county, at the same time.

The accountant could not settle an account for the mere purpose of charging the estate of-Joseph Eoyer, deceased, with the expenses incurred, as prayed for in his account..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ak1\">Second. The estate of Joseph Eoyer, deceased, is-not liable for the fees paid to attorney and other costs and expenses incurred in attempting to establish the will of the deceased on the trial of the issue of <em>dev. vel non </em>in the District Court of Lancaster county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-14\">The case was argued-by V. <em>B. Amwahe, </em>for appellants, the administrators.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asf\">On the first- error assigned, he contended that the accountant in this case ought not to be permitted to settle an account in the Orphans\u2019 Court, for the mere purpose of charging the estate of Joseph Eoyer, deceased, for on the face of his account nothing appears to show that any part of the estate of said deceased ever came to Ms hands or possession, he therefore could, not raise an account merely to let in Ms claims; his remedy, if any he has against the estate of said Joseph Eoyer, deceased, for the costs and expenses as prayed for in his account, is by action against the administrators of the deceased: Shenk\u2019s Appeal, 5 <em>Watts, </em>p. 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-15\">As to the s\u00e9cond error, he contended that the costs, expenses, &amp;c., as paid to attorney, and commission to accountant incurred on the trial of the issue of <em>dev. vel non, </em>must be borne by the parties to it, and not by the funds of the estate, of which they were devisees or legatees, as the parties litigated for their individual interests and not for the benefit of the estate: Copenhaffer <em>vs. </em>Isaacs, 7 <em>Watts </em>170; Mumper\u2019s Appeal, 3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>441.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-16\"><em>Frazer, </em>for Fahnestock.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWxe\">The will of Joseph Eoyer was tried before Judge Hayes, and the question of revocation came before the court on the ground that as the testator had conveyed by deed after the date of the will, certain parts of his real estate as there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>in devised, it would be difficult to say what <em>was his will </em>as to <em>the </em>portions of bis real estate undisposed of, &amp;c.; the judge charged the jury <em>if was a revocation, \u00bf\u2022c. </em>\u2014 and <em>so they found.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-6\">Peter Fahnestock was not a legatee, devisee, or in any way interested in the said estate save as one of the executors. His co-executor and himself proved the will, filed an inventory, employed counsel, paid debts and expenses, and the issue was directed to try the validity of the will, on the appeal of some of the heirs to the decree of the Register\u2019s Court allowing the probate of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-7\">\u25a0 It was the duty of the executor to support the decision of the Register in favor of that will; and he was entitled to the aid of the estate, to discharge all reasonable costs and expenses incurred on that account: 8 <em>Wash. Cir. Court Rep. </em>122, 123, 124, Bradford <em>vs. </em>Boudinot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-8\">The account in this case was properly settled by the accountant.' He and his co-executor filed an inventory, was in possession of the assets. This accountant paid debts and expenses of administration, out of his own pocket as executor, and claimed in said account no debt due him by testator in his life time: <em>4'Watts </em>85\u2014 Shenck\u2019s administration account. An executor is bound to prove the will, and certainly not at his own expense. When he meets with obstruction, it is his duty to remove it if h\u00e9 can, and he is unfaithful if he omits to attempt it: 9 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 98, Scott\u2019s Estate; 9 <em>Watts </em>284, Geddis\u2019 Appeal; 3 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep. </em>Bradford <em>vs. </em>Boudinot.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b574-10\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0j\">Notwithstanding what was said in Bradford <em>vs. </em>Boudinot, 3 <em>W. C. C. R. </em>122, and repeated in Geddis\u2019 Appeal, 9 <em>W. </em>284, of the duty of an executor to sustain the validity of the instrument under which he acts, as a will, against the hostile attacks of those claiming adversely to it, and of his right to call on the estate of the supposed testator to discharge the costs and expenses \u2022incurred in the contest, it is, under our decisions, clear that his right to do so depends altogether upon whether the litigation is for the benefit of the estate, or in promotion of the interests of those eventually fotihd entitled to the fund. It is not universally, or even ordinarily true, that he may endeavor the establishment of a suppositious testamentary paper at the expense of creditors or distributees, or that even if successful, he can tax the whole fund he represents by claiming the costs incurred in his administration account as a general item of credit. Th\u00e9 expenses of trying an issue <em>devisavit vel non </em>must be borne by the parties to it: Copenhaffer <em>vs. </em>Isaacs, 7 <em>W. </em>170, or, at least, by those for whose benefit it is carried on. This may be so, even when the testamentary act is validated by a judicial <em>fiat, </em>as is shewn by Mumper\u2019s Appeal, 3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>441. It is, therefore, difficult to imagine how, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>where a pretended will has been repudiated by verdict, the costs of the contest can be cast on those who have succeeded, by charging them upon an estate to which they have shown themselves entitled as distributees, under the intestate laws; claiming not by virtue of the. supposed will, but in direct and-triumphant hostility to it. The inadmissibility of such a pretension is pointed out in the case just referred to, where it is put as. an illustration, not open to cavil. There, as already intimated, even a successful litigant, who,( in his. character of executor, had succeeded in .a, feigned issue in establishing a disputed will, was.denied the asserted right to charge upon the whole estate of the testator, the counsel fees paid by him during the controversy. Indeed, it. frequently happens that only a very few of the heirs or next of kin of a supposed testator are interested in sustaining an. alleged testament. Nay, sometimes .the interest of a majority of them lies in shewing an intestacy. In such instances, it would be obviously unjust to compel them to contribute towards defraying expenses incurred in the attempt to1 prejudice them pecuniarily upon this point. I commend attention to the observations'of Mr. Justice Kennedy, who, in Mumper\u2019s Appeal, very clearly shews that only thos\u00e9 who have an immediate and direct interest in the subject, should be called to bear the burden of carrying on the investigation., Reason and equity unite to support this rule,, and I know of no authority that directly impugns it. Geddis\u2019 Appeal is mentioned, as of this stamp, but properly understood, it is not' so. The misapprehension seems to be induced by some general remarks of the judge, who delivered the opinion, on the duties of an executor, but the doctrine of Copenhaffer <em>vs. </em>Isaacs is recognized, and although the case itself does not distinctly shew the applicability of the rule I have mentioned, the decision is expressly put on the ground that the action of the executor was for the benefit of the estate. To charge the fund belonging to the estate, it is not enough that the executor has no pecuniary interest- in the settlement of-the imputed will. To confer that right, it must appear, his course was dictated by a regard for the profit of those eventually found to be entitled to the property. This was the basis of the determination pronounced in Scott\u2019s Estate, <em>9 W. &amp; S. </em>98, cited .for the appellee; as is made manifest by the opinion delivered by the same learned judge who decided this cause below, and by-the remark of the chief justice, speaking for this court on appeal: \u201cthat the executor litigated, not for his own interest, but for the interest of the parties who got the whole of the estate by the litigation, and now refuse to reimburse him his expenses.\u201d But we have before us a -widely different case. Fahnestock, the testator, is the only one who appears to have urged forward the contest, for some reason which remains unexplained. In the. Register\u2019s Gourt, he demanded an issue to be directed to the Common Pleas;- he subpoenaed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the witnesses, employed counsel, and so far as we are informed, was alone concerned in conducting the litigation, while the alleged testator\u2019s next of kin either stood aloof, or appeared as defendants in the feigned issue, actively denying the validity of the supposed testament, set up by Fahnestock. And yet, this attempt is gravely made to charge the fund distributed among them with costs incurred in the effort to disappoint their wishes and to defeat their interests. Such a claim is wholly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">But it is asked, is he named as executor in a contested will, to undertake its establishment, solely at his own risk ? By no means. It is not required of him to become a party to such a contest, unless those interested in the disputed paper. will''indemnify: him. against the costs.of the investigation; or he may calbupon them' to assume the responsibility of carrying it on. The eohrs'e 'open to him is pointed out in Mumper\u2019s Appeal; a decision referred to thus frequently, because I consider it as decisive of the present,, and entirely approve the reasoning upon which it proceeds. I have known many instances, when I sat in the Common Pleas, of refusals by those named executors, to 'become parties'to an issue <em>devis'avit vel non, </em>until they were secured for future expenses. No one ever supposed it was incompetent to them so to refuse. In-truth, their names are not essential to the' framing of a -feign\u00e9tb issue. It may be made with the same legal effect between any other parties having an interest, and frequently is so; or between men of straw, designated by the court, provided security be given for the costs. There is, consequently, no pretence for departing from a rule just as it is convenient, because of any supposed constrained liability arising from the legal position of the executor. The application of this rule to the claim in hand dictates the dis-allowance of the several sums of money claimed for counsel fees, and other expenses consequent upon the trial of the issue. \u2019 :</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">I should think, however, the accountant, ought to be allowed from the estate the expenses incurred in preparing to administer the will, before a contest arose as to its validity. But this did Hot,, call for the settlement of an administration account, nor justify the expense encountered in passing it through the office of the several functionaries. In fact there was nothing to state an account about: Shenck\u2019s Appeal, 5 <em>W. </em>84; and therefore no portion of it is entitled to our sanction., We will not say the appellant may not maintain an action against the administrators of Royer for the $32 41, or so much of it as he may shew himself entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court confirming the account is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
