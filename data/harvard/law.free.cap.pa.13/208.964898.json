The defendant, Jacob Day, availed himself of this offer, and wrote to plaintiffs in reply, among other things, as follows: \u2014 \u201c I am willing to extend the time for 30 days longer, <em>and of course will stand responsible for the payment of the note as originally intended. </em>This letter, No. 1, dated May 15, 1845. Before the expiration of the 30 days referred to, the defendant, by letter, again agreed the time of payment should be extended.\u2014 This letter, No. 2; and so continued, from time to time, to acknowledge his liability down to <em>the 29th April, </em>1846. On the 20th of <em>April, </em>1846, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendant that his brother Samuel had not reduced the amount for which he the defendant had becdme liable to them enliis guarantee, and that they <em>should claim of him the amount 'gu,aranteed. </em>On the 21th of April, 1846, Samuel W. Day, the drawer, paid to the plaintiffs one hundred dollars on account of the note. The action was brought agaist Jacob Day, to recover the balance of the note, with the interest due thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-12\">A narr. was filed setting out the note and indorsement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-13\">An amendment of narr. was filed, setting out the agreements of Jacob Day, the defendant, to extend the time of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-14\">Same day defendant pleads <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment with leave, &amp;c.

And a special agreement to extend the time of payment, dispenses with a demand of payment from the maker, protest or notice; 10 <em>Watts, </em>111 Williams <em>vs. </em>Brobst; and so when protest is waived on the day of the maturity of the note, 10 <em>Barr </em>103, Scott <em>vs. </em>Greer, <em>Story on pro. notes, </em>314.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-16\">\u2022 There was no attempt on the part of defendant to shew that he sustained loss by the omission of demand and notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-17\">There was no consideration for the extension, and this was essential to suspend the action and discharge the indorser; <em>Ohitty on Bills </em>441, 446.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-18\">That the necessity for demand, protest and notice, being once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>waived, could never again be taken advantage of: 16 <em>East. </em>104, Forster <em>vs. </em>Jurdison; 3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>363, Clark vs. Develin; Idem. 365.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\">No counsel appeared for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b213-8\">Coulter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8P\">An indorser is entitled to notice of protest and non-payment of a negotiable note; because the contract is that the maker will pay at maturity; and the strict punctuality which is the life of the commercial law, authorizes the indorser to presume that he has paid, in the absence of any notice to the contrary. But the right to receive notice, in order to make him liable, like any other right, may be waived by the indorser: <em>Story on promissory notes </em>314, Williams <em>vs. </em>Brobst, 10 <em>Watts </em>111, Scott <em>vs. </em>Greer, 10 <em>Barr </em>103, Clark <em>vs. </em>Develin, 3 <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pul. </em>365. The letter dated the 15th May, 1845, from the indorser to the payee, contains a distinct statement that the drawer, his brother, will not be able to meet the note at maturity, but that, if the time is extended for thirty days, he will hold himself bound. This is a distinct guarantee that he will hold himself bound, at the end of thirty days, after maturity, and is within the case of Foster vs. Jurdison, 16 <em>East. </em>104, establishing that, under like circumstances the holder was not bound to give notice. The other letters offered in evidence, shew that the time was given in consequence of this request, and the reiterated recognition of this indulgence.\u2014 The whole proceeding of the plaintiff, as evidenced by these letters, was not only fair and exceedingly indulgent, but according to law, and seems little to merit the requital it has received.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The court erred in rejecting the 1st, 2nd and third bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The error assigned is sustained; the judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
