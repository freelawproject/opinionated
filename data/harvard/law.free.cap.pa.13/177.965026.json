The plaintiff M\u2019Olain was in the grocery business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-8\">To sustain the allegation that money was advanced by plaintiff to Flemming, plaintiff\u2019s counsel called John Barr, who testified m<em>ter alia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-9\">I was in the employ of M\u2019Clain from 1837 to 1841; I kept the books and attended to the customers; Mr. Flemming got money and checks several times from M\u2019Clain; I filled up the checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-10\">The counsel for the plaintiff then offered in evidence the following checks, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-11\">A check purporting to be drawn by Joseph M\u2019Clain, on the Schuylkill Savings Institution, dated July 26, 1838, payable to Robert Flemming, or bearer, for two hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-12\">A check purporting to be drawn by Joseph M\u2019Clain, on the Schuylkill Savings Institution, dated October 16,1838, payable to Robert Flemming, or bearer, for fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-13\">A check purporting to be drawn by Joseph M\u2019Clain, on the Bank of Penn Township, dated July 10,1840, payable to Robert Flemming, or bearer, for thirty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-14\">. A check purporting to be drawn by Joseph M\u2019Clain, on the Bank of Penn Township, dated the 23d July, 1840, payable to Robert Flemming, or bearer, for seventy-five dollars. (Prout said checks, which had on them the bank marks of cancellation.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-15\">Whereupon the counsel for the defendants objected to the admission of the said checks in evidence, because they did not tend to prove money advanced to the said Robert Flemming, or <em>paid for his use, </em>by the said Joseph M\u2019Clain. But the learned judge overruled the objection, and admitted the said checks in evidence; whereupon the counsel for the defendants excepted to his opinion, and the judge at his request sealed this bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-16\">The jury found for the plaintiff $2,492 67.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-17\">The counsel of plaintiff in error assigned the following error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-18\">The judge erred in admitting in evidence certain checks pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>porting to have been drawn by the plaintiff, in favor of Robert Elemming, as evidence of money lent and advanced by said plaintiff, to said Robert Elemming.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-6\">The case was argued by <em>Wm.

The presumption is, it is given either in payment of a debt, or that cash was given for it at the time. This is ruled in Aubert <em>vs. </em>Walsh, 4 <em>Taunton </em>293. A check was there produced as evidence of a debt, but it was held that alone, it was not sufficient; so in Geatorex\u2019s executors <em>vs. </em>Gerrish, 4 <em>Esp. </em>9, where a draft given by a testator on his bankers, payable to the defendant, and it was proved by the bankers that the money was paid to the defendant, out of the money of the testator, then in their hands, it was ruled to be no evidence of a debt. Kenyon, O. J., observed, this is no evidence to establish a debt, for no evidence is offered of the circumstances under which the draft was given. It might be, in payment of a debt due by the testator, or the defendant might have given cash for it at the time; so in Pearson <em>vs. </em>Darus, 1 <em>Mood. </em>&amp; <em>Rob. </em>365. The production of a check is not evidence of any loan; if it be evidence of any thing, it is rather evidence of payment; and in Fletcher <em>vs. </em>Manning, 12 <em>Mees </em>&amp; <em>Welsby </em>571, it was held that \u201c cancelled checks were not evidence of a loan; checks are <em>prima facie </em>evidence of payment of a debt.\u201d And in our court, Patton <em>vs. </em>Ash, 7 <em>S. &amp; R. 125, </em>it was held, that in order to charge a person to whom a check was paid with a debt, \u201c some evidence should be given to explain the consideration of the check, for it may have been given in payment of a debt due from the drawers;\u201d and in Baker <em>vs. </em>Williamson, 4 <em>Barr </em>469, it is said, \u201cit never was hold in any court, that a check was evidence of a gift.\u201d Erom a review of the cases the rule appears to be well settled, and the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>question which remains is, was there any evidence to rebut the presumption; any evidence of the circumstances under which the check was given; evidence to explain the consideration of the check. For this purpose, the defendant in error relies on the testimony of Barr; also, on the close intimacy in business, between Flemming and M\u2019Clain, at the time the checks bear date. And the fact that M\u2019Clain paid bills of Flemming, and also at other times loaned him money and checks. The evidence, however, as it appears in the bill of exceptions, is too vague and unsatisfactory. All that Barr says is, that Flemming got money and checks several times from M\u2019Clain, and that <em>he </em>filled up the checks; this may very well be in perfect consistency with the fact, that this individual check was in payment of the debt; he does not even say he filled up this check. That he loaned him various small sums of money, at several times previously to the date of the checks, which were carefully charged in the account, if it proves anything, rather tends to show that the checks were given for cash advanced at the time. The mere fact that there were transactions between the parties, will not suffice, unless these transactions connect themselves directly with the subject in controversy; Aubert <em>vs. </em>Walsh, 4 <em>Taunton </em>293, is a case very like the present. We are therefore of opinion the court erred in admitting the checks, as evidence of money lent and advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">There is nothing in the second assignment of error, as the objection to the admission of the receipts, was withdrawn at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
