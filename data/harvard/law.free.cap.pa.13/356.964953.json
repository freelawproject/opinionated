They showed a warrant by John Lock, in August, 1846, for 400 acres, and surveyed in that month, on the land in dispute. The survey was regularly returned into the land office in August, 1846. The warrant calls for and dates the improvement back to the first of March, 1802, by commencing interest on his purchase from that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-10\">Hoover, the plaintiff, claimed under an improvement by one Ramsey, began in or about 1779. The occupancy, under this improvement, was interrupted. In 1809 or 1810, one McCune, perhaps a tenant of Ramsey, either died on the premises, and his widow and children lived there some time, and left <em>it; or McCune </em>left it before he died, in 1809 or 1810. Eor several years, perhaps till 1815, 1816 or 1817, there was no person residing on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-11\">In May, 1813, James Ramsey, who was executor, and one of the heirs of John Ramsey, took a surveyor upon the land, claimed by his father, in his life time, and by his heirs, since his death, and had the lines run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-12\">Witherow, the administrator of the estate of Ramsey, obtained a warrant, dated 9th October, 1846, for 300 acres, in part surveyed, as the draft from the office of the deputy surveyor shows, on the 28th November, 1846, and completed on the 19th June, 1847 \u2014 330 acres surveyed \u2014 improved land.

Samuel Caldwell proved them to be official surveys, made by him in the capacity of deputy surveyor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-9\">His Honor, Judge Wilson, observed to the jury: \u201c The warrant taken by Witherow, administrator of Ramsey, would have located for all that could be surveyed, according to the claim by the warrant, without interfering with the survey of Lock, which had been located. <em>It is in filling the call of the Hoover </em>warrant, which he claimed to have located under his purchase from Witherow, as stated in Ms deed, that occasioned the interference in their location.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-10\">The court <em>inter alia, </em>charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-11\">The facts of the case are for you. The plaintiff, to authorize his recovery, cannot depend on the later warrants and surveys to make out his title. He must depend on his possession; and whether he has made out an actual, notorious, and distinct and adverse possession of the land in dispute, continued and uninterrupted for a period of twenty-one years previous to the bringing of this suit, you will determine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-12\">Verdict was rendered for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-13\">There were a number of errors assigned.

That it did not appear that plaintiff had claim to <em>any </em>land, by occupancy, much less the land in dispute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b360-9\">Burnside, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">I throw out of this case the consideration of the applications of Brown and Harrison of 1767. These surveys were made before the revolution. Both parties settled, and held adverse to them. Neither are the owners of these ancient surveys, and both parties rely on their improvements, and subsequent warrants and surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The improvement of Ramsey, under which the plaintiff claims, is the oldest, but it was often without an actual resident settler. It appears that he claimed the land in question in 1813, when he had a private survey made, which included it. His tenants also cleared some patches upon it, which were at times grown over with saplings.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Lock\u2019s settlement commenced about the year 1804, and was better continued than Ramsey\u2019s. After the death of Ramsey, his administrator took a warrant for 300 acres. He had a survey made, returned and accepted for 330 acres, excluding the land in controversy, prior to the defendant taking out his warrant. Witherow, the administrator of Ramsey, made a sale of the claim. It was bought by Caldwell, the deputy surveyor, for Hoover, who never entered any complaint against that survey at the land office, nor do we hear of any complaint from the heirs of Ramsey to correct that survey. Hoover got all the land he purchased and paid for. Lock took his warrant in 1846, calling for interest beyond the date of his improvement, and had the land in question included in his survey, which was returned and accepted. Subsequent to this, Hoover took a warrant for the land in dispute, which lay between his survey, on the Ramsey improvement, and the <em>line </em>run by Ramsey in 1813. No warrants or surveys were shown by either party from the land office; all the papers in evidence came from the office of the deputy surveyor. This bungling and slovenly mode of trying an ejectment is no credit to the profession. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Hoover claims an equity from the old improvement of Ramsey. The taking of two warrants on one improvement is a novelty.\u2014 Prom me sucb a practice will receive no encouragement. It is inconsistent with the principles wbick have heretofore governed our land titles. Our law allows lands to be taken up by warrant and survey, or \u00a1by improvement, and a warrant founded on that improvement and a survey. I am unable to discover any equity or title, derived from Ramsey\u2019s improvement, to support this warrant of Hoover. Claims under improvements are classed as imperfect rights to land, 1 <em>Yeates, </em>500, 516, although an improver in this purchase of 1754, in which this land is situated, was entitled to 300 acres, and at this time to 400, where there is so much vacancy. Yet he may tak\u00e9 less, and when he comes to make his survey he may change his boundaries, or at any other time, provided the land is vacant, and no other is affected by the change. When he does take a warrant, and has his survey made and returned, he is bound by that survey, Davis <em>vs. </em>Keefer, 4 <em>Binn. </em>161. A settler may limit his claim to a less quantity than is usually surveyed, and will be bound in his limitation as against an interfering right, Hamilton <em>vs. </em>McCulloch, <em>Add. </em>272. When Hoover bought the land, surveyed and returned from Witherow, Lock had some possession of the land in dispute and claimed it.</p>\n<p id=\"A7a\">I am unable to discover that the claim in his deed, beyond his purchase, can help him. His title only commenced for the land in controversy from the date of his warrant. I deem it unnecessary to review any of the other points raised by the learned counsel of the plaintiff, as the view I have taken of the cause puts an end to all controversy between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"AMD\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
