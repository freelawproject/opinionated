This offer to show want of consideration, and that <em>she </em>had no interest in the land as set out in this agreement; and that this agreement was entered into by mistake of the parties as to their rights; and that the widow accepted under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-16\">Objected to, because it proposes to go into the merits of the questions admitted and settled by the article of agreement; and at most the evidence offered only proposes to show a mistake of the parties as to their rights; a mutual mistake of the law, with a full knowledge of the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-17\">Objection overruled, and <em>plaintiff </em>excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-18\">This was plaintiffs <em>first </em>bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-19\">Evidence was given, on the part of defendant, that on the day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>gale of tbe personal property, in 1809, tbe widow got such articles of personal property as she was allowed under the will, except a saddle ; that some other article was spoken of, and not agreed on, and that it might have been the saddle that was not furnished her \u2014nothing said about it at the second sale of personal property. That the will was read in the presence of the widow. That the executors said they were willing to give what was specified in the will to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">The act of assembly in force at the time of the death of James M\u2019Kee, sen\u2019r., in relation to a bequest in lieu of dower, enacts that \u201cif any testator after the passage of this act, (the act of 4th April, 1797,). shall devise or bequeath to his wife, any portion of his estate, such devise or bequest shall be deemed and taken to be in lieu and bar of her. dower, out of the estate of her deceased husband, in like manner as if the same had been so expressed, unless such testator shall, by his last .will and testament declare otherwise, any law, usage, or custom of this commonwealth to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided always, that nothing in this section contained, shall deprive the widow of her choice, either to dower, or the estate so devised or bequeathed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">Wilson, J., charged the jury <em>inter alia, </em>that under this act of assembly, she could not be entitled to both the bequests and the dower in the land, and if she took the property bequeathed to her, after knowing the provisions of the will, it would amount to a choice of the estate bequeathed, and Henry and the purchaser of his estate would take the land discharged from her right of dower. To bar her it must be distinctly shewn she took under the will. That if she accepted, she had no interest in the land, or any right to claim dower; and in this event, defendant would derive no benefit under his contract with her to pay for her claim of dower, and that there would then be no consideration for the agreement by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">Verdict was rendered for defendant, Laughlin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-9\">It was assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-10\">1st. The court erred in admitting the evidence offered by defendant, constituting the plaintiffs\u2019 first bill of exception. The evidence offered and admitted only went to establish the fact that the defendant was mistaken as to the right of the plaintiffs \u2014 \u201cthe evidence discloses a case where there was neither fraud, misconception nor surprise, but a mutual mistake, a misconception of law by both parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-11\">2. The court erred in their charge to the jury, \u201c it is contended\u201d the court say, \u201c that ignorance of the legal effect or operation of the agreement entered into between the parties will not serve as a defence. This, as a general principle, is correct, but to it there are exceptions. Contracts based upon a supposed state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>of things which had no existence in fact, will he relieved against on the ground of mistake; and it is stated in Rankin <em>vs. </em>Mortimer 7 <em>W. </em>374, that a material mistake of law is an exception to the rule.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\">Blair, for plaintiffs in error;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajhg\">The facts were equally within the knowledge offboth parties \u2014 the only question was one of pure law, and defendant pleads his ignorance of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">If the defendant did not know that the widow had received the personal property bequeathed to her by the will, he could easily have ascertained. When each party is innocent, and there is no concealment of facts which the other party has a right to know, and no surprise or imposition exists, the mistake or ignorance, whether mutual or unilateral is treated, as laying no foundation for equitable interferences. It is strictly <em>damnum absque injuria ; Story\u2019s Eq., </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 151.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">The will in this case proved , in 1809, no act of assembly till 1811 prescribing a time, or the manner in which the election of a widow to take under the will, or not. If the act of 1811 applies to wills proved before, no proceedings were ever had against the widow to cause her to determine her choice, and her right to elect still exists, unless her reception of the articles devised to her, amounts to a choice, and that it would not; 2 <em>Yeates </em>302; 3 <em>Bro. Cha. Ca. </em>255.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-9\"><em>Orbison, </em>for defendant, Laughlin.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1R\">To the first error assigned, that if the defendant could avail himself of a want of consideration, as a defence, then the evidence to show want of title in the plaintiffs, was admissible. The admission of the evidence.objected to was right, if the court did not err in their charge as to what would bar dower, and in relation to defendant using the failure in the title as a defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-10\">The charge of the court was more favorable to plaintiffs than the law would allow <em>; </em>for, in order to make the want of consideration an available defence to defendant, he was required to satisfy the jury that there was a <em>mutual mistake.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-11\">He cited 1 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>438 ; <em>Id. </em>42; 10 <em>Barr </em>74 ; 7 <em>Watts </em>374.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-12\">That the widow was barred of dower, 2 <em>Yeates </em>302; <em>Id. </em>389.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b377-14\">Hibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1S\">By decisions here and abroad, the principle of Lansdown <em>vs. </em>Lansdown, <em>Mosely Rep. </em>264, has been exploded. It was rejected in Rankin <em>vs. </em>Mortimer, 7 <em>Watts </em>372. The Supreme Court of New York alone is the only one that has hesitated ; because it leaned, in its latter days, towards the subtle equities of the civil law. Chancellor Kent certainly did not encourage the notion, that a mistake of law is ground of relief; for he puts the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>sale of aHorse, dead, but not known to be so, as an instance of the distinction, between a mistake of law and a mistake of fact. Here the facts which constituted the basis of the bargain, were mutually understood. The defendant was bound to know the provisions under which he derived title; and he was bound to inquire whether the widow had elected to take dower, or the devise in lieu of it. The parties were or ought to have been, mutually informed of the facts on which they founded their agreement. The defence is that she took a benefit under the will, which excluded her right to dower. Be it so. But the facts were within the knowledge of both parties, and the mistake was in the judgment they formed of the legal effect of them. The plaintiffs have brought their action at law on a specialty; and a Chancellor would not interfere to rescind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
