A <em>sai. fa. </em>was subsequently issued on this judgment in favor of Mehaffey. See the case reported in 1 W. &amp; <em>S. </em>276. McKinney died in 1843; another <em>sai. fa. </em>issued on the same judgment, in favor of Haines, administrator of the estate of Share, against Withers, administrator of the estate of McKinney, the defendant in the original judgment. See this case reported in 2 <em>Barr </em>435.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-14\">Withers was married to the daughter of McKinney. In his account on the estate of McKinney, he asked credit for counsel fees exceeding f&gt;900, and for other items. The auditors allowed a portion of the amounts for which credits were asked, and disallowed other amounts and items.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Exceptions were filed on the part of the accountant to the report of the auditors, some of which were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">1. The auditors erred in disallowing the said administrator the following sums, viz: paid for paper book at Supreme Court, May 1846, $50 \u2014 paid counsel for services at May, 1844, $300. Also for amount reduced on commissions $250, and' two items for repairs $20 66.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_-\">2. Said auditors also erred in charging wear of goods, &amp;c., viz: $131 25. Also in charging accountant with costs of audit; The costs of audit are too high and exorbitant..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-9\">The exceptions to the auditors report were overruled and the report confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-lm\">Assignments error.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-11\">The court erred in confirming that part of the auditors report, disallowing the credit prayed for of $50 for paper book at Supreme Court, May term, 1846. Also the credit of $300 for professional services of S.. Parke and R. Frazer,' in Common Pleas and Supreme Court of May term, 1846. Also in reducing commissions to $250.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-12\"><em>Frazer, </em>on the part of the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATh\">contended that Withers was bound to contest the. judgment entered against McKinney, or he might be made responsible by the other creditors for the loss, particularly when he could prove that the bond had been given for lots distributed to McKinney .by illegal lottery, at high prices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-13\">Mehaffey\u2019s judgment was reversed without a <em>venire de novo, </em>and that Withers contended, when the <em>sci. fa. </em>by the administrator of the estate of Share was issued, that the costs of the previous suit should be paid \u2014 but that the Supreme court ruled the power discretionary with the court below. He contended that the efforts by Withers, under the advice of counsel, ought not to be at his own expense. That his being the son-in-law did not alter the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-14\"><em>Stevens, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmH\">The question is whether the administrator contended ft\u00edr his own benefit, or for that of the estate. Withers got the rents of the property, above $1300 or more \u2014 the proceeding was for his advantage, and so the auditors determined. That above $600 have been allowed to the administrator and counsel, and $300 is objected to because no- defence was made to the second <em>sci. fa. </em>on the merits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-15\"><em>Frazer, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXl\">The second <em>sci. fa. </em>was not resisted on its merits; it was thought that there was enough in the legal objections. ' \u2022</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The opinion of the court, was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AIN\">Burnside, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Afk5\">The only question this case presents, is whether an' administrator shall be allowed his counsel fees and expenses for' carrying on' a vexatious and tedious litigation for his exclusive benefit, or a benefit to his wife, who was the sole heir, and no creditors interested ?. If authority was wanted, Gossner\u2019s estate, 6 <em>Whar. </em>401, settles this- question. It jvas there held that an administratrix was not entitled to charge counsel fees to the fund, where she had made an unjust and vexatious defence' to the next of kin. Nor do we think he can be allowed to charge the- estate-with counsel fees and other expenses where he vexatiously resists a just creditor, for his own benefit or that of his wife. Here all the resistance to the collection of this debt, after it was in the Supreme Court in 1844, 7 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>276, was not only vexatious but dishonest, and for the exclusive benefit of Withers and his wife. The auditors and orphans\u2019 court were as liberal to the administrator as he deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
