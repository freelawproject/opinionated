That the declaration varies from the notice to the defendant, now plaintiff in error, (as one of the aldermen <em>in and for the county of Philadelphia), </em>inasmuch as the notice recites the fee bill of 1821, which was and is repealed by the act of 16th April, 1827, so far as relates to the city and county of Philadelphia, whereas the declaration recites the fee bill of 1814, <em>Pur. Dig. </em>469, <em>Pamp. L. </em>471. <em>F</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-6\">2. That the plaintiff (now defendant in error) having stated in his notice, that his cause of action arises under the fee bill of 1821, he is bound by said notice and cannot declare under the fee bill of 1814. The causes of action being distinct and different, as the compensation for the various services allowed under the fee bill of 1814 are nearly double those of the act of 1821. See act of 1772, sec. 1 and 5; <em>Pur. Dig. </em>681; Stansbury <em>vs. </em>Bertron, 7 <em>Watts &amp;\u2022 Berg. </em>363; 3 <em>Watts </em>144; 8 <em>Watts Berg. </em>162; 4 <em>Parr </em>517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-7\">3. That the notice should have distinctly set forth the particular fee insisted upon as illegal, in order to allow a tender of amends under the act of 1772. See act 1772, <em>Pur. Dig. </em>681, sec. 5; 8 <em>Watts Berg. </em>162; 4 <em>Parr </em>517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-9\">4. That the plaintiff (now defendant in error), having in his notice relied on the fee bill of 1821, he cannot declare under the fee bill of 1814. Act 1772, sec. 5; 7 <em>Watts Berg. </em>863.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-10\">5. That the fees received by the defendant (now the plaintiff in error), to wit, mittimus and justification of bail 31 cents, constable serving mittimus 25, mileage 37, bail 20 cents, in all f 1,12, wore in accordance with the fee bill of 1814, consequently no penalty had or could have occurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-11\">6. That the notice is <em>deceptive </em>and therefore void, act 1772, sec. 5; 7 <em>Watts </em>\u00bff <em>Berg. </em>363.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-12\"><em>Ketcham </em>was concerned for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b13-13\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b13-14\">Ro&amp;ers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">To discourage vexatious suit against Justices of the Peace, the act of 21 March, 1772, directs, that before any suit shall be brought against such justice, for any thing done in the execution of his office, notice in writing shall be given, for at least thirty days before suing out or serving the process. The act directs that the notice shall clearly and explicitly contain the cause of action, and the name of his agent or attorney, with the place of his abode, endorsed <em>on the back </em>of the notice. The cause of action here appears to be clearly and explicitly set forth. There is such a sufficient and substantial notice, as that he could not have been ignorant of the charge made against him. He is apprized of the sum and the occasion on which it was extorted, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>'that he might have tendered the amount, if he had chosen to do so. But another objection remains to be considered; this is not so clear. The notice charges that the justice received illegal fees, exceeding the amount that aldermen and justices of the Peace are permitted to receive, by the act of assembly of the 22d Eeb. 1821. In the declaration he declares on the Fee Bill of the 28th March, 1814. That is he gives notice under one act, and declares on another, and entirely different act. I cannot regard the reference to the act of the 22d Feb. 1821, as surplusage, but as a substantial averment that he intended to proceed on that act. From this ;he ought not to be at liberty to depart in a penal action against a justice of the Peace, whom the legislature have endeavored to protect against harrassing and vexatious suits. I have examined the authorities cited by the defendant'in error, which do not, in \u2022my judgment, support the position assumed, that the reference to the act is surplusage, particularly as the act referred to and the act declared on, differ materially in the eonrpensation allowed, for the various services performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
