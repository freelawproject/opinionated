The case of Hale <em>vs. </em>Henry differs from this. There, the real estate was purchased by Capp and Henry together, and the deed taken in their names, as tenants in common, and while there was nothing contained in the deed shewing that they held the sa\u00edne, as partners, there was besides no agreement or other writing placed on record, that creditors might not be deceived. It was, therefore, held by the court, that \u201cit is not competent to show by 'parol that a deed to two persons as tenants in common, was purchased and paid for by them as partners, and was partnership property; and that when partners intend to bring real estate into a partnership stock, that intention must be manifested by deed or writing placed on record.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-6\">That case was therefore entirely different from the present. <em>There, </em>the deed was to Capp and Henry, as tenants in common. <em>Here, </em>it was to Augustus Holmes, James Myers and John Strimpler, trading under the firm of Holmes, Myers &amp; Co. <em>There, </em>there was no record of anything. <em>Here, </em>there was a-'sheriff\u2019s deed duly executed, acknowledged in open court, and placed on record in the prothonotary\u2019s office, in conformity with the laws of this commonwealth. \u25a0 This registering of a sheriff\u2019s deed in the prothonotary\u2019s office, is equivalent to recording it in the recorder\u2019s office; and this was so decided in 4 <em>Whar. </em>293, Nagle <em>vs. </em>Albright and others. Here was cited 1 <em>Amer. Lead.Cases, </em>340; 1 <em>State Rep. in Equity in S. C. </em>1824, Winslow <em>vs. </em>Chifelle; 1 <em>Hammond\u2019s Ohio Rep. </em>244; 3 <em>Kent </em>39, <em>note A.; Story on Part. </em>sec. 82 id. 92; <em>Coll. on Part.

This is not the fact. Here the sheriff,by his deed, grants, bargains and sells the property \u201c to Augustus Holmes, James Myers and John Strimpler* &amp;c., their heirs and assigns,\u201d to have and to hold the same \u201cunto the said Augustus Holmes, James Myers and John Strimpler, &amp;c., their heirs and assigns.\u201d There is no mention of the partnership in the operative clauses of the deed \u2014 no conveyance to the uses of1 the partnership \u2014 but simply to the partners in their individual capacity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-9\">But the sheriff\u2019s deed was not that upon which the defendants relied for th'eir title; they held the property under a deed of conveyance from Thaddeus Stevens, Esq. This deed was <em>not recorded, </em>and granted, bargained and sold the property to \u201c John Strimpler, Augustus Holmes and James Myers, their .heirs and assigns,\u201d <em>habendum </em>and <em>tenendum, </em>to \u201c John Strimpler, Augustus Holmes and James Myers,'their-heirs and assigns,\u201d covenant with \u201cJohn Strimpler, Augustus Holmes and James Myers, their heirs, executors and assigns.\u201d This deed does not even recite the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of the second part in the order in which their names occurred in the firm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-6\">The payment of the purchase money with partnership funds does not affect the nature of the interests conveyed by the deed: Goodwin <em>vs. </em>Richardson; 11 <em>Mass. </em>475; 7 S. &amp; <em>R. </em>443, McDermot <em>vs. </em>Lawrence; 3 Br. <em>Ch.

It is therefore submitted that this case does not differ in any material respect from Hale <em>vs. </em>Henry, and is ruled by it, as decided by the court below. , . .</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-7\">2. The appellants contend that the intention -to bring this real estate into partnership is manifested by deed or writing placed on record. Where and how ? Only by the recital of the payment of the purchase money, which cannot affect the interests vested under the deed; in fact, the operative portions of the deed negative any inference of such intention that might be drawn from this recital. In McDermot <em>vs. </em>Lawrence, in which Chief Justice Tilghman declared that \u201c certainly where it is the intention of partners to bring real property into the common stock, it wpuld be prudent to put. their agreement on record, in order that purchasers may not be. deceived:\u201d Hale <em>vs. </em>Henry, in which the court <em>\u201c </em>think that where partners intend to bring real estate into partnership, that intention must be manifested by deed or .writing placed on record, that purchasers and creditors may not be deceived.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-8\">These cases, which settle the law in Pennsylvania, clearly require a recorded deed or agreement in writing; appropriating the real estate to the uses of the partnership, and cannot be satisfied with thp naked recital of the source of the consideration of a deed, which passes individual titles on its face.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b551-10\">Coulter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4j\">It is very true that a title of land cannot be affected or overborne by <em>parol </em>evidence, that a deed to two or more persons, as <em>tenants in </em>common, was purchased and paid for by them as partners, and was partnership property. Because that would be to destroy and contradict the title by deed and set up .a parol title in.'its place. It is also true that when parties intend to bring real estate into a partnership stock, that such intention must be manifested by writing placed on record. Because under the statute of frauds all contracts respecting real estate must be. in writing, saving only those .exceptions which have been made by the courts, of which this is not bne. But the caus\u00e9 on hand is not governed by these principles, or by the case of Hale <em>vs: </em>Henrie, 2 <em>Watts </em>145, on the authority of which the court below ruled it.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The deed, in the case, is made to Augustus Holmes, James Myers and John Strimpler, trading under the firm of Holmes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Myers &amp; Co. and recites that the purchase money was paid by them, as partners, and the receipt appended to the deed is in the same character. The sheriff in his deed recites that he sold the estate by public vendue or outcry, to Holmes, Myers and Strimpler, - trading under the firm of Holmes, Myers &amp; Co. This deed is duly acknowledged in open court and placed in the records of the Common Pleas, as a deed to Holmes, Myers &amp; Co. This furnace and land was the place where the firm carried on the iron business.' This deed, then, is not a deed to the members of the firm, as tenants in common, no such word is to be found in the deed; nor can any glimmering of such intent be collected from its whole contents; but on the <em>contrary, it is not </em>only distinctly so expressed, but is apparent from the whole scope of the deed, that that it was made to Holmes, Myers and Strimpler, as a partnership, for manufacturing iron. In the early case of McDermot <em>vs. </em>Lawrence, 7 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>443, it was said by Chief Justice Tilghman, that when it was the intent of the firm to bring real estate into the common stock, it would be prudent to put their agreements on record, that purchasers may not be deceived. And in Hale <em>vs. </em>Henry, before cited, the language of the court is <em>\u201c </em>that when parties intend <em>to </em>bring real estate into partnership, that intention must be manifested by deed or writing, placed on record, that purchasers may not be deceived. But how could parties more effectually manifest their intention, that the property was to be held in partnership, than by taking a deed for it, to them as <em>partners, </em>as in the present case. The object to be answered is to put creditors and purchasers on their guard, and that purpose is effectually answered by the deed being made to the partners, as partners and not as tenants in common. As parties take so they hold. When the .parties take a deed, as <em>tenants in common, </em>then, and in such case, it would be necessary to put on record an agreement that it was intended to be brought into partnership stock, or when one of the partners held individually, the same agreement would be necessary. But where the inception and completion of the deed and title is, as partners, so do they hold and not otherwise. Then <em>the </em>next question is did they put the evidence on record? The object is to give creditors and purchasers notice. How is this to be done, except as it is done in similar cas\u00e9s. You may affect creditors with notice of the purchase and sale of real estate,-by putting the deed on record, in the recorder\u2019s office, or, by that process, which this court has decided to be equivalent in cases of sheriff\u2019s sale, which was adopted in this case, to wit: the record of the deed to the firm, by the Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas. This record distinctly shows that the deed was made to the partnership or firm. And this having been adjudged to be good notice to creditors and purchasers in all other cases, must be considered a sufficient record and notice in this case. Besides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the partnership existed, lived, moved and had its being, on this property, and that'was adequate notice, if the rule adopted in kindred cases is to govern here, that is notice of the deed to the firm, when one existed, or its equivalent, an agreement to make the land partnership stock. In Kramer <em>vs. </em>Arthurs, 7 <em>Barr </em>171, it is said by the court, that when land is brought into a concern as stock, it is between the partners and a person who has knowingly dealt with one of them for it, to be treated as personal estate, belonging not to the parties individually, but to the company collectively; and the Chief Justice adds that it would be absurd to let the nature of the article dealt in change the nature of the contract. But it is alleged that the <em>habendum </em>is \u201cto them their-heirs and assigns forever,\u201d and that this makes it a tenancy in common. But this is a misapprehension. The premises are used to set forth the names of <em>the parties. </em>Then follows the certainty of <em>the </em>grantee, and the thing granted: 2 <em>Blaehstone </em>298. So in this case, the certainty of the grantee, to wit: the firm or partnership is orderly set out. But the office of the <em>habendum </em>is not to designate the grantee, but to determine the amount of the estate or interest granted by the deed, whether for life in tail or in fee simple: same book and page. . The <em>habendum </em>here was to determine what quantity of interest was conveyed to the firm. Whether an estate in fee or during 'the-continuance of the partnership, or for life, as a fee, was intended to be passed to the firm,- apt words were used for that purpose. The <em>habendum </em>cannot introduce a party not named in the premises; nor can it strike out a party that is named.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On the whole, the money of the firm paid for this land, as appears by the deed itself; it was' used for the purposes and existence of the firm, and it ought to go to pay the debts of the firm, rather than the debts of Strimpler, one of the partners. Although, therefore, the judgment against Strimpler was before the mortgage by the firm, yet he who dealt with Strimpler was affected with notice that the furnace was the partnership stock of the firm, and the furnace being sold on the judgment against the firm, the money ought to be distributed to the creditors of the firm. The judgment or decree of the court below is reversed, and the report of the auditors is confirmed; and the money ordered to be distributed, accordingly; and the record is remitted to the court below for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
