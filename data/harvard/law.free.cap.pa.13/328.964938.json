Both of the parties lived in Adams county. There was no distinct evidence where the arrangement to purchase the ticket was made; but see charge of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">Defendant denied that the ticket was purchased for the plaintiff, and alleged that, in any event, there could not be a recovery against him, on account of the illegality of the transaction; and his counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">Charge of the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">This is an action for money had and received. The facts are fully stated by a single witness, the only one examined on either side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">The plaintiff employed the defendant to' purchase a lottery ticket for him in the city of Baltimore. The ticket was there purchased by the defendant for the plaintiff, and retained by him until the lottery was drawn, when he called with the lottery broker, and received the proceeds of a prize payable on the ticket, to the amount of two hundred and twelve dollars. The only evidence in the case, as to where the arrangement was made between the plaintiff and defendant, as to the purchase of the ticket, was that both plaintiff and defendant resided in Pennsylvania at the time, and that the defendant was on a visit to Baltimore when he made the purchase, from which it is fairly inferable that it was made in Pennsylvania. It is contended by the defendant that there can be no recovery against him, because, by the laws of Pennsylvania, lotteries are unlawful, and all transactions growing out of them are unlawful, and will not be enforced by our courts. A transaction or contract founded upon that which is either <em>malum in se </em>or <em>malum prohibitum </em>will not be enforced by our courts. But is this either ? It is admitted that lotteries are lawful in the state of Maryland; and there is no law of Pennsylvania which prohibits a citizen of Pennsylvania from purchasing a lottery ticket in Maryland. The case presented, then, is simply this: the plaintiff procured the defendant to purchase a ticket for him in Baltimore. He did so. That ticket drew a prize-which entitled the plaintiff to receive two hundred and tw$ve dollars. After the lottery was drawn, the defendant called and received the money for the plaintiff, and now refuses to pay it to him, because the transaction was unlawful. We think it was not unlawful; and if it was, the defendant cannot take advantage of it; and therefore instruct you, that if you believe the facts in evidence, the plaintiff is eniitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\">Errors assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-11\">1. The court erred in assuming, as a fact, and charging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>jury, that the ticket which drew the prize was purchased and held by the defendant for the plaintiff; and that the money subsequently received by the defendant, was received as the agent of the plaintiff, and for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">2. The court erred in charging the jury that the transaction was not unlawful; that if it was unlawful, the defendant could not take advantage of it; and that if they believed the facts in evidence, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-7\"><em>D.

The contract between the plaintiff and defendant was made in this state. The ticket was to be brought here for the plaintiff, and he has chosen his forum here. But if even the contract had been made in Maryland, it would not be <em>enforced by our </em>courts. 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Commentaries, </em>458, and note and authorities there cited; <em>Story on Conflict of Laws, </em>203, 215; 6 <em>Mass.

When a contract is to be performed where it is made, the <em>lex loci </em>is the rule of decision. 2 <em>Say, </em>378. It is true, the money to purchase the ticket in Baltimore was to be paid in this state; but this was not against any statute or common law of Pennsylvania. The receipt of the money drawn by the ticket was not unlawful by the laws of Maryland; but the refusal to hand it over, when he returned to Pennsylvania, was dishonest and unlawful; and the court was right in directing the jury to find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
