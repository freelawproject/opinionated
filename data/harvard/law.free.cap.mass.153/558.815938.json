Loomis, 139 Mass. 302. See <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Pick. 416 ; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>152 Mass. 310. But the proviso in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>guaranty that the lessee shall live to the end of the term implies that the guaranty only extends to the end of the term; and we think that it should be taken in favor of the guarantor, that the term with which the guaranty ends is that which is spoken of as the term in the lease. Whether the tenant on his election to renew the lease held under the old instrument or needed a new one, the lease, as appears in the language quoted, speaks of the first three years as the present term, and calls the period of possible renewal \u201c the further term.\u201d We are of opinion that the defendant is not liable for the time covered by the renewal. <em>Judgment for defendant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
