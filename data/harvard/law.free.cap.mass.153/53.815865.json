The first count of the declaration, so far as it need be stated, was as follows: \u201c And the plaintiff says the defendant made a great pond of water near the land of the plaintiff in said Lynn, bounded north by Walnut Street nine hundred feet; east by land of the defendant and other land of the plaintiff five hundred feet; south by land of the plaintiff nine hundred feet; and west by land of the plaintiff five hundred feet; and so maintained the same on the 17th day of July, A. d. 1886, and on divers days since, even to the date of this writ, that the waters of said pond have flowed into and upon her said land, to its great injury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-13\">The answer contained a general denial, and alleged that the defendant <em>ct </em>made the pond declared on by authority of law, under the provisions of chapter 218 of the Acts of the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the year 1871.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Writ dated April 21, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>At the trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., there was evidence tending to prove the following facts. In 1873, the defendant city constructed a reservoir for the permanent storage of water for the use of its inhabitants, by erecting a dam on land bought by it, opposite land which the plaintiff purchased in 1886. This dam was two hundred and ten feet long and sixteen feet high, and the pond when full covered an area of sixty-seven acres, and had a capacity of two hundred million gallons, the depth of water at the dam being thirteen feet. Before this dam was built, the plaintiff\u2019s land was dry, and affected only in the usual manner by rains. After the construction of the dam and the reservoir, water percolating from the latter saturated the plaintiff\u2019s land, which consisted in part of an orchard, and also flowed a number of acres so that it was unfit for tillage purposes. In 1885, the defendant city raised the dam nine feet, so that the reservoir when full was twenty-one feet and nine inches deep at the dam, and had a capacity of four hundred million gallons. After this increase of height and size of the dam and reservoir, the water rose still higher upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, so saturating and flowing it that it could not be used either for tillage or building purposes, and the water remained upon it during all the seasons of the year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">The plaintiff contended that the reservoir and dam were permanent, and, if the jury found for the plaintiff bn the question of liability, that she was entitled to recover damages for the permanent injury to her property; but the judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury, that, if they found that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries to her land as alleged, then she was entitled to recover damages only from the date of the conveyance to her to the date of the writ, and no more; and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>One Mullen, a witness for the plaintiff, was asked, on direct examination, What was' the condition of the orchard with reference to water prior to the construction of the pond in 1873 ? The defendant objected to the question, as being too remote from the time of the reconstruction of the dam in 1885; but the judge, after the defendant had stated that it was denied that any water flowed from either the original dam or the present dam upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, admitted the evidence merely for the purpose of showing the condition of the land prior to the erection of the original dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">There was evidence that the plaintiff had, on many occasions, stated to agents of the defendant city that she would bring an action against it if it did not purchase her land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">Upon the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination, the defendant, for the purpose of showing a bias upon the part of the plaintiff, offered in evidence a paper under seal, of which she had possession, given her on May 28,1888, by her grantor, a corporation, and reciting the assignment and transfer unto her of all its claims for injury to her land, by way of trespass or otherwise, caused by the defendant city or its agents, which accrued while it owned the land; and authorizing her to sue, and to settle in any way, in its name, all of such claims, for her own use and at her own cost and expense. The judge excluded the evidence; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">It was agreed that all the facts stated and found by the court in the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>119 Mass. 174, might be taken as proven in this case. The defendant asked the judge to rule that this action could not be maintained other than by petition. The judge refused so to rule; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and both the plaintiff and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-9\"><em>H.

The plaintiff excepted to the ruling that she was entitled to recover damages only to the date of her writ, and contended that the dam and pond were permanent, and that she was entitled to damages for a permanent injury to her property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>An erection unlawfully maintained on one\u2019s own land, to the detriment of the land of a neighbor, is a continuing nuisance, for the maintenance of which an action may be brought at any time, and damages recovered up to the time of bringing the suit. <em>Prentiss </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>132 Mass. 486. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>New Haven Northampton Co. </em>151 Mass. 46, and cases there cited. That it is of a permanent character, or that it has been continued for any length of time less than what is necessary to acquire a prescriptive right, does not make it lawful, nor deprive the adjacent landowner of his right to recover damages. Nor can the adjacent landowner in such a case, who sues for damage to his property, compel the defendant to pay damages for the future. The defendant may prefer to change his use of his property so far as to make his conduct lawful. In the present case, we cannot say that the defendant may not repair or reconstruct its dam and reservoir in such a way as to prevent percolation, with much less expenditure than would be required to pay damages for a permanent injury to the plaintiff\u2019s land. As was pointed out in <em>Wells </em>v. <em>New Haven &amp; Northampton Co., ubi supra, </em>it appeared in <em>Fowle </em>v. <em>New Haven &amp; Northampton Co. </em>107 Mass. 352, and 112 Mass. 334, that the parties in a former suit had elected to treat the injury as permanent, and the plaintiff had accepted entire damages for the future as well as the past, and on that ground, which is adverted to in the last opinion, the case was well de- . cided. In <em>Goslin </em>v. Corry, 7 Man. &amp; G. 342, 345, where a defendant, on the trial of an action for a libel, permitted evidence to be given of damage caused after action brought, Tindal, 0. J. said:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u201c By permitting this evidence to be given, the defendant may possibly have escaped having a second action brought against him. It was, therefore, far from an impolitic thing to allow damages to be assessed for the whole cause of complaint in one action.\u201d So far as there are intimations in the successive opinions in <em>Fowle </em>v. <em>New Haven &amp; Northampton Co. </em>which seem to make the case an authority for the plaintiff\u2019s contention in the case at bar, we are not inclined to follow them. The ruling was correct, and the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The defendant excepted to the refusal of the court to rule \u201c that this action could not be maintained other than by petition.\u201d No question was raised upon the form of the declaration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>nor is the evidence reported. It is therefore to be assumed that the evidence was sufficient for the maintenance of the action, if such evidence could be legitimately introduced under the pleadings. The declaration set out a good cause of action at the common law. The defendant alleged in justification that the pond was made and maintained under the provisions of the St. of 1871, c. 218. If the defendant had shown that all due and reasonable precautions were taken in the construction and maintenance of the dam and reservoir, and that nothing was done wantonly or negligently, so as to cause unnecessary damage to the property of the plaintiff, the defence would have been made out. For all damages resulting from the proper exercise of the authority given the defendant by the statute the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was by petition. But for damages resulting from a negligent or improper construction or maintenance of the dam and reservoir, the plaintiff might recover at the common law. It is to be assumed that the jury were so instructed, and that the evidence warranted their verdict. <em>Mellen </em>v. <em>Western </em>Railroad, 4 Gray, 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\">The testimony of the witness Mullen was rightly received. It was proper to show the condition of the land before the original dam was built, to assist the jury in determining whether the pond had affected its condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The paper offered by the defendant was incompetent. It did not show bias on the part of the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s exceptions must also be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>.Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
