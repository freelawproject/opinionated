All the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal, or mixed, of which I shall die seised and possessed, or to which I shall be entitled at the time of my decease, I give, devise, and bequeath to my beloved wife, Ann L. Chase, to her use and be-hoof forever. Provided, however, that my said wife shall cause to be erected on my lot in Merrimack Cemetery in said West Newbury a handsome marble monument, worth at least five hundred dollars; also, to put the monument now standing on my lot in said cemetery on th\u00e9 lot where Jane Jaques is buried. All to be paid for by my said wife out of the estate which I have given to her. Provided also, that if any of the property which I have given my beloved wife aforesaid shall not have been ex pended by her for her support and maintenance during her lifetime, then and in that case my will is, that so much of said estate as shall remain unexpended at the time of her decease shall be disposed thereof in manner following, to wit.\u201d Then followed bequests aggregating S3,500 to various persons named, \u201c to their own use and behoof forever.\u201d On April 20,1870, Ann L. Chase caused to be transferred to her account in the savings bank an amount already on deposit there and belonging to the estate of her husband, and deposited at the same time therewith the proceeds of real estate belonging to him which had been sold and conveyed by her. She died on June 29, 1889, leaving a will. Her executor contended that the deposit in question and its accumulations were the absolute property of his testatrix, and passed to his hands by the will.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-7\"><em>B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEX\">The principal differences between this case and <em>Joslin </em>v. Rhoades, 150 Mass. 301, are that the devise in <em>Joslin </em>v. <em>Rhoades </em>is to the wife and \u201c her heirs and assigns forever,\u201d and in the present case it is to the wife, \u201c to her use and behoof forever,\u201d and that in <em>Joslin </em>v. <em>Rhoades </em>there is no express or implied restriction upon the right or power of the devisee to dispose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>estate unless it is to be inferred from the \u201c condition that, if any portion of my said estate should remain in the possession of my said wife at the time of her decease, such remainder shall be divided \u201d as expressed in the will, while in the present case it is distinctly implied that the wife shall have the power of expending the property only \u201c for her support and maintenance during her lifetime,\u201d and it is provided that \u201c so much of said estate as shall remain unexpended at the time of her decease shall be disposed \u201d of as expressed in the will. We are inclined to the opinion, that these differences are significant, and that the most reasonable construction of the will is that the testator intended that the wife should have the use of the property for her support and maintenance, with the power of expending it,' that is, of selling and conveying it, and using the proceeds only so far as was necessary for her reasonable support and maintenance during her life, but with no other power of disposing of the property, or of any part of it. The words of the first part of the clause do not so plainly convey the property absolutely, or in fee simple, that the subsequent proviso must necessarily be considered as inconsistent with them, and the meaning of the proviso is clear. There is no doubt of the intention of the testator to dispose of what remains at the death of his wife unexpended for her support and maintenance, and we see no insuperable difficulties in carrying this intention into effect. None of our decisions in which it has been held that the property was given absolutely, and that the remaining provisions were inconsistent with such a gift and were void, requires us to reach that conclusion from the particular words of this will, although there are cases closely resembling the present, which certainly is very near the line which separates the decisions.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Bamforth </em>v. Bamforth, 123 Mass. 280. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>123 Mass. 323. <em>Schmaunz </em>v. <em>Goss, </em>132 Mass. 141. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Meins, </em>135 Mass. 231. <em>Damrell </em>v. <em>Hartt, </em>137 Mass, 218. <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>144 Mass. 542. <em>Joslin </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>150 Mass. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The provisions in this clause of the will concerning the monuments are not, we think, very material. Undoubtedly the wife was given power to sell for this purpose so much of the property as was necessary. <em>Demurrer overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"><em> </em>See <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Morrison, post, </em>137.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
