Sts. c. 48, \u00a7 14; that the respondents had failed and neglected to establish the school; and praying that they be ordered to do so. The answer alleged that the towns of Beverly and Danvers had rescinded their votes whereby they had required the respondents to establish the truant school in question; and that in consequence the respondents were not required or authorized to establish it. The petitioner demurred generally to the answer. <em>Devens, </em>J., reserved the case for the determination of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\"><em>J.

Sts. c. 3, \u00a7 3, cl. 23, it is provided that, in the construction of statutes, \u201cthe word \u2018town\u2019 may be construed to include cities.\u201d If this provision is applicable to the word \u201ctowns,\u201d as used in the first part of \u00a7 14 of the Pub. Sts. c. 48, the cities of Lynn and Haverhill are to be counted as having required the county commissioners to establish a truant school, and the votes of Beverly and Danvers to rescind their former votes are immaterial, and a peremptory writ of mandamus must be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Reading \u00a7 14 of the Pub. Sts. c. 48, as if it were a single enactment, the use of the word \u201ctowns\u201d alone in the first part of the section, and of the words \u201ccities or towns \u201d in a similar connection in the last part of the section, creates an ambiguity, and raises a doubt whether a distinction was not intended between the method of requiring the establishment of a county truant school under the first part of the section, and of a union truant school for different counties under the last part of the section. But upon considering the history of the legislation the whole matter becomes clear. The first part of the section is a re-enactment of the St. of 1873, c. 262, \u00a7 5, in which the words used were \u201c cities or towns,\u201d and the commissioners, without intending to change the meaning, and evidently with a view to conciseness, omitted the word \u201c cities \u201d as unnecessary. Their first report to the Legislature did not contain the last part of \u00a7 14 of the Pub'. Sts. c. 48, and this was derived from a subsequent enactment of the Legislature (St. 1881, c. 144), and incorporated into their report by an amendment. In this amendment the words \u201ccities or towns \u201d were retained as found in the original act.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>We are of opinion that the word \u201c towns \u201d in the first part of the section includes cities, and that if the towns of Beverly and Danvers could effectually rescind their action after having joined with other towns in requiring the county commissioners to establish a truant school, which we do not intimate, there are still more than three cities and towns continuing in the requirement, and the order must be, <em>Peremptory mandamus to issue.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
