Reynolds T. White of Boston, Mass., having this date assigned to me all his right, title, and interest in certain allowance for letters patent, serial number 207,184, I hereby agree, after a full and complete test has been made of aforesaid named invention, and the same proves entirely satisfactory to me, and a stock company has been formed as the result of said invention, after which I will pay to said White the sum of fifteen hundred dollars; also to make over or cause to be made over fifty thousand dollars of the aforesaid capital stock, or said Randall can pay said White for all his right, title, and interest in invention serial number 207,184 the sum of five thousand dollars net cash.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Mason, </em>J., there was evidence that the defendant had paid the plaintiff fifty dollars on account, and had promised to pay him $4,950 more, but had not done so. There was no evidence that any full and complete test had been made of the invention, or that the same was entirely satisfactory to the defendant, or that any stock company had been formed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">The plaintiff contended that the defendant\u2019s agreement contained two distinct and separate contracts; that the second contract consisted of an unconditional promise on the part of the defendant to pay the plaintiff $5,000 for his interest in the invention mentioned in the agreement; and that the defendant had elected to be bound by the second contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">The judge ruled that, while there was evidence to go to the jury upon the question of election, the agreement in question would not admit of the interpretation put upon it by the plaintiff, and ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-9\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai9\">We think that the construction given by the presiding justice of the Superior Court to the written agreement declared on was correct. The defendant had the option either to pay to the plaintiff for the .assignment of his interest in the seller\u2019s patent, $1,500, and to make over to him $50,000 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>capital stock of a company to be formed, or to pay him $5,000; but the defendant promised to do one or the other only \u201c after a full and complete test has been made of aforesaid named invention, and the same proves entirely satisfactory to me, and a stock company has been formed as the result of said invention.\u201d Even if the formation of the stock company was not a condition precedent to the performance of the promise to pay $5,000, if the defendant elected to pay $5,000, yet we think that the other provisions we have cited were conditions precedent to the performance of that promise. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
