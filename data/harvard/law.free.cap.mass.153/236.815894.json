And I, the said F. W. A. Bergengren, hereby covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and agree, for the consideration above named, that I will not practise in my profession as a physician at said Gloucester so long as the said Smith shall be engaged in the practice of a physician at said Gloucester; provided, however, that I shall have the right to engage in the practice of a. physician at said Gloucester at any time after the expiration of five years from November 1, 1872, by paying to said Smith the sum of two thousand dollars, but not otherwise.\u201d Writ dated August 24, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-3\">Trial in the Superior Court, before Sherman, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows. When the agreement was executed, the defendant was a practising physician in Gloucester, and the plaintiff a physician who intended to locate there for the same purpose, and who, after the signing of the agreement, began to practise there as a physician, and so continued until the trial. In the spring of 1887, the defendant returned to practise in Gloucester without paying to the plaintiff the $2,000 named in the agreement, or any part thereof, and without the plaintiff\u2019s consent, but he ceased thus to practise about the time the action was begun.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlUV\">The judge ruled, against the defendant\u2019s objection, that the sum of $2,000 named in the agreement was to be treated as liquidated damages, and submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $2,000 ; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The case was argued at the bar in November, 1890, and after-wards, on February 24, 1891, was submitted on the briefs to all the judges.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\"><em>W.

It was not a sum to be paid in case the defendant broke his contract, and did what he had agreed not to do. It was a price fixed for what the contract permitted him to do if he paid. The defendant expressly covenanted not to return to practice in Gloucester unless he paid this price. It would be against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>common sense to say that he could avoid the effect of thus having named the sum by simply returning to practice without paying, and could escape for a less sum if the jury thought the damage done the plaintiff by his competition was less than two thousand dollars. The express covenant imported the further agreement, that if the defendant did return to practice he would pay the price. No technical words are necessary if the intent is fairly to be gathered from the instrument. See <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>24 Wend. 244, and 26 Wend. 630; <em>Stevinson's case, </em>1 Leon. 324; <em>St. Albans </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>16 East, 352; <em>Deverill </em>v. <em>Burnell, </em>L. R. 8 C. P. 475; <em>National Provincial Bank of England </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>40 Ch. D. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\">If the sum had been fixed as liquidated damages, the defendant would have been bound to pay it. <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>97 Mass. 445. <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>2 Allen, 456. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>66 Maine, 410. But this case falls within the language of Lord Mansfield in <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Peers, </em>4 Burr. 2225, 2229, that if there is a covenant not to plough with a penalty in a lease, a cojirt of equity will relieve against the penalty, \u201c but if it is worded \u2018 to pay \u00a35 an acre for every acre ploughed up,\u2019 there is no alternative, no room for any relief against it, no compensation; it is the substance of the agreement.\u201d See also <em>Ropes </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>125 Mass. 258, 260. The ruling excepted to did the defendant no wrong. In the Opinion of a majority of the court, the exceptions must be overruled. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
