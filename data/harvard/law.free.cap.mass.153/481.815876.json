Plea, <em>nul disseisin. </em>At the trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Dewey, J., the following facts were not disputed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-12\">John Goodwin, who was seised in fee of the entire parcel, died on December 1, 1889, leaving a widow, Sadie Goodwin, and a son, the demandant. His will, omitting parts merely formal, was as follows : \u201c I, John Goodwin, being of sound mind and intellect, do give, devise, and bequeath one half of all my property, both real and personal, to my beloved wife, Sadie Goodwin, the remaining half to my dear son, Francis Goodwin. Should either said wife or son die, their share to go to the survivor.

If there could be any doubt that the subsequent words, \u201c Should either wife or son die, their share to go to the survivor,\u201d intend a death before the testator, the words which follow, \u201c Should both die, the property to go to the nearest of kin,\u201d would remove it. The will cannot reasonably be construed to give life estates to the wife and son, with remainder for life to the survivor, and remainder in fee to the nearest of kin. Such a construction would be contrary to the plain meaning of the testator. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>9 Allen, 516. <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Field, </em>119 Mass. 170. <em>Moffat </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>150 Mass. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
