Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, and need not more particularly describe the place so used.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-10\">Complaint alleging that John Quinlan, of Rockland, on September 15, 1889, and on divers days and times between that day and January 20, 1890, unlawfully \u201cdid keep and maintain a certain nuisance, to wit, a tenement at said Rockland then and on said other days and times there, used for the illegal sale and illegal keeping for sale of intoxicating liquors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-11\">In the Superior Court, on appeal, before the jury were impanelled, the defendant moved to quash the complaint because: \u201c 1st. The same is insufficient, uncertain, and does not with accuracy set out any offence known to the law. 2d. Because it does not allege that the tenement mentioned in said complaint was kept by the defendant.\u201d Bishop, J. overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-12\">The defendant was then tried, and found guilty, and alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-13\"><em>H.

Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>10 Gray, 465, the indictment charged that the defendants \u201c did keep and maintain a certain common nuisance, to wit, a certain building, to wit, a house of ill fame,\u201d and contained other allegations applicable to the building. It was contended by the defendants, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>words \u201c did keep and maintain a certain common nuisance \u201d were clearly insufficient, and that these words were not aided by the words under the videlicet. But the court held that the general expression first used, though susceptible of a different meaning in itself, was, by the videlicet, restricted and confined to a definite fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u201c The precise and legal use of a videlicet in every species of pleading \u201d was defined to be, \u201c to enable the pleader to isolate, to distinguish, and to fix with certainty, that which was before general, and which, without such explanation, might with equal propriety have been applied to different objects.\u201d 10 Gray, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The same principles apply to the complaint now under consideration. The videlicet particularizes what was left too general. The descriptions are not repugnant to each other, and the accused is not exposed to the danger of misapprehending the exact offence he is called on to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The defendant further contends that, although the word \u201c tenement \u201d in the videlicet is used in the statute, this is not enough, because the word has several meanings. As used in the Pub. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, it means either a building, or a part of a building. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>144 Mass. 297; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>148 Mass. 8, and cases cited. It is unnecessary, however, to consider this question further, for in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skelley, </em>10 Gray, 464, it was held that an indictment under the St. of 1855, c. 405, \u00a7 1, (which is similar to the Pub. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7 6,) for keeping and maintaining a certain common nuisance, to wit, \u201c a tenement \u201d in a certain street and city, used in a manner prohibited by that statute, need not more particularly describe the place so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
