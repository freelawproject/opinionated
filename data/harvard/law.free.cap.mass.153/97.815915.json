At the trial of a complaint for obstructing a police officer, there was evidence that the officer had been detailed to keep the streets clear, under a city ordinance the validity of which was not questioned, while a circus procession was passing along; and that the defendant sought to prevent the removal of his horse and wagon from the street. The defendant, who contended that, as a traveller, he had a right to remain there, excepted to refusals to order a verdict of not guilty, to give instructions predicated upon the hypothesis that he was at the time a traveller, and also to give other instructions which were given in substance. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-12\">Complaint to the Police Court of Fitchburg, alleging that the defendant, \u201con the 26th day of July, in the year eighteen hundred and ninety, at Fitchburg, in said county, in and upon the body of Jos. T. Battles, he being then and there one of the constables, watchmen, and police officers of said Fitchburg, legally authorized and duly qualified to discharge and perform the duties of said office, and also being then and there in the due and lawful execution of the same, and also being then and there in the peace of said Commonwealth, did make an assault, and him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the said Joseph T. Battles, did then and there heat, bruise, and wound, and in due and lawful execution of his said office did then and there unlawfully, knowingly, and designedly obstruct, hinder, and oppose, and other wrongs to the said Joseph T. Battles then and there did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-5\">In the Superior Court, on appeal, before the jury were impanelled, the defendant renewed a motion, made by him in the police court, to quash the complaint, on the ground that it did not sufficiently set forth the time when the alleged offence was committed, in that the day of the month was expressed in Arabic figures. Dunbar, J., overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-6\">At the trial there was evidence tending to show that, on July 26, 1890, Joseph T. Battles, who was a police officer of Fitchburg, had been specially detailed, in anticipation of a parade in the .streets by a circus, to keep the streets clear of obstructions, and was engaged in this service at the time of the alleged assault; that he had been instructed by Captain Wheeler, of the police force of the city, to look out for teams and keep the street clear for the procession, and went ahead of the procession for the purpose of carrying out these instructions; that Captain Wheeler had received instructions from the chief of police to the same effect; that, as Battles came down a street several rods in advance of the procession, he saw the defendant with his horse and wagon standing about one hundred feet in front of him upon the left hand side of the street; that they stood up close to the sidewalk, and the defendant was by his horse\u2019s head ; that Battles warned the defendant by motions to remove his team, but the defendant, who knew that Battles was an officer, did not move ; and that thereupon the officer attempted to remove the team and was resisted by the defendant, who struck him and succeeded in preventing him from removing the team before the procession came up. There was no evidence that the municipal authorities had given the circus a right to parade in the streets, or taken any action with reference to clearing the streets or the passing of vehicles during the parade, except an existing ordinance of the city, which provided that the chief of police \u201c shall take notice of all nuisances, impediments, and obstructions in the streets of the city, and shall remove the same, or take all proper action in relation thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The defendant asked the judge to rule that there was a variance, and that under this complaint, alleging an assault upon Jos. T. Battles, the defendant could not be convicted of an assault upon Joseph T. Battles. The judge declined so to rule, and the defendant excepted. The defendant also asked the judge to give the following rulings, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">\u201c 1. If the defendant was a traveller upon the highway, and stopped in front of a store for the purpose of trading, and, seeing the circus procession approaching, stood by his horse\u2019s head for the purpose of holding his horse and to prevent him from being frightened, he did not thereby cease to be a traveller on the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">2. If the defendant, being a traveller upon the street, was properly and peaceably holding his horse at the side of the street while the procession was passing, he was not obliged to remove his horse from the street at the command of the police officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">3. If the defendant, being a traveller upon the street, was properly and peaceably holding his horse at the side of the street during the passing of the procession, the police officer had no right, against the objection of the defendant, to remove the defendant\u2019s team from the street, and if the defendant did nothing more than to hold on to his horse to prevent the removal of his team, then the jury would not be justified in finding him guilty, under this complaint. 4. The police officer was not in the lawful execution of his office if he attempted to remove the defendant\u2019s horse and carriage from the street against the objection of the defendant, and the defendant had the right to hold on to his horse to prevent such removal. 5. If the defendant was properly and peaceably holding his horse at the side of the street, the police officer had no right, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to remove his team from the street in order to make way for a circus procession which was parading the street, without any special license or- authority. 6. The fact that the defendant was on the left side of the street has no effect upon this complaint, and gave the officer no right to interfere with the defendant nor with his team. 7. That the jury be instructed to return a verdict of not guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-8\">The judge declined to give any of these rulings as requested, but after instructions, to which no exception was taken, as to what would constitute an assault and battery, further instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the jury as follows: \u201c As I have previously said to you, it is necessary to show that the officer was in the due and lawful exercise of his duty. Of this there is a question. It is necessary also to show that Smith knew what was required of him, and by whom, and, as I have before told you, that Battles was an officer. Whether the officer was in the due and lawful exercise of his duty depends upon the right of the defendant to make such use of the street as he was making. Upon that question I instruct you that the streets and highways are laid out for travellers. They are not for spectators, if by being spectators they obstruct the highway. The right of the public in a highway is coextensive with the limits of such highway. A traveller upon the highway does not necessarily cease to be a traveller because he stops his team and alights from it temporarily, nor does he necessarily become an obstruction in so doing. Whether in any case he has ceased to be a traveller, or has become an obstruction, is ordinarily a question of fact depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. A traveller may stop upon a highway a reasonable time for a reasonable purpose. And what is a reasonable purpose and a reasonable time also depend upon the circumstances. It might seem to you, for instance, that a man driving upon a county road upon which there was little travel, and when there was no reason to apprehend that he would interfere with others who were lawfully using the way, would not be making an unreasonable use of the highway if he stopped his horse and alighted from his carriage to pick berries growing by the side of the way ; while you might take a very different view of the reasonableness of the action of a man who should stop his team in the midst of a crowded street of a city thronged with other travellers, whose lawful use of the street he thereby impeded, merely to gaze from curiosity at some object he saw in a window or upon the street. The Commonwealth claims that Smith was making an unreasonable use of the highway, and had ceased to be a traveller. Was he at the time in question a traveller? If his stop was a reasonable one, he was, and the officer had no right to interfere. If it was not, the officer had the right to remove his team, after Smith\u2019s unreasonable refusal to do so, by the use of such force as was necessary and reasonable to accomplish such removal. If the officer exceeded that force he was a trespasser, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>and Smith had the right to defend his team by reasonable and necessary force as against an unjust aggressor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">The defendant excepted to the refusal of the judge to give the rulings requested; but saved no exception to the rulings as given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions, which were allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-7\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUB\">The defendant moved to quash this complaint because \u201cit did not sufficiently set forth the time when the alleged offence was committed, the day of the month being expressed in Arabic figures.\u201d The time when the offence was committed is described in the complaint as \u201c on the 26th day of July, in the year eighteen hundred and ninety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The English statutes of 4 Geo. II. c. 26, and of 6 Geo. II. c. 14, did not extend to the Colonies, and all writs, processes, declarations, indictments, etc., in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, long before the passage of these statutes were required by a provincial statute to be \u201cin the English tongue and no other,\u201d if indeed by reason of the usage prevailing in the Colony and Province any statute was necessary. Prov. St. 1701-2, c. 5, \u00a7 1, 1 Prov. Laws, (State ed.) 464. The provincial acts of 1692-98, c. 33, \u00a7 13, 1697,- c. 9, \u00a7 11, and 1699-1700, c. 4, \u00a7 6, 1 Prov. Laws, (State ed.) 75, 287, 374, contained a similar provision, but these acts had been disallowed by the Privy Council. The English decisions, therefore, upon the use of Arabic figures when indictments were in the Latin language, or such decisions under the peculiar language of the English statutes, are not directly applicable to indictments and complaints in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLoon, </em>5 Gray, 91, it was decided that a complaint which charged the defendant with unlawfully selling intoxicating liquors \u201c on the fifteenth day of July, 1855,\u201d was insufficient, and it was said that \u201c to make the allegation of time in the indictment [complaint] against the defendant sufficient, there should, at all events, have been words, or at least letters, which have acquired an established use in the English language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>so added to or connected with the figures contained in it, as to describe or indicate with certainty the era to which it was intended that they should refer. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>4 Cush. 596.\u201d The court declined to express any opinion whether it was sufficient \u201c to describe the time by the use of numeral letters or figures,\u201d or whether it \u201c must be expressed in words written out at full length.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>14 Gray, 37, the time was described in the complaint as \u201c on the fourteenth day of December in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty eight,\u201d and this was held sufficient, the court construing the word \u201c year \u201d to mean \u201c the year of our Lord.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>11, Allen, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In a g'eneral sense, the Arabic signs for expressing number are now a part of the English language, and we think that by the weight of authority in this country it must be held that the allegation of time in this complaint is sufficient, although it is undoubtedly the better practice in criminal pleading to write out in words at length the day of the month, and the year, when time is alleged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hagarman, </em>10 Allen, 401. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>35 Maine, 489. <em>State </em>v. <em>Seamons, </em>1 Greene, (Iowa,) 418. <em>State v. Raiford, </em>7 Porter, 101. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>Peck, 165. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodgeden, </em>3 Vt. 481. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuller, </em>34 Conn. 280. 1 Bish. Crim. Proc. (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 344-346, 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The complaint charges the defendant with making an assault \u201c in and upon the body of Jos. T. Battles.\u201d The evidence was that the name of the person assaulted was \u201c Joseph T. Battles.\u201d The defendant asked the court to rule \u201c that there was a variance, a.nd that under this complaint alleging an assault upon Jos. T. Battles the defendant could not be convicted of an assault upon Joseph T. Battles.\u201d The name of the person assaulted occurs three times in the complaint. The complaint charges that the defendant \u201cin and upon the body of Jos. T. Battles . . . . . did make an assault, and him, the said Joseph T. Battles, did then and there beat, bruise, and wound, .... and other wrongs to the said Joseph T. Battles then and there did.\u201d We think that it appears by the complaint itself that the name of the person assaulted was Joseph T. Battles, and that \u201c Jos.\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201c Joseph,\u201d and that the court rightly refused to rule that there was a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>It appears from the exceptions that Battles, who was a police officer, \u201c had been especially detailed to attend to keeping the streets clear of obstructions, and was engaged upon this service at the time of the alleged assault,\u201d under instructions given by Captain Wheeler, and received from the chief of police, and that by an ordinance of the city of Fitchburg, it was provided that the chief of police \u201c shall take notice of all nuisances, impediments, and obstructions in the streets of the city, and shall remove the same, or take all proper action in relation thereto.\u201d It has not been conten ded that the city council had not authority to pass such an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Of the first three requests for instructions, it may be said that they are all predicated upon the hypothesis that the defendant was, at the time of the alleged assault, a traveller, and had the rights of a traveller with a horse and wagon upon the street. The court in effect ruled that, if he was a traveller at that time, the officer had no right to interfere with him. The fourth and fifth requests for instructions ought not to have been given, if the defendant with his horse and wagon was not at the time a traveller, and they were an obstruction in the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The fact that the defendant\u2019s horse and wagon were upon the left side of the street was, in the charge of the court, apparently considered as immaterial, except so far as it might tend to show whether the defendant was using the street as a traveller with a horse and wagon, or as a place to leave his horse and wagon in while he amused himself by watching the procession. The court left it to the jury to say whether the defendant was a traveller, and was making a reasonable use of the highway under all the circumstances shown, and instructed them that, \u201cif his [the defendant\u2019s] stop was a reasonable one, he was \u201d a traveller, \u201c and the officer had no right to interfere,\u201d and that, if he was not a traveller, the officer had a right to remove the horse and wagon, using no more force than was necessary, if the defendant on request refused to remove them. No exception was taken to these rulings, the only exceptions being to the refusal to give the rulings requested, and these, we think, were either given in substance, or ought not to have been given in the form in which they were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
