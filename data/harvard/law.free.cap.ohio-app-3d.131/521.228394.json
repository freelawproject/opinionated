Seventy-Seven Health Spa, appeals a decision of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas affirming defendantappellee Austintown Township\u2019s decision to revoke appellant\u2019s permit to operate a massage establishment in Austintown Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">On April 29, 1996, Boualaphana Sithavong, an employee of appellant, was arrested by the Austintown Township Police Department on a charge of soliciting in violation of R.C. 2907.24, a third-degree misdemeanor. Sithavong\u2019s case was assigned to Mahoning County Court No. 4. On May 20, 1996, Sithavong entered into a plea agreement, stipulating to a finding of guilty to attempted soliciting in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2907.24. On May 28, 1996, the Austintown trustees revoked appellant\u2019s license to operate a massage establishment pursuant to R.C. 503.44 and Section 4, Paragraph E of the Austintown Township Resolution regarding the denial or revocation of permits. On May 30, 1996, Sithavong\u2019s counsel filed a motion for acquittal in Mahoning County Court No. 4, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">On June 3, 1996, appellant appealed appellee\u2019s decision- to revoke appellant\u2019s license to the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his appeal to the common pleas court, appellant named Austintown Township, the individual trustees and the police chief as defendants, all of whom are appellees in this appeal. Appellant alleged that the revocation was unconstitutional, contrary to law, and invalid. On August 22, 1997, a magistrate\u2019s decision was entered affirming the township\u2019s decision to revoke appellant\u2019s permit to operate a massage establishment. On September 3, 1997, appellant filed a notice of appeal to this court regarding the August 22, 1997 decision of the magistrate. On September 18, 1997, the appeal was <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed by this court for lack of jurisdiction due to the fact that the magistrate\u2019s decision was not a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">On September 10, 1997, appellant filed an \u201cObjection to [the] Magistrate\u2019s Decision and Motion for Leave to File Specifics of Objection.\u201d No further filings on behalf of appellant are in the record prior to the trial court\u2019s October 20, 1997 judgment entry, adopting the decision of the magistrate as its own. On October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>28, 1997, appellant timely appealed the October 20, 1997 decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">On March 11,1998, appellees filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal due to appellant\u2019s failure to file specific written objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On April 27, 1998, this court issued a journal entry stating that the motion to dismiss would be considered along with the merits of this appeal. On April 29, 1998, appellant filed a motion in opposition to appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">On appeal, appellees filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal due to appellant\u2019s failure to file specific written objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Appellees cite Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b), <em>United States v. Walters </em>(C.A.6, 1981), 638 F.2d 947, and <em>Thomas v. Arn </em>(1985), 474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435, for the proposition that the failure to do so operates as a waiver on appeal of the issues that could have been raised by objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Appellant states that on September 10, 1997, appellant filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision and motion for leave to file specifics of.objection. Appellant goes on to argue that the court of common pleas did not grant appellant leave to file said objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Appellant also attempts to distinguish <em>Thomas, supra, </em>from the case <em>sub judice. </em>Appellant argues <em>Thomas </em>requires \u201cclear notice\u201d of the need to file objections and that, in this case, clear notice was not given as the magistrate\u2019s decision did not indicate that failure to specifically object to it would waive the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Civ.R. 53(E)(3) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u201c(a) <em>Time for Filing. </em>Within fourteen days of the filing of a magistrate\u2019s decision, a party may file written objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. If any party timely files objections, any other party may also file objections not later than ten days after the first objections are filed. If a party makes a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law under Civ.R. 52, the time for filing objections begins to run when the magistrate files a decision including findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">\u201c(b) <em>Form of Objections. </em>Objections shall be specific and state with particularity the grounds of objection. If the parties stipulate in writing that the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact shall be final, they may object only to errors of law in the magistrate\u2019s decision. Any objection to a finding of fact shall be supported by a transcript of all of the evidence submitted to the magistrate relevant to that fact or an affidavit of that evidence if a transcript is not available. A party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any finding of fact or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>conclusion of law unless the party has objected to that finding or conclusion under this rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Civ.R. 53(4)(a) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u201c(4) <em>Court\u2019s action on magistrate\u2019s decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u201c(a) <em>When effective. </em>The magistrate\u2019s decision shall be effective when adopted by the court. The court may adopt the magistrate\u2019s decision if no written objections are filed unless it determines that there is an error of law or other defect on the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Appellant failed to file specific objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision with the trial court. Therefore, the trial court was permitted to adopt the magistrate\u2019s decision \u201cunless it determine^] that there is an error of law or other defect on the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The magistrate\u2019s decision stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\u201cOn May 20, 1996, one of the plaintiffs employee\u2019s [sic] was found guilty in Mahoning County Court No. 4 on an amended charge of attempted soliciting in violation of R.C. 2923.02 (attempt) of R.C. 2907.24 (soliciting to engage in sexual activity for hire).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\"><em>a </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">\u201cWhether or not the County Court was correct in its ruling that attempted soliciting is a criminal offense, the ruling and conviction stand. No appeal was taken from the conviction and sentence. No appeal was taken on the court\u2019s decision(s) denying the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal or to vacate the conviction. The plaintiffs argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\"><em>&lt;( </em>sfc j|\u00ed sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">\u201cThe plaintiffs employee\u2019s conviction for attempted solicitation of a sexual act, as prohibited by -R.C. 2907.24 is a conclusive fact. If, as the plaintiff contends, there is no such crime, as held in <em>State of Ohio v. Anderson </em>(1979), 62 Ohio Misc. 1 [16 O.O.3d 185, 404 N.E.2d 176], then as held in that same case she was guilty of solicitation because the court stated that R.C. 2907.24 includes an attempted solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">\u201cMoreover, attempted solicitation of a sexual act is conduct prohibited under R.C. 503.42 and is grounds for the revocation of the license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">The essence of appellant\u2019s appeal is that there is no such crime as attempted solicitation. This claim involves a question of a clear error of law or other defect on the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision and the trial court\u2019s improper adoption thereof. Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s appeal is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Appellant\u2019s Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Appellant sets forth two assignments of error which both involve the application of Sithavong\u2019s \u201cattempted soliciting\u201d plea to the revocation of appellant\u2019s permit. In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he states:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u201cThe court erred when it found that the defendants-appellees properly revoked the permit of plaintiff-appellant pursuant to ORC Section 503.44 for a violation of ORC Sections 2923.02 and 2907.24.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Appellant argues that pursuant to the Austintown Township ordinance and R.C. 503.44, appellant\u2019s permit could only be revoked if any one of the persons named on the application was convicted of any violation of R.C. Chapter 2907, or a similar municipal ordinance. Appellant states that although charged with a violation of R.C. 2907.24, appellant\u2019s employee, Sithavong, was found guilty of violating R.C. 2923.02.-</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Appellees argue that the trial court did not err in upholding the township\u2019s revocation of appellant\u2019s permit. Appellees state that the judgment entry regarding appellant\u2019s employee, Sithavong, shows that she was found guilty of violating both R.C. 2923.02 and 2907.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">R.C. 503.44 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\u201cIf a board of township trustees has adopted a resolution under section 503.41 of the Revised Code, it shall deny any application for a permit to operate a massage establishment or revoke a previously issued permit, for any of the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\"><em>U </em>* \u2021 \u00ed]\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">\u201c(D) Any one of the persons named on the application has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Chapter 2907 of the Revised Code, or violation of any municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to any offense contained in Chapter 2907. of the Revised Code, within five years preceding the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The relevant Austintown Township Ordinance states:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">\u201cSection 4. Denial or revocation of permit. (As set forth in O.R.C. 503.44).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">\u201cThe board of township trustees shall deny any application for a permit to operate a massage establishment or revoke a previously issued permit for any of the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\"><em>U </em>tjs <em>t$\u00a1 </em>ifc</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">\u201cD. Any one of the persons named on the application has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Chapter 2907 of the Revised Code, or violation of any municipal ordinance, in Ohio, that is substantially equivalent to any offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>contained in Chapter 2907 of the Revised Code within five years preceding the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The judgment entry evidencing the plea agreement of appellant\u2019s employee, Sithavong, states that she pled no contest, waived the introduction of evidence, and stipulated to a finding of guilty to the charge of attempted soliciting, a fourth-degree misdemeanor, a violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2907.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">There is no such crime as attempted solicitation in the state of Ohio. R.C. 2907.25 (prostitution) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u201c(A) No person shall engage in sexual activity for hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u201c(B) Whoever violates this section is guilty of prostitution, a misdemeanor of the third degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">R.C. 2907.24 (soliciting) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u201c(A) No person shall solicit another to engage with such other person in sexual activity for hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u00ab $ * \u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">\u201c(C)(1) Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of soliciting, a misdemeanor of the third degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">R.C. 2923.02 (attempt) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">\u201c(A) No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">In <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1979), 62 Ohio Misc. 1, 16 O.O.3d 185, 404 N.E.2d 176, the Toledo Municipal Court was confronted with the issue of whether attempted solicitation was a chargeable offense in the state of Ohio. In analyzing the above statutes, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">\u201cIt is * * * clear that R.C. 2907.24(A) (soliciting) prohibits the act of \u2018soliciting\u2019 someone to engage in that activity which is prohibited by R.C. 2907.25 (prostitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">\u201cIn reading the two statutes together it can hardly be argued that one who is actually soliciting another person to engage in sexual activity for hire is not in fact attempting to so engage in sexual activity for hire. It necessarily follows therefore, that, as proposed by the defendant, the offense of \u2018soliciting\u2019 is in fact an attempt to engage in the offense of \u2018prostitution.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">\u201cAs was stated above, however, the offense of \u2018soliciting\u2019 is in itself offensive and does in fact stand on its own as a separate offense. It is important here to examine R.C. 2923.02, the \u2018attempt\u2019 statute, which deals with \u2018 * * * conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in * * * [an] offense\u2019. Unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>activity specifically prohibited by the \u2018soliciting\u2019 statute, there are any number of actions by individuals that could be subjectively construed by law enforcement officers as conduct which, if successful, could constitute or result in an offense of \u2018soliciting,\u2019 but which actions by themselves would not be unlawful or offensive. To permit the prosecution of such actions could conceivably subject certain citizens to arrest at the whim of a policeman for such things as standing on a street corner or waving at a passing car. This is clearly beyond the scope of constitutional permissibility and contrary to the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u201cTherefore, for the reasons stated herein, this court finds defendant\u2019s motion well taken and grants same. The complaint is hereby ordered dismissed and the defendant is discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">We agree with the reasoning as set forth by the Toledo Municipal Court. Solicitation is an attempt to engage in the offense of prostitution. To permit \u201cattempted soliciting\u201d would make it a crime to attempt to attempt to engage in the offense of prostitution. We therefore find that there can be no such offense as \u201cattempted solicitation\u201d under existing Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Furthermore, the magistrate\u2019s statement that appellant\u2019s argument is without merit because \u201cno appeal was taken on the court\u2019s decision(s) denying the defendant\u2019s [Sithavong\u2019s] motion for acquittal or to vacate the conviction\u201d is also misplaced. Appellant was not a party to Sithavong\u2019s criminal proceeding, and hence, had no standing to appeal her conviction. Consequently, appellant cannot be bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is with merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">In their second assignment of error, appellant argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">\u201cThe court erred in finding that the trustees were correct in revoking plaintiff-appellant\u2019s permit when there is no such offense as attempted soliciting, ORC 2923.02.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Appellant cites <em>Anderson, </em>62 Ohio Misc. 1, 16 O.O.3d 185, 404 N.E.2d 176, for the proposition that an offense of soliciting under R.C. 2907.24 necessarily constitutes an attempt to commit an offense of prostitution under R.C. 2907.25, and therefore there can be no such offense as attempted soliciting under the general attempt statute, R.C. 2923.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">Appellees argue that assuming <em>arguendo </em>that appellant is correct that there is no offense known as \u201cattempted solicitation,\u201d the conviction was not appealed and remains on record. Additionally, appellees argue that the judgment entry shows that the appellant\u2019s employee was found guilty of both R.C. 2923.02 and 2907.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The May 20, 1996 judgment entry pertaining to Sithavong states that she was found guilty of \u201cattempted soliciting M-4.\u201d Appellant is correct in the assertion that the attempt statute cannot be used with the soliciting statute to charge an offense of \u201cattempted soliciting\u201d as a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, since the offense of soliciting necessarily constitutes an attempt to commit prostitution. See Assignment of Error One.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The decision of the trial court is hereby reversed and the township\u2019s revocation set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b561-8\">Waite, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b561-9\">Cox, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\">. R.C. 2506.01 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\u201cEvery final order, adjudication, or decision of any officer, tribunal, authority, board, bureau, commission, department, or other division of any political subdivision of the state may be reviewed by the court of common pleas of the county in which the principal office of the political subdivision is located as provided in Chapter 2505 of the Revised Code, except as modified by this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b561-10\">Cox, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AA0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">While I concur with the discussion and ruling of the majority in this case, I would also reverse the trial court\u2019s decision revoking appellant\u2019s permit to operate a massage establishment on another ground. Although this issue was not specifically raised as an assignment of error, I would <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue that R.C. 503.44 clearly provides for the revocation of a permit when <em>any one of the persons named on the application </em>has been convicted of or pled guilty to any violation set forth in R.C. Chapter 2907. There was no evidence in the record to indicate that appellant\u2019s employee, who was found guilty of a violation of R.C. 2907.24, was named on the application. Therefore, the requirements of R.C. 503.44 were not met and the trial court erred in revoking appellant\u2019s permit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
