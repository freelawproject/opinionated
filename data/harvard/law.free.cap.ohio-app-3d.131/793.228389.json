Appellee received custody of their only child, Joshua, and appellant was ordered to pay child support. In 1995, appellant and appellee entered into an \u201cagreed order,\u201d which was filed in the Greenup Circuit Court. The order specifically provided that \u201cthere are no child support arrearages due and owing\u201d and that \u201call child support payments by [appellant] to [appellee] shall cease.\u201d The order granted custody to the appellant, but is silent as to appellee\u2019s obligations to pay child support. In 1996, appellant initiated a proceeding in Ohio under R.C. Chapter 3115,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (\u201cURESA\u201d), seeking to establish an order of child support. The Scioto County Court of Common Pleas ultimately found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the URESA petition, and granted the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it determined that jurisdiction to establish a support order lies exclusively with Kentucky. We review the determination of subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo, </em>without any deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>McClure v. McClure </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 76, 694 N.E.2d 515, citing <em>Burns v. Daily </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 693, 683 N.E.2d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">This c\u00e1se requires us to decide whether an Ohio court has subject-matter jurisdiction under URESA to establish a support order when a Kentucky court\u2019s order changing custody of the child is silent on the issue of support to be paid to the parent receiving custody. We conclude that it does. First, we note that the agreed order did not set the amount of child support as \u201czero.\u201d If it had, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>appellant\u2019s petition would have asked the trial court to modify an existing support order. Ohio courts do not have subject-matter jurisdiction to modify support obligations set forth in initiating state\u2019s orders. See <em>McClure </em>at 80, 694 N.E.2d at 517-518, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The syllabus in <em>Haskins v. Bronzetti </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 202, 594 N.E.2d 582, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">\u201cA nonresident custodial parent has a right to pursue an action for child support against the noncustodial parent in a court of competent jurisdiction in this state when the noncustodial parent is a resident of Ohio and the parties\u2019 foreign divorce decree and child custody order do not address the issue of support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Absent express language to the contrary in the foreign order, a parent has an obligation to provide support for the issue of the marriage. <em>Linville v. Marshall </em>(Mar. 1, 1995), Hamilton App. No. C-940129, unreported, 1995 WL 84075. Ohio courts can suspend this obligation only upon clear and unambiguous language in a decree. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, where a decree is silent as to support, URESA confers subject-matter jurisdiction to establish a support order. <em>Id.; 2 </em>Sowald &amp; Morganstern, Domestic Relations Law (1997), 48-9, Section 23.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction to establish a child support order because the agreed order was silent as to that issue. It may ultimately decide that no support is warranted, but that is a separate matter. Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s only assignment of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b828-10\">Peter B. Ajbele and Kline, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-12\">. R.C. Chapter 3115 has since been completely revised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
