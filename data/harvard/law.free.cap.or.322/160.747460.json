Petitioners are electors who, in a timely manner, submitted written comments about the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title, pursuant to ORS 250.067(1). Accordingly, petitioners are entitled to seek a.different title in this court. ORS 250.085(2). Most of the arguments that petitioners make differ from the comments that they made during the administrative process, but those arguments in several respects \u201cconcem[] language added to or removed from the draft title after expiration of the comment period provided in ORS 250.067.\u201d ORS 250.085(6). We consider both the arguments that correspond to the ones presented in writing to the Secretary of State and those relating to new wording chosen after the close of the comment period. We modify the ballot title in certain respects and, as modified, certify it to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The proposed initiative measure would add the following new subsections to Article IV, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201c(6) The initiative and referendum powers of the people shall not be restricted except by the use of the initiative power. Other than provisions enacted by the use of the initiative power, all constitutional or statutory provisions pertaining to the initiative or referendum power or process enacted after March 30, 1995 shall be without effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201c(7) Any administrative rule or action shall employ the least restrictive means necessary to allow the people to exercise the initiative or referendum power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">For that measure, the Attorney General certified this ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: REMOVES LEGISLATURE\u2019S POWER TO PROPOSE RESTRICTING INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall constitution remove legislature\u2019s authority to refer constitutional restrictions on initiative, referendum powers to voters, and to regulate those powers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends constitution. Legislature now may adopt statutes on people\u2019s initiative, referendum powers not inconsistent with constitution. Legislature also may refer proposed constitutional changes in those powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>to voters. Measure would remove legislature\u2019s power to refer such constitutional amendments to voters, and to enact laws pertaining to initiative or referendum. Measure nullifies any constitutional or statutoxy provisions pertaining to initiative or referendum enacted after March 30, 1995, except through initiative. Administrative rules, actions must use least restrictive means necessary so people may exercise initiative or referendum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">This court reviews that ballot title for \u201csubstantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035 and 250.039.\u201d ORS 250.085(5) (1993). <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 250.035(l)(a) (1993) required that a ballot title contain a \u201ccaption of not more than 10 words which reasonably identifies the subject of the measure.\u201d ORS 250.035(l)(b) (1993) required that a ballot title also contain a \"question of not more than 20 words which plainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure.\u201d ORS 250.035(l)(c) (1993) required that a ballot title contain a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d Finally, ORS 250.039 (1993) required that a ballot title meet \u201ca standard of minimum readability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">With respect to the Caption, petitioners argue that it is too narrow to identify reasonably the subject of the measure. Specifically, they contend that the proposed measure does more than remove the legislature\u2019s authority in the future to refer constitutional restrictions on the initiative and referendum to the voters. For example, they point out, the measure also would nullify any constitutional or statutory provisions pertaining to the initiative or referendum enacted after March 30, 1995, xinless those provisions themselves resulted from an initiative. Petitioners also assert that the measure would prevent the legislature from changing the process, as well as the power, of the initiative and referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The Attorney General responds that the more specific alternative that he has chosen complies substantially with the statutory mandate to identify the subject of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>proposed measure, because it \u201cfocuses precisely on how the measure would change the current constitution.\u201d We agree that the proposed measure removes \u201can existing legislative power (and thereby also remov[es] the people\u2019s power to approve a referendum proposed by the legislature).\u201d But we disagree that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title conveys the full scope of the proposed measure. Even if some aspects of the proposed measure are redundant of existing constitutional provisions, as the Attorney General argues, the subject of the concededly nonredundant portions is not conveyed sufficiently to meet the statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Based on the text of the proposed measure, we agree with petitioners that the Caption fails to identify reasonably the measure\u2019s subject. Accordingly, we modify the Caption. In addition, we make conforming changes to the Question.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Summary, however, complies substantially with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">One of the petitioners also brings a readability challenge. We conclude that it is not possible to improve the readability of the ballot title significantly, because the key terms of the proposed measure, which must be included in order to convey its scope to voters, are long words: <em>e.g., </em>constitution, initiative, referendum, and legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">We certify the following ballot title for use with the proposed initiative measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: REGULATE INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM POWERS, PROCESSES ONLY BY INITIATIVE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">QUESTION: Shall constitution forbid regulating initiative, referendum powers, processes except by initiative; nullify such provisions if enacted after March 30, 1995?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">SUMMARY: Amends constitution. Legislature now may adopt statutes on people\u2019s initiative, referendum powers not inconsistent with constitution. Legislature also may refer proposed constitutional changes in those powers to voters. Measure would remove legislature\u2019s power to refer such constitutional amendments to voters, and to enact laws pertaining to initiative and referendum. Measure nullifies any constitutional or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>statutory provisions pertaining to initiative or referendum enacted after March 30, 1995, except through initiative. Administrative rules, actions must use least restrictive means necessary so people may exercise initiative, referendum power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Ballot title certified as modified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(9).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> The 1995 legislature amended ORS 250.035 and repealed ORS 250.039. Or Laws 1995, ch 534, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 19. Those changes, however, do not apply to the ballot title in this case. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 20(l)(a) (act applies to initiative petitions for which prospective petition is filed on or after effective date of act). The prospective petition in this case was filed before the effective date of the 1995 act, July 7,1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b202-5\">UNIS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ac-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">I adhere to my view that, to the extent that ORS 250.085(5) (1993) gives this court jurisdiction to draft and certify a ballot title for a proposed initiative measure that is different than the one certified by the Attorney General, that statute violates the principle of separation of powers embodied in Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #13), </em>322 Or 15, 55, 902 P2d 1143 (1995) (Unis, J., dissenting). I would, therefore, dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
