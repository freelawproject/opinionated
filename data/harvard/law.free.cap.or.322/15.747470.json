Petitioner Lon T. Mabon is a chief petitioner for the measure. He submitted timely written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the draft ballot title and thereby preserved the right to reiterate those positions in this challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title. ORS 250.067(1), 250.085(2). Petitioners Daniel A. Rooney and Julie Davis (hereafter collectively \u201cRooney\u201d) also have complied with the statutory requirements. Both Mabon and Rooney challenge the Attorney General\u2019s certified Caption, Question, and Summary for the ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Before turning to the merits of the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the adequacy of the Attorney General\u2019s wording of the ballot title, we consider three threshold issues. The first two pertain to the fact that Lon T. Mabon is a chief petitioner for four separate ballot measures, all of which relate to the same general subjects and use text that is often similar or identical,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> designated by the Secretary of State as Elections Division numbers 13, 17, 21, and 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\u2019S POSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">As noted, the petitions at issue in this consolidated case concern Elections Division #13. During oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to this court, one of the counsel for Mabon informed us that a total of eight proposed measures had been submitted to the Secretary of State, but that the chief petitioners intended to circulate no more than one of the measures for signatures. That statement later was clarified, however, during oral argument in the challenge to the ballot title for Elections Division #17, when another counsel informed us that the chief petitioners intend to circulate for signatures one <em>or more of </em>the remaining proposed measures (by that time reduced in number to four), once the ballot title preparation and challenge process is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The Attorney General argues that an opinion by this court concerning this or any of the three other challenged ballot titles<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would constitute an advisory opinion, for which the court lacks constitutional authority, and that the court therefore should refuse to certify any ballot title. When initially made, that argument was based on the factual premise that the chief petitioners intended to circulate one of four (or, perhaps, one of eight) proposed measures for signatures and the consequent legal assertion that the existence of a justi-ciable case or controversy as to <em>any </em>of the cases was, therefore, speculative. As noted above, however, various counsel for the chief petitioner have since left open the possibility that the chief petitioner may circulate <em>all </em>the measures presently before the court. The real possibility that the chief petitioner will circulate each of the proposed measures for signatures negates the legal and factual premises of the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d theory. It is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">ROONEY\u2019S POSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Rooney asserts that the court should either (1) impose a sanction against Mabon for misuse of the ballot title process; (2) require the chief petitioners to identify which proposed measure or measures they intend to circulate, before the court will issue a decision in any of the four pending cases; or (3) certify an identical ballot title for each measure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We consider those contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Rooney first asserts that the submission by the chief petitioner of multiple measures on the same general subject is an abuse of the initiative process, because what the chief petitioner really is doing is shopping for a ballot title: He can review the ballot titles certified for each of the proposed measures and circulate the measure with the ballot title most to his liking. Rooney relies on the court\u2019s \u201cinherent\u201d authority to impose sanctions to protect the integrity of the judicial process from such abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We have some difficulty with Rooney\u2019s premise. Rooney does not point to any way \u2014 and we know of none \u2014 in which the chief petitioner has failed to comply with the statutes pertaining to the initiative process. Assuming (without deciding) that Rooney is correct in labeling the chief petitioner\u2019s sponsorship of multiple proposed measures as a shopping expedition, that expedition does not appear to violate the ballot title preparation and certification process, of which this court\u2019s judicial review is merely one part. It may be that the next legislature will wish to consider whether such activities by sponsors of initiative measures is an abuse that calls for some reform in the process but, at this time, the chief petitioner has done no more than the law permits. Assuming \u2014 again, without deciding \u2014 that we would have the authority to do so, we decline to consider imposing a sanction under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Rooney next asserts that the court should require the chief petitioners to disclose which proposed measure or measures they intend to circulate, before the court will certify a ballot title. That assertion is akin to the underlying contention made by the Attorney General regarding advisory opinions, <em>i.e., </em>it assumes that the court is being asked to render decisions regarding the ballot titles for some proposed measures that will never see the light of the signature-gathering day. That assertion also has the same factual and legal infirmities as the advisory opinion theory argued by the Attorney General and, similarly, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Attorney General has certified four differently worded ballot titles for the four proposed measures. Rooney\u2019s final argument, before addressing the merits, is that application of ORS 250.035(2) should lead to the certification of the <em>same </em>ballot title for each of the four pending measures. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">\u201cThe ballot title shall not resemble, so far as probably to create confusion, any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">As a general proposition, our task in ballot title review cases, pursuant to ORS 250.085(5),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is to determine whether the Attorney General\u2019s decision to certify a <em>particular </em>ballot title for a <em>particular </em>proposed measure constitutes \u201csubstantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035.\u201d In the present cases, however, in which the four proposed measures all deal with the same topic, Rooney essentially is asking us to hold that substantial compliance with ORS 250.035(2) would require the Attorney General to certify the same ballot title for each of the pending measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">To discern the legislative intent behind a statute, we look first to the statute\u2019s text and context and, if the legislature\u2019s intent is clear from that inquiry, then we look no further. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). ORS 250.035(2) starts from the unexceptional premise, implicit in its text and consistent with the overall statutory context, that a proposed initiative measure will receive a ballot title. <em>See </em>ORS 250.035(1) (form of ballot title of any initiated measure); ORS 250.065, 250.067, and 250.085 (procedures for preparation and certification of ballot title).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Assuming for the purpose of discussion that all the proposed measures are identical in material respects (as Rooney asserts is the case),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there are three conceivable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>permutations of ORS 250.035(2) when it comes to certifying ballot titles for the measures: (1) the statute requires certifying the same ballot title for each measure; (2) the statute requires certifying different ballot titles for each measure; or (3) the Attorney General can comply substantially with the statute by certifying the same ballot titles, similar ballot titles, or different ballot titles, depending on the measures and recognizing the possibility that more than one of the choices may constitute substantial compliance in a given situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The first permutation, <em>viz., </em>certifying the same ballot title for all, is the obverse of the statutory text. The statute provides that ballot titles shall not resemble each other so far as to create confusion. The obverse of that proposition is that ballot titles shall resemble (or perhaps be identical with) each other to avoid confusion. There is, however, no support in the text or the context of the statute for a conclusion that the statute necessarily mandates its obverse. A fair inference from the statute is that a ballot title <em>may </em>resemble (or perhaps be identical with) another, if to do so probably will not create confusion, but the statute cannot support the construction that a ballot title <em>must </em>resemble or perhaps even be identical with another to avoid confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Neither is the second permutation, <em>viz., </em>different ballot titles are <em>always </em>required, contemplated by the statute. There is nothing in the statute\u2019s text or context to suggest that it requires a differently worded ballot title for a measure that is materially identical to another measure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">We turn to consider the third permutation. As noted above, one fair inference from the statute is that a ballot title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>may resemble (or perhaps be identical to) another, if it probably will not create confusion. And it follows easily from the text that a ballot title may be different from another, if it probably will not create confusion. That is, the overall statutory concern is with the probable creation of confusion, and the statutory mandate is that ballot titles shall not resemble each other so far as probably to create confusion. Thus, the permissible amount of resemblance between or among ballot titles in a given situation must be a function of that particular situation. The statute prescribes no one choice for all situations; indeed, more than one choice may satisfy the statute in any given situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The third permutation thus is consistent with the text and context of the statute; the other interpretive options are insupportable. We therefore hold that the Attorney General may comply with ORS 250.035(2) by certifying identical, similar, or different ballot titles for materially identical proposed measures, depending on the measures and recognizing that, in certain situations, more than one of those options may be an acceptable form of substantial compliance. Of course, the statute is not limited by its terms to situations in which the measures are materially identical. The statutory rule is the same, and the same principles regarding the prevention of confusion apply with equal force if the measures are not materially identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Having stated the proper office for ORS 250.035(2), our next task is to describe and then to implement a methodology that will enable us to certify ballot titles for the various measures pursuant to ORS 250.085, while taking both ORS 250.035(1) and (2) into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The nature of the inquiry under each of those statutory subsections, ORS 250.035(1) and (2), dictates the order in which they will be considered in a ballot title review proceeding. Under subsection (1), the focus is on the content of ballot titles for <em>individual </em>proposed measures. By contrast, the focus of subsection (2) is limited to situations in which there are at least two proposed ballot measures that necessitate a comparison of their respective ballot titles. It follows that, in performing our review function, we should proceed from the particular to the general, <em>i.e., </em>we first should focus on the requirements of subsection (1) with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>particular proposed measure before us. Although subsection (2) plays a role in the final analysis, comparison of ballot titles to determine whether they probably will create confusion comes second, not first. This is compelled not only by logic but by necessity. Neither the Attorney General nor this court can know or predict what proposed measures will be circulated, with what relative vigor signatures for those measures will be sought, or which measures actually will receive sufficient signatures to be placed on the ballot. The first responsibility of the Attorney General and the court to the electorate, therefore, is to ensure an accurate ballot title properly describing the individual measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Accordingly, we will proceed as follows to decide the ballot title challenges in the present case, along with those mounted with respect to Elections Division numbers 17, 21, and 25:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">1. In each case, we will perform an independent inquiry into the validity of the particular challenges made by petitioners, to determine whether the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">2. If the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title is not deficient in the particulars asserted by petitioners under the requirements of ORS 250.035(1), that ballot title will be changed thereafter only if it becomes necessary to do so to bring about substantial compliance with ORS 250.035(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">3. If the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title is deficient in one or more particulars asserted by petitioners, then the court will draft a ballot title that cures any defect. Thereafter, that ballot title will be changed only to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">4. Once the court has proceeded through steps 1 to 3 and has thus adjudicated the validity of all the particular claims under ORS 250.035(1) as to all the measures, then it will consider Rooney\u2019s contention that application of ORS 250.035(2) should result in the certification of the same ballot title for each of the measures. That discussion will be found at the conclusion of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>SEPARATION OF POWERS</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">In addition to the foregoing arguments, an issue arose at oral argument in this case, during colloquy between members of the court and counsel for the parties, concerning whether our ballot title review function offends the principle of separation of powers. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The separation of powers is required by Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cThe powers of the Government shall be divided into three seperate (sic) departments, the Legislative, the Executive, including the administrative, and the Judicial; <em>and no person charged with official duties under one of these departments, shall exercise any of the functions of another, except as in this Constitution expressly provided.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">(Emphasis supplied.) Clearly, the enactment by the people of initiative or referendum measures is a legislative act. Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 1 (\u201cThe legislative power of the state, except for the initiative and referendum powers reserved to the people, is vested in a Legislative Assembly.\u201d). But, concerning the initiative and referendum process, there is an express constitutional provision that allows the legislature to enlist the other branches of government. Article IV, section l(4)(b), of the Oregon Constitution, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201cInitiative and referendum measures shall be submitted to the people as provided in this section <em>and by law not inconsistent therewith.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Although the Oregon Constitution does not require the preparation of ballot titles, we shall assume, for the purposes of this case, that the preparation of a ballot title is a legislative function. It is obvious that such ballot titles can significantly enhance the initiative and referendum process by helping voters to inform themselves, on as objective a basis as possible, concerning the nature of the measures before them. The ballot title process, including the judicial review portions of that process, thus is a part of the legislature\u2019s response to the power conferred on it by Article IV, section l(4)(b), to enact laws governing the initiative and referendum process that are \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with that process. Case law from this court supports this same proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>This court addressed a similar issue in <em>In re Ballot Title, </em>247 Or 488, 433 P2d 1 (1967). The Attorney General there had prepared a ballot title which, pursuant to a 1967 legislative act, automatically went to this court for \u201creview\u201d to determine if it met statutory requirements. If the ballot title was deemed to be \u201csufficient,\u201d then the court was to file it with the Secretary of State; if the court found that the ballot title did not meet the statutory requirements, then it was to \u201cwrite a substitute ballot title\u201d and file it with the Secretary of State. 247 Or at 490. The court explained its conclusion that the ballot title \u201creview\u201d statute was unconstitutional, in violation of Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution (the separation of powers provision), this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">\u201cSection 4 [of Oregon Laws 1967, chapter 364,] states that it is now our duty to \u2018review\u2019 the title prepared by the Attorney General and either approve it or write a substitute title and file it with the Secretary of State. It is proposed that we do this without any form of judicial process; without parties being summoned or otherwise appearing who would be governed by the action taken, and without rendering an enforceable judgment. It is clear that the statute attempts to require the court to render a nonjudicial, advisory opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201c[T]he present statute seeks to have the court perform a nonjudicial function, contrary to the prohibition of Art III, \u00a7 1\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Id. at 491-92, 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">In contrast to the statute held to be invalid in the case of <em>In re Ballot Title, </em>the current statutory scheme has none of the same infirmities. This court does not review all ballot titles, but only those in which there has been a challenge filed in this court. Those challenges are concrete disputes, brought by interested parties. The court has a limited, statutorily prescribed standard of review and engages in review of specific challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it is in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements. ORS 250.085(5). This is a by-now familiar exercise, familiar in its own context but familiar also because it is no different in its adjudicative essence than is the review of any other Executive Department action that ordinarily comes before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>courts in the context of judicial review under the Oregon Administrative Procedures Act, ORS 183.480 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The Attorney General has conducted a statutorily prescribed function of that office, and a court challenge has been brought contesting the legal validity of his action. We can find no basis under the premises of the decision in <em>In re Ballot Title </em>to suggest that there is any constitutional separation of powers or other principle limiting judicial authority to adjudicate such a claim. The fact that ballot title decisions may say something, before a measure is circulated for signatures, about the measure, its subject, chief purpose, and major effect, does not turn the court\u2019s decision into an unconstitutional exercise of a nonjudicial function. Rather, any such observations occur only in the context of determining whether the Attorney General\u2019s linguistic choices in the challenged ballot title meet statutory standards. In other words, in determining the validity of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title, the court <em>is performing its case-deciding function. </em>In certifying a ballot title to the Secretary of State, the court affords to the parties whatever relief, if any, to which they are entitled pursuant to the justiciable challenge that was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The fact that the court is asked to adjudicate an otherwise justiciable case <em>during the electoral process </em>does not alter the foregoing analysis. <em>See generally OEA v. Roberts, </em>301 Or 228, 721 P2d 833 (1986) (approving judicial review of whether the Secretary of State had properly discharged her responsibility to review proposed laws for compliance with the constitutional one-subject rule); <em>see also State ex rel Keisling v. Norblad, </em>317 Or 615, 860 P2d 241 (1993) (mandamus authority of this court available to adjudicate a pre-election dispute over whether the Secretary of State was obliged to place a measure on the ballot).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The fundamental genius of the constitution may be found in the creation and separation of three distinct branches of government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But that separation is not always complete, and the roles that governmental actors are asked to play not infrequently interact in material ways. Thus, this court has recognized that the separation of powers does not require or intend an absolute separation between the departments of government. <em>SER Acocella v. Allen, </em>288 Or 175, 180-81, 604 P2d 391 (1980); <em>Boyle v. City of Bend, </em>234 Or 91, 100-02, 380 P2d 625 (1963). Rather, the court has cautioned that a violation of separation of powers may be found only if the problem is clear, <em>State ex rel Emerald PUD v. Joseph, </em>292 Or 357, 361, 640 P2d 1011 (1982), and has set out two inquiries to determine whether there is a separation of powers violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The first inquiry is whether one department of government has \u201cunduly burdened\u201d the actions of another department in an area of responsibility or authority committed to that other department. <em>Id. </em>at 361-62; <em>Ramstead v. Morgan, </em>219 Or 383, 399, 347 P2d 594 (1959). That inquiry corresponds primarily to the underlying principle that separation of powers seeks to avoid the potential for coercive influence between governmental departments. <em>See Mon-aghan v. School District No. 1, </em>211 Or 360, 364-66, 315 P2d 797 (1957) (recognizing the principle). The second inquiry is whether one department is performing the functions committed to another department. <em>State ex rel Frohnmayer v. Oregon State Bar, </em>307 Or 304, 310, 767 P2d 893 (1989); <em>In re Ballot Title, </em>247 Or at 495. That inquiry corresponds primarily to the underlying principle that separation of powers seeks to avoid the potential for concentration of separate powers in one department. <em>Monaghan, 211 Or </em>at 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">It appears clear that the court\u2019s role in adjudicating challenges to the legal adequacy of the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title does not place an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the Executive Branch, here personified by the Attorney General. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>noted above, judicial review of the Attorney General\u2019s acts done pursuant to statute is a well-established role for the court and does not present the potential for the court to influence coercively the Attorney General. <em>See generally Lipscomb v. State Bd. of Higher Ed., </em>305 Or 472, 478-79, 753 P2d 939 (1988) (traditional divisions of authority and exercises of power are considered with due respect by the courts in the constitutional analysis, although the existence of a historically accepted practice will not be dispositive). Neither is the court\u2019s adjudicatory role an impermissible burden on the court. The court is being asked only to carry out classic adjudicatory functions in the context of a live controversy between truly contending parties. It is not being asked to perform the functions committed to the Attorney General. The legislature has corrected the statutory scheme held invalid in 1967 in the <em>In re Ballot Title </em>decision, which did amount to a shift of functions, and the present system now limits the court to a proper adjudicatory role.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">We turn to the remaining branch of government. The people, when carrying out their responsibilities under the initiative and referendum process, are a part of the Legislative Department of government. Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 1 (2)-(5). But for purposes of a separation of powers analysis, it is clear that the court is not placing an undue burden on the people, in an area committed to the people, nor is the court performing a function committed to the people. The ballot title preparation process has never been a function that the people have chosen to reserve to themselves. Rather, the other part of the Legislative Branch, the Legislative Assembly, has by statute placed the responsibility for preparing ballot titles in the Executive Department, subject to judicial review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">To summarize: The role accorded the court in the ballot title process is a proper adjudicatory function, well within the court\u2019s recognized range of judicial authority. The exercise of that authority does not unduly burden the Attorney General (as part of the Executive Branch) or the people (as part of the Legislative Branch), or vice versa, nor does it perform a function committed to either of them. This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>does have the constitutional authority to decide the ballot title challenges at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">THE PARTIES\u2019 CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Subject to the methodological principles discussed above, we now consider the challenges of the parties to the Caption, Question, and Summary, respectively. We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the statutory requirements, pursuant to ORS 250.085(5). We begin by setting out the full text of the measure and of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>The Measure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Elections Division #13 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">\u201cTHE MINORITY STATUS AND CHILD PROTECTION ACT OF 1996 AN ACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">\u201cThe People of the State of Oregon do enact as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">\u201cThe Constitution of the State of Oregon is amended by creating a new section to be added to and made a part of Article 1.

Minority status shall not be based on sexual behavior or desires; therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-13\">\u201c(a) Children, students and employees shall not be advised, instructed or taught by any government agency, department or political subdivision that a person\u2019s sexual behavior or desire is the legal or social equivalent to existing minority civil rights classifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-14\">\u201c(b) The People find that to be morally opposed to certain sexual behaviors such as homosexuality, when based upon a person\u2019s convictions, is a Right of Conscience in accord with Article 1 Section 2 and 3 of this Constitution. Such objection produced by one\u2019s moral standards and values is therefore not discrimination relating to civil rights, nor shall it be considered so by any unit of state or local government; therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-15\">\u201c(1) Public funds shall not be expended in a manner that has the purpose or effect of expressing approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201c(2) Marital status shall not be recognized or spousal benefits awarded on the basis of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">\u201c2. Though subsection one is established and in effect, no licenses, permits, services or benefits shall be denied any person otherwise due under existing statute; nor shall the holding or exercise of any rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Oregon or of the United States of America be deprived, nullified or diminished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201c3. Though subsection one is established and in effect, with regard to public employees, it shall be generally considered that a person\u2019s private lawful sexual behavior is a non-job related factor, provided such consideration does not violate any provision of this Act or of the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">\u201c4. Though subsection one is established and in effect, books or literature in public libraries which promote or express approval of homosexuality shall be kept from minors; access made available only under parental supervision. Such material must meet local community standards established through the existing library review process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u201c5. The term minority status shall refer to any class or category of individuals created in the law as a special civil rights classification such as race, religion, gender, national origin, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">\u201c6. The PEOPLE INTEND that if any part of this enactment be found unconstitutional, the remaining parts shall survive in full force and effect. This Act shall be in all parts self-executing. For the purposes of this Act, every Oregon resident and non-profit entity doing business in the State of Oregon has standing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for Elections Division #13 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: HOMOSEXUALITY, OTHER SEXUAL BEHAVIOR NOT CIVIL RIGHTS BASIS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall constitution forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behaviors, desires; bar spending public funds in way approving homosexuality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends state constitution. Forbids basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behavior or desires. Government cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201c\u2014 teach or advise children, students, employees that sexual behavior or desires equate legally or socially to existing civil rights classifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">\u201c\u2014 recognize marital status, or grant spousal benefits based on homosexuality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201c\u2014 spend public funds in way expressing approval of homosexuahty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201cPublic employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behavior treated as non-job related unless that treatment expresses approval of homosexuahty. Bans pro-homosexuality books from public libraries unless books meet established local community standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">ORS 250.035(l)(a) requires a Caption of not more than 10 words that \u201creasonably identifies the subject of the measure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Rooney asserts that <em>homosexuality </em>is the subject of the measure and that the term \u201cother sexual behavior\u201d is not a necessary piece of the Caption. He also asserts that the wording of the Caption is awkward, obscure, and unclear, and should be changed to state, \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: FORBIDS CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTION BASED ON HOMOSEXUALITY.\u201d We agree with Rooney\u2019s criticism with respect to the Caption\u2019s clarity. The awkwardness and lack of clarity undoubtedly stem from the phrase \u201cnot civil rights basis,\u201d which leads to queries such as \u201cbasis of what?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The Attorney General responds that the ballot title substantially complies with the statutory requirement that a Caption \u201creasonably identifies the subject of the measure.\u201d ORS 250.035(l)(a). The Attorney General also acknowledges, however, that the wording of the Caption is awkward and agrees that inclusion of the term \u201cother sexual behavior\u201d will have little practical impact. If the court concludes that the Caption is flawed, the Attorney General would not object to Rooney\u2019s proposed substitute wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">On a related point, Mabon contends that the Caption is inaccurate, misleading, and confusing. Mabon asserts that the Caption misstates the main subject of the initiative, which is that sexual behavior of any kind simply should not be the basis for a \u201cminority\u201d classification. He specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>objects to the singling out of homosexuality in the Caption (contending that the measure applies to \u201cany form of sexual behavior, heterosexual, transgender or otherwise\u201d) and, relying on <em>Sampson v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 335, 340, 788 P2d 421 (1990), asserts that the Attorney General should use the actual words of the measure. He proposes a Caption that states, \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: PROHIBITS MINORITY STATUS BASED ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, DESIRES.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The wording of the measure is not limited to sexual behavior, but also includes provisions that relate to \u201csexual behavior or desires.\u201d (Sections 1 and 1(a).) The measure also either singles out or specifies \u201chomosexuality\u201d in four separate instances. (Sections 1(b) and 4.) Thus, although the measure does state that \u201cminority status shall not be based on sexual behavior or desires,\u201d it also is clear from the text of the measure itself that the Attorney General\u2019s certified Caption, when it refers specifically to homosexuality in describing the subject of the measure, has substantially complied with the statutory requirement that the Caption reasonably identify the subject of the measure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Cf. June v. Roberts, </em>301 Or 586, 589, 724 P2d 267 (1986) (rejecting the wording of an Explanatory Statement for a measure that referred to \u201can existing nuclear fueled thermal power plant in Oregon\u201d and certifying an Explanatory Statement that named specifically the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant at Rainier, which was the only such entity in existence in Oregon).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The mandate of ORS 250.035(1) to present, in a few words, the subject, the chief purpose, and the major effect of a measure in a ballot title requires that judgments be made about the relative significance of the provisions of a measure. Although reference to \u201csexual behavior\u201d in the broader sense might be appropriate in another portion of the ballot title, a Caption containing a 10-word description of the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>this measure (or, more accurately, an 8-word description of the subject of the measure, following the introductory phrase, \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION\u201d) does not substantially comply with the statutory requirement when it includes reference to \u201cother sexual behavior.\u201d Thus, some alteration to the Caption is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Mabon also contends that the Caption should refer to \u201cminority status,\u201d rather than \u201ccivil rights.\u201d He asserts that the measure uses and defines the term \u201cminority status,\u201d and that the term is now widely understood and is clearer and more precise than \u201ccivil rights,\u201d which frequently evokes an emotional response. All parties agree that either civil rights or minority status is at the core of the measure and is properly included as a concept in any Caption identifying the subject of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">This court previously rejected the use of the term \u201cminority status\u201d in a ballot title for a measure sponsored by the same chief petitioner, stating that the concept \u201chas no recognized meaning outside of this measure.\u201d <em>Mabon v. Keis-ling, </em>317 Or 406, 416, 856 P2d 1023 (1993). That remains true. Moreover, the Attorney General\u2019s Caption utilizes the words of the measure itself by referring to \u201ccivil rights,\u201d which is a term in common parlance that is utilized by the measure to define \u201cminority status.\u201d Section 5 provides: \u201cThe term minority status shall refer to any class or category of individuals created in the law as a special <em>civil rights </em>classification such as race, religion, gender, national origin, etc.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Attorney General\u2019s Caption substantially complies with the statutory requirement that it reasonably identify the subject of the measure when it refers to \u201ccivil rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">To summarize, the Caption\u2019s express reference to \u201chomosexuality\u201d and its use of the term \u201ccivil rights\u201d satisfy the requirements for a ballot title Caption. The inclusion of the phrase \u201cother sexual behavior\u201d does not. We will revise the Caption to reflect those decisions. Furthermore, the additional words available with the deletion of \u201cother sexual behavior\u201d can permit us to rectify the awkward phrasing in the Attorney General\u2019s Caption, although that awkwardness might not otherwise be an independent basis for a change.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Based on the foregoing analysis of the Attorney General\u2019s Caption, we conclude that an apt way to describe the proposed measure before us (and the other three proposed measures whose ballot title challenges also are resolved this date) is to say that the measure deals with the powers of state and local governments to affect homosexuality and homosexuals, and that it does so by specifically restricting those powers. We believe that that general subject is captured by the following Caption: \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: RESTRICTS LOCAL, STATE GOVERNMENT POWERS CONCERNING HOMOSEXUALITY.\u201d Subject to the qualifications noted below, we adopt that Caption as substantially complying with the requirements of ORS 250.035(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Consistent with our methodology for certifying the ballot titles for these four related cases, the final wording for the Caption will be decided after application of ORS 250.035(2) (re: confusion among ballot titles). That discussion will be found later in this opinion. 322 Or at 43-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">THE QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">ORS 250.035(l)(b) requires a Question of not more than 20 words that \u201cplainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure.\u201d The chief purpose is the most significant aim or end that a measure is designed to bring about. <em>Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or at 413. The Attorney General\u2019s certified Question asks, \u201cShall constitution forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behaviors, desires; bar spending public funds in way approving homosexuality?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Mabon repeats his objection to the use of the term \u201ccivil rights,\u201d and we reject that position in this context as well. Mabon also contends that barring certain public funding is not a chief purpose of the measure, but rather is an effect of the chief purpose, which assertedly is to prohibit the granting of \u201cminority status\u201d based on sexual behavior or desires <em>and </em>to protect individual rights of conscience. Mabon proposes a Question that asks, \u201cShall Constitution be amended to prohibit minority status based on sexual behavior or desires and to protect rights of conscience?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The Attorney General responds that a constitutional ban on expenditure of public funds is central to the chief purpose. He further asserts that one consequence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>measure is that \u201cthe public spending provision of the measure would allow some or all homosexuals to be barred from public employment merely because they are homosexuals.\u201d The Attorney General also asserts that the \u201cright of conscience\u201d provision does nothing more than reiterate existing constitutional provisions and should not be featured as a chief purpose of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We do not find it necessary to the analysis in this case to agree or disagree with the Attorney General\u2019s legal conclusions respecting public employment and rights of conscience. It is sufficient for purposes of our review to conclude that the measure\u2019s express constitutional bar on expenditure of public funds \u201cin a manner that has the purpose or effect of expressing approval of homosexuality\u201d is properly characterized as a chief purpose of the measure. It is not an effect of the chief purpose, as Mabon characterizes it, because it is independent of and does not necessarily follow from the provisions regarding civil rights and minority status. Accordingly, we reject Mabon\u2019s challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s certified Question.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Rooney asserts that the chief purpose of the measure is that it seeks: (1) to give constitutional recognition to a right to discriminate (including one express use of the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in section 1(b)); (2) to prevent government from extending civil rights protections to homosexual persons; and (3) to prevent courts from recognizing a claim of discrimination based on a person\u2019s homosexuality. Rooney proposes to change the last clause of the Attorney General\u2019s Question, after the semi-colon, as follows, \u201cShall constitution forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behaviors, desires; permit discrimination against homosexuality in spending public funds?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The Attorney General responds that both his Question and Rooney\u2019s proposed alternative are accurate and that the measure \u201cconcerns discrimination on the basis of homosexuality.\u201d The Attorney General states that he declined to use the word \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the Question because of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or at 416. In that case, this court rejected the Attorney General\u2019s use of the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the ballot title and stated that \u201cthe use of the word \u2018discrimination,\u2019 while accurate, is better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>avoided (if possible), because of the negative context in which that word normally is used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s choice to use, in place of the word \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d another accurate description is an acceptable choice, within the bounds of the substantial compliance for which we review ballot titles. Rooney\u2019s challenge, to compel the use of the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the Question, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We have rejected each of the parties\u2019 challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s certified Question. Subject to the qualifications noted below, we accept the Attorney General\u2019s certified Question as substantially complying with the requirements of ORS 250.035(l)(b). It provides: \u201cShall constitution forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behaviors, desires; bar spending public funds in way approving homosexuality?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Consistent with our methodology for certifying the ballot titles for these four related cases, the final wording for the Question will be decided after application of ORS 250.035(2) (re: confusion among ballot titles). That discussion will be found later in this opinion. 322 Or at 47-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">THE SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\"> ORS 250.035(l)(c) requires a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effects.\u201d The purpose of the Summary is to help voters understand \u201cwhat will happen if the measure is approved,\u201d Fred <em>Meyer, Inc. v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 169, 175, 777 P2d 406 (1989), but speculation about potential secondary effects is not permitted, <em>Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Mabon raises a number of challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s Summary. He first asserts that the Summary fails to mention that the measure would guarantee the right of conscience to object to certain sexual behavior without having the exercise of that right considered to be discrimination. Mabon seeks a sentence in the Summary that would say: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cAffirms constitutional right of conscience as basis to prohibit homosexual marriages and public expenditures approving homosexuality.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Attorney General again asserts that the measure does no more with respect to the right of conscience than existing provisions of the state constitution already provide.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We disagree with Mabon\u2019s challenge, but not for the reason given by the Attorney General, as to which we express no opinion. We conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s Summary substantially complies with the statutory requirements by conveying sufficient and accurate information about what would happen if the measure were to pass, including the asserted individual right to object to sexual behaviors without that objection being deemed discrimination. The pertinent provision of the measure is section 1(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201c1. Minority status shall not be based on sexual behavior or desires; therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201c(b) The People find that to be morally opposed to certain sexual behaviors such as homosexuality, when based upon a person\u2019s convictions, is a Right of Conscience in accord with Article 1 Section 2 and 3 of this Constitution. Such objection produced by one\u2019s moral standards and values is therefore not discrimination relating to civil rights, nor shall it be considered so by any unit of state or local government; therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201c(1) Public funds shall not be expended in a manner that has the purpose or effect of expressing approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201c(2) Marital status shall not be recognized or spousal benefits awarded on the basis of homosexuality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The Attorney General\u2019s Summary, in part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201cAmends state constitution. Forbids basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behavior or desires. Governments cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">\u201c\u2014 recognize marital status or grant spousal benefits based on homosexuality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201c\u2014 spend public funds in way expressing approval of homosexuality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s Summary conveys the idea that the measure amends the constitution and also lists two of the specifics set out by section 1(b) of the measure (public funding and marital status). The Summary also states that the constitution would forbid basing civil rights on sexual behavior or desires. Mabon argues that this is insufficient, because it fails to mention either the right of conscience or the fact that, if the proposed measure passed, the exercise of that right is not discrimination. Mabon does not, however, explain how his point is not covered conceptually by the Attorney General\u2019s statement that the effect of the measure would be for the constitution to forbid basing civil rights on sexual behavior or desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Whether a Summary states that government cannot base civil rights on sexual behavior or desires or, instead, states the corollary, <em>viz., </em>that an individual decision to exercise a right of conscience on the basis of sexual behavior or desires is not discrimination cognizable by the government, is a choice that falls within permissible range of choices that the Attorney General could make. We conclude that, as against this challenge, the Attorney General\u2019s Summary substantially complies with the requirement that it be a concise and impartial summary of the measure and its major effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Mabon next contends that the Attorney General\u2019s Summary fails to mention the \u201csafeguards\u201d in section 2 of the measure and that this failure demonstrates bias. Mabon would insert a sentence in the Summary that states that the measure \u201c[preserves basic constitutional rights and access to public services and privileges.\u201d The Attorney General responds that those \u201csafeguards\u201d are no more than the preservation of the status quo, which should not bear separate mention. The Attorney General also contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Mabon\u2019s proposed wording, which is not found in the proposed measure, would suggest that this court had given its imprimatur to the measure\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We agree with Mabon that section 2 is a major effect of the measure, at least as significant as other effects stated in the Attorney General\u2019s Summary, insofar as it states limitations on the effect of the measure if passed. Space permitting, it should be mentioned in the Summaiy. We also conclude, however, that Mabon\u2019s proposed substitute is argumentative and does not track the terms of the measure. We will certify a ballot title Summary for this measure that refers to the effect of section 2 of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Mabon next objects to the format of the Summary, asserting that voters who read quickly may be misled if they miss the word \u201ccannot\u201d in the phrase \u201cGovernments cannot:\u201d We reject that argument. If we may not assume that the voters can read, or that they are able to tell the difference between \u201ccan\u201d and \u201ccannot,\u201d then this entire exercise is senseless. We certified the same format in <em>Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or at 418, and Mabon\u2019s objection to it here is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Mabon\u2019s final objection relates to how the Summary treats section 4 of the measure. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u201cThough subsection one is established and in effect, books or literature in public libraries which promote or express approval of homosexuality shall be kept from minors; access made available only under parental supervision. Such material must meet local community standards established through the existing library review process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Mabon objects to the sentence in the Summary that states that the measure \u201c[b]ans pro-homosexuality books from public libraries unless books meet established local community standards.\u201d Mabon asserts that this is not so, but that the measure \u201cwould only require that pro-homosexuality books be available to minors with parental supervision, and meet local community standards established through existing library review processes.\u201d The Attorney General responds that the measure clearly provides that the books must meet community standards to be in the library.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The Attorney General has interpreted the measure in a particular way, and the parties are trying to draw the court into the same exercise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of course, any attempt to summarize or to distill a proposed measure by any formula of words short of a rote repetition of the measure will always involve at least minimal interpretation of the measure. But our task is to see to it that the interpretive exercise be minimal, because that is the best way to ensure that the Summary will meet the mandate of ORS 250.035(l)(c) that it be \u201cconcise and impartial.\u201d We therefore will revise the Summary\u2019s description of section 4 simply to summarize the language of the measure. Proponents and opponents of the measure are free to trumpet its purported effects or to point to its possible ambiguities, but it is not the court\u2019s role to engage in an abstract exercise of pre-enactment constitutional interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Rooney asserts that one major effect of the measure would be to invalidate <em>existing </em>local anti-discrimination ordinances. Rooney asserts that there is room in the Summary to refer to this and proposes that the Summary state: \u201cOverturns local ordinances that protect homosexuals from discrimination in jobs, housing.\u201d The Attorney General agrees that the measure would make such ordinances unconstitutional. The Attorney General asserts that his ballot title substantially complies, but would not object to the addition of a sentence that would help the voters to understand this as one of the measure\u2019s major effects. The Attorney General proposes: \u201cBars [or bans, or forbids] local ordinances that protect homosexuals from discrimination in jobs, housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It may be, as Rooney argues and the Attorney General concedes, that one of the effects of the proposed measure would be to constitutionally nullify at least some local ordinances. But the possible range in the wording of such ordinances makes it difficult to be confident of any generalization concerning them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Moreover, it would extend well beyond this court\u2019s usual (albeit self-imposed) restraint to announce such an abstract ruling of constitutional interpretation. Finally, and given the veiy ordinance \u2014 specific nature of the constitutional ruling that Rooney seeks, it is not at all clear that the effect that Rooney wishes to have highlighted is so much more important than those subjects that the Attorney General has placed in his certified ballot titles that it is necessary, as a matter of law, to make a substitution. We hold that the addition that Rooney seeks is not necessary in order to ensure that the Attorney General\u2019s caption conforms to the requirements of ORS 250.035(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">To summarize: We reject the addition of a sentence to describe the effect of the measure on existing local ordinances. We reject the addition of a reference to the right of conscience and the contention that the format of the Summary is inadequate. We agree that the Summary should refer to the limitations in section 2, and we conclude that the description of the public library provision should summarize the wording of the measure. Subject to the qualifications noted below, we hold that the following Summary substantially complies with the requirement of ORS 250.035(l)(c) that there be a Summary that concisely and impartially summarizes the proposed measure and its major effects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201cAmends state constitution. Government cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">\u201c\u2014 base civil rights on homosexuality, sexual behavior or desires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201c\u2014 deny other constitutional rights, or licenses, benefits, services under existing statutes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">\u201c\u2014 tell children, students, employees that sexual behavior, desires equate to classifications like race, religion, gender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">\u201c\u2014 recognize homosexual marital status, spousal benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">\u201c\u2014 spend public funds approving homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">\u201cPublic employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behavior treated as non-job related unless that treatment expresses approval of homosexuality. Public libraries: Pro-homosexuality books available to minors with parental supervision, must meet local standards per review process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>We turn now to a discussion of whether, in light of the wording of the present proposed measure and the other measures that are before us today, the provisions of ORS 250.035(2) require us to modify the ballot title wording that we thus far have found to conform to statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">APPLICATION OF ORS 250.035(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Faced with multiple related measures and ballot title challenges, and having tentatively revised a number of ballot title provisions, both with respect to the present measure and with respect to Elections Division Numbers 17, 21, and 25, we now must consider the potential for confusion between and among the various titles.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">We begin by restating that ORS 250.035(2) provides: \u201cThe ballot title shall not resemble, so far as probably to create confusion, any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d We already have held that the statute may be satisfied by giving identical measures the same, similar, or different ballot titles, depending on the circumstance, and that more than one of those choices may be an acceptable choice for the Attorney General to make in a particular situation. 322 Or at 23. The statutory rule is the same, and the same principles regarding the prevention of confusion apply with equal force if the measures are not materially identical, although the danger that similar or identical ballot titles will be used under those circumstances is far less.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The stated purpose of ORS 250.035(2) is to help prevent voter confusion. We have noted in a companion case that the text of the measures for Elections Division #13 and #17 is nearly identical, and we deemed \u201cthe variance to be immaterial for purposes of a ballot title.\u201d <em>Mabon v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #17), </em>322 Or 65, 68 &amp; n 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>902 P2d 1171 (1995). Different ballot titles for two measures that are nearly identical textually and substantively would run too great a risk of confusing voters by suggesting that there are differences in the measures when such differences do not exist. Thus, we believe that the ballot titles for Elections Division #13 and #17 should be the same, and we will treat them accordingly in the analysis that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\">1. <em>The Caption. </em>Set out below is a statement of each of the Captions and a summary of the pertinent rulings on the parties\u2019 challenges to those Captions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">a. <em>Elections Division #13: </em>\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: HOMOSEXUALITY, OTHER SEXUAL BEHAVIOR NOT CIVIL RIGHTS BASIS.\u201d We have held earlier in this opinion that the Caption\u2019s express reference to \u201chomosexuality\u201d satisfies the requirements for a ballot title Caption, while the inclusion of the phrase, \u201cother sexual behavior,\u201d does not. In the course of that discussion, we concluded that the underlying point made by the Caption was a core point of the measure (a conclusion shared by all the parties in their briefing) and that it was properly included as a concept in a Caption. We concluded that the measure deals with the powers of state and local governments to affect homosexuality and homosexuals. Finally, we acknowledged the awkward phrasing of the Caption, which is remediable on revision. 322 Or at 32-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">b. <em>Elections Division #17: </em>\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: LAWS CANNOT GUARANTEE EQUAL TREATMENT FOR HOMOSEXUAL PERSONS.\u201d We have held that the Caption does not satisfy the statutory requirements because of its rhetorical content. As with Elections Division #13, we have concluded that the underlying point made by the Caption was a core point of the measure and that it was properly included as a concept in the Caption. <em>Mabon v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #17), </em>322 Or at 71-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">c. <em>Elections Division #21: </em>\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: BARS SPENDING PUBLIC FUNDS IN WAY APPROVING HOMOSEXUALITY.\u201d We have rejected this Caption as being too narrowly focused and not capturing the subject of the measure. Because that conclusion left us with no Caption, we were compelled to formulate a statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the subject of the measure. We pointed to the various provisions of the measure, all of which are contained in one form or another in Elections Division #13 and #17, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">\u201cWhen a measure contains an affiliated grouping of separate provisions related by a common thread, the subject of the measure may well be most reasonably identified by characterizing the thread, rather than by focusing on one or more of the most significant constituent parts. This is consistent with the approach that we took quite recently to certifying a ballot title Caption for a measure with a similar range of provisions and subject matter. <em>Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or 406, 411-13, 856 P2d 1023 (1993) (rejecting a specific Caption for a more generally descriptive one). In this instance, we conclude that the subject of this measure likewise is best captured by reference to the common thread, rather than to any one or more pieces of the patchwork.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201cWe conclude that the subject of this measure is properly characterized as a constitutional amendment that relates to the powers of state and local governments concerning homosexuality. That statement of the subject accurately and neutrally describes the measure and apprises the electorate of what subject they are being asked to consider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #21), </em>322 Or 77, 85-86, 902 P2d 1177 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">d. <em>Elections Division #25: </em>\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: BARS LEGAL PROTECTIONS BASED ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, DESIRE.\u201d We have disapproved of the use of the word \u201cbars,\u201d concluding that the Caption should, if possible, recognize both the substance of the \u201cminority status\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provision and the limitations on that provision as expressed in the measure. We also have recognized that, if the word \u201climits\u201d is substituted for \u201cbars,\u201d the foregoing goal is achieved. <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #25), </em>322 Or 90, 97, 902 P2d 1183 (1995). With that substitution, the resulting Caption for this narrow measure complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The foregoing demonstrates that three of these proposed measures \u2014 Numbers 13,17, and 21 \u2014 are concerned with the same basic overall subject. The statement of that subject in the Caption for Elections Division #21 \u2014 that the measure would amend the constitution with respect to the powers of state and local governments concerning homosexuality \u2014 neutrally and accurately captures the subject of each of the measures, while also taking account of the particular rulings in each of the challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s Captions. With respect to Elections Division #13 and #17, a core concern of those measures \u2014 civil rights \u2014 which we deemed properly included as a concept in a Caption, is included in a Caption that communicates the general subject identified in the context of those cases and articulated more fully in Elections Division #21. Use of the word \u201chomosexuality\u201d is acceptable throughout. <em>(See, e.g., </em>322 Or at 33, rejecting a challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s use of the term \u201chomosexuality\u201d in the Caption for Elections Division #13). Finally, because the approach taken by the statement of the subject identifies the common thread in the proposed measures, it is consistent with the approach that we took under somewhat similar circumstances in <em>Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or at 411-13 (rejecting too narrow a focus in proposed Caption and certifying a more broadly descriptive Caption).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Because three of these four measures have the same subject, with interlocking choices of text in the measures, and because the Caption is a very short heading to advise the voters generally what the measure is about \u2014 is, in other words, a \u201crelating clause\u201d for a proposed piece of legislation \u2014 we believe that there will be too great a risk of voter confusion if we provide different Captions for those measures. The Captions, which describe the measures in the most general terms, will lead naturally to the more specific Questions, stating the chief purposes of the measures, and to the yet more specific Summaries, stating the major effects of the measures. As one moves from the general to the specific, then points of departure may become more appropriate. Accordingly, we certify the following Caption for the ballot title for Elections Division #13, #17, and #21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: RESTRICTS LOCAL, STATE GOVERNMENT POWERS CONCERNING HOMOSEXUALITY\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>With respect to the far narrower measure in Elections Division #25, however, the foregoing Caption would be far too broad. With respect to Elections Division #25, we certify the following Caption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: LIMITS LEGAL PROTECTIONS BASED ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, DESIRES\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">2. <em>The Question. </em>Set out below is a statement of each of the Questions and a summary of the pertinent rulings on the parties\u2019 challenges to those Questions in each of the four cases that we decide today:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">a. <em>Elections Division #13: </em>\u201cShall constitution forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behaviors, desires; bar spending public funds in way approving homosexuality?\u201d We rejected all the parties\u2019 challenges to this Question and concluded, therefore, that it substantially complies with the statutoiy requirements. 322 Or at 35-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">b. <em>Elections Division #17: </em>\u201cShall constitution say laws cannot guarantee equal treatment for homosexual persons, and forbid spending public funds in way approving homosexuality?\u201d Consistent with our ruling on the Caption for the ballot title for this measure, we have concluded that the Question does not substantially comply with the statutory requirements because of the rhetorical content of its first clause. <em>Mabon v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #17), </em>322 Or at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">c. <em>Elections Division #21: </em>\u201cShall state constitution bar spending public funds in way approving homosexuality; forbid granting marital status, spousal benefits based on homosexuality?\u201d We have concluded that the Question cannot refer to other specific provisions and at the same time omit reference to the substance of the \u201cright of conscience\u201d provision. <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #21), </em>322 Or at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">d. <em>Elections Division #25: </em>\u201cShall state constitution bar laws defining a class of people for protection of rights based on sexual behavior or desires?\u201d Consistent with the ruling on the Caption for the ballot title for this measure, which differs from the Caption for the other three measures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and closely follows the Attorney General\u2019s Caption, the Question certified by the Attorney General comes close to meeting the statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">As noted above, we will certify the same ballot title for Elections Division #13 and #17, which we deemed to be materially identical, textually and substantively. We also have noted that Elections Division #21 is essentially the verbatim equivalent of portions of Elections Division #13, albeit without other provisions of that proposed measure. <em>Mabon v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #17), </em>322 Or at 68 n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We have held that the Attorney General\u2019s certified Question for Elections Division #13 substantially complies with the statutory requirements. Accordingly, it is also a sufficient Question for Elections Division #17. We also conclude that that Question accurately states the chief purpose of Elections Division #21, notwithstanding the fact that Elections Division #21 does not include all the text of the measure for Elections Division #13. Consistent with our conclusions in the context of the Captions, we conclude that there would be too high a risk of voter confusion if the voters were asked different Questions for these three measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We certify the Attorney General\u2019s certified Question for Elections Division #13 and shall certify the same Question for #17. We shall certify the same Question for Elections Division #21, with one small change, the deletion of the word \u201cdesires,\u201d which does not appear in the text of the measure of Elections Division #21.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Elections Division #25 is different. It contains only two major operative provisions, the \u201cminority status\u201d provision and the limitations placed on that provision. It does not contain a public spending provision. To prevent voter confusion, the Question must differ from the other Questions. With slight modification, the Question certified by the Attorney General meets the requirements of ORS 250.035(2). We certify the following Questions for each of the measures:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Elections Division #13 and #17: \u201cShall constitution forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behaviors, desires; bar spending public funds in way approving homosexuality?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Elections Division #21: \u201cShall constitution forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behaviors; bar spending public funds in way approving homosexuality?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Elections Division #25: \u201cShall state constitution bar laws defining a class of people for granting civil rights based on sexual behavior or desires?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">3. <em>Summary. </em>Set out below is a statement of each of the Summaries and a description of the pertinent rulings on the parties\u2019 challenges to those Summaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">a. <em>Elections Division #13:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">\u201cAmends state constitution. Forbids basing civil rights on homosexuality, other sexual behavior or desires. Government cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">\u201c\u2014 teach or advise children, students, employees that sexual behavior or desires equate legally or socially to existing civil rights classifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\u201c\u2014 recognize marital status, or grant spousal benefits based on homosexuality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">\u201c\u2014 spend public funds in way expressing approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">\u201cPublic employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behavior treated as non-job related unless that treatment expresses approval of homosexuality. Bans pro-homosexuality books from public libraries unless books meet established local community standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">We concluded that the Summary had to mention the limits imposed by the measure on its scope and also that the public library sentence required revision to summarize the provision of the measure in the terms of the measure. 322 Or at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">b. <em>Elections Division #17:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-14\">\u201cAmends state constitution. Forbids laws that guarantee equal treatment for homosexual persons. Government cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-15\">\u201c\u2014 teach or advise children, students, or employees that sexual behavior or desires equate legally or socially to race, religion, or gender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">\u201c\u2014 recognize marital status or grant spousal benefits based on homosexuality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u201c\u2014 spend public funds in way expressing approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\u201cPublic employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behavior treated as non-job related unless that treatment expresses approval of homosexuality. Bans pro-homosexuality books from public libraries unless books meet established local community standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">As with the Summary for Elections Division #13, we have concluded that the Summary must mention the limits imposed by the measure on its scope and also that the public library sentence requires revision to summarize the provision of the measure in the terms of the measure. We also have concluded that the Summary should be revised to correct for the rhetoric of the second sentence. <em>Mabon v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #17), </em>322 Or at 74-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">c. <em>Elections Division #21:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201cAmends state constitution. Provides that moral objection to homosexuality is \u2018right of conscience,\u2019 not discrimination relating to civil rights. Bans spending public funds in way expressing approval of homosexuality. Forbids government from recognizing marital status or awarding spousal benefits on basis of homosexuality. Public employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behavior treated as non-job related unless that treatment expresses approval of homosexuality. Bars access by minors to pro-homosexuality public library books or literature without parent\u2019s supervision. Governments nonetheless cannot deny licenses, services, benefits due under existing statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We have rejected Rooney\u2019s challenge to the Summary, Mabon posed no challenge. Accordingly, the Attorney General\u2019s certified Summary was deemed to be in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements. <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #21), </em>322 Or at 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">d. <em>Elections Division #25:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">\u201cThis measure would amend the state constitution. Current laws protect people from denial of housing, employment and other rights on the basis of race, religion, gender, or national origin. The measure would bar laws that protect people from denial of such rights based on their sexual behavior or desires. The measure also would say that governments nonetheless could not deny constitutional rights, or licenses, permits, services, or benefits due under existing statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>We have concluded that the use of the term \u201cprotect\u201d can be emotionally charged and is not necessary to convey a major effect of the measure. We also have concluded that, in an 85-word Summary, some express mention of the measure\u2019s specific effect on homosexual persons was necessary. <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #25), </em>322 Or at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">As we have done in the context of the Captions and the Questions, we will certify the same Summary for Elections Division #13 and #17. The Attorney General\u2019s certified Summaries already share text that is similar or identical, and the two Summaries also share the same problems \u2014 the need to recognize the measure\u2019s limits and to revise the public library sentence. The one additional problem posed by the Summary for Elections Division #17 \u2014 the rhetoric of the phrase, \u201cForbids laws that guarantee equal treatment for homosexual persons\u201d \u2014 is fixed by the Summary for Elections Division #13 (\u201cForbids basing civil rights on homosexuality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Elections Division #21 does not include certain of the provisions of Elections Division #13 and #17. In addition, unlike with Elections Division #13 and #17, the Attorney General\u2019s certified Summary for Elections Division #21 does substantially comply with the statutory requirements, without need for revision. Because the Summary is the most specific descriptor of the ballot title sections for the measures, and because the underlying similarity among Elections Division #13, #17, and #21 already has been made clear to the voters by certification of the same Caption and nearly the same Question for each of those measures, we conclude that the Summary for Elections Division #21 does not need to be the same or nearly the same as the Summary for Elections Division #13 and #17 in order to prevent voter confusion. Accordingly, we can certify a different Summary for Elections Division #21 than the one that we certify for Elections Division #13 and #17. Because the Attorney General\u2019s certified Summary for Elections Division #21 does substantially comply with the statutory requirements, we will certify that Summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>As we have noted in the context of our discussion of the Questions, Elections Division #25 is different. It warranted a different Caption and Question from the other three measures, and it warrants a different Summary. It is necessary to certify a different Summary for Elections Division #25 to avoid voter confusion and permit recognition of the different range of the measure. Accordingly, we will certify a Summary for that measure that takes into account the parties\u2019 valid objections to the Attorney General\u2019s certified Summary, necessary to bring the Summary into substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We certify the following Summaries for each of the measures:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Elections Division #13 and #17: We have set out below a version of the Summary that uses the Attorney General\u2019s certified Summary for Elections Division #13 as a baseline, showing this court\u2019s changes by indicating deletions in brackets and additions with italics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201cAmends state constitution.

As noted above, since that time, counsel for the chief petitioner has stated that he intends to circulate one or more, rather than one at most, of the proposed measures for signatures.

In so doing, the majority concludes that the performance of that statutory duty \u2014 the drafting and certification of a different ballot title \u2014 does not violate the separation of powers principle embodied in Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution. Because I conclude that, insofar as ORS 250.085(5) (1993) directs this court, if a ballot title prepared by the Attorney General does not comply substantially with statutory standards, to draft and certify a different ballot title that does meet those standards, that statute offends the separation of powers principle embodied in Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The Oregon Constitution is the source of power for each branch of the Oregon government. Article IV, section 1(1), of the Oregon Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cThe legislative power of the state, except for the initiative and referendum powers reserved to the people, is vested in a Legislative Assembly, consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Article IV, sections l(2)(a) and l(3)(a), reserve to the people the initiative and referendum powers, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Article VII (Amended), section 1, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201cThe judicial power of the state shall be vested in one supreme court and in such other courts as may from time to time be created by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Additionally, Article III, section 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\u201cThe powers of the Government shall be divided into three seperate (sic) departments, the Legislative, the Executive, including the administrative, and the Judicial; and <em>no person charged with official duties under one of these departments, shall exercise any of the functions of another, eoccept as in this Constitution expressly provided.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The Oregon Constitution compels the separation of powers among the branches of government<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in two ways. First, the Oregon Constitution affirmatively assigns separate powers to each branch of government. Second, an additional section expressly forbids an officer of one branch of government from exercising the distinct functions of another branch unless the Oregon Constitution otherwise <em>expressly </em>provides. Therefore, without such express constitutional authority, a statute that requires the Judicial Branch to exercise legislative functions is invalid. <em>See City of Enterprise v. State, </em>156 Or 623, 69 P2d 953 (1937) (statute that, among other things, vested court with power to levy taxes, fix salaries of municipal officers, and effect municipal contracts violated Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">The Oregon Supreme Court may not act legislatively or encroach on the functions of another branch of government merely because strong policy considerations favor the exercise of extra-judicial functions. \u201cOur task * * * in construing a constitutional provision is to respect the principles given the status of constitutional guarantees and limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>by the drafters; it is not to abandon these principles when this fits the needs of the moment.\u201d <em>State v. Kessler, </em>289 Or 359, 362, 614 P2d 94 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">As Justice Linde, formerly of this court, observed in regard to the federal constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThe Constitution directs governments how to act and how not to act. The Constitution does not say that a government may act contrary to those directives if judges believe that the government has good enough reasons to do so.\u201d Hans Linde, <em>Who Must Know What, When, and How: The Systemic Incoherence of </em>\u201cInterest\u201d <em>Scrutiny, </em>in Public Values in Constitutional Law 219, 219 (Stephen E. Gottlieb ed., 1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">That principle applies equally to the Oregon Constitution. The Oregon Supreme Court may not draft and certify a ballot title different from the one certified by the Attorney General merely because the Legislative Branch directs this court to do so, or because this court believes that it plays an important part in the initiative and referendum process when it does so.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">I begin my analysis by reviewing the process by which a ballot title reaches this court for certification. After a prospective petition for an initiative measure is submitted to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State sends copies of the proposed initiative measure to the Attorney General. ORS 250.065(2). The Attorney General then prepares a draft ballot title for the proposed initiative. ORS 250.065(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">ORS 250.035(1) (1993) mandated three components for a ballot title: (1) a Caption that reasonably identifies the measure\u2019s subject; (2) a Question that plainly phrases the measure\u2019s chief purpose; and (3) a concise and impartial Summary that summarizes the measure and its major effect. <em>Nelson v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 499, 502, 789 P2d 650 (1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, ORS 250.035(2) (1993) mandated that the ballot title \u201cnot resemble, so far as probably to create confusion, any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d After the Attorney General prepares a ballot title, the public may submit written comments concerning that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>title during the comment period. ORS 250.067(1). If an elector \u2014 a person qualified to vote under Article II, section 2, of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 timely submits written comments during the comment period, the elector, if dissatisfied with the ballot title certified by the Attorney General, may petition this court to \u201cseekG a different title.\u201d ORS 250.005(2); ORS 250.085(2) (1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Under the statutory scheme relevant to the ballot title at issue in this case, the Legislative Assembly gives this court two primary responsibilities when we receive a petition that seeks a different ballot title. If this court, on review, determines that the ballot title for a proposed initiative measure certified to the Secretary of State by the Attorney General complies substantially with the statutory standards set forth in ORS 250.035(1) and (2) (1993), ORS 250.085(5) (1993)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> directs this court to approve and certify that ballot title to the Secretary of State. If, however, this court determines that the ballot title certified to the Secretary of State by the Attorney General for a proposed initiative measure does not comply substantially with those statutory standards, ORS 250.085(5) (1993) directs this court to draft and certify a ballot title that does meet those statutory requirements. It is the nature of the act of drafting and certifying a different ballot title that raises separation of powers concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">This court\u2019s act of drafting and certifying a ballot title different than the one prepared by the Attorney General is legislative in nature, because it entangles the court in the enactment of direct legislation. The enactment of direct legislation through a ballot measure is a function of the Legislative Branch of government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cBy the adoption of the initiative and referendum into our constitution, the legislative department of the State is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>divided into two separate and distinct law-making bodies. There remains, however, as formerly, but one legislative department of the State. It operates, it is true, differently than before \u2014 one method by the enactment of laws directly, through that source of all legislative power, the people; and the other, as formerly, by their representatives!.]\u201d <em>Straw v. Harris, </em>54 Or 424, 430-31, 103 P 777 (1909).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><em>See also </em>Article IV, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution (the people exercise a legislative function through the initiative and referendum processes).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Under the statute, the drafting of the ballot title is an important necessary step in the enactment of any initiative measure. It is the ballot title, not the full text of the measure itself, that voters have before them when casting their votes. <em>See </em>ORS 254.145 (setting forth the design and contents of official ballots). The wording of the ballot title greatly influences the success or failure of a particular measure. Moreover, the ballot title becomes part of the legislative history that courts utilize in interpreting measures that are approved by the voters. <em>Ecumenical Ministries v. Oregon State Lottery Comm., </em>318 Or 551, 560 n 8, 871 P2d 106 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Thus, when this court drafts and certifies a ballot title for a proposed initiative measure that is different than the ballot title certified by the Attorney General, it performs a crucial preliminary step in the legislative process. As this court has recognized in the past,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201cthe writing of ballot titles is not a judicial but a legislative or political function. Normally, appeals may be taken only from judicial bodies, and, generally, the doctrine of the separation of powers prohibits courts from infringing upon legislative functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">\u201cThe preparation of a ballot title, like the writing of a title for a legislative bill, requires construction and interpretation of the measure itself. The purpose of a ballot title is to guide and inform the voters in a future election. A court which writes a ballot title for an initiative measure knows that the title which it is writing will be printed upon the ballot if enough signatures are procured for the measure, and may be accepted by the signers and voters as an index to the meaning of the measure. Should the measure become involved in political discussion, the ballot title may be invoked by partisans to settle some of the debates. Thus, in a measure, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>court which wrote the title would find itself drawn into the controversy as counsel by the side served by the title. If the measure is adopted at the election and if it later becomes the subject of judicial controversy involving its true interpretation, the court may find that either the appellant or the respondent will wish to contest the interpretation manifested in the ballot title which the court wrote.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Neuner, </em>183 Or 558, 562-63, 194 P2d 989 (1948).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The drafting of the ballot title is akin to the writing of a title for a legislative bill. Preliminary steps of the legislative process, such as the drafting of titles for legislative bills, or the drafting of ballot titles, are internal processes committed exclusively to the other branches of government. The judiciary should play no role in those legislative functions in the absence of express constitutional authorization. By requiring this court to draft and certify a ballot title to the Secretary of State that is different than the ballot title certified by the Attorney General, the pertinent statutory scheme makes this court an active participant in the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The exercise of such a political or legislative function by this court unduly entangles this court in the internal workings of a separate branch of government. The statutory scheme that directs the Judicial Branch to revise ballot titles vests in the Judicial Branch the power to influence the passage or failure of legislative proposals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In my view, vesting such power in the judiciary violates Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>It is true, as the majority notes, that under Article III, section 1, an officer of one branch may exercise the functions of another if the Oregon Constitution \u201cexpressly provides.\u201d Nowhere in the Oregon Constitution, however, is there an <em>express </em>grant to the Judicial Branch to perform the legislative function of drafting and certifying a ballot title for a proposed initiative measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The majority finds an express grant in Article IV, section l(4)(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201cInitiative and referendum measures shall be submitted to the people as provided in this section <em>and by law not inconsistent therewith.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">That section authorizes the Legislative Assembly to adopt laws concerning the submission of initiative and referendum measures as long as they are not inconsistent with other constitutional provisions. Article IV, section l(4)(b), however, does not <em>expressly </em>give the Legislative Assembly the power to involve the Judicial Branch in the legislative process. The phrase \u201cand by law not inconsistent therewith\u201d is not an express grant of power to the Legislative Assembly to compel officers of the Judicial Branch to carry out a function that, without question, is legislative in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">By contrast, there are several examples in which the Oregon Constitution does expressly grant one branch of government the power to perform the functions of another. For example, Article IV, section l(4)(a), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\u201cPetitions or orders for the initiative or referendum shall be filed with the Secretary of State. The Legislative Assembly shall provide by law for the manner in which the Secretary of State shall determine whether a petition contains the required number of signatures of qualified voters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">That section expressly gives one branch of government, the Executive, the power to administer part of the legislative process, the filing of petitions or orders for initiatives and referendums.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Another example in which the Oregon Constitution expressly grants one branch of government the power to perform the functions of another exists in Article XV, section 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 1 article III and section 10 article II of the Constitution of the State of Oregon, a person employed by the State Board of Higher Education, a member of any school board or employee thereof, shall be eligible to a seat in the Legislative Assembly and such membership in the Legislative Assembly shall not prevent such person from being employed by the State Board of Higher Education or from being a member or employee of a school board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Before the amendment of Article XV, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution, this court had held that a person who was a member of the Legislative Assembly could not teach in a public school because of the Article III, section 1, principle of separation of powers. <em>Monaghan v. School District No. </em>1, 211 Or 360, 315 P2d 797 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In <em>Monaghan, </em>this court construed Article III, section 1, strictly to prohibit any mixing of legislative and executive functions. Indeed, the <em>Monaghan </em>court noted that this was a construction of \u201cextreme precaution\u201d; however, it believed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201c[this construction] expresses the considered judgment and deliberation of the Oregon Convention to give greater force to the concepts of separation by thus barring any official in one department of government of the opportunity to serve any other department, even as an employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Similarly, in <em>In the Matter of Sawyer, </em>286 Or 369, 384, 594 P2d 805 (1979), this court held that Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution prohibits a judge from engaging in employment as a regular part-time teacher for compensation at a state-funded college (a function of the Executive Branch).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Article III, section 1, therefore, is not merely an affirmative allocation of powers to the separate branches; it is stated also as a negation: \u201cno person charged with official duties under one of these departmentsQ shall exercise any of the functions of another[.]\u201d Or Const, Art III, \u00a7 1. Following <em>Monaghan, </em>to create an exception to the strict limitations of Article III, section 1, the Oregon Constitution was amended. The amendment, Article XV, section 8, expressly granted one part of the Executive Branch, employees of the State Board of Higher Education and of any school board, the power to exercise the functions of another, the Legislative Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The express grant evident in Article XV, section 8, is in contrast to the language of Article IV, section l(4)(b), which makes no provision for the sharing of power between separate governmental branches. Although Article IV, section l(4)(b), gives the legislature broad powers to make laws consistent with the people\u2019s right to vote on initiative and referendum measures, it does not expressly grant the Judicial Branch the power to draft and certify ballot titles for proposed initiative measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The majority also relies on <em>In re Ballot Title, </em>247 Or 488, 431 P2d 1 (1967), to support its conclusion that judicial drafting and certification of ballot titles different than those prepared by the Attorney General does not violate the separation of powers. The majority\u2019s reliance on that case is misplaced. That case supports my view, not the majority\u2019s. In <em>In re Ballot Title, </em>this court held unconstitutional a statute that required this court to review ballot titles prepared by the Attorney General, regardless of whether a challenge was brought by a particular party, and to certify a substitute title if the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title was not sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 491-92. The court said that the statute attempted \u201cto require the court to render a nonjudicial advisory opinion,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that \u201cthe present statute seeks to have the court perform a non-judicial function, contrary to the prohibition of [Article] III, [section] 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The majority attempts to distinguish <em>In Re Ballot Title </em>by arguing that \u201cthe current statutory scheme has none of the same infirmities\u201d as the statute held unconstitutional in that case. I disagree. Although ORS 250.085(5) (1993) creates the trappings of administrative adjudication for the process of judicial review of a ballot title, its requirement that this court compose a different ballot title if the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title is deemed insufficient is identical to the requirement held unconstitutional in <em>In Re Ballot Title. </em>The <em>function </em>of creation of a new ballot title is not transformed from its legislative character by the addition of adjudicative procedures to the ballot title review process. The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>In Re Ballot Title </em>on that basis is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The view expressed in Justice McAllister\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>In re Ballot Title </em>is correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u201cThe preparation of a ballot title * * * is either a legislative or an executive function. The drafting of a ballot title by this court would be the exercise by the judicial department of a function of another department of government. This court is prohibited by the express language of the constitution from exercising a legislative or executive function and the same language prohibits the legislature from imposing a legislative or executive function upon the court. I prefer to rest our decision on the separation of powers doctrine and therefore concur in the result of the majority opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496 (McAllister, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Recognizing the gravity of even limited intrusions by one branch of government into the functions of another, this court in <em>Monaghan </em>concluded its opinion \u201cwith the words of Madison, taken from 1 The Federalist, p 340\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201c Tt is equally evident that, in reference to each other, neither of them ought to possess, <em>directly or indirectly, </em>an overruling influence in the administration of their respective powers. It will not be denied that power is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)\u201d <em>Mon-aghan, </em>211 Or at 377.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In summary, I believe that, to the extent that ORS 250.085(5) (1993) directs this court to draft and certify a ballot title for a proposed initiative measure that is different than the ballot title prepared by the Attorney General, it requires this court to engage in a legislative function and makes this court an active participant in the legislative process. In my view, the involvement of this court in the legislative process, by drafting and certifying a ballot title for a proposed initiative measure, violates the separation of powers guaranteed by Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution. I would, therefore, dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-7\">Durham, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\"> The 1995 Oregon Legislative Assembly made significant amendments to OES 250.035 (1993).
