The Attorney General certified the same ballot title for both measures. Because petitioners present the same challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title for both measures, we address that challenge in one opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Petitioners are electors who, in a timely manner, submitted written comments about the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title, pursuant to ORS 250.067(1). Accordingly, they are entitled to seek a different ballot title for the two measures in this court. ORS 250.085(2). We modify the ballot title in certain respects and, as modified, certify it to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">At the outset, we note that the context for our discussion in this case includes our treatment of petitioners\u2019 challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s ballot titles in <em>Ascher v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #46), </em>322 Or 516, 909 P2d 1216 (1996), and <em>Nakamoto v. Kulongoski, </em>322 Or 181, 904 P2d 165 (1995). Elections Division #48 and #50 are identical to the measure discussed in <em>Nakamoto, </em>except that they add an explanatory \u201csummary,\u201d and a new section 4. Apart from the text contained in section 4, the only difference between the measures in this case and the measure discussed in <em>Ascher (Elections Division #46) </em>is that the former contains a relating clause and the latter does not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The Attorney General certified the following ballot title for both measures to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">\u201cFORBIDS GOVERNMENT PREFERENCES BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">\u201cRESULT OF TES\u2019 VOTE: Tes\u2019 vote adopts statute forbidding government preferences based on listed factors, in employment, other areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects statute forbidding government preferences based on listed factors, in employment, other areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">\u201cSUMMARY: Adopts statute. Oregon law now forbids government discrimination based on race, religion, color, sex, national origin. Law also provides for government affirmative action programs to provide fair and equal opportunity in employment, public contracting, to cure past and present discrimination. Measure forbids state, local government discrimination against, preference for citizens based on race, religion, color, sex, national origin. Applies in education, employment, contracting, public services. Any unaffected government affirmative action program must show government has history of discrimination. Unaffected state programs implemented under strict scrutiny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Pursuant to ORS 250.085(5), we review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Petitioners initially restate the same challenges that they made with respect to the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for Elections Division #46. <em>See Ascher (Elections Division #46), </em>322 Or at 520-24 (discussing petitioners\u2019 challenges). Their challenges to the caption and result statements have no greater validity in the context of Elections Division #48 and #50 than they had with respect to Elections Division #46. For the reasons stated in <em>Ascher (Elections Division #46), </em>322 Or at 520-22, we conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s certified caption and result statements comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (c). In addition, we conclude, as we did in <em>Ascher (Elections Division #46), </em>322 Or at 522, that the Attorney General\u2019s summary does not comply substantially with ORS 250.035-(2)(d), because it does not inform voters that a \u201cmajor effect\u201d of the measures, if voters approve them, would be to limit government affirmative action programs in Oregon. Accordingly, we modify the Attorney General\u2019s summary, in the manner described in <em>Ascher (Elections Division #46), </em>to correct that deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining challenges relate to how the Attorney General\u2019s certified summary treats section 4 of the measures. Section 4 in each measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201c(1) Any state affirmative action programs not affected by this amendment shall be implemented by a standard of strict scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">\u201c(2) any [sic] state or local affirmative action programs not affected by this amendment shall have to prove that the effected [sic] benefactor has had a specific history of past disrimination [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Petitioners argue that those provisions warrant no mention in the summary, because they would not have a \u201cmajor effect\u201d if voters approve the measures. <em>See </em>ORS 250.035(2)(d) (ballot title shall contain a summary describing \u201cthe measure and its major effect\u201d). In support, petitioners contend that section 4 pertains only to state and local affirmative action programs that otherwise are \u201cnot affected\u201d by the measure and that, because section 1 of the measure would abolish most, if not all, state and local government affirmative action in Oregon, section 4 would affect few, if any, programs. In <em>Nakamoto, </em>322 Or at 186-88, we rejected that contention, and we again reject it here for the same reasons. <em>See Ascher v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #47), </em>322 Or 531, 535, 909 P2d 1223 (1996) (rejecting similar contention).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Petitioners next argue that section 4(1) would not have a \u201cmajor effect\u201d if voters approve the measure, because that provision merely codifies existing law. In support, petitioners argue that, under <em>Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., </em>488 US 469, 109 S Ct 706, 102 L Ed 2d 854 (1989), all state and local government affirmative action programs already must satisfy a standard of \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> We reject petitioners\u2019 argument, because its premise is faulty. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a standard of \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d applies to legislation directed at a \u201csuspect class\u201d of citizens. <em>Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Schools, </em>487 US 450, 457, 108 S Ct 2481, 101 L Ed 2d 399 (1988). However, not all affirmative action programs in Oregon are targeted at a \u201csuspect class\u201d of citizens. ORS 243.305(2) defines the phrase \u201caffirmative action\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>\u201ca method of ehminating the effects of past and present discrimination, intended or unintended, on the basis of race, religion, national origin, age, sex, <em>marital status or physical or mental disabilities.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The Supreme Court of the United States has not designated marital status or physical or mental disability as classifications that are inherently \u201csuspect.\u201d Nevertheless, section 4 requires that affirmative action programs that otherwise are unaffected by the measure, such as a program aimed at eliminating discrimination based on any of those characteristics, \u201cshall be implemented by a standard of strict scrutiny.\u201d Application of a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard to legislative programs that do not target a \u201csuspect class\u201d of citizens would constitute a change in the law. We therefore agree with the Attorney General that section 4(1) of the measures would have a \u201cmajor effect,\u201d if either measure is approved, and that ORS 250.035(2)(d) requires some mention of that effect in the summary. The Attorney General\u2019s description of that provision complies substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In the fight of the foregoing discussion, we modify the Attorney General\u2019s summary, with additions shown in italics and deletions shown in brackets, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">SUMMARY: Adopts statute. Oregon law now [forbids government discrimination based on race, rebgion, color, sex, national origin.

First, I dissent for the reasons expressed in <em>Sizemore v. Kulongoski, </em>322 Or 229, 239, 905 P2d 1146 (Unis, J., dissenting), <em>recon allowed </em>322 Or 387, 908 P2d 825 (1995). In that decision, I stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201c[T]o the extent that ORS 250.085(5) gives this court jurisdiction to draft and certify a ballot title for a proposed initiative measure that is different from the one certified by the Attorney General, that statute violates the principle of separation of powers embodied in Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">I continue to adhere to that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">I also dissent for the reasons expressed in <em>Ascher v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #46), </em>322 Or 516, 527, 909 P2d 1216 (1996) (Unis, J., dissenting). The majority in this case certifies a ballot title that closely resembles the ballot titles certified in <em>Ascher (Elections Division #46), Ascher v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #47), </em>322 Or 531, 909 P2d 1223 (1996), and <em>Ascher v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #49), </em>322 Or 550, 909 P2d 1228 (1996). While certifying ballot titles that closely resemble each other, the majority avoids any discussion concerning the impact of ORS 250.035(6) on this court\u2019s role in reviewing ballot titles and on its decision in this case. ORS 250.035(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">\u201cTo avoid confusion, a ballot title shall not resemble any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">For the reasons expressed in <em>Ascher (Elections Division #46), </em>322 Or at 527 (Unis, J., dissenting), I believe that ORS 250.035(6) raises important questions that the majority should address.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">A discussion concerning the impact of ORS 250.035(6) on this court\u2019s role in certifying ballot titles is particularly important in this case because the court certifies the same ballot title (Elections Division #48 and #50) for two initiative measures. The ballot titles certified by the court in this case not only \u201cresemble\u201d each other; they are identical.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
