An assessment of one-tenth of one per cent, upon the amount of its authorized capital was laid upon the company by the state board, the company having failed to make any return to the state board as required by the statute.

We think that public, policy requires that under the circumstances of this case the assessment should be set aside without costs, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
