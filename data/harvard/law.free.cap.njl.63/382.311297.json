Morrow.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b417-11\">Garrison, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APc\">Upon the trial of an indictment for having carnal knowledge of a woman under the age of consent, the defendant offered to prove his reputation by the following question put to a witness who lived in his neighborhood: \u201cDo you know what is his [defendant\u2019s] reputation for morality, virtue and honesty in living?\u201d To this question the prosecutor objected, stating as his sole ground that \u201c it makes no difference.\u201d The objection thus made was sustained and a bill of exceptions sealed, upon which error is now assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Evidence of the defendant\u2019s general reputation was, of course, admissible. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>State, </em>24 <em>Vroom </em>45.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">If his general reputation were admissible upon a specific indictment, his specific reputation with respect thereto was relevant. <em>Dally </em>v. <em>Overseers of Woodbridge, </em>1 <em>Zab. </em>491; <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>State, Id. </em>630. But his specific reputation in other respects was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">The contention of the state was that the question put to the defendant\u2019s witness went outside of the issue, in that it called for his reputation for \u201c honesty in living,\u201d which it was argued, referred only to financial probity, hence was not germane to an issue that turned upon sexual laxity.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">This distinction, which is not suggested by the objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>is not well founded in fact. The word \u201c honesty,\u201d from the Latin \u201c <em>honestus,\u201d </em>is essentially a word that takes its meaning from its context. Primarily, it means \u201c suitable,\u201d \u201c becoming\u201d or \u201cdecent\u201d \u2014 meanings that obviously lend themselves to diverse contexts. In monied transactions it means financial integrity; in affairs of state it means loyalty; in matters of friendship it mean's steadfastness; and so on. In sexual relations it imports chastity. This is an accepted signification.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In Webster\u2019s International Dictionary it is said to mean \u201c chastity, modesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">As early as 1385 Chaucer so used it, saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\u201c Why lyked me thy yelow heer to see More than the boundes of myn honestie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">In 1621, Burton, in the \u201cAnatomy of Melancholy,\u201d wrote, \u201cIt was commonly practiced in Diana\u2019s Temple for women to go barefoot over hot coals to try their honesties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Shakespeare constantly so used it, notably in the phrase, \u201c Wives may be merry and yet honest too.\u201d <em>Merry Wives, </em>IV., 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">In 1661, Pepys, in the Diary of August 11th, gives it this sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">In 1711, Steele, in the \u201cSpectator,\u201d No. 118, paragraph 2, says, \u201c The maid is <em>honest, </em>and the man dares not be otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">In Fletcher and Rowly\u2019s \u201c Maid of the Mill \u201d it is said, \u201c Her honesty was all her dower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">In 1749, Fielding, in \u201cTom Jones,\u201d XV., VIII., writes, \u201c Miss Nancy was, in vulgar language, soon made an honest woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">And Scott, in \u201cSt. Ronan\u2019s Well,\u201d chapter 25, gives it a like meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">The only conclusion from these citations is that common usage has given to the word \u201chonesty,\u201d the meaning of sexual propriety when the context so requires. In the question put to the witness the expression \u201chonesty in living\u201d was directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>coupled with \u201c morality and virtue.\u201d Clearly it had no alien meaning, and the question as a whole was proper. The contrary ruling deprived the defendant of a substantial element of his defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Another matter controverted upon the trial was the age of the prosecuting witness. Upon this issue the trial court admitted, over the defendant\u2019s objection, a written certificate of baptism in which the clergyman had given the date of birth. This was illegal evidence. It is true that the mother testified that her daughter was under the age of sixteen, but the jury saw the prosecuting witness, and upon the question of her age it may be that the clergyman\u2019s certificate had weight with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">For these errors the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
