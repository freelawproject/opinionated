The defendants challenge the interest of the prosecutor in the premises and have served notice requiring him to prove his interest. The differing opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>read in the eases of <em>Avon </em>v. <em>Neptune City, </em>28 <em>Vroom </em>701, and <em>West Jersey Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>362, have left involved in some doubt the question of the duty of the prosecutor of a <em>certiorari </em>to prove on final hearing his interest in the controversy he incites, but I understand it to-be settled that whenever it does in fact appear that a prose-* eutor has no such interest the writ should be dismissed as to him. <em>Tallon </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>31 <em>Id. </em>212. The defendants in this case pray a dismissal on this ground, and we feel constrained to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The prosecutor lives near the school-house, but in Piscataway township. His farm extends into Raritan, but by the General Tax law he is taxed only in Piscataway. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>3345,' <em>pi. </em>291; revived by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1896, <em>p. </em>180. He is, therefore, neither a resident nor a taxpayer in Raritan, and it seems clear that he has no interest to warrant his inquiring by <em>certiorari </em>into the action of the public authorities of that township.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The <em>certiorari </em>will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Application was made at the hearing to admit as a joint prosecutor Mr. Samuel E. Stelle. This gentleman, while shown to be a resident of Raritan, is not shown to be a taxpayer there or to have any children within school age. He seems to have no special interest in the controversy, and the motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
