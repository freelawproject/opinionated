He was mistaken. There is no such evidence. What misled the court were the following questions and answers :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What did you see him doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Carrying the mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>From where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\"><em>\u2018\u25a0A. </em>The Pennsylvania railroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>In a wagon or on foot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>On foot; sometimes he would have a little wagon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">If the examination of this witness had stopped here the court might have been justified in leaving the question to the jury; but farther on the witness was asked :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you ever see him driving the mail in a wagon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>How often ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I seen him that morning \u2014 the morning of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-16\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Before that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, he used to go up and down with a push-cart with the mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-18\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>How often had you seen him with anything but a pushcart ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-19\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not to my knowledge \u2014 only the morning of the .accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">In this state of the evidence the case of the plaintiff-was that Mrs. Wilson had been injured by a wagon belonging to the Adams Express Company, driven by one Fitzpatrick, who was, at the time, as the servant of the defendant, carrying the United States mail, which previously to this occasion he had \u25a0carried either on foot or in a push-cart. There is nothing to \u25a0show that the defendant furnished the wagon, or authorized \u25a0or even knew of its use. Even if it be considered that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>an even question whether the defendant authorized its servant to use the wagon or whether he did it of his own accord, the plaintiff cannot recover; for when the testimony is evenly balanced there is no preponderance in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">This state of affairs was not cured by the defendant\u2019s case, for its testimony was that the servant was provided with a push-cart and instructed to use it when the mail was not light enough to be carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The same misconception of the evidence entered into the final submission of the case to the jury in that it was submitted upon a point with respect to which there, was no testimony in support of the plaintiff\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The rule to show cause is made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
