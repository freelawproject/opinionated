That meeting being adjourned to June 14th, 1897, the ordinance was then passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">This was unlawful. The adjourned session held on June 14th was but a part of the stated meeting commenced on June 7th. <em>Staates </em>v. <em>Borough of Washington, </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>605. The statute requires that the ordinance should not be passed at the same stated meeting at which it was introduced or substantially amended. <em>Cowen </em>v. <em>Wildwood, </em>31 <em>Id. </em>365, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">The ordinance is therefore set aside, and with it, of course, the conviction of the prosecutor. The prosecutor is entitled to costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
