CHRISTOPHER GARRITY, DEFENDANT IN ERROR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b84-8\">Submitted December 5, 1898</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWh\">Decided February 27, 1899.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-9\">When, in the summing up to the jury, the defendant\u2019s counsel refuses to reply to the opening argument made on behalf of the plaintiff on account of its meagre and unsubstantial character, it is discretionary with the court to grant or refuse counsel for the plaintiff permission to further address the jury. If such permission is granted the defendant has a right to be heard in reply to such further address, and if he exercises that right the plaintiff is then entitled to make the closing argument.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-10\">On error to the Monmouth Common Pleas.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b84-11\">Before Magie, Chief Justice, and Justices Dixon, Garrison and Gummere.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>For the plaintiff in error, <em>Applegate &amp; Hope.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\">For the defendant in error, <em>James D.

Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then proceeded \u201c to sum up the case,\u201d to which defendant\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that, as he had not answered the opening argument there was nothing for plaintiff to reply to. The court, however, permitted plaintiff\u2019s counsel to proceed with his second argument notwithstanding the objection. At its close defendant\u2019s counsel asked to be permitted to reply to it. This request was refused by the court and to this ruling exception was taken and sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">We think that in this refusal there was error. Ordinarily a plaintiff who makes a mere nominal opening does so at his peril, and, if the defendant then submits his case without argument, the plaintiff will not be allowed to make a second argument. But, although this is the customary practice, it is always within the discretion of the court, when such a case arises, to permit the making of a second argument by the plaintiff, or rather, to state it more accurately, to make a fuller and more complete opening; and such permission will usually be granted when it appears, that plaintiff has been led into making merely a formal opening, by the action of the defendant. When a second and more extended opening is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>permitted, however, the defendant is entitled to reply to it if he so desires, and if he does so, the plaintiff then has a right to make the closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The refusal of the court to permit the defendant\u2019s counsel to reply to the enlarged opening of the plaintiff deprived him of a substantial right, and the judgment below should therefore be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
