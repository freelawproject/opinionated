They only became bound, under their contract, provided the plaintiff sold to the coal company \u201ccoal to an amount not exceeding in value $900.\u201d These words are restrictive; they were intended as a limitation upon the quantity of sales to be made on the credit of the defendants, and the plaintiff lost the benefit of the guarantee by making sales in excess of the stipulated amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In order that the effect of this decision may not be misunderstood by the parties, we deem it proper to state that it is based entirely upon the wording of the guarantee as recited in the declaration; we have not examined the copy of that instrument which is annexed to the declaration, it being no part of that pleading. It may be that the terms of the guarantee have not been set out with accuracy by the pleader, and that an amendment of the declaration will be necessaiy before the rights of the parties can be judicially determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">As the pleadings now stand, the defendant is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
