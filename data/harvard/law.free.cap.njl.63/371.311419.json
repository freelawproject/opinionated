McCully, who became thereby the owner of said bond, and entitled to the principal and interest thereon. It further avers that on July 4th, 1894, by virtue of the provisions of an amendment to the Public Instruction act, the said School District No. 1, of the county of Bergen, and the corporation known as the trustees of School District No. 1, in the county of Bergen, were consolidated with the other school districts in the township of Ridge-field under the name and designation of the plaintiffs in this action, and that by virtue of said act of the legislature, the bond of which McCully was the bearer became the obligation and indebtedness of the plaintiffs, who were legally bound to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">It further avers that after the said bond became the obligation and indebtedness of these plaintiffs, the borough of Cliffside Park was formed out of the township of Ridgefield, and became a separate and distinct school district \u00e1nd corporation by the name of <em>\u201c </em>The Board of Education of the Borough of Cliffside Park, in the County of Bergen,\u201d and that within the territorial limits of the said borough of Cliff-side Park was and is the school-house and property formerly belonging to the plaintiffs in this action, by reason of the consolidation of School District No. 1, in the county of Bergen, with these plaintiffs, and for the erection of which the said bond was issued, and that thereby the said defendants became entitled to said school-house and property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">It further avers that on September 5th, 1896, an action was commenced in this court by said McCully against the plaintiffs to recover the amount of his said bond, and that such proceedings were had therein that on February 16th, 1897, McCully recovered a judgment against the plaintiff's for $1,227.59.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>It further avers that the plaintiffs upon a writ of execution issued against them upon such judgment paid, in satisfaction thereof, the sum of $1,342.55, and that by means thereof, and according to the tenor and effect of an act entitled <em>\u201cA </em>supplement to an act entitled \u2018An act to establish a system of public instruction (Eevision),\u2019 passed March 27th, 1874,\u201d approved April 6th, 1897, and a further supplement to the same act approved April 22d, 1897, the defendants became liable to reimburse and pay to the plaintiffs the sum of money paid by the latter upon the said judgment, with interest.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">Before Magie, Chief Justice, and Justices Garrison, Lippincott and Collins.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-6\">For the plaintiff, <em>Charles J.

The averment is that the bond was issued pursuant to the Public Instruction act of March 27th, 1874. The second cause of demurrer assigned by defendant insists that this statement is insufficient, because by that act authority to issue such bonds by school districts requires the consent of the inhabitants of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">When corporate bonds of a municipality are issued by special agents having limited powers, the declaration on such bonds must exhibit the possession of such powers. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Bernards, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>219; <em>Cotton </em>v. <em>New Providence, </em>18 <em>Id. </em>401. But when corporate bonds are issued by general agents or the corporation itself, no such averments are necessary. <em>Montague </em>v. <em>Church School, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>218 ; <em>Rahway Savings Institution </em>v. <em>Rahway, </em>24 <em>Id. </em>48.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The averment of this count that the bond in question was issued by the corporation known as the Trustees of School District No. 1, in the county of Bergen, is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The third cause of demurrer assigned by defendant is that the acts of the legislature of April 6th, 1897, and of April 22d, 1897, upon which the liability of the defendant to the plaintiff is founded are void because the objects of said acts are not expressed in their titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The provisions of the act of April 6th, 1897, were construed by this court in the case of <em>McCully </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Ridgefield Township, ante p. </em>18. It was there held that the act imposed the indebtedness of a bond such as that in question upon a separate school district set off from a township, if there was within its limits a schoolhouse belonging to the board of education of the township and for the erection of which.there is an indebtedness on such bond for which the said board is liable, and that the said indebtedness shall be assumed and become the obligation of the board of education of the set off school district, and that whenever the board of education of the township is compelled to pay by suit and judgment at law any portion of such indebtedness, the board of education of the set off school district must repay to the board of education of the township the amount of the judgment, with interest, and the same may be collected by action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The objection now made to this legislation does not seem to have been presented to the mind of the court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The provisions of the act of April 22d, 1897, substantially imposes the same obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The act to establish a system of public instruction, approved March 27th, 1874, conferred corporate powers for school purposes, including the power to purchase land, to build school-houses, to borrow money for those purposes and to incur and issue obligations therefor. These corporate powers are plainly within the title of the act under the construction given to our constitutional provision on that subject in cases too well known to require citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Legislation properly apportioning or imposing obligations that have been thus issued, among such corporations as the legislature deemed to be properly liable, is within the scope of the title of the Public Instruction act in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The result is that the demurrer must be overruled and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment thereon.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
