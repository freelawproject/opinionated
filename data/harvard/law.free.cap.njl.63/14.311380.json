III. </em>36; <em>Pie </em>v. <em>Coke, Hob. </em>128; <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>8 <em>Conn. </em>71; 1 <em>Enaycl. Pl. &amp; Pr. </em>753. In <em>Combe </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1423, Lord Mansfield questioned the decision in Pie <em>v. </em>Coke, but not on the doctrine above stated, doubting merely whether \u201c the same day \u201d necessarily meant in law \u201c the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The foundation of the doctrine is the maxim, \u201c <em>Nemo bis vexari debet pro ead.em causa.\u201d </em>When a recovery in one suit would answer the purposes of a recovery in both, the prosecution of two suits is vexatious, and the second will be abated if the court can ascertain which is the second, and if it cannot, both will abate.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">The plea seems to bring the present case within the rule, and consequently the writ must be quashed, unless the plaintiff obtains leave to withdraw his demurrer and reply.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
