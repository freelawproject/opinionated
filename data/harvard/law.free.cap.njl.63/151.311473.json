Erom that point there was a break in the line for three miles where, by the return, they did not lay any road. Their return shows that from the end of the break of three miles, starting again, they laid a road by courses and lines numbered 94, 95 and 96, to a stake quite indefinitely located, and there to end, which ending point, however, it is conceded, is about four miles short of the ending point designated in the said application. The return states that no road was laid over this intervening space because it could not be maintained by reason of the near approach of the ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">This return is, in fact, of two separate, unconnected roads, and without any sort of relation to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The return is so entirely at variance with the road applied \u2022 for that it cannot be sustained. Q</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">It is also admitted in the agreed facts that the said road in the return from course 12 to the end of course 27, about ten thousand feet, is laid within and through the corporate limits of the duly-incorporated borough of Harvey Cedars, and from the thirty-seventh course to the end of the forty-first course, about seven thousand feet, is laid within the corporate limits of another duly-incorporated borough, Long Beach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>City. As boroughs of this state have the exclusive power to lay out, regulate, &amp;c., streets and highways within their respective corporate limits, any proceedings under the General Road act of this state in the way of laying out <em>\\ </em>ublic roads within the limits of such municipalities are invalid. <em>In re Public Road, </em>25 <em>Vroom </em>539.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The order appointing surveyors of the- highways in this matter is vacated and the return of said surveyors is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
