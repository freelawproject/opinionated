Obviously the purpose of the proceeding is to try the title of a <em>de facto </em>officer. This cannot be done on <em>certiorari </em>even by a claimant to the office, much less by a stranger. <em>Quo warranto, </em>and not <em>certiorari, </em>is the only appropriate proceeding in such a case. <em>Henry </em>v. <em>City Council of Camden, </em>13 <em>Vroom </em>335; <em>Stites </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Cumberland, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>340; <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Hudson, </em>31 <em>Id. </em>364.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The writ in this case is therefore dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
