The City cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. The City also requests sanctions for frivolous appeal under Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. On the merits, we hold that the district court correctly dismissed the suit. We also hold that the City is entitled to relief for frivolous appeal under Rule 38 and section 1927, and that the district court should reconsider its Rule 11 ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-19\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-20\">The Taxpayers\u2019 amended complaint below complained of a denial of due process concerning the City\u2019s 1984 tax ordinance, in two respects. First, it was alleged that this ordinance increased the tax rate imposed by the City over that prevailing in 1983 and that, accordingly, under the Texas statutes and Constitution, and under the United States Constitution, the plaintiffs were entitled to have a public hearing by the City on the 1984 ordinance, but no such hearing was afforded. Second, it was alleged that after being deprived of such a hearing by the City, the Taxpayers filed suit against the City in the proper state trial court complaining of that denial, that both parties filed motions for summary-judgment, that the state trial court granted the City\u2019s motion and that that was error because there were disputed questions of fact, and that the Taxpayers were not afforded a proper hearing. The Taxpayers further alleged that they appealed the state trial court\u2019s adverse judgment to the state court of appeals, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, 716 S.W.2d 578, and that they thereafter appealed the case to the Texas Supreme Court, which on December 17, 1986 refused the Taxpayers\u2019 application for writ of error so that the decisions of the state trial court and of the state court of appeals became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>The Taxpayers further alleged in the present suit that \u201c[t]he combined action of the City and the courts of the State of Texas has served to deprive Plaintiffs of the right to a public hearing, and the right to other hearings allowed under due process of law.\u201d The plaintiffs prayed for relief, including a declaration \u201cthat the City and State of Texas proceedings here complained of are invalid and void\u201d as contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. It is unquestioned that this reference to \u201cproceedings here complained of\u201d included all the state court proceedings described in the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint also sought a judgment declaring \u201cinvalid that portion of the [City\u2019s] tax levy in 1984 that exceeded the 1983 tax levy by the City\u201d and ancillary relief, including attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">The City filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on the grounds, among others, that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction because the essence of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was an attempt to revise or modify the state court judgments and that, in any event, the suit was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>The State similarly resisted the suit, alleged it had not given its consent to be sued, had immunity under the United States Constitution, and that it was not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of section 1983. The City, in connection with its motions, furnished the district court copies of the pleadings, judgment, and other relevant papers in the state action. The plaintiffs furnished no meaningful eviden-tiary response to the City\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">In a well-considered opinion supported by numerous authorities cited, the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs, regardless of how they labeled their claim, in substance sought review of the state court judicial proceedings or matters arising out of those proceedings. Alternatively, the district court ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was barred by <em>res judicata </em>on account of the final judgment in the state court suit. We agree, largely for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 state court suit specifically complained that the City\u2019s 1984 tax ordinance had raised the tax rate over that for 1983, but that the City had not afforded a public hearing in connection therewith as was required by the Texas statutes and Constitution. The plaintiffs\u2019 state court pleading, in its paragraph XX, further specifically alleged that the City\u2019s conduct in this connection, as alleged elsewhere throughout that pleading, deprived the plaintiffs of property and liberty without due process of law in violation of the Texas Constitution \u201cand the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d In paragraph XXI of their state court pleading, the plaintiffs also complained that the Texas Property Tax Code is unconstitutional and void and deprives the plaintiffs of property and liberty \u201ccontrary to ... the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments] to the United States Constitution.\u201d Among the relief the plaintiffs sought in the state suit was a declaration that the City\u2019s 1984 and 1985 tax ordinances \u201care unconstitutional,\u201d that the City\u2019s 1984 tax is illegal and void, that a portion of the Texas Property Tax Code is unconstitutional and void, and a mandatory injunction demanding that the City set the proper tax rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">The state trial court judgment decreed that the plaintiffs take nothing from the City and denied all relief requested by the plaintiffs. This judgment was rendered in response to the motion for summary judgment of the City. Apparently the City\u2019s motion was founded on the proposition that the 1984 tax ordinance did not increase the tax rate. The plaintiffs appealed to the state court of appeals, contending that summary judgment was improper because there was a disputed fact issue as to whether the taxes had been increased, and also complaining that the state trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>should not have rendered a take-nothing judgment as to their entire suit because the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not expressly address their constitutional claims. The court of appeals affirmed, noting that the undisputed summary judgment evidence demonstrated there was no tax increase, and the plaintiffs had not, as they should have, opposed the summary judgment on the grounds that it did not properly reach their constitutional claims. Thereafter, the plaintiffs asserted essentially those same two arguments to the Texas Supreme Court, which refused to review the case, with the result that the state trial court judgment became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\">It is clear that the state trial court judgment was one on the merits, and ruled adversely to the plaintiffs on all of their claims, decreeing they take nothing by their suit. Since the plaintiffs\u2019 state court pleadings clearly raised the same constitutional complaints about the 1984 tax ordinance that the plaintiffs seek to raise in their present federal suit, it is evident that this aspect of the present suit is nothing but an attempt to challenge the validity of the state trial court judgment that the 1984 tax ordinance did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 federal constitutional rights. However, such an attack can only be made by review in the United States Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 and the district court had no jurisdiction to entertain such an attack. <em>Carbonell v. Louisiana Department of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>772 F.2d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1985). This conclusion likewise applies to the only other claim asserted in the complaint, namely, that the state trial court erred by rendering summary judgment when the facts were disputed, and by rendering a take-nothing judgment as to the plaintiffs\u2019 entire suit when the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment had been founded only on the no tax increase theory. Again, if the state trial court erred in this respect, the plaintiffs\u2019 remedy was to cure that error by appeal through the Texas courts and ultimately to the United States Supreme Court, and not by an independent proceeding in the federal district court. <em>See, e.g., Lampkin-Asam v. Supreme Court of Florida, </em>601 F.2d 760 (5th Cir.1979), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1013, 100 S.Ct. 662, 62 L.Ed.2d 642 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">Moreover, it is evident that the plaintiffs\u2019 federal suit is barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The same claim of invalidity of the City\u2019s 1984 tax ordinance, which is made in this federal suit, was included in the state suit, and the state court judgment, by decreeing that the plaintiffs take nothing by their suit, clearly determined that claim on the merits and adversely to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs in this federal suit are the same parties who were plaintiffs in the state suit, and the City is a defendant in the federal suit as it was also the defendant in the state suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the City that the City\u2019s 1984 tax ordinance violated their rights under the United States Constitution is barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The plaintiffs say that this is not so because the state trial court did not expressly rule on their constitutional claims. However, the state trial court\u2019s judgment does not state the basis of its ruling, but rather merely renders judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing by their suit. The judgment is plainly on the merits as to all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in that suit. Indeed, the bar of <em>res judicata </em>extends to all legal theories which would support recovery in respect to the same nucleus of operative facts. Under our decisions in <em>Gregory v. Drury, </em>809 F.2d 249, 253-54 (5th Cir.1987), and <em>Flores v. Edinburg Consolidated I.S.D., </em>741 F.2d 773 (5th Cir.1984), the state trial court judgment is plainly preclusive of the present suit. <em>See also, e.g., Segrest v. Segrest, </em>649 S.W.2d 610, 612 (Tex.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">We turn now to the City\u2019s cross-appeal, complaining of the district court\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>nial of its request for sanctions under Fed. R.Civ.P. 11. Promptly after the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was filed, the City moved for dismissal and also for Rule 11 sanctions. The case remained pending for approximately seven more months, during which time numerous motions and the like were filed. The City clearly and adequately disclosed the base-lessness of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit, but the plaintiffs nevertheless persisted in it. The district court\u2019s order on the motion for sanctions does not state whether or not a Rule 11 violation was found, but merely concludes that \u201csanctions should be denied\u201d without stating any reasons. Nor does anything in the transcript of the sanctions hearing reflect any basis for the district court\u2019s action. Here, the basis for sanctions is not a failure to investigate the facts, as these have all along been essentially fully known to all parties and undisputed insofar as they are material to the viability of the plaintiffs\u2019 federal suit. Rather, the sanctions motion poses the question of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 original and amended complaint, and the plaintiffs\u2019 various motions, were submitted without \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d as to whether the document \u201cis warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">The district court\u2019s order denying sanctions was rendered before, and therefore without the benefit of, our decision in <em>Thomas v. Capital Security Services, Inc., </em>836 F.2d 866 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc). Under <em>Thomas, </em>we review a denial of Rule 11 sanctions under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 872. However, a district court abuses its discretion if it finds a Rule 11 violation and does not impose some form of sanctions. <em>Id. </em>at 876. Although this Court does not routinely require district court findings and conclusions in Rule 11 cases, the record must reflect some reason for the court\u2019s denial of the requested Rule 11 sanctions when the face of the record appears to warrant the Rule\u2019s application. <em>Id. </em>at 883. That is the situation here. The Taxpayers\u2019 legal arguments in support of their federal suit are not warranted by existing law or any good faith argument for its extension, modification, or reversal. It is impossible to tell whether or not the district court found there was a Rule 11 violation. If it found a Rule 11 violation, but nevertheless declined to impose any sanctions, that would be contrary to <em>Thomas. </em>On the other hand, if the court found there was no Rule 11 violation, then, at the least, in light of this record, the district court was called on to make some explanation on the record of why it reached that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of sanctions and remand that aspect of the case to the district court for reconsideration and further action in accordance with this opinion and <em>Thomas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAP\">We next turn to the City\u2019s motion in this Court seeking damages and double costs on appeal under Fed.R.App.P. 38, and requiring the Taxpayers\u2019 counsel to personally satisfy such excess costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We conclude that the Taxpayers\u2019 appeal involves legal points not arguable on their merits, and that the appeal is accordingly frivolous. The City is thus entitled to its Rule 38 costs reasonably incurred on this appeal. <em>See United States v. One Parcel of Real Property, </em>831 F.2d 566, 568 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 692 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>749 F.2d 217 (5th Cir.1984); <em>News-Texan, Inc. v. City of Garland, Texas, </em>814 F.2d 216, 221 (5th Cir.1987). The City is also entitled to relief against the Taxpayers\u2019 counsel personally for the unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of these proceedings by the Taxpayers\u2019 appeal to this Court and their various motions filed in connection therewith. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927; <em>One Parcel, </em>831 F.2d at 568-69; <em>Harney, </em>786 F.2d at 692; <em>McGoldrick Oil Co. v. Campbell, Athey Zukowski, </em>793 F.2d 649, 653-54 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Olympia Co., Inc. v. Celotex Corp., </em>771 F.2d 888, 892-94 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"A80\">Accordingly, we grant the motion of the City for damages under Fed.R.App.P. 38, but remand to the district court for determination of the proper amount, namely, the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>penses reasonably incurred by the City by virtue of this appeal. We also grant the City\u2019s motion to assess such costs against the Taxpayers\u2019 counsel personally, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, so that he or they will be liable for them personally as well as the Taxpayers\u2019 being liable therefor. On remand, the district court should determine the amount of excess costs incurred by virtue of this appeal. The district court shall also apportion the amounts awarded as between the Taxpayers and their counsel. <em>See Harney, </em>786 F.2d at 692; <em>Olympia Co., </em>771 F.2d at 894.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit. We vacate the district court\u2019s denial of the City\u2019s motion for Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 sanctions, and we remand the matter of Rule 11 sanctions to the district court for further proceedings consistent herewith and with <em>Thomas. </em>We deny the motions of the plaintiffs for relief under Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We grant the motions of the City under Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 for damages and excess costs by reason of this appeal, and we remand that matter to the district court to determine the amount of such damages and excess costs and to apportion the same between the Taxpayers and their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">. In their reply brief on appeal, the plaintiffs have since stated that they withdraw this request for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">. It is true that the State, a named defendant in the present federal suit, was not a party to the prior state suit. However, the State is clearly immune from federal court suit under the Eleventh Amendment and is not a \"person\u201d for purposes of section 1983. Therefore, dismissal of the State also mandated on these grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">. The Taxpayers also request Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 relief against the City and its counsel. This request is frivolous and is denied. Rule 38 is inapplicable because the City is an appellee. As to section 1927, it is the Taxpayers and their counsel, and not the City or its counsel, which has unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
