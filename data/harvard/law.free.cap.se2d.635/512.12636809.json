Because the evidence supported a finding that Defendant personally assisted the principal\n   in avoiding detection and arrest, we uphold Defendant's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Calvin L. Brewington, Jr. was indicted as an accessory after the fact to the first-degree murder of Rogerick Antwon Hall by Kelly Durant Rudisill. Before Defendant's trial, Rudisill pled guilty to the second-degree murder of Hall. At Defendant's trial, the State presented evidence that Rudisill shot and killed Hall on the evening of 22 February 2004; Defendant also conceded in his brief to this Court that Rudisill killed Hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Marvin Sutton, a friend of Defendant, testified at trial that he was with Defendant on the evening of 22 February 2004, when the Defendant drove Sutton in his purple Nissan Altima to purchase marijuana. According to Sutton, while the two were in the car, Defendant received a call from an individual Sutton believed to be Defendant's brother, Thomas Brewington. During the call, Defendant reportedly said something along the lines of, \"We got him,\" and that Rudisill had \"gotten his stripes.\" Sutton testified that he believed the conversation referred to Rudisill's beating up Hall; later evidence showed that the attack was in revenge for Hall's robbery of Rudisill, Thomas Brewington, and two other friends several months earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the phone call, Defendant and Sutton drove to a nearby neighborhood, where they saw Hall lying in the middle of the street and realized he had been shot. They left without getting out of the car, and Defendant made a phone call, upset, complaining that they had not known that Hall had been shot and that they should not have gone to the neighborhood. After leaving, Defendant, Sutton, Thomas Brewington, and Rudisill met at Defendant's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hall died from his injuries later that night at the hospital. Following the shooting, the police started looking for a purple Nissan Altima and a black Suzuki Sidekick seen by witnesses in the neighborhood. Defendant drove a purple Nissan Altima, and his sister owned a black Suzuki Sidekick, which Thomas Brewington was seen driving on the night of the shooting. Police later found a bullet hole from the gas tank area of the Suzuki, and a projectile fragment removed from the hole was found to be consistent with a nine-millimeter bullet. The State presented further evidence that Hall was shot three times in the back and once in the leg, and that the two projectiles removed from his body were consistent with a nine-millimeter bullet. Eight spent shell casings from a nine-millimeter handgun were found at the scene, in addition to a .22 caliber handgun removed from Hall's jacket pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two days after the shooting, the police released photographs of Rudisill, Thomas Brewington, and Sutton to the local media. The same day, Defendant approached a friend, Decarlos Wright, and offered to pay him two thousand dollars to use a car for two days in order to leave town. The two then picked up Rudisill and Thomas Brewington, who had bags packed for the trip, and headed out of town on the highway; Wright testified that he was not informed as to the ultimate destination for the trip but that Rudisill stated in the car that he \"wasn't going to come back.\" Defendant, Rudisill, and Wright were subsequently arrested after being stopped by police in Mississippi; Thomas Brewington was later apprehended in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant was charged with being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder for the assistance he personally provided to Rudisill in escaping detection and arrest. He was then convicted of being an accessory after the fact to second-degree murder; after entering judgment, the trial court sentenced Defendant to prison for a term of 77 to 102 months. In his appeal from that judgment, Defendant contends (I) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge for failure to present substantial evidence; (II) the trial court committed plain error by instructing the jury as to the lesser offense of accessory after the fact to second-degree murder; and, (III) in the alternative, the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury as to the lesser-included offense of accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"When a defendant moves to dismiss a charge against him on the ground of\n   insufficiency of the evidence, the trial court must determine whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged and of the defendant being the perpetrator of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, a review of the record reveals that the State offered testimony from Marvin Sutton concerning Rudisill's guilt, circumstantial evidence linking Rudisill to the vehicle used in the shooting, and Rudisill's own guilty plea to the crime. Sutton further testified concerning a phone call in which Defendant learned that Rudisill had \"gotten his stripes\" by attacking Hall. Moreover, Decarlos Wright testified that Defendant offered two thousand dollars for the use of his car to leave town with Rudisill, and that they did, in fact, travel as far south as Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Taken in the light most favorable to the State, it was reasonable for the jury to accept this evidence as adequate to support its conclusion that Rudisill committed second-degree murder, as well as that Defendant knew Rudisill had killed Hall and subsequently assisted him in escaping detection and arrest. As such, we find that the State offered substantial evidence of each element of the charge of accessory after the fact to murder in the second degree. We therefore affirm the trial court's denial of Defendant's motion to dismiss the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant next asserts that the trial court committed a plain error, which requires him to show on appeal that the asserted error: (1) is a \"fundamental error, something so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done\"; (2) \"amounts to a denial of a fundamental right of the accused;\" (3) has \"resulted in a miscarriage of justice or in the denial to appellant of a fair trial\"; (4) \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\"; or, (5) was an instructional mistake that \"had a probable impact on the jury's finding that the defendant was guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our Supreme Court has defined the test for determining whether an instruction on second-degree murder is required as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The determinative factor is what the State's evidence tends to prove. If the evidence is sufficient to fully satisfy the State's burden of proving each and every element of the offense of murder in the first degree, including premeditation and deliberation, and there is no evidence to negate these elements ..., the trial judge should properly exclude from jury consideration the possibility of a conviction of second degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the physical evidence, such as the four gunshot wounds to Rudisill, could have supported a finding of premeditation and deliberation, Marvin Sutton also testified that he thought Hall had been \"jumped,\" which could support a reasonable inference that the attack had been spontaneous. The State did not present overwhelming evidence of first-degree murder such as to preclude an instruction on second-degree murder; rather, both due process and the evidence warranted an instruction on both offenses given that the evidence could support either conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We therefore hold that the trial court did not commit plain error by instructing the\n   jury on the lesser-included offense of accessory after the fact to second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the alternative, Defendant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Defendant argues that if Rudisill did not act with premeditation and deliberation in killing Hall, he instead acted in imperfect self-defense such that the killing was voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice and without premeditation or deliberation.\n   <em>\n    State v.
