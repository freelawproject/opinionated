For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondent-mother is the mother of Amy, who was born 27 November 2004. Respondent-mother is also the mother of Karen, born 19 November 2002, and Chris, born 3 November 2003. On 8 September 2004, Chris was adjudicated abused and neglected due to serious injuries, including multiple bruises which appeared to be intentionally inflicted, as well as life-threatening trauma to the liver. On the same date, Karen was adjudicated neglected. The trial court determined that both Karen and Chris were at ongoing risk of injury and the children were placed in the legal custody of the Durham County Department of Social Services (\"DSS\"), with physical placement with the paternal grandparents. The trial court also ordered both respondent-mother and father to have mental health evaluations, receive recommended treatment, obtain and maintain stable employment, and complete a parenting program. Respondent-mother was also ordered to obtain her GED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The first review hearing following the entry of the order adjudicating Chris abused and neglected and Karen neglected was held 29 November 2004. The trial court again ordered respondent-mother and father to comply with the 8 September 2004 order and receive a mental health evaluation, obtain employment, complete a parenting program, and for respondent-mother to make progress on her GED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Amy was born on 27 November 2004, but remained hospitalized for some weeks thereafter due to complications at birth. A visit to the home of respondent-mother, conducted by DSS on 10 December 2004, revealed that respondent-mother did not have a crib and did not appear prepared to care for a newborn. DSS held a meeting with respondent-mother and father on 15 December 2004, prior to the discharge of Amy from the hospital, at which the parents agreed to allow DSS to assume custody of Amy and to place her in the physical custody of the paternal grandparents with her siblings. DSS assumed custody, and filed a juvenile petition on 17 December 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Amy's father was found guilty of abusing Chris, and was sentenced and incarcerated subsequent to the filing of the juvenile petition,\n   but prior to the adjudication and dispositional hearing as to Amy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In an order entered 2 May 2005, the trial court adjudicated Amy neglected. The trial court granted legal custody to DSS with physical placement with the paternal grandparents, supervised visits with respondent-mother, and no visitation with father. Respondent-mother was referred to the Child Support Enforcement Office for establishment of support, and was again ordered to have a mental health evaluation, receive recommended treatment, obtain and maintain stable employment, complete a parenting program, and obtain her GED. Father was also again ordered to have a mental health evaluation and receive recommended treatment, and to complete a parenting program. Respondent-mother appeals from this order. Father does not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellees initially contend that the appeal before this Court is moot. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Our Supreme Court has recently determined that a trial court retains \"jurisdiction to terminate parental rights during the pendency of a custody order appeal in the same case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re R.T.W.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804066\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/539/#p553\">\n    359 N.C. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p498\">\n    614 S.E.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    R.T.W.,\n   </em>\n   the respondent-mother appealed a custody review order to this Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p498\">\n    at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p498\">\n    614 S.E.2d at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Despite respondent's consent after Amy's birth to allow DSS to assume custody of the child, these findings support the trial court's conclusion that a substantial risk of impairment existed for Amy, and that Amy was therefore a neglected child as defined by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-101(15). The assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As the trial court's findings of fact are supported by clear and convincing evidence, and the findings of fact support the conclusions of law, we affirm the order of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Chief Judge MARTIN and Judge McCULLOUGH concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Names of all minor children have been changed to protect their identity pursuant to N.C.R.App. P. 26(g)(4).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    We note that our General Assembly has recently amended N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1003 (2005) to provide that, pending disposition of an appeal, the trial court no longer continues to exercise jurisdiction over termination proceedings. However, this statutory change applies only to petitions filed on or after 1 October 2005 and therefore does not apply to the appeal in this matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
