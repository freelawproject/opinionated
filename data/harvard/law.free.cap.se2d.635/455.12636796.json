We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    A. State's Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show that the victim (\"A.W.\") was born on 6 January 1988 during the marriage of her mother and defendant. A.W.'s mother and defendant divorced within two years after her birth. A.W. and her mother moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Defendant continued to reside in North Carolina, and A.W. visited defendant during summers and holidays. A.W. testified during the summer of 2000 she was twelve-years-old and visited defendant. A.W. fell asleep on defendant's couch and awoke after he pulled down her covers and inserted his fingers into her vagina. A.W. pushed defendant away and ran into another room. A.W. did not tell her mother about the incident because defendant apologized and she did not think such conduct would re-occur. This was the only incident during the summer of 2000\n   of sexual contact between defendant and A.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the summer of 2001 at age thirteen, A.W. again visited defendant. Defendant entered A.W.'s room either \"every night or every-other night\" and inserted his fingers in A.W.'s vagina. Defendant also masturbated to the point of ejaculation in the presence of A.W. A.W. tried to avoid defendant's behavior by sleeping in her brother's bedroom. A.W. did not tell anyone about these summer 2001 abuses and assaults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.W. visited defendant during Thanksgiving or Christmas 2001 and during the summer of 2002. During these visits, defendant engaged in these past behaviors: defendant entered A.W.'s room and inserted his fingers into A.W.'s vagina. During the summer of 2002, defendant tried to force A.W. to touch his penis, but she refused. After this summer, A.W. told a friend about the assaults, but did not tell any family members. In addition to the sexual assaults, A.W. testified defendant had provided alcohol to her on occasion and regularly supplied her with marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The last incident of defendant sexually touching A.W. occurred in May or June 2003 when she was fifteen-years-old and visited defendant to attend her brother's high school graduation. While A.W. stayed in a room with her cousin, defendant entered their room and inserted his fingers into her vagina. A.W. realized if defendant would sexually assault her, while others were present in the room, he would not cease these behaviors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.W. was scheduled to visit with defendant again in the summer of 2003. A.W. refused and told her mother she would not go because of defendant's behavior. A.W.'s mother cancelled the trip and called the police. On 10 June 2003, A.W. gave a statement to Concord Police Detective Landers (\"Detective Landers\") and related defendant's behaviors. A.W. told Detective Landers that defendant had inserted his finger into her vagina once during the summer of 2000, and two or three times each week during visits in the summer of 2001, Thanksgiving in 2001, and during the summer of 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State presented testimony from Dr. James Powell (\"Dr.Powell\"), a clinical psychologist with a specialization in child sex abuse cases. Dr. Powell met A.W. in June 2003. Marijuana was found inside A.W.'s purse while she was on school grounds and she was expelled. Dr. Powell learned about defendant's conduct during interviews with A.W. He testified A.W.'s behaviors were consistent with those of a sexually abused child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State also presented testimony from A.D., defendant's former step-daughter, and S.M. A.D. testified that during 1995 and 1996, defendant entered her room at night, inserted his finger into her vagina, and insisted she \"masturbate him to where he would ejaculate.\" A.D. told her mother about defendant's behavior. A.D.'s mother divorced defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   S.M. testified she visited defendant's son and A.W.'s older brother in defendant's apartment when she was fifteen years old. S.M. fell asleep on defendant's couch. Defendant awoke S.M., and told her that she could not sleep on his couch, and led her into his bedroom. S.M. fell asleep on defendant's bed, but awoke to find defendant \"playing with\" her vagina. Defendant tried to force S.M.'s legs open and touched her pubic hair. Defendant was unable to pry S.M.'s legs open and ceased his assault. S.M. left defendant's bedroom and telephoned her mother, who came to defendant's apartment and picket S.M. up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.W.'s mother corroborated A.W.'s testimony concerning the time periods of her visits with defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    B. Defendant's Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant's sister testified that he had a reputation for honesty and truthfulness. She stated A.W. and defendant had a good relationship. A.W. had confided in her about alcohol use, but never mentioned that defendant had inappropriately touched her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   S.M.'s mother, Audrey, testified that she had known defendant all of her life. She stated defendant and A.W. had a good relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant testified and denied inserting his fingers into A.W.'s vagina or masturbating in front of her. Defendant denied providing\n   A.W. with marijuana, and stated A.W. had used marijuana since 1998 when A.W.'s mother found marijuana in A.W.'s clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On 17 July 2003, the grand jury indicted defendant on one count of first-degree sex offense, for acts occurring in June through August 2000, and two counts of statutory sex offense, for acts occurring in November 2001 and June through August 2002. The jury found defendant guilty on all charges. The trial court sentenced defendant to two consecutive active sentences between 192 minimum to 240 maximum months. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by: (1) allowing Dr. Powell's testimony to bolster A.W.'s credibility; (2) allowing Detective Landers to testify as an expert to support A.W.'s credibility; (3) allowing the State's motion to amend the indictment by changing the alleged offense date and by denying his motion to dismiss; and (4) violating his constitutional right to a unanimous jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    III. Dr. Powell's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Powell to testify regarding A.W.'s credibility. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant failed to object to Dr. Powell's testimony, but argues for plain error review on appeal. To be awarded a new trial based on plain error, a defendant must show the error complained of was so fundamental that a different result would have probably occurred without the error.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

We recently stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even in child sexual abuse cases ... variance as to time ... becomes material and of the essence when it deprives a defendant\n   of an opportunity to adequately present his defense.... The purpose of the rule as to variance is to avoid surprise, and the discrepancy must not be used to ensnare the defendant or to deprive him of an opportunity to present his defense.... Time variances do not always prejudice a defendant so as to require dismissal, even when an alibi is involved. Thus, a defendant suffers no prejudice when the allegations and proof substantially correspond; when [a] defendant presents alibi evidence relating to neither the date charged nor the date shown by the State's evidence; or when a defendant presents an alibi defense for both dates. However, when the defendant relies on the date set forth in the indictment and the evidence set forth by the State substantially varies to the prejudice of [the] defendant, the interests of justice and fair play require that [the] defendant's motion for dismissal be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
