HILLERY, Jr., Petitioner-Appellee, v. Reginald PULLEY, Warden, Respondent-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b712-9\">No. 83-2017.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b712-10\">United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b712-11\">Submitted April 12, 1984.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b712-12\">Decided May 14, 1984.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b712-13\">Clifford Tedmon, Sacramento, Cal., for petitioner-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b712-14\">Willard F.

East, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b712-18\">In this matter, petitioner Booker T. Hillery, Jr., successfully challenged the constitutionality of his 1962 Kings County Superior Court judgment of conviction and sentence for the stabbing murder of a fifteen-year-old girl, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 187, by applying for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court. The District Court granted the writ upon concluding that petitioner\u2019s conviction resulted from a denial of equal protection because black persons had been systematically excluded from selection to the Kings County grand jury for the years preceding his 1962 indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-19\">We affirm upon the basis and for the reasons set forth in the excellent and extensive District Court opinion granting the application. <em>Hillery v. Pulley, </em>563 F.Supp. 1228 (E.D.Cal.1983). <em>See also Hillery v. Pulley, </em>533 F.Supp. 1189 (E.D.Cal.1982) (denial of government\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust); <em>Hillery v. Sumner, </em>496 F.Supp. 632 (E.D.Cal.1980) (denial of government\u2019s motion to dismiss for prejudicial delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-20\">The judgment of the United States District Court granting petitioner\u2019s application for writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\">The matter is REMANDED to the District Court for issuance of the writ and other appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-22\">The state may seek to recharge and try petitioner again by the procedure which conforms to constitutional requirements.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b712-23\">J. BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Apj\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-24\">I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s order affirming the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-25\">In my view, petitioner has failed to exhaust his state remedies as required by 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), <em>Picard v. Conner, </em>404 U.S. 270, 275-76, 92 S.Ct. 509, 512-13, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971), and <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). The testimony of an expert \u201cforensic actuary\u201d presenting a new theory of statistical analysis is, in spite of the characterization by petitioner, new evidence that has not been presented to the state courts. This \u201cnew method\u201d is new evidence supporting a new theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Nor do I agree that the affidavits of three witnesses establishing the competency of black persons to serve as grand jurors are properly characterized as \u201ccumulative.\u201d The same may be said of the new census material.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Although petitioner\u2019s basic claim has remained the same, the evidentiary basis for that claim changed significantly in the present habeas corpus proceeding from that presented to the state courts years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We should vacate the district court\u2019s order with instructions to dismiss the petition without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
