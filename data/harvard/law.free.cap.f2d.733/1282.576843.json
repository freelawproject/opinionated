GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1351-23\">Tomas G. Ervin appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his claim to recover $7,876.63 deducted from his earnings for maintenance costs by the Missouri Division of Corrections while he was enrolled in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Institutional Work Release Program.- He argues that the deduction deprived him of his property without due process of law. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Ervin was an inmate subject to the custody and control of the Missouri Division of Corrections between February 14, 1969, and August 16, 1979. From December 21, 1976, until the date of his release, he participated in the Division\u2019s work release program and was employed as a computer operator by the Missouri Department of Revenue. Upon entering the program, no maintenance costs were deducted from Ervin\u2019s salary. After he had been enrolled for approximately five months, he claims that prison authorities threatened and coerced him into signing an agreement to permit the deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">At the time Ervin enrolled in the work release program, maintenance cost deductions were authorized by regulations adopted by the Missouri Division of Corrections. <em>See </em>13 Mo.Admin.Code \u00a7 20.103.-010(3) (rescinded 1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The amount of the deduction was based on a sliding scale keyed to the prisoner\u2019s earnings. During the period of his employment, Ervin earned $33,857.58 and the state deducted $7,986.63 from this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Following his parole, Ervin brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976) to recover the amount of his maintenance costs. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the appellees. In so ruling, the district court rejected Ervin\u2019s characterization of the issue as whether or not he possessed a protectable property interest in his salary. Rather, the court held the issue to be whether or not Ervin had a liberty interest in participating in the work release program:</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">[t]he underlying right involved ... is not in a salary obtained if the plaintiff is granted work release, but in the work release program itself. The issue is whether plaintiff has a liberty interest in the work release program and, if so, whether the defendants\u2019 actions deprived him of that interest or infringed upon it. Naturally, plaintiff has a property right in his salary, but in this case he exchanged a portion of his salary for the opportunity of participating in the work release program. The issue is whether the defendants can require such payment as a condition to work release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">The district court found only passing statutory reference, and no specific authorization, for the establishment of the work release program. It determined, however, that the general grant of authority provided to the Director of the Division of Corrections was sufficiently broad to permit the establishment of the program and to condition participation in it on the payment of maintenance costs. It further noted that the maintenance deductions were specifically authorized by the Division\u2019s regulations. Under these circumstances, the district court found that Ervin\u2019s rights had not been violated because he had no liberty interest entitling him to participate in the work release program. The district court further concluded that summary judgment was mandated by the qualified immunity doctrine of <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Appellee Jenkins was Director of the Missouri Division of Corrections from February 1, 1978, until August 8, 1979. Appellee Blackwell held the same position from that date through appellant\u2019s parole on August 17, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">Although our analysis leads us to the same conclusion, we cannot agree with the district court that the issue presented is whether Ervin possessed a liberty interest in the work release program. It is true that most section 1983 actions arising out of work release programs involve questions of whether the inmate has a constitutionally-protected liberty interest to participate in the program. <em>See, e.g., Matz v. Kelsch, </em>638 F.2d 48 (8th Cir.1981); <em>Winsett v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number><em>McGinnes, </em>617 F.2d 996 (3d Cir.1980) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1093, 101 S.Ct. 891, 66 L.Ed.2d 822 (1981); <em>Jones v. Lane, </em>568 F.Supp. 1113 (N.D.Ill.1983); <em>Young v. Hunt, </em>507 F.Supp. 785 (N.D.Ind.1981). Such programs typically implicate a prisoner\u2019s liberty because they represent additional freedom not available under full-time incarceration. In this case, however, Ervin is not challenging a decision denying him entrance or continued participation in the program. He successfully completed the program and was paroled. What he is contesting are the conditions of the program as they affected his salary. The issue therefore is whether Ervin possessed a protectable property interest \u2014 \u201ca legitimate claim of entitlement\u201d \u2014 to the full amount of the salary he earned while enrolled in the program. <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2103, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979) (quoting <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)); <em>Peck v. Hoff, </em>660 F.2d 371, 373 (8th Cir.1981). As the district court correctly noted, however, that salary did not exist in the abstract; Ervin received it only by virtue of his participation in the work release program. We therefore look to the state law creating the program to determine if Ervin possessed such a property interest. <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 529 n. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1910 n. 1, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981) (citing <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">At the time Ervin was enrolled, the work release program lacked specific statutory authorization. However, the district court held, and we agree, that the following general grant of authority to the Director of the Division of Corrections provided sufficient authority to establish the program:</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">The director shall make such rules and regulations, not in conflict with the laws of this state, as he may deem proper for the government and management of the institutions under the jurisdiction of the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 216.115(3) (1978) (repealed 1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our conclusion that the Director was authorized to establish the program is supported by a reference to work release in a related statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Division of Corrections cited section 216.115(3) as granting it the authority to promulgate the work release regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">The work release regulations specifically provided that the payment of maintenance costs was a mandatory condition to participation in the work release program:</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-12\">(C) Contractual Requirement: Prior to entering an institutional work release program, each inmate and his employer shall be required to sign a statement indicating the following: (A copy of the statement is attached to this policy as Appendix 4)</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-13\">1. That the inmate\u2019s entrance into the work release program is voluntary;</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-14\">2. That the inmate is willing to pay all or part of his maintenance costs if his income from working is sufficient, as determined by the slide scale attached to this policy as Appendix 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-15\">3. That the inmate and employer understand and will abide by the conditions applicable to this program as issued by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>the Division of Corrections and the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">13 Mo.Admin.Code \u00a7 20-103.010(3) (rescinded 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">These regulations clearly establish that Ervin can assert no legitimate claim of entitlement to the full amount of his salary. Missouri regulations specifically condition participation in the program on the payment of maintenance costs, and carrying out that condition is hardly an \u201carbitrary action of government\u201d demanding of due process protection. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Ervin can claim nothing more than \u201can abstract need or desire\u201d for his full salary. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. There is simply \u201cno interest ... for process to protect.\u201d <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 1748, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983). It is true that Ervin did not sign a contract authorizing the deductions until after he had been in the program five months. Even if this delay violated the work release regulations, <em>see </em>13 Mo.Admin. Code \u00a7 20-103.011(3)(C) (rescinded 1978), it would not be actionable under section 1983 without an accompanying deprivation of a federal right. <em>See Sigler v. Lowrie, </em>404 F.2d 659 (8th Cir.1968), cer<em>t. denied, </em>395 U.S. 940, 89 S.Ct. 2010, 23 L.Ed.2d 456 (1969); <em>Ybarra v. Bastian, </em>647 F.2d 891 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 857, 102 S.Ct. 309, 70 L.Ed.2d 153 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">The authority cited by Ervin in support of his claim is unpersuasive. In <em>Sell v. Parratt, </em>548 F.2d 753 (8th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 873, 98 S.Ct. 220, 54 L.Ed.2d 152 (1978), a prisoner had his \u201cfree world money\u201d confiscated by prison authorities. We held that the prisoner had a protectable property interest in the money and that Nebraska law did not permit the \u201cpunitive forfeiture\u201d of such funds. <em>Id. </em>at 758. In the present case, we are not dealing with \u201cfree world funds\u201d confiscated in violation of Nebraska law. Ervin earned his money while in a prison rehabilitation program authorized under Missouri law which expressly required enrollees to pay maintenance costs. In <em>Cruz v. Cardwell, </em>486 F.2d 550 (8th Cir.1973), the issue before this court was whether dismissal on the pleadings was justified where a prisoner brought a section 1983 action alleging that prison authorities had confiscated his money upon arrest. Again, the funds at issue here were earmarked from the beginning for the payment of maintenance costs. Finally, our decision in <em>Sigler v. Lowrie, supra, </em>not only fails to support Ervin\u2019s claim but is consistent with our disposition of his claim. In <em>Sigler, </em>a prisoner had a percentage of his salary from prison labor deposited into his spending account. Under Nebraska law, the account was subject to the warden\u2019s discretion; he could pay out funds to the prisoner\u2019s family, hold funds until the prisoner was discharged, or cancel credit in the account for disciplinary reasons. The prisoner filed suit under section 1983 when the warden cancelled credit in the account to reimburse the prison for expenses incurred when the prisoner escaped. In light of the warden\u2019s statutory authority, we held that his action did not amount to a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected property right. In a similar fashion, the denial of prison earnings to Ervin in accordance with state regulations is not a constitutional deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">Ervin also argues that a Missouri statute that requires prison authorities to confiscate \u201ccontraband\u201d money possessed by an inmate and return it upon discharge prevents the withholding of maintenance costs in the work release program. <em>See </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 216.310 (1978). This statute has no relevance to the question of whether Ervin had a property interest in receiving the full amount of his salary while enrolled in the work release program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">The withholding of Ervin\u2019s salary is not actionable under section 1983. In view of this holding, we have no need to reach the qualified immunity issue. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1351-13\">. The Honorable Scott 0. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">. These regulations were rescinded in 1978 and replaced by new regulations which provided that if the prisoner\u2019s gross monthly earnings exceeded $150.00, 25% of the amount earned up to $300.00 was to be deducted. <em>See </em>13 Mo.Admin.Code \u00a7 20-103.011(3) (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">.

The authority herein conferred may be exercised to permit the inmate to visit a relative who is ill, to attend the funeral of a relative, to obtain medical services not otherwise available, to contact prospective employers <em>and to participate in approved rehabilitation programs.
