Tenney, District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b327-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">In this appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, Michael A. Telesca, District Judge, The Genesee Brewing Company challenges the Village of Sodus Point\u2019s refusal to refund payments made by Genesee under a state law enacted pursuant to the now repealed \u201cIndustrial Cost Recovery\u201d (ICR) provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 <em>et seq. </em>(1982). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The district court rejected Genesee\u2019s argument that the repeal of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1284 created a federal right in Genesee to the refund of amounts it paid during the congressionally mandated moratorium on collection of those payments. It reasoned that because the Village enacted a local sewer rent law adopting the required ICR formula, a law which remained on the books after repeal of the federal legislation, Genesee\u2019s rights, if any, to the fund of approximately $56,120 depended on state law. Since the federal repeal provision did not provide for the disposition of ICR payments collected during the moratorium and since state law continued to provide for collection of those payments, the district court concluded that plaintiff had stated neither a claim under the federal statute, nor a \u00a7 1983 claim under the doctrine of <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">On appeal, Genesee renews the argument it made below that Congress indicated its intent that refunds be made. Inasmuch as Judge Telesca correctly analyzed the statute and its legislative history, finding no congressional intent to require, as opposed to permitting, such refunds, we affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by the district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">We add, however, that the dismissal below appears grounded in Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). While Rule 12(b)(6) would be a secondary reason to dismiss the complaint, the district court\u2019s finding that no federal right was implicated rendered the dismissal more appropriate under Rule 12(b)(1). Since Genesee failed to show a basis for subject matter jurisdiction under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 or under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, the defendant\u2019s contention that no federal jurisdiction existed was correct. <em>See City of Kenosha v. Bruno, </em>412 U.S. 507, 513, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 2226, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">The order dismissing Genesee\u2019s complaint is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
