RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AMqC5\">This breach of contract diversity case turns on the interpretation of contracts by which a petroleum refiner agreed with an oil buyer to construct a petroleum terminal and to deliver large quantities of diesel and heavy oil at the completed terminal over a ten-year period. Directed by a Texas court\u2019s interpretation of a notably similar contract, subsequent to the trial of this case, we conclude that the refiner breached the contract and, therefore, vacate the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the refiner</p>\n<p id=\"AVg\">, , . . , The buyers counterclaim sought dam- \u201e ,, ,, \u201e \u201e&amp; , , ages from the retmer-seller for fraudulent- \u201e ly inducing it to enter the contract and for overpricing products sold. The district court entered a directed verdict on this claim. We conclude that there was suf\u00f1cient evidence to warrant submission of that issue to the jury. Therefore, although the alleged fraud and overpricing affected only the relatively small quantity of oil actually purchased, we reverse the judgment on the counterclaim and remand for a trial of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AkK\">A third party, who contracted to repurchase the oil from the initial purchaser, asserted a claim for indemnity under an alleged hold-harmless contract and under the Texas Deceptive Practices Act. We affirm the judgment in favor of the third party on the hold-harmless claim, but conclude that it was not a consumer entitled to invoke that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AqEX\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"A8g\">South Hampton Company, which operated a petroleum refinery at Silsbee, Texas, entered into two contracts with Stinnes Corporation, a diversified holding company operating through its Stinnes Oil &amp; Chemical Co. division. One contract required South Hampton to deliver large quantities of diesel oil, the other to deliver large quantities of heavy oil. Each required Stinnes to buy the oil and each required South Hampton to construct a petroleum termmal on the banks of tbe Neches Rl\u2122r\u2019 near Beaumont, Texas. Stmnes simultaneously entered into two contracts with tt m. /r&gt; + i tv . , . , , United Petroleum Distributors for resale to United of the products purchased by Stinnes from South Hampton at a markup of 42$ per barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"A7Bc\">AU four contracts contained identical termS; which we paraphrase as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A6dm\">\n<em>Terminal:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQK\">Each required South Hampton to construct a terminal at the refinery with tankage for 110,000 barrels of heavy oil and 50,000 barrels of diesel,</p>\n<p id=\"ABR3\"><em>Terminal Facilities and </em>Functions:</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">Each required that (a) shore storage , , , , . , , , <em>\u00bf </em>tanks were to be an integral part of ,, , . , , the terminal and (b) the terminal was to be a facilit at which certain basic functions-including acurate pre-trangit testing&gt; measurement, and certification of product and passage of liability; and rjgk of loss_would be performed.

United later contended that it was experiencing significant losses in volume of deliveries due to mismeasurements and was lifting product in tows too small to be commercially feasible. In addition, United contended that it was paying prices far above those being charged on the open market. Addressing both Stinnes and South Hampton directly, United complained repeatedly about these problems and about South Hampton\u2019s failure to complete the terminal. South Hampton\u2019s chief executive officer, Marvin A. Bomer; Stinnes\u2019s president, Thomas H. Pierson; and United\u2019s president, Edward J. Pourticq; attended various meetings in an effort to resolve these problems. Stinnes\u2019s position was that they were temporary in nature and would end when the terminal was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-21\">By early December 1975, it became obvious that the terminal could not be completed by January 1, 1976, and that United\u2019s problems and losses would continue. United was, therefore, threatening to cancel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>contracts. Further conversations failed to resolve the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">United notified Stinnes on January 26 that it was cancelling both contracts. Stinnes in turn cancelled its contracts with South Hampton. South Hampton then responded to Stinnes, \u201cyou have no valid right to cancel\u201d and refused to \u201caccept your notice of cancellation,\u201d insisting that Stinnes accept both products \u201caccording to the pricing terms in the contract.\u201d Stinnes inquired whether this response was meant to be an offer of an alternative source or whether South Hampton was contending that the terminal facility was complete. South Hampton\u2019s reply refused to answer this inquiry, and merely asserted that product was \u201cavailable for delivery to Stinnes pursuant to the terms of the contract\u201d at the terminal site. During February and March, however, Stinnes continued to purchase heavy fuel oil from South Hampton at Hawkins Slip; but the purchases were at a reduced price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">II. PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Unable to resolve their differences through negotiation, the contracting parties commenced a barrage of litigation. South Hampton sued Stinnes for damages resulting from wrongful termination of the heavy oil contract. South Hampton also included a similar claim regarding the diesel oil contract; but because a rising market made sales to others more profitable than sales to Stinnes, it suffered no damage as a result of. termination of the diesel contract and accordingly abandoned that claim. Stinnes responded to the heavy oil contract claim by alleging in defense that South Hampton\u2019s failure to complete the terminal, particularly its failure to construct shore tanks, activated the contracts\u2019 cancellation clause. Alternatively, Stinnes alleged that South Hampton had breached the contracts by overpricing its products. Moving to the offensive, Stinnes counterclaimed for damages arising out of South Hampton\u2019s allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations concerning the pricing term of the contracts. Stinnes next asserted a cross claim against United, arguing that the nature of the contracts and their execution entitled it to indemnification from United for any liability it might incur to South Hampton. United returned Stinnes\u2019s fire, counterclaiming that, contrary to Stinnes\u2019s allegations, it was Stinnes that had agreed to hold United harmless from any loss resulting from inadequate performance. United also alleged that Stinnes had violated Texas\u2019s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and claimed treble damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">Stinnes did not fare well at the trial. In answer to a special interrogatory, the jury found that Stinnes, not South Hampton, breached the contracts. The jury also found that South Hampton sustained $7,574,509 damages under the heavy oil contract, but that it gained $2,995,885 profit from sale of diesel oil. The court awarded South Hampton the difference, i.e., $4,578,624. The court dismissed Stinnes\u2019s fraud claim against South Hampton, and directed a verdict against Stinnes- on its indemnification-from-United theory. The jury also found that Stinnes had agreed to hold United harmless for losses incurred \u201cas.a result of taking products under its contract with Stinnes,\u201d and assessed the resulting damages at $149,320.69. Stinnes did prevail against United, however, on a motion for directed verdict on United\u2019s deceptive trade practices claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">Stinnes timely appealed the judgment, assailing each adverse outcome and further, alleging that the trial was conducted in a prejudicially improper manner. South Hampton disputed both the application of its diesel sales profits to offset its heavy oil sales losses and the method of calculating the amount of offset. United sought to overturn the court\u2019s ruling on its deceptive-trade-practices claim. We discuss in turn the issues presented by these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">III. WHO BREACHED THE CONTRACT?</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">The parties reassert the positions they adopted at trial, but the debate has been significantly refocused by a post-judgment development.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>A. Interpretation of \u201cTerminal\u201d \u2014 the <em>Varibus </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">A key step in identifying the breaching party depends upon whether, under Texas contract law, South Hampton\u2019s failure to complete shore tankage facilities by January 1 warranted cancellation of the contract. Resolution of this issue turns on the interpretation of the word \u201cTerminal.\u201d If that word, as used in the contracts, unambiguously includes within its meaning completed shore tank facilities, then the district court erred in sending to the jury the question whether Stinnes\u2019s cancellation was wrongful. This preliminary determination is for the court to make; for, absent latent or patent ambiguity, the meaning of the contract is to be decided by the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A contract is not ambiguous if it is so worded that a court may properly give it a definite legal meaning. Ambiguity arises when the court is left genuinely uncertain which of the two meanings is the proper one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">While this suit was pending, a similar suit between other parties was proceeding through the Texas courts; for South Hampton had also negotiated with other oil buyers regarding completion of the terminal. It had entered into a contract with Varibus Corporation that was, in all relevant respects save those mentioned below, identical to the Stinnes and United contracts. Indeed, the Varibus contract had served as a model for the Stinnes contract. Varibus\u2019s contract gave it the right of cancellation if the \u201cTerminal,\u201d the same terminal involved in the South Hampton-Stinnes contract, were not complete on January 1, 1976. Varibus, like Stinnes, had exercised its cancellation right on the basis that the \u201cTerminal\u201d was not complete; and it also had been sued by South Hampton for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">While the present case was pending on appeal, the Beaumont Court of Civil Appeals decided the Texas case. <em>Varibus Corporation v. South Hampton, </em>623 S.W.2d 157 (Ct.Civ.App.1981), <em>writ ref. n.r.e. </em>(1982). It held that there was no ambiguity in the contract, and that South Hampton had not complied with the requirement that it construct a terminal that included storage tanks by the use of which tank strappings and shore tank samples might be taken to determine the quantity and quality of the product delivered to the buyer. Varibus, the Texas court held, \u201cwas not required by the contract to accept the product from a pipeline, rather than from shore tanks; it was entitled to have the quantity and quality of the product determined before the product was received into its barges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160. Thus, the court concluded that Varibus \u201cproperly exercised its right to cancel the contract by reason of South Hampton\u2019s failure to complete the terminal by January 1, 1976.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court reversed the verdict for South Hampton that the trial court had directed and rendered judgment for Varibus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">South Hampton advances several reasons why the <em>Varibus </em>decision does not require us to reach a similar conclusion regarding Stinnes\u2019s cancellation of the contracts. First, it seeks to distinguish <em>Varibus </em>on a factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">There were a few differences between the Varibus contracts and the Stinnes contracts. One lay in the respective versions of the \u201cterm\u201d clause, \u00a7 3.01, of each contract. The Varibus contract gave the buyer the right of cancellation as of August 1, 1975, if the seller had failed to complete the terminal. The seller, however, had an option to provide product of equal quantity and quality from an alternative source at a price to be adjusted to account for trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>portation costs. But if the terminal were not completed by January 1, 1976, the buyer had the right to cancel the contract finally; and there was no provision for an alternative-source option after that date. The Stinnes contract, by contrast, merely set August 1 as the <em>expected </em>date of first delivery, but provided an alternative source option if the terminal were not finished by January 1. South Hampton argues that, because the Stinnes contract contemplated delivery of product for at least six full months before it required the terminal to be completed, the importance of a complete terminal and the meaning of that term are \u201cconsiderably less certain in this case than in <em>Varibus.\u201d </em>By this attempt to distinguish <em>Varibus, </em>South Hampton also seeks to resurrect its <em>pre-Varibus </em>argument: that its failure to construct shore tankage facilities by January 1 did not amount to a failure to complete the terminal. South Hampton argues that under the \u201cFacilities\u201d clause, \u00a7 1.04, shore tankage facilities were a \u201cseparate entity,\u201d not an integral part of the terminal envisioned by the parties, because that clause refers to \u201cseller\u2019s terminal <em>and </em>tankage .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">In concluding that the word \u201cTerminal\u201d was not ambiguous, however, the <em>Varibus </em>court did not look to \u00a7 3.01 of the contract but to \u00a7 1.04. There were differences between those provisions of the respective contracts too, but not significant ones.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite South Hampton\u2019s efforts to distinguish the terms of the Varibus contract from those of the Stinnes contracts, the key similarities predominate. As the Texas court concluded, shore tankage was a necessary element of a complete terminal for important functional reasons: measurement, quality control, and risk of loss are all better managed from tanks than from pipes or barges. Those considerations are identical in the two seller-buyer relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-14\">South Hampton next argues that, even if the two sets of contracts are indistinguishable, no binding force attaches to the <em>Varibus </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cTerminal.\u201d Because the question of what meaning a court should attribute to the words of a contract is a question of fact, and not one of law, \u201c[t]he fact that specific words in a contract, even a standardized contract such as an insurance policy, have once been given a meaning by a court in a litigation between A and B should never be held to be conclusive in subsequent litigation between C and D or between A and C,\u201d South Hampton contends, quoting Cor-bin on Contracts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A later Texas court would not be bound by the <em>Varibus </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cTerminal,\u201d nor are we.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as Corbin goes on to note in the same discussion, the prior interpretation \u201cis an important factor; but the other relevant factors may be different.\u201d We regard the <em>Varibus </em>court\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>elusions as persuasive authority, and absent some indication that a later Texas court would do otherwise, we adopt them as our own in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">There was a single substantive difference between the Varibus contract and the Stinnes contracts: Varibus had an absolute cancellation right if the terminal were not completed by the deadline; under the Stinnes contract, South Hampton had the option of tendering product from an alternative source. This option, however, does not alter the clarity of the termination clause. Neither does the fact that deliveries under the Stinnes contracts began eight months before the estimated date of terminal completion alter the meaning of that clause. What the buyer was willing to accept as a temporary expedient does not alter what it had the contractual right to require for a continuing ten-year relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">One consideration remains under this issue. The meaning of a contractual term is usually a question of fact, but meaning \u201cmay be made so clear by the evidence that a jury\u2019s verdict to the contrary would be set aside.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If a written contract containing an express merger clause is \u201cclear and unambiguous and not subject to more than one interpretation\u201d it need not be opened to judicial interpretation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In making its determination, the <em>Varibus </em>court of course applied the Texas rules for granting a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Under these rules, a court asks, in evaluating a motion for a directed verdict, \u201cwhether there is any evidence of probative force\u201d to raise the factual issues presented;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to uphold a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a court must determine \u201cthat there is no evidence upon which the jury could have made the findings relied upon.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The standard for directing a verdict being a procedural matter, we apply federal, not state, rules even in diversity cases; and the applicable standard in this circuit is set forth in <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc): If, considering all the evidence, the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in one direction that reasonable persons could not arrive at a contrary verdict, the motion should be granted. The Texas Court of Appeals has determined that there is no evidence that the word \u201cTerminal\u201d is ambiguous in a contract using the word in a context almost identical to that in the Stinnes instruments. Under Texas practice, the state Supreme Court\u2019s refusal \u201cno reversible error\u201d to grant an application for a writ of error signifies that the Supreme Court has considered the substance of the opinion and approves the result although it neither approves nor disapproves the specific language of the Court of Civil Appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are convinced that a Texas court, faced with substantially similar facts as we are in the present case, would reach the same conclusion. Our confidence is bolstered by the fact that federal procedural law requires us to apply a less stringent standard for taking a question from a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">B. South Hampton\u2019s \u201cOut-turn\u201d Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">South Hampton contends that, whatever the Stinnes contract may originally have required, the parties reached an understanding in early December that all future deliveries of product would be on an \u201cout-turn\u201d basis; i.e., that Stinnes would pay only for the amount of product actually delivered to <em>its </em>tanks, instead of the amount pumped out of South Hampton\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>storage facilities as the contracts required. This argument is advanced as a basis for several different theories in support of the thesis that Stinnes wrongfully cancelled the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">1. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">South Hampton\u2019s first theory is that this out-turn agreement modified the \u201cTerminal\u201d requirements of the contract. It contends that the parties intended to substitute measurement at the place of final delivery (out-turn) for preshipment measurement in tanks at the terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">Standing squarely in the path of this argument is the contract\u2019s no-oral-modification clause, which bars proof of any such change. That clause provides that the contract \u201cmay not be changed or terminated orally and no attempted change, termination or waiver of any of the provisions hereof shall be binding unless it is in writing, signed by the parties hereto ____\u201d Under the Texas version of the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201c[a] signed agreement which excludes modification or recission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded Texas Bus. &amp; Comm.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.209(b). Hence no-oral-modification clauses are binding in Texas.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">South Hampton attempts to side-step that clause by arguing that the out-turn agreement was a waiver, not a modification, of the contract term. It argues that the provision for measurement of product at storage tanks was for its benefit, not Stinnes\u2019s. Out-turn measurement, South Hampton explains, shifts the risk of loss, shrinkage, or contamination in favor of the buyer because measurement is not performed until product reaches the point of final delivery. South Hampton thus attempts to assert waiver as a sword rather than as a shield, contending that it was entitled to waive a contract provision so patently intended to operate for its own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-15\">The contract language refutes this argument. Texas law does distinguish between modification and waiver; its commercial code provides that \u201c[although an attempt at modification or recission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (b) [quoted above] or (c) [applying the statute of frauds to contracts that, as modified, fall within its ambit] it can operate as a waiver.\u201d Texas Bus. &amp; Comm.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.209(d). A waiver may be express or implied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But recitation of these general principles does not carry the day for South Hampton. First, the no-oral-modification clause itself anticipated the assertion of waiver by expressly including oral \u201cwaiver\u201d among its proscriptions. It does not distinguish between waiver of favorable and burdensome provisions. And the requirement sought to be waived \u2014 shore tank facilities \u2014 is expressly and, as we have held, unambiguously provided for in the \u201cTerminal\u201d clause. Further, the contract expressly provided that \u201ctime was of the essence.\u201d Texas courts have held that alleged oral \u201cwaivers\u201d of express contract terms specifying place of payment, in contracts containing no-oral-modification clauses, constitute \u201cmodifications\u201d under \u00a7 2.209(b) and are barred by such clauses because not reduced to writing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the <em>Varibus </em>court rejected an identical argument for the same reason; \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>theory, if accepted, would amount to a unilateral modification of the contract in violation of [the no-oral-modification clause] of the contract. 623 S.W.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"AIva\">Second, South Hampton\u2019s theory reaches too far. Although there is evidence in the record to support its contention that out-turn measurement benefitted Stinnes, there is also evidence to the contrary. Stinnes presented evidence showing that measurement, both for quality and quantity, is more accurately made from shore tank strappings and samples. The detailed provisions contained in clause 1.05 (\u201cMeasurement, Inspection, and Effect of Acceptance ) indicates that this additional precision is more than incremental. South Hampton suggests that these functions could have been performed as well as Stinnes s storage facilities. The contract, however, provided that title to, and risk of loss, and liability for, all Product delivered , , \u201e ,, ,, j hereunder passed to Stinnes as the prod- , , \u00bb, . \u2022 uct moved through the flange connecting, \u25a0n , , , on &gt; rn - iijBuyer s vessel to Seller s Terminal loading v ,, , ni ui i hne ... or other mutually agreeable place xcj-itt i i. i , \u2022 of delivery. South Hampton has not directed our attention to any evidence in the voluminous record showing that it agreed to assume responsibility for all shrinkage, loss, or contamination during product movement. Following the Texas courts\u2019 lead in <em>Dave Summers Realtors, Inc. </em>and in <em>Varibus, </em>we regard the alleged waiver in this case as an attempt to modify the contract orally and hold that it is rendered a nullity by the unambiguous terms of the no-oral-modification clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">2. Alternative Source</p>\n<p id=\"AAE9\">As mentioned above, South Hampton had option to cure its nonperformance of the Stinnes contracts\u2019 \u201cTerminal\u201d provisions by offering an alternative source of supply. This option was not available when Varibus cancelled its contracts, South Hampton argues that this difference requires a different result in the present case. Because we have concluded that the word \u201cTerminal\u201d is unambiguous, and its requirements have not been waived, South Hampton may prevail only if it satisfied the alternative source provisions of the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"AJqU\">South Hampton contends, somewhat inconsistently with its waiver theory, that the out-turn agreement satisfied the alternative-source option.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that South Hampton failed properly to exercise 0py0ri) both in form and substance.</p>\n<p id=\"ARQB\">Stinnes urges that [t]he acceptance of \u00b0 \u201e\u201e , L,J , , r an option, to be effectual, must be unquah- . fied, absolute, unconditional, unequivocal, . \u2019 ... unambiguous, positive, without reserva- \u00ae tion, and according to the terms and conditions of the option,\" quoting Vratis v.

Robertson, et al., Business Law: Uniform Commercial Code 136 (5th ed. 1982). Accordingly, we turn to the U.C.C. provision on offer and acceptance, which provides: \u201cUnless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances (1) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d Texas Bus. &amp; Comm.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.206(a)(1). The contracts do not provide for any particular manner of acceptance or exercise of the option. South Hampton did not articulate its intention to exercise the option, but it contends that its conduct manifested such an intention. Although the Code implicitly permits acceptance by performance,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> South Hampton made neither proffer of performance nor exercise of its option in a manner \u201creasonable in the circumstances.\u201d Stinnes had substantial cause to question whether South Hampton intended the post-January 1 deliveries to invoke the alternative-source option.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Stinnes therefore took the most sensible course: it asked South Hampton. When confronted directly with the simple question whether it was exercising its option, however, South Hampton refused to reply. Silence in response to a direct inquiry, made necessary by doubtful circumstances that South Hampton itself created, hardly comports with even a generous reading of the word \u201creasonable.\u201d Smith &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-3\">Even had South Hampton communicated its intentions in a reasonable manner, the source it offered would not measure up to contractual standards. The only alternatives it offered were the barges at the Neches River slip or the incomplete terminal. The option clause did not specify criteria for the alternative source. Section 1.01, however, mandated that Buyer and Seller were to perform their respective obligations \u201cat Seller\u2019s Terminal, or <em>elsewhere, </em>in accordance with the terms of the contract.\u201d Reading the contract as a whole,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we conclude that it unambiguously required South Hampton substantially to meet the measurement and inspection obligations, even if it were to deliver product from an alternative source. The parties made completion of a terminal that allowed satisfaction of those obligations, by January 1, 1976, so critical that its failure \u2014 for any reason whatsoever, including <em>force majeure </em>\u2014 authorized cancellation of the contracts. Although a provision plainly intended to preserve the deal in the face of adversity might reasonably be expected to comtemplate less-than-perfect performance, it is not a <em>carte blanche </em>to ignore major contractual obligations. Under South Hampton\u2019s argument, it might continue to supply produce from barges floating in the Neches River for the entire ten-year term of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">The contractual terms expressly required tankage, with facilities for accurate measurement of product. A facility that itself did not satisfy the contract could not either in common sense or law be considered an adequate alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">South Hampton argues that its volume of out-turn deliveries evidence the commercial reasonableness of that practice. South Hampton did deliver 700,000 barrels of oil to purchasers from the incomplete terminal, approximately 80,000 to Stinnes. These deliveries demonstrate that the pipeline functioned to deliver oil; they do not demonstrate that the terminal was complete or that this method of delivery satisfied the contract requirements. The terms under which the buyers of the other 620,-000 barrels chose to accept delivery are irrelevant to interpretation of the Stinnes contracts. And, as South Hampton concedes, the 80,000-barrel transaction with Stinnes was not a sale covered by the contract. It was instead a spot sale, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>reduced price, made for the sole benefit of United, with Stinnes waiving its 42$ per barrel profit margin.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">IV. FRAUD</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">The district court dismissed Stinnes\u2019s counterclaim that South Hampton made false representations in negotiating the contracts. Under Texas law, actionable fraud requires proof that: (1) a material misrepresentation was made; (2) the representation was in fact false; (3) the representation was known to be false when made or was made recklessly without knowledge as to its truth and as a positive assertion; (4) the representation was made with the intention that it be acted on by the other party; (5) that party did act in reliance on the representation; and (6) injury resulted.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There was sufficient evidence in support of each of these elements to send the claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">As set forth above, the contracts contained a formula by which the price of the oil was to be determined from time to time. This formula was based on the cost to South Hampton of crude oil and \u201cother feedstocks to the refinery.\u201d \u201cOther feed-stocks\u201d cost less than crude oil and, when included in the price computation, reduce the cost of both diesel and heavy oil and produce a lower price for each. Throughout the trial, Stinnes contended that the phrase \u201cand other feedstocks to the refinery\u201d meant all feedstocks purchased by South Hampton regardless what their ultimate use would be. South Hampton contended that the phrase was intended to include only those feedstocks that were used to produce heavy fuel oil or diesel and it did not include the cost of \u201cother feed-stocks\u201d in computing the price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-10\">The contract also included an example of computation, leading to the price of $10.04, which is referred to in Part I of this opinion. Stinnes adduced evidence that this example set a benchmark to be used for verification of the actual price to be charged before the contracts were executed and for auditing during their operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-11\">There was evidence that the parties intended the example to be accurate and that its terms were a major factor in Stinnes\u2019 decision to obligate itself to a ten-year contract.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There was also evidence that South Hampton had intended to exclude the cost of feedstocks not used to produce -diesel and heavy oil but knew that Stinnes thought they would be included and that, during negotiations, South Hampton knowingly understated both the $10.04 price in the example and the $8.19 crude oil component and did not disclose this understatement to Stinnes. The district court nonetheless directed a verdict for South Hampton on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-12\">South Hampton first responds that the evidence does not prove that it made a promise with the intention not to perform,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and contends that the record, when read as a whole, shows at most a failure of communication concerning the meaning of the language which was to be included in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>contract. Moreover, it disputes that Stinnes justifiably relied on any representation made by it, pointing to Stinnes\u2019s right to make an audit and the audit it made in December, 1975. Stinnes\u2019s right to make an audit, however, does not negate the possibility of fraud; it merely casts doubt on whether it in fact relied on South Hampton\u2019s alleged misrepresentation. On this element of fraud, as on the others, South Hampton has demonstrated the existence of a factual dispute. But the existence of a factual dispute is what creates a jury issue unless the evidence is so one-sided that a reasonable juror could not credit any other interpretation. South Hampton\u2019s contentions are all supported by the record, and they may well satisfy the trier of fact. They are not, however, established so firmly that a reasonable jury might not decide to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">South Hampton further argues that Stinnes\u2019s claims for lost profits and overpricing do not describe actionable injury; for lost profits are not recoverable as damages for fraud and any overcharges were passed on to United under Stinnes\u2019s cost-plus contracts. South Hampton\u2019s first argument ignores Texas law. The U.C.C. provides that \u201c[rjemedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under this chapter for non-fraudulent breach.\u201d Texas Bus. &amp; Comm. Code Ann. \u00a7 2.721. Those remedies include both recission and consequential damages. <em>See Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.715(b). In general, lost profits are \u201cconsequential damages\u201d as contemplated by this subsection.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">South Hampton quotes <em>Collins v. McCombs, </em>511 S.W.2d 745 (Tex.Civ.App.1974), <em>writ ref. n.r.e., </em>as support for its assertion that lost profits are not recoverable by Stinnes: \u201c[I]t has been settled that ... the measure of damages for fraud and deceit is not what the plaintiff might have gained, had the representation been true, but what he has lost.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747. Viewed in context, it is obvious that the quoted language from <em>Collins </em>is simply not apposite. It appears in the court\u2019s analysis of the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s suit was an action sounding in tort, or \u201can indirect attempt to recover for the breach of an unenforceable oral promise,\u201d which would be barred by the statute of frauds. <em>Id. </em>The action was not brought under the U.C.C. for lost profits as consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">And South Hampton\u2019s second argument simply creates another factual question: whether Stinnes suffered any direct loss, or was able to pass all overcharges onto United by way of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">Pretermitting the correctness of the directed verdict, South Hampton contends that the jury\u2019s answer to Interrogatory 2 is a specific fact finding that South Hampton\u2019s interpretation of the pricing provision was correct, and that Stinnes\u2019s interpretation was not. That interrogatory asked the jury whether South Hampton had breached the contract by overpricing. The jury answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The thrust of South Hampton\u2019s argument is that the jury\u2019s verdict precludes a finding that South Hampton misrepresented the pricing provision to Stinnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">In its charge to the jury, the district court outlined both parties\u2019 competing interpretations of \u201cother feedstocks\u201d and instructed that the jury\u2019s answer should depend upon which one it believed. The court went on, however, to instruct the jury that, if it found \u201cSouth Hampton acted in good faith, [its] answer would be \u2018No\u2019.\u201d Later in its charge, the court told the jury \u201cthat no fraud exists as a matter of law, in this lawsuit.\u201d It is unclear from the context of these remarks whether the court was referring solely to United\u2019s deceptive-trade-practices claim, which it mentioned immediately before the quoted passage, or to all fraud claims, including Stinnes\u2019s claim against South Hampton. The court\u2019s language eas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>ily bears with the latter interpretation, which, if considered by the jury in evaluating the good-faith charge for special interrogatory No. 2, might have led the jury to understand a negative answer was required. Viewing the charge as a whole, as we must,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that the jury, if properly instructed on the element of fraud as applied to this case, would have reached the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">V. UNITED\u2019S CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"Aq0v\">The jury found that Stinnes had agreed to hold United harmless from any damages sustained by it as a result of taking products under the contracts with Stinnes, and assessed this damage at $149,320.69. The hold-harmless claim rested solely on testimony concerning a verbal agreement. There was other testimony to the contrary and Stinnes sets forth reasons to question the credibility of the United executive whose testimony furnished the principal evidence of that agreement. That testimony did not evidence a categorical commitment to make good any loss in cash. But the credibility of the witness in the face of contradictory testimony and the inferences that might reasonably be drawn from the statements made were matters for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">In addition to assailing the credibility of the testimony, Stinnes contends both that the alleged oral statements were too vague to create a binding obligation and that in any event United, by cancelling its contracts in January, failed to perform its end of the alleged contract. Neither argument is persuasive. Although some agreements may, under Texas law, be too amorphous to be enforceable,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a contract is sufficiently definite if a court is able to determine the respective legal obligations of the parties.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cThe provisions of the contract which may at first appear incomplete or uncertain are often readily made clear and plain by the aid of common usage and reasonable implication of facts.\u201d <em>Estate of Griffin v. Sumner, </em>604 S.W.2d 221, 229 (Tex.Civ.App.1980), <em>writ ref. n.r.e.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>United claimed losses arising out of mismeasurement and overpricing. The testimony evidencing the formation of the alleged hold-harmless contract referred generally to those losses and suggested that the parties understood the references. Stinnes has had no difficulty determining its own losses from mismeasurement and overpricing, and has offered no reason why we should take a different view of United\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">A promise to forego assertion of a colorable claim for breach of contract obviously inures to the promisor\u2019s detriment, and in this case to the promisee\u2019s benefit; therefore, there is sufficient consideration to support enforcement of a contract.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Continued performance despite substandard measurement and pricing conditions constituted United\u2019s consideration for Stinnes\u2019s promise of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-11\">United did thereafter seek concessions and ultimately terminated its contract. The jury might properly have inferred that United was not obliged to accept noncomplying delivery for the entire ten-year term, and that Stinnes had the benefit of such continued purchases as United chose to make. Stinnes made a profit on each sale, and hoped, it is apparent, to work out matters in such fashion as to benefit by the full term of the contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>Whether United\u2019s continued negotiations and ultimate cancellation of the contract negate the existence of the hold-harmless agreement was for the jury to determine; those circumstances do not necessarily betray a failure of consideration for Stinnes\u2019 promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">United also contends that, because Stinnes subsequently refused to reimburse United for its losses, the hold-harmless promise was a false or deceptive act or practice giving rise to a cause of action for treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practice and Consumer Protection Act. Tex.Bus. &amp; Comm.Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.46, 17.50. The district court properly directed a verdict against United on this claim. Those provisions of the Act protect only consumers.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> At the time of the alleged promise,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> insofar as is here relevant, it defined \u201cconsumer\u201d as a \u201ccorporation who ... acquires by purchase ... any goods,\u201d and goods as \u201ctangible chattels ... purchased ... for use.\u201d Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm.Code \u00a7 17.45. United was not a consumer, as thus defined; for it did not purchase oil not for use but for resale.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, United has not directed our attention to any evidence in the record of any \u201cfalse, misleading, or deceptive\u201d acts by Stinnes. The mere insistence on litigation to determine one\u2019s obligations hardly constitutes such a practice. Stinnes\u2019s denial of the contract, although insufficient to earn a directed verdict, was not patently frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">VI. UNFAIR TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"ARW\">Stinnes raises numerous points of error concerning the conduct of the trial. Only one merits discussion. During the trial, opposing counsel made various references to Stinnes\u2019s German ownership, and contrasted South Hampton\u2019s and the jurors\u2019 local roots with Stinnes\u2019s German and New York ties. Although Stinnes has now prevailed in its appeal against South Hampton, our disposition of United\u2019s hold-harmless claim keeps this issue from becoming moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">Although counsel\u2019s arguments to the jury contained irrelevant and potentially prejudicial comments, the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial was not an abuse of discretion under the particular circumstances we now review.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We apply this standard because the trial judge is in the best position to evaluate the impact on the jury of the attorney\u2019s conduct, and to determine the most effective response to ensure a fair trial.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-13\">The objectionable comments by United\u2019s attorney did appeal blatantly to ethnic and regional prejudices.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> But the court cautioned the jury to disregard remarks concerning Stinnes\u2019s corporate status as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>as its foreign parentage; and under the facts of this case, we conclude that the warning was sufficient to smother the inflammatory effect of these comments.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Such remarks are, however, not only improper but reflect disregard by counsel of his duty to the court and to the adversary system which supposes a fair contest, not under-handed blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">For these reasons we: (1) VACATE judgment in favor of South Hampton, and REMAND for entry of judgment in favor of Stinnes, on South Hampton\u2019s breach of contract claim; (2) REVERSE the directed verdict in favor of South Hampton on Stinnes\u2019s fraud claim and REMAND the case for a new trial on this issue alone; (3) AFFIRM the judgment in favor of United and against Stinnes for $149,320.69; and (4) AFFIRM the verdict rejecting United\u2019s deceptive trade practices claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">. <em>Christopher v.

South Hampton\u2019s position on this issue is unclear. In its briefs, it seems to argue that out-turn deliveries invoked its option to provide product at an alternative source. At oral argument, however, counsel conceded that pre-January deliveries did not involve the alternative-source option because South Hampton was not then required to have completed the terminal, Counsel further conceded that post-cancellation deliveries were really spot sales, transacted outside the contract. It is conceivable that de- , T . , it T liveries made between January 1 and the cancel- , A <em>c u </em>u <em>J </em>.. lation date fell within the alternative-source prov\u00a1sion In the Iight of our conciusion, however, we need nQt specuIate further on the basis for South Hampton\u2019s theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1187-4\">. \"Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance, an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed.\u201d Texas Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Comm.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.206(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">.
