The issue before us involves the rule which requires federal jurisdiction to be demonstrated in a well-pleaded complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-30\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b688-31\">In 1976, Whittington retired from active duty in the United States Navy. On March 3, 1981, a California court dissolved the Whittingtons\u2019 marriage. The state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>awarded 42.8% of Whittington\u2019s military retirement pay to his ex-wife as part of a community property settlement. Although Whittington never questioned the state court\u2019s jurisdiction during the divorce proceedings, in February of 1982 he sought federal declaratory and injunctive relief from its judgment on grounds that a California court lacked jurisdiction to divide his retirement pay. He argued that Cal.Civ. Code \u00a7 4800(a) provides jurisdiction only over \u201cproperty\u201d and, as a matter of federal law, he had no property rights in future retirement paychecks. Whittington alleged federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. His ex-wife responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The district court granted the motion by dismissing Whittington\u2019s complaint without leave to amend. Although there was a failure to dismiss the action, the district judge clearly determined Whittington could not save his suit by any amendment. Under these circumstances, we treat the order of dismissal as final and appealable, <em>see, e.g., Marshall v. Sawyer, </em>301 F.2d 639, 643 (9th Cir.1962), and review it de novo, taking a favorable view of the facts alleged to support jurisdiction, <em>see A. Cherney Disposal Co. v. Chicago &amp; Suburban Refuse Disposal Association, </em>484 F.2d 751, 759-60 (7th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1131, 94 S.Ct. 870, 38 L.Ed.2d 755 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Whittington agrees that <em>McCarty v. McCarty, </em>453 U.S. 210, 101 S.Ct. 2728, 69 L.Ed.2d 589 (1981) <em>(McCarty), </em>which held the states could not treat military retirement pay as community property, does not apply to his case. The Supreme Court decided <em>McCarty </em>after the Whittingtons\u2019 decree became final, and <em>McCarty </em>does not apply retroactively, <em>e.g., In re Marriage of Sheldon, </em>124 Cal.App.3d 371, 177 Cal.Rptr. 380 (1981), <em>appeal dismissed for want of a substantial federal question sub nom. Sheldon v. Sheldon, </em>456 U.S. 941, 102 S.Ct. 202, 72 L.Ed.2d 462 (1982). Whittington observes, correctly, that the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408, does not preclude his arguments. The Act applies to judgments after June 25, 1981, <em>see </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(c)(1), and the Whittingtons\u2019 decree issued on March 3, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The disposition of this case turns on Whittington\u2019s contention that <em>Armstrong v. Armstrong, </em>696 F.2d 1237 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 337, 78 L.Ed.2d 306 (1983) <em>(Armstrong), </em>does not control his ease, or, if it does, it was wrongly decided. In <em>Armstrong, </em>we adhered to the well-pleaded complaint rule. We held, on facts almost identical to those in Whittington\u2019s case and prosecuted by the same lawyer, that the federal issues raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 by a declaratory judgment attack on a California court\u2019s community property division of military retirement pay \u201chave vitality only as defenses to the state court judgment. Federal question jurisdiction is thus lacking ____\u201d 696 F.2d at 1238. Whittington seeks to distinguish <em>Armstrong </em>by claiming he lacked an opportunity to use his federal law defense. In <em>Armstrong, </em>however, we did not rely on the existence of any certain post-judgment opportunity for raising the federal defenses. As Whittington's circumstances make clear, the federal defenses could have been raised in the original state court action. If the state court had failed to recognize those defenses, Whittington could have obtained federal review by appeal to the Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(2). <em>See Alton Box Board Co. v. Esprit de Corp., </em>682 F.2d 1267, 1270 (9th Cir.1982). If another opportunity arises, Whittington may, perhaps, use his federal defenses. We do not reach the question whether his failure to raise those defenses , in state court will preclude him from using them in a later action. <em>Cf. e.g., Cromwell v. County of Sac, </em>94 U.S. 351, 353, 24 L.Ed. 195 (1876) (res judicata precludes relitigation of defenses that might have been presented in a first suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>In light of Whittington\u2019s failure to raise his federal defenses in state court, his argument that \u201cCalifornia courts are understandably reluctant to subordinate their community property rules to overriding federal considerations which are now forced on them by the requirements of the Supremacy Clause\u201d seems particularly lame. We do not believe the California courts are inept or unfaithful to properly presented federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We conclude that <em>Armstrong </em>controls this suit and, under its well-pleaded complaint rule, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
