Mr. Hux was convicted of second degree burglary by a jury in Oklahoma state court and sentenced to twenty-eight years\u2019 imprisonment. At trial, the court instructed the jury that there is a \u201clegal presumption that one intends the obvious and natural consequences of his acts, unless the contrary is shown.\u201d Record on Appeal to Okla.Crim.App., vol. 1, at 10. Although this instruction is arguably unconstitutional, <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979), Mr. Hux did not object to it at trial. Mr. Hux challenged the instruction on direct appeal. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals held that since he had not objected to the instruction at trial, he could obtain a reversal on direct appeal only if the instruction was \u201cfundamental error.\u201d The court held that the instruction was not fundamental error and affirmed Mr. Hux\u2019s conviction. Mr. Hux then filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court. The district court held that since Mr. Hux had not objected to the instruction at trial, he could challenge it in a federal habeas corpus proceeding only by satisfying the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d standard of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). It then dismissed his petition, holding that he had not satisfied <em>Wainwright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">In <em>Wainwright, </em>a state criminal defendant had failed to comply with a state contemporaneous objection rule when some evidence was introduced against him. Because of his failure to object, the defendant was precluded by state law from asserting on direct appeal that admission of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>dence violated <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). After exhausting his state remedies, the defendant petitioned for habeas corpus in federal district court. The Supreme Court held that unless he could show \u201ccause for the noncompliance and ... actual prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional violation,\u201d his procedural default in the state court barred his assertion of the trial court\u2019s error in a petition for habeas corpus in federal court. 433 U.S. at 84-91, 97 S.Ct. at 2505-2508. Two terms later, the Court held that the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d test applies only when the state courts invoke state law to dismiss a defendant\u2019s federal claims on procedural grounds; a habeas petitioner need not satisfy the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d test if he failed to comply with a state procedural rule but the state courts nevertheless considered his claim on the merits on direct appeal. <em>Ulster County Court v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 147-54, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2219-23, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979); <em>cf. Connecticut v. Johnson, </em>460 U.S. 73, 80 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 969, 974 n. 8, 74 L.Ed.2d 823 (1983) (no adequate, inde.pendent state ground precluding direct appeal to United States Supreme Court if, after failure to object, state court reviews on merits under \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d rule). As the Supreme Court has explicitly pointed out, and as this court has held, the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d test does not apply in such a case even if the state court\u2019s review on direct appeal is restricted to plain error. <em>See Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 135 n. 44, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1575 n. 44, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982); <em>Morishita v. Morris, </em>702 F.2d 207, 209 (10th Cir.1983); <em>cf. Ulster County, </em>442 U.S. at 151 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. at 2221 n. 10 (\u201ccause and prejudice\u201d inapplicable when state court review limited to violations of fundamental constitutional rights). In the instant case, although Mr. Hux failed to object to the challenged instruction at trial, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals nevertheless reviewed his claim under its \u201cfundamental error\u201d rule. Thus, Mr. Hux need not satisfy the \u201ccause- and-prejudice\u201d test, and his claim is properly before us on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In <em>Sandstrom, </em>the Supreme Court reversed a state criminal conviction on the basis of the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that \u201c[t]he law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\u201d 442 U.S. at 513, 99 S.Ct. at 2453. The Court held that the instruction might have been interpreted by the jury as shifting the burden of proof of intent, an element of the crime charged, to the defendant. The instruction therefore violated the due process requirement that the state obtain a conviction only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of a crime. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">In <em>Connecticut v. Johnson, </em>460 U.S. 73, 103 S.Ct. 969, 74 L.Ed.2d 823 (1983), the Court affirmed the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of a conviction after a trial in which a jury instruction violated <em>Sandstrom. </em>A plurality wrote that</p>\n<p id=\"AAE\">a conclusive presumption on the issue of intent is the functional equivalent of a directed verdict on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">....</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Because a conclusive presumption eases the jury\u2019s task, \u201cthere is no reason to believe the jury would have deliberately undertaken the more difficult task\u201d of evaluating the evidence of intent____</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">... If the jury may have failed to consider evidence of intent, a reviewing court cannot hold that the error did not contribute to the verdict. The fact that the reviewing court may view the evidence of intent as overwhelming is then simply irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 976-77 (citations and footnotes omitted). The plurality concluded that a <em>Sandstrom </em>error, with rare exceptions, cannot be harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 977-78. Before applying the <em>Johnson </em>plurality to Mr. Hux\u2019s petition, however, we must consider whether the instruction amounted to a <em>Sandstrom </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Before the plurality in <em>Johnson </em>reached the question of whether a <em>Sandstrom </em>error can ever be considered harmless, they reviewed the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s decision finding a <em>Sandstrom </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In accordance with <em>Sandstrom </em>the-court analyzed the charge as a whole to determine how the jury might have interpreted it; the court balanced other portions of the charge against the challenged language essentially to determine whether \u201cthe ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>at 974 (quoting <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973); <em>see also, United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 169, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1595, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982) (\u201c[A] single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d) We must also make that initial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In determining whether a <em>Sandstrom </em>error has been committed in the context of the overall charge, the \u201ctest is whether any \u2018reasonable juror could have given the presumption conclusive or persuasion-shifting effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Engle v. Koehler, </em>707 F.2d 241, 244 (6th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Sandstrom, </em>442 U.S. at 519, 99 S.Ct. at 2456), <em>aff'd </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1673, 80 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (judgment below affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court; Marshall, J., not participating). Viewing the charge as a whole, we find that Mr. Hux has not demonstrated that the challenged jury instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. The trial court explicitly told the jury that intent was an element of burglary, and that Mr. Hux could be convicted only if the State proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, on the specific facts of this case, we find no <em>Sandstrom </em>error and the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b808-9\">BARRETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"APT\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">I fully concur in light of the fact that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals reached the merits of the challenge to the instruction to the jury, notwithstanding the failure of Hux\u2019s counsel to lodge a contemporaneous instruction as required by Oklahoma law. If the state appellate court on direct appeal does not reach the merits of the federal constitutional claim and, instead, refuses to consider the issue for want of a trial court contemporaneous objection, our opinion in <em>Runnels v. Hess, </em>713 F.2d 596 (10th Cir.1983) demonstrates that absent a contemporaneous objection the Supreme Court opinions in <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982) and <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982) have, in the context of a federal habeas corpus case involving a challenge to a state court criminal conviction, strictly required a state habeas corpus petitioner to demonstrate both \u201ccause\u201d for failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection and actual \u201cprejudice\u201d resulting therefrom. While the Supreme Court did observe that \u201cIn appropriate cases those principles must yield to the imperative of a fundamentally unjust incarceration,\u201d <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. at p. 135, 102 S.Ct. at p. 1575, the court nevertheless expressed confidence that prisoners falling victims of such a miscarriage of justice \u201cwill meet the cause- and-prejudice standard ...\u201d 456 U.S. at p. 135, 102 S.Ct. at p. 1575. Thus, the \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\" standard is a difficult one to hurdle in terms of proof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
