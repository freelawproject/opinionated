Glenn, </em>394 F.2d 631 (6th Cir.1968), is determinative in this tax case involving a casualty loss that was covered by insurance but which was not claimed by the insured taxpayer for fear of cancellation of his insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue appeals from a decision of the United States Tax Court upholding the taxpayer\u2019s claim for a casualty loss deduction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 165(a) and (c)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The facts in this case have been stipulated by the parties. In June, 1976, a friend of the taxpayer ran the taxpayer\u2019s boat aground. The boat was damaged but to an extent-less than $1,000. Although the boat was insured, taxpayer did not file a claim for recovery of the damage with his insurance company. The taxpayer\u2019s decision not to collect insurance proceeds was motivated by his fear that the submission of another claim would result in the cancellation of his insurance policies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Taxpayer was able to collect $200.00 from his friend, reducing taxpayer\u2019s actual loss to $642.55. After taking into account the $100.00 limitation under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(c)(3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> taxpayer claimed a $542.22 casualty loss deduction on his 1976 return. The Commissioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction and issued a notice of deficiency. Taxpayer filed a timely petition with the United States Tax Court challenging the Commissioner\u2019s decision to disallow the deduction, Relying on <em>Kentucky Utilities Co. v. Glenn, </em>394 F.2d 631 (6th Cir.1968), the Tax Court concluded that the taxpayer s failure to pursue insurance _ proceeds barred the casualty loss deduction. The Tax Court, however, reconsidered its decision in light of Hills v. <em>C.I.R., </em>76 T.C. 484 (1981), aff'd, 691 F.2d 997 (11th Cir.1982)' \u201dd a\"\u00b0\"d the deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"pA10\">We are now asked to determine whether a voluntary election not to file an insurance claim for a casualty loss preeludes the insured-taxpayer from taking a casualty loss deduction under \u00a7 165 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. We are not able significantly to distinguish the issue presented in this ease from that presented in <em>Kentucky Utilities, </em>and, to the extent it is contrary to our holding in this case, we overrule that decision and Affirm the holding of the Tax Court below,</p>\n<p id=\"pA6p\">In <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>(K.U.), a steam . j <em>, . </em>generator was damaged m an accident. The generator was originally sold to K.U. by Westinghouse Electric Corporation and was under warranty at the time of the accident. Based on an independent invest\u00edgation, K.U. concluded that Westinghouse was responsible for the loss. Rather than jeopardize a valued business relationship by pursuing a claim against Westinghouse, K.U. sought indemnification from its insurance company, Lloyds of London. The insurance carrier did not dispute either its liability or the amount necessary to indemnify the loss. In fact, Lloyds offered to indemnify K.U. for the full amount of the damage. Because Lloyds insisted upon its right of subrogation against Westinghouse, however, K.U. refused to accept any insuranee proceeds. Instead, K.U., Westinghouse, and Lloyds entered into a settlement agreement whereby Westinghouse and Lloyds agreed to compensate K.U. in the amount of $65,550.93 and $37,500.00, respectively. Pursuant to this settlement, k.U. agreed to absorb the remaining cost 0f repairs and proceeded to deduct the $44,-486.77 on its corporate income tax return, either as a \u00a7 165 loss or as a \u00a7 23 \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d business expense, The district C01irt held that Kjrs failure reasonably to pnrsne indemnification from Lloy* baited an, casnalty loss dednction under \u00a7 2g(f) of the 1939 j R c <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> except to the extent of the $10,000 deductible provision in its insurance policy. Likewise, the district court held that K.U.\u2019s expenditures did not constitute ordinary or necessary business expenses under \u00a7 23(e) of the 1939 LR.C&gt;&gt; simflar to \u00a7 162 of the 1954 Qode This Court affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"pAia\">After our holding in <em>Kentucky Utilities, </em>Eleventh Circuit handed down its decis^on m <em>Hills, supra. </em>The <em>Hills </em>court attempted to distinguish, rather than to reject, the holding of <em>Kentucky Utilities. </em>\u2019 , ,, , have been unable to distinguish, how- , <em>TT </em>. . 6 \u2019. \u201e , ever\u2019 <em>Kentucky Ut\u00fcfes </em>\u201d aiW meaningful marmer- !t 18 true that <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>deals Wlth a corporation and a claimed business loss akm to a \u00a7 ^X1) loss&gt; while <em>Hills, </em>as well as the instant case, deal with subsection 165(c)(3) casualty loss claims by individual taxpayers (theft and shipwreck, respectively). Each situation is subject, nevertheless, to the general overriding requirement of \u00a7 165(a), whether business or individual, that a loss be \u201csustained ... and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.\u201d An interpretation of the code subsection under consideration, \u00a7 165(c)(3), as it pertains to a claimed individual loss, is therefore closely related to the interpretation given in <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>to the claimed business loss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Judges and commentators have given differing interpretations of the holding in <em>Kentucky Utilities. </em>Generally speaking, <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>is said to set forth a two-part transaction view; it looks to the \u201csustained loss\u201d clause and the \u201cnot compensated\u201d clause of \u00a7 165. Thus, <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>can be interpreted to hold either (a) that a taxpayer must exhaust all reasonable prospects for insurance indemnification before claiming a \u201csustained loss,\u201d or (b) that the phrase \u201cnot compensated by\u201d must be equated with the phrase \u201cnot covered by\u201d insurance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We now reject both of these interpretations which would preclude Miller\u2019s claim of a loss deduction under the circumstances here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The former interpretation must be rejected because it renders the \u201cnot compensated by\u201d clause mere surplusage. <em>See Hills, </em>691 F.2d at 1002. The question of whether a loss has been sustained depends upon the taxpayer\u2019s reasonable expectation of recovery from the wrongdoer. <em>Alison v. United States, </em>344 U.S. 167, 170, 73 S.Ct. 191, 192, 97 L.Ed. 186 (1952). The plain language of \u00a7 165(a) supports the proposition that the timing of a loss transaction must be determined <em>independent </em>of insurance consequences. Section 165(a) provides that \u201c[tjhere shall be allowed as a deduction any <em>loss sustained ... and not compensated </em>for by insurance ____\u201d (emphasis added). To define a sustained loss with reference to potential indemnification by an insurer strips the language of \u00a7 165(a), regarding compensation, of its meaning; any time a loss is sustained it, by definition, would not be \u201ccompensated for by insurance.\u201d <em>Hills, </em>691 F.2d at 1000-1002. In short, we believe that \u00a7 165(a) reflects the intent of Congress that the question of whether a loss is sustained should be resolved independently of any insurance consequences involved. This conclusion is bolstered by the rule of statutory construction that requires courts to construe the language of a statute so as to avoid making any word meaningless or superfluous. <em>See Fulps v. City of Springfield, </em>715 F.2d 1088, 1093 (6th Cir.1983). In the instant case, the parties have stipulated that, at the time of the deduction, there remained no reasonable prospect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>recovery from the wrongdoer. Thus, we conclude that the taxpayer has sustained a loss in a \u201cclosed transaction\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> during the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We likewise reject <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>for the proposition that \u201cnot compensated by\u201d means \u201cnot covered by.\u201d Such an interpretation of the language of \u00a7 165 is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the word \u201ccompensated.\u201d Absent unusual circumstances, we are bound to apply the plain meaning of a statute. <em>Hills, </em>691 F.2d at 1000. Moreover, legislative history, scant though it is, does not support an interpretation of \u00a7 165 that equates \u201cnot compensated by\u201d with \u201cnot covered by.\u201d As the court in <em>Hills </em>noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The initial House Ways and Means Committee language was \u201closses ... not covered by insurance or otherwise and compensated for.\u201d The Senate Finance Committee amended the language to its final and enacted form of \u201closses ... not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2U\">The footnote to this paragraph provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHV\"><em>\u201c13. See </em>J. Seidman, Seidman\u2019s Legislative History of Federal Income Tax Laws, 1938-1961, at 1018 (1938). There was no Finance Committee report for this bill. See <em>also </em>Comment, <em>Theft Loss Deductions as Relief for the Small Investor, </em>1978 Duke L.J. 849, 860-61 &amp; nn. 67, 68 (discussing and citing sources for limited legislative history of \u00a7 165(c)(3)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axa\"><em>Hills, </em>691 F.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Hills v. Commissioner, </em>76 T.C. 484, 487, after its analysis of the legislative history:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">[A]ll losses compensated by insurance are also, as a necessary concomitant, covered by insurance; nonetheless, it should be equally obvious that the converse, i.e. that all losses covered by insurance are also compensated for, is not- necessarily true.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\"><em>See also Hills, </em>691 F.2d at 1006: \u201c \u2018Compensated\u2019 is a word distinct from \u2018covered\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">It should also be pointed out that the only case relied upon in <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>for disallowing the claimed deduction as not an \u201cinsured loss\u201d was <em>Sam P. Wallingford Grain Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>74 F.2d 453 (10th Cir. 1934). The <em>Wallingford </em>case did not involve insurance at all, nor any casualty loss; rather, it involved the voluntary payment by a corporation of a predecessor concern\u2019s debt that was not assumed by the taxpayer. This was held not to be a payment giving rise to a loss \u201ccompensated for by insurance or otherwise\u201d under \u00a7 23(f), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2023 (Revenue Act of 1928). <em>Wallingford </em>may have been pertinent for its holding that this voluntary payment was also not an ordinary or necessary expense under \u00a7 23(c) of that same Act but it does not appear relevant to the insurance issues in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Courts which have held to the contrary generally have reasoned by analogy. <em>See Jewell v. Commissioner, </em>69 T.C. 791 (1978) (where the Tax Court analogized to medical expenses not compensated by insurance or otherwise under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)); and <em>Heidt v. Commissioner, </em>274 F.2d 25 (7th Cir.) <em>aff'g., </em>18 T.C.M. (CCH) 149 (1959) (where the Tax Court analogized that no ordinary and necessary business expense can be claimed under \u00a7 162(a) for the personal use of an automobile in connection with business when reimbursement is available from the employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">When the language of a statute is clear, as in this case, one need not resort to analogy. Congress has simply elected to treat seemingly analogous situations differently for underlying policy reasons. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>conclude that Congress limited the availability of \u00a7 165 deductions to \u201closses not compensated for by insurance or otherwise\u201d to avoid double compensation for taxpayers who in fact had received indemnification from their insurers. This interpretation is supported by Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.165-1(c)(4) [26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165-1(c)(4) ] (emphasis added),</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In determining the amount of loss actually sustained for purposes of section 165(a), proper adjustment shall be made for any salvage value and <em>for any insurance or other compensation received.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0y\">Because Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.165 \u2014 l(d)(2)(i) [26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165 \u2014 1 (d)(2)(i) ] speaks of \u201ca claim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery,\u201d some courts have relied upon it to support the contrary proposition that \u201cnot compensated by\u201d means \u201cnot covered by.\u201d When taken as a whole, however, we believe Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.165-l(d)(2)(i) also supports our conclusion that \u201cnot compensated by\u201d means not having actually received indemnification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The plain language of \u00a7 165, its legislative history, and the interests of public policy all support the conclusion we reach today. It should be noted that to hold otherwise would unjustifiably work to the disadvantage of taxpayers, not engaged in business, who voluntarily decline insurance indemnification for sound and practical reasons not primarily motivated by tax considerations, such as appellee. To hold otherwise would also work to the indirect advantage of taxpayers who, for whatever reasons, decline to obtain any insurance coverage at all to protect themselves from casualty, and then claim an uncompensated loss as deductible if a casualty occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s observation in <em>Hills </em>that \u201c[t]he disposition the Commissioner favore[d] in this case would deny a section 165 deduction any time a loss is covered by insurance,\u201d 691 F.2d.at 1000, would apply equally here. Such a disposition, that of the <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>case that there was no \u201cinsured loss,\u201d does not comport with the plain and clear meaning of this section of the Internal Revenue Code in light of the legislative history pointed out. We agree with the <em>Hills </em>court in its ultimate holding: \u201cSection 165(a) allows a deduction for an economic detriment that (1) is a loss, and (2) is not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Accordingly, our prior decision in <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>is overruled to the extent it is interpreted as denying any taxpayer in the posture of Miller a deduction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 165(a) and (c)(3), and the judgment of the Tax Court is Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">CONTIE, Circuit Judge, with whom LIVELY, Chief Judge, and GEORGE CLIFTON EDWARDS, Jr., KEITH and NATHANIEL R. JONES, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Although I agree with the majority that the question presented by this case is indistinguishable from the first issue discussed in <em>Kentucky Utilities Co. v. Glenn, </em>394 F.2d 631 (6th Cir.1968), and although I further agree with the majority that the phrase \u201cnot compensated for by insurance or otherwise\u201d in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(a) may not properly be construed to mean \u201cnot covered by insurance or otherwise,\u201d I neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>less remain convinced that the first holding of <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>should not be overruled. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">I do so for three reasons, the first of which is that the taxpayer\u2019s voluntary choice not to file an insurance claim, a claim which the parties stipulate the insurer would have paid, prevented a loss from being sustained under \u00a7 165(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority admits that the taxpayer\u2019s election to forego insurance benefits was a voluntary decision. For instance, the majority states the issue in this case as \u201cwhether a voluntary election not to file an insurance claim for a casualty loss precludes the insured-taxpayer from taking a casualty loss deduction under \u00a7 165 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 401. Although voluntary assumptions of economic detriments have been held not to result in deductible losses in analogous situations such as those involving bad debts, <em>see, e.g., Roth Steel Tube Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>620 F.2d 1176, 1181 (6th Cir.1980), the majority holds that Congress \u201csimply elected to treat seemingly analogous situations differently for underlying policy reasons.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 403. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In determining whether a voluntary election not to file an insurance claim prevents a loss from being sustained for purposes of \u00a7 165(a), one must distinguish between the casualty, which causes damage, and the loss, if any, resulting from this casualty. The language of certain subsections of \u00a7 165, the language of a relevant interpretative regulation and the case law all support the conclusion that the concepts of casualty and loss are distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The version of \u00a7 165(c)(3) applicable to this case states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">LIMITATION ON LOSSES OF INDIVIDUALS. \u2014 In the case of an individual, the deduction under subsection (a) shall be limited to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">(3) Losses of property not connected with a trade or business, <em>if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, </em>or from theft. A loss described in this paragraph shall be allowed only to the extent that the amount of <em>the loss to such individual arising from each casualty, </em>or from each theft, exceeds $100.00. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Since a loss \u201carises from\u201d an antecedent casualty under this language, the former term is not identical to the latter. The wording of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165 \u2014 l(d)(2)(i), a Treasury Regulation, is of similar import. This regulation concerns \u201ca casualty or other event ... <em>which may result in </em>a loss ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The words \u201cmay result in\u201d are instructive. Since a loss may, but need not, follow a casualty, the two concepts clearly are distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">The case law is equally clear on this point. In <em>Alison v. United States, </em>344 U.S. 167, 170, 73 S.Ct. 191, 192, 97 L.Ed. 186 (1952), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe terms embezzlement and loss are not synonymous. The theft occurs, but whether there is a loss remains uncertain.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, a casualty can occur without a loss subsequently being sustained. <em>See also Ramsay Scarlett and Company, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>61 T.C. 795, 808 (1974), <em>aff'd, </em>521 F.2d 786 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Allied Furriers Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>24 B.T.A. 457, 460 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">A voluntary election not to recover insurance benefits prevents a casualty from becoming a sustained loss because the causal connection between the two events is severed. The alleged loss results not from \u201cone of the circumstances listed in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>165(c)(3) ... but rather [from] the insured\u2019s own election not to accept reimbursement under his insurance policy, a separate identifiable event.\u201d <em>Hills v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>76 T.C. 484, 493 (1981) (Sterrett, J., dissenting). <em>See also Axelrod v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>56 T.C. 248, 261 (1971) (Quealy, J., concurring); <em>Bartlett v. United States, </em>397 F.Supp. 216, 218-20 (D.Md.1975); <em>Morgan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>47 T.C.M. \u00b6 78,116 (1978).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The responses to this analysis found in the Tax Court\u2019s majority opinion in <em>Hills </em>are unconvincing. First, the Tax Court noted that uninsured persons who suffer casualties are entitled to deduct their resulting losses. The court then held that insured persons who elect not to use their insurance in given situations are entitled to identical tax treatment because any economic detriment \u201csuffered by an individual taxpayer who voluntarily chooses not to maintain insurance coverage can likewise be said to. result from the choice to forego insurance coverage.\u201d <em>Hills, </em>76 T.C. at 488. The court thus equated the voluntary choice not to obtain insurance coverage to the voluntary election not to file a valid insurance claim after a particular casualty occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">One problem with this argument is that \u00a7165 refers only to the situation as it exists at the time of, and after, the casualty. Events and decisions preceding the casualty are simply irrelevant. Moreover, a great difference exists between not obtaining insurance coverage against highly contingent future occurrences and deliberately refusing a full recovery, at the expense of the federal Treasury, in the face of an actual casualty. In the latter situation, voluntarily choosing not to file a valid insurance claim should operate as a waiver of any form of compensation, including a tax deduction, for damages caused by the casualty. The purpose of \u00a7 165 is to allow a deduction for substantial uncompensated losses that are non-volitional in character. <em>Hills, </em>76 T.C. at 492 (Sterrett, J., dissenting); <em>see also Axelrod, </em>56 T.C. at 263 (Quealy, J., concurring); <em>Bartlett, </em>397 F.Supp. at 218. Since uninsured taxpayers have no choice but to bear any losses resulting from casualties, they should receive a deduction. Insured taxpayers, who have the present option to avoid losses, should not receive similar treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Second, the Tax Court analogized the present situation to 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165-1(d)(2)(i), which permits a taxpayer to deduct unrecompensed losses after litigation initiated in order to recover such losses has been settled or abandoned. The court noted that although the decision to settle or abandon litigation is voluntary, a loss deduction for unrecouped damages is nevertheless available in these situations. <em>Hills, </em>76 T.C. at 488-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The analogy between settling or abandoning litigation and voluntarily refusing to file insurance claims is strained. Pragmatic considerations, such as the time and hardship involved in litigation and the cost of litigation compared to the eventual recovery, <em>id. </em>at 489, may influence a prospective litigant to settle or abandon a claim. These factors should not become operative, however, until <em>after </em>the insurer has denied a filed claim and until litigation is contemplated. There simply is no justification for voluntarily electing not even to file a claim when the insurer may pay it in full. Indeed, the parties in the present case have stipulated that the insurer would have paid the taxpayer\u2019s entire claim had he chosen to file. A clear inference from this stipulation is that the taxpayer would not have encountered undue expenditures of time, effort or money in obtaining compensation. Hence, the Tax Court\u2019s analogy to the settlement and abandonment provisions of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165 \u2014 1(d)(2)(i) is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">A second reason for concluding that the taxpayer in this case sustained no loss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>purposes of \u00a7 165(a) is that the transaction was not closed and completed. Although the closed and completed transaction requirement is a product of the Treasury Regulations rather than of the statute itself, <em>see </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165-1(b), the courts have long upheld the doctrine. <em>See, e.g., United States v. S.S. White Dental Manufacturing Co., </em>274 U.S. 398, 47 S.Ct. 598, 71 L.Ed. 1120 (1927); <em>Ramsay Scarlett &amp; Co., </em>61 T.C. at 807, <em>aff'd, </em>521 F.2d 786. Whether a casualty transaction is closed and completed depends upon the reasonable prospects of eventual recoupment. <em>See S.S. White Dental, </em>274 U.S. at 402-03, 47 S.Ct. at 600; <em>Estate of Scofield v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>266 F.2d 154, 159-60 (6th Cir.1959); <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Harwich, </em>184 F.2d 835 (5th Cir.1950). The requirement that reasonable prospects of recovery must be exhausted before a transaction may be considered closed and completed was most forcefully stated in the <em>Ramsay Scarlett &amp; Co. </em>case:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">One of the essential inquiries under the \u201cclosed transaction\u201d concept has been whether, in the year the deduction is sought, there existed a substantial possibility that the alleged losses could be recouped by actions against responsible third parties or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">61 T.C. at 807, <em>aff'd, </em>521 F.2d 786. A reasonable prospect for recovery exists:</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">When the taxpayer has bona fide claims for recoupment from third parties or otherwise, and when there is a substantial possibility that such claims will be decided in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 811. Since the taxpayer in the present case possessed a bona fide claim against the insurer which would have been paid, he had a reasonable prospect for recovery which he was required to exhaust under the closed and completed transaction doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">It bears emphasis that this circuit has required the exhaustion of reasonable prospects of recovery at least since the <em>Estate of Scofield </em>case was decided in 1959. The majority opinion substantially narrows the exhaustion requirement. Specifically, the majority holds, in reliance upon language in <em>Alison v. United States, </em>that in order for a closed and completed transaction to exist, the taxpayer need only have exhausted reasonable prospects of recovery against the wrongdoer and not against third party insurers:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Furthermore, the terms embezzlement and loss are not synonymous. The theft occurs, but whether there is a loss may remain uncertain. One whose funds have been embezzled may pursue the <em>wrongdoer </em>and recover his property in whole or in part. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"AIQ\"><em>Id. </em>at 170. The issue discussed in <em>Alison </em>was whether terms such as \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201ccasualty\u201d are synonymous with the term \u201closs.\u201d In answering this question, the Supreme Court stated that the mere occurrence of a casualty does not constitute a loss because compensation might be available from the wrongdoer. Nevertheless, the court was not asked to decide, and it did not decide, whether exhaustion of reasonable prospects of recovery against wrongdoers <em>alone </em>would create a closed and completed transaction if insurance benefits were available. The issue of a duty to file insurance claims simply was not presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Decisions such as <em>S.S. White Dental </em>and <em>Estate of Scofield </em>require exhaustion of reasonable prospects of recovery without distinguishing between wrongdoers and third parties such as insurers. Moreover, the section of the Treasury Regulations which uses the phrase \u201creasonable prospect of recovery\u201d does not mention such a distinction. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165-1(d)(2)(i). None of these sources indicates that a taxpayer need exhaust only \u201csome\u201d reasonable prospects of recovery. Finally, the Fourth Circuit rule articulated in <em>Ramsay Scarlett &amp; Co. </em>and the Fifth Circuit standard stated in <em>Harwich </em>both expressly require exhaustion of reasonable prospects of recovery against insurers. Under these circumstances, the majority has improperly limited the scope of the exhaustion rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The majority also holds, in reliance upon the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Hills, </em>691 F.2d at 1002, that if a taxpayer must exhaust reasonable prospects of recovery against insurers in order to have a sustained loss under \u00a7 165(a), then the phrase \u201cand not compensated for by insurance or otherwise\u201d is rendered surplusage. <em>Ante. </em>at 402. As I read the majority\u2019s opinion, the point is that \u00a7 165(a) requires that two conditions be met before a deduction is permitted: (1) that a loss be sustained and (2) that this loss not be compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The majority argues that if the taxpayer must show that no compensation was either available or received (the second element) in order to demonstrate a sustained loss (the first element), then as a practical matter the second condition is deprived of meaning. Although this argument has force, adopting it creates a fundamental, though at first glance unapparent, conflict between \u00a7 165(a) and \u00a7 165(c)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">As has been indicated, \u00a7 165(c)(3), the relevant Treasury Regulation and the case law establish that the terms \u201ccasualty\u201d and \u201closs\u201d are not synonymous. The question, therefore, is by what mechanism the former is transformed into the latter. Under the approach being taken in this opinion, exhausting reasonable prospects of recovery after a casualty occurs and emerging from that process with unrecompensed damages creates a loss. The majority is precluded from adopting this mechanism in view of the holding that reasonable prospects of recovery must not be considered in defining what constitutes a loss. For the majority, a sustained loss under \u00a7 165(a) and the occurrence of a casualty are the same thing. This is so because no mechanism for transforming a casualty into a \u00a7 165(a) loss is present. The majority opinion, therefore, equates the terms \u201closs\u201d and \u201ccasualty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 165(a) even though the same terms are not synonymous for purposes of \u00a7 165(c)(3) and even though the case law expressly holds that the two terms do not mean the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Furthermore, the majority may not use as its mechanism for transforming a casualty into a \u00a7 165(a) loss the requirement that the taxpayer exhaust reasonable prospects of recovery against the wrongdoer. The final phrase of \u00a7 165(a) reads \u201cand not compensated for by insurance <em>or otherwise\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Obtaining compensation from the wrongdoer surely is comprehended by the \u201cor otherwise\u201d language. Although it holds to the contrary, the majority, under its analysis of \u00a7 165(a), may not properly require the taxpayer, in demonstrating that a loss has been sustained, to prove exhaustion of reasonable prospects of recovery against the wrongdoer. In the language of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Hills, </em>recoupment from the wrongdoer is part of the \u201ccompensation phase\u201d of \u00a7 165(a) rather than the \u201closs phase\u201d of that subsection. 691 F.2d at 1001. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, defining the term \u201closs\u201d with reference to reasonable prospects of recovery against the wrongdoer should be just as wrong as defining that term with reference to reasonable prospects of recovery against the insurer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">In short, this court faces a choice between two evils. Either a conceptual conflict must be created between \u00a7 165(a) and \u00a7 165(c)(3) or a phrase within \u00a7 165(a) must be construed in such a way as to render it superfluous. Although one might reasonably assert that the rule of construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>favoring avoidance of an outright conflict within a statutory provision outweighs the rule against construing part of that language in a manner so as to render it superfluous, it may be assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the policies underlying the two rules of construction are evenly balanced. Even in the latter situation, the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>counsels this court not to abandon one imperfect construction of \u00a7 165 in favor of another. Since the statute under review is inherently flawed, Congress should amend it if Congress dislikes the construction which the courts, including this court, have traditionally placed upon it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">A third reason for questioning the majority\u2019s conclusion is that it results in preferred tax treatment for business taxpayers. The majority\u2019s holding allows business taxpayers to \u201cdouble-dip.\u201d Since business taxpayers are comprehended by the decision in this case, <em>ante </em>at 401-02, they will be able to deduct both their insurance premium costs and their unrecompensed casualty damages for which reasonable prospects of recovery exist. I am of the opinion that the majority\u2019s brief treatment of this issue, <em>ante </em>at 401 n. 6, inadequately responds to the concerns expressed by Judge Hatchett, who dissented from the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Hills. </em>691 F.2d at 1008-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Moreover, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 raised the floor for nonbusiness taxpayer casualty loss deductions from $100 to the greater of $100 or ten per cent of a nonbusiness taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(h). Although the decision in this case will be of great significance to all business taxpayers, it will be of little or no benefit to numerous individual taxpayers. I am deeply troubled by such a disparate practical result.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Accordingly, I would reaffirm the first holding in <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>and would reverse the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\">.

Prior to December of 1974, taxpayer purchased insurance policies that covered his personal automobile, boat, and apartment.

Taxpayer\u2019s insurance broker convinced the insurance company to impose a -higher deductible, rather than cancel taxpayer\u2019s policies.

Because the loss was not an \"uninsured loss,\u201d by affirming the district court's view that it was not a loss \"not compensated for by insurance or otherwise\u201d the Sixth Circuit equated \"insured\" with \"compensated.\u201d Therefore, if \"insured\" is equivalent to \"covered,\" then <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>stands for the proposition that \"covered\" is equivalent to \"compensated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">On the other hand, this Court\u2019s <em>Kentucky Utilities </em>decision dealing with the question of whether an uncompensated loss was deductible was described as \"a rather terse opinion\u201d by Professor Summers in <em>Taxes, </em>April 1983 at 277, but it was further described as \"the <em>genesis </em>of a theory that the taxpayer may not elect to forego an insurance claim and deduct his loss ....\u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 276.

A loss must be \u201csustained in a closed transaction during the taxable year\u201d before a \u00a7 165(a) deduction is available. <em>Stivers v. C.I.R., </em>360 F.2d 35, 40 (6th Cir.1966)., The closed transaction doctrine is a timing principle that also requires that the gain or loss from a particular transaction be ascertained. <em>Burnet v. Logan, </em>283 U.S. 404, 51 S.Ct. 550, 75 L.Ed. 1143 (1931). This same principle applies to casualty loss deductions: as long as a reasonable expectation of recovery from the wrongdoer exists, the taxpayer\u2019s loss is not ascertained; thus, no loss has been sustained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.165 \u2014 1 (d)(2)(i) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">If a casualty or other event occurs which may result in a loss and, in the year of such casualty or event, there exists \u00e1 claim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, no portion of the loss with respect to which reimbursement may be received is sustained, for purposes of section 165, until it can he ascertained with reasonable certainty whether or not such reimbursement will be received. Whether a reasonable prospect of recovery exists with respect to a claim for reimbursement of a loss is a question of fact to be determined upon an examination of all facts and circumstances. Whether or not such reimbursement will be received may be ascertained with reasonable certainty, for example, by a settlement of the claim, by an adjudication of the claim, or by an abandonment of the claim. When a taxpayer claims that the taxable year in which a loss is sustained is fixed by his abandonment of the claim for reimbursement, he must be able to produce objective evidence of his having abandoned the claim, such as the execution of a release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">. As indicated by the majority, a loss must be both \"sustained\u201d and \"not compensated for by insurance or otherwise\" in order to be deductible under \u00a7 165(a). While acknowledging that the taxpayer has not in fact been compensated for $642.55 worth of damages to his boat, this dissent contends that the taxpayer has not sustained a loss for purposes of \u00a7 165(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-13\">. The rationale underlying this distinction will be discussed in greater detail <em>infra. </em>Although <em>Alison </em>is a theft case rather than a casualty case, the language of both \u00a7 165(c)(3) and \u00a7 165(e) indicates that this difference does not render <em>Alison </em>inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\">. Both <em>Bartlett </em>and <em>Morgan </em>have been cited for the now discredited proposition that \"compensated for by insurance or otherwise\" in \u00a7 165(a) means \"covered by insurance or otherwise.\" The cases are cited here only for their remarks concerning the voluntariness issue and not for their construction of the phrase \"compensated for by insurance or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\">.

The <em>Hills </em>court may have committed the same error as the majority makes in this case when it stated that recovery from a thief is part of the \"loss phase\" of \u00a7 165(a) rather than the \"compensation phase.\" 691 F.2d at 1001. If the court meant recovery of monetary compensation from a thief, then the court erred. Such recoupment is comprehended by the \u201cor otherwise\u201d language of the last phrase of \u00a7 165(a). On the other hand, if the court meant return of the stolen property by the thief, then the court was correct. That situation does not involve compensation. The present case, of course, involves compensation. The damage to the taxpayer\u2019s boat could only be remedied by recovering money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">. Indeed, the majority\u2019s decision is philosophically inconsistent with the most recent amendment to \u00a7 165. While the majority\u2019s approach will result in wider availability of \u00a7 165 deductions for certain taxpayers, the newly enacted \u00a7 165(h) is designed to limit \u00a7 165 deductions for nonbusiness taxpayers. <em>See infra. </em>Thus, Congress has indicated a preference for restricting, rather than expanding, the availability of \u00a7 165 deductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
