LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1500-8\">Appellants Richard David Blackston, Samuel Brantley, Alfred Canas, James Murray, Clifford Washington, and Carroll Barrett Zeigler were indicted for various violations of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>(West 1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, Washington, Brantley, Murray, Zeigler, and Blackston were convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute (Count V); Blackston and Zeigler were additionally convicted of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute (Count III); Canas and Blackston were convicted of conspiracy to import marijuana (Count II); and Blackston was convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (Count I). Appellants raise numerous contentions on appeal. After careful consideration of these arguments, we affirm the convictions of all appellants except Murray and Blackston. We conditionally affirm Murray\u2019s conviction, subject to the outcome of a hearing on remand. We affirm Blaekston\u2019s convictions on Counts I and V, but vacate his convictions and sentences on Counts II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-12\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-13\">Between August 1980 and September 1981, appellant Richard David Blackston organized a series of ventures to smuggle marijuana into the United States. The activities generally originated in Savannah, Georgia, and the surrounding area, including the fishing community of Thunderbolt. Typically Blackston would arrange for shrimp boats to go to Colombia, South America, and take on multi-ton cargos of marijuana. The boats would then either rendezvous near the Bahamas with offloading boats destined for the United States, or return directly to the United States and be offloaded in a harbor in Frogmore, South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-14\">In August 1980 Blackston arranged for co-indictee William Welch to take Welch\u2019s boat, the \u201cMiss Mary,\u201d to Colombia to pick up marijuana and transport it to the Bahamas for offloading. Blackston enlisted appellant Alfred \u201cSonny\u201d Canas to serve as base radio operator, in charge of communications with the boat. He also hired Frank Senior to serve as a crew member.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201cMiss Mary\u201d sailed to Colombia in September 1980, took on 10 tons of marijuana, and then proceeded to the Bahamas to offload onto smaller boats that would transport the marijuana to the United States. While the \u201cMiss Mary\u201d awaited rendezvous with the smaller boats, however, the Coast Guard spotted the ship, and the crew dumped the marijuana overboard. The Coast Guard subsequently boarded the \u201cMiss Mary,\u201d but found no evidence of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-15\">In October 1980 Blackston arranged another trip to Colombia, this time on the \u201cLady Lynn,\u201d a shrimper owned by appellant Carroll Barrett Zeigler. Blackston paid Zeigler $4,000 for the use of the boat. Blackston hired Welch to captain the boat and Canas to serve again as base radio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>operator. The \u201cLady Lynn\u201d took on 40,000 pounds of marijuana in Colombia and offloaded 96 bales onto smaller boats near the Bahamas, which then headed in the general direction of Florida. The crew of the \u201cLady Lynn\u201d dumped the rest of the marijuaha overboard and returned to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-4\">In May 1981 the shrimper \u201cLady Lynn\u201d made a second trip to Colombia. Again Welch served as captain. Blackston provided money for the boat\u2019s supplies and served as base radio operator. After the \u201cLady Lynn\u201d took on a load of marijuana in Colombia, it was stopped and boarded by the Coast Guard 50 miles off the coast of Colombia. The Coast Guard arrested the crew members and seized the ship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">During this period, Blackston was busy managing other drug smuggling ventures as well. In December 1980 Blackston supervised the unloading of an unidentified boat that brought a load of marijuana to Frogmore, South Carolina. The marijuana was stored in a stash house in Frogmore. Blackston wholesaled the marijuana from that location. In January 1981 Blackston arranged to move the marijuana to Chat-ham County, Georgia. Appellant Zeigler and Michael Feltovic, a co-indictee who pled guilty and testified at trial pursuant to a plea agreement, drove a truckload of 9,840 pounds of marijuana to a location near Zeigler\u2019s father\u2019s house in Chatham County. In February 1981 Blackston arranged to move this marijuana from Chatham County to Effingham County, Georgia. This move was less successful; during the course of it state undercover agents arrested several conspirators, including Zeigler.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1501-6\">Also in January 1981, Blackston arranged for the shrimp boat, the \u201cJeanette Murray,\u201d to bring a load of marijuana into the United States. Blackston gave appellant James Murray, owner of the boat, $50,000 to get the \u201cJeanette Murray\u201d ready for the marijuana run. Murray hired an unindicted coconspirator to serve as crew member for $50,000 and gave him a $2,000 downpayment. Blackston hired appellant Clifford Washington to captain the boat, promising him $50,000. Appellant Samuel Brantley was the navigator, and Clarence Outler helped ready the boat for the run.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1501-13\">Washington guided the \u201cJeanette Murray\u201d from Thunderbolt, Georgia, to a point near the Anguilla Banks, where they picked up 510 bales of marijuana from a fishing boat. The \u201cJeanette Murray\u201d proceeded to Frogmore, South Carolina, where the marijuana was unloaded. Appellant Zeigler helped unload and then took one truckload of the marijuana to Savannah. Washington and Brantley returned the \u201cJeanette Murray\u201d to Georgia, after completely ridding it of any marijuana residue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1501-14\">II. VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-15\">Appellants Washington and Brantley claim that the government failed to prove that the offense charged in Count V, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, took place in the Southern District of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-16\">Criminal defendants have a constitutional right to be tried in the state and district in which the crime was committed. <em>United States v. Males, </em>715 F.2d 568, 596 (11th Cir.1983). In reviewing an improper venue claim, this court must determine \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and making all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury verdict ... the Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that the offense took place within the trial district. <em>United States v. White, </em>611 F.2d 531, 535 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 992, 100 S.Ct. 2978, 64 L.Ed.2d 849 (1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[T]here need not be direct proof of venue where circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the inference that the crime was committed in the district where venue was laid.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>586 F.2d 395, 397 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 926, 99 S.Ct. 1258, 59 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">Count V was based on violations of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (West 1981), which prohibits possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2 (West 1969), which provides that \u201c[wjhoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\u201d Sufficient evidence of either (a) actual or constructive possession or (b) the aiding and abetting of another\u2019s actual or constructive possession could therefore support a conviction under this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">An aider or abettor may be tried in the district in which the principal committed the offense. <em>United States v. Kibler, </em>667 F.2d 452, 455 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 961, 102 S.Ct. 2037, 72 L.Ed.2d 485 (1982); <em>United States v. Buckhanon, </em>505 F.2d 1079, 1083 (8th Cir.1974); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>482 F.2d 1167, 1178-79 (10th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1159, 94 S.Ct. 918, 39 L.Ed.2d 111 (1974); <em>United States v. Kilpatrick, </em>458 F.2d 864, 868 (7th Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Bozza, </em>365 F.2d 206, 221 (2d Cir.1966). Therefore, as appellants concede, if there was adequate proof that Brantley and Washington aided and abetted another\u2019s actual or constructive possession in the Southern District of Georgia, venue was proper as to them under Count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-9\">An aiding and abetting offense occurs when a defendant \u201cassist[s] the perpetrator of the crime while sharing in the requisite criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>555 F.2d 1269, 1271 (5th Cir.1977). Aiding and abetting has two components: \u201c \u2018[a]n act on the part of a defendant which contributes to the execution of a crime and the intent to aid its commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>546 F.2d 1275, 1284 (5th Cir.1977) (quoting <em>United States v. Greer, </em>467 F.2d 1064, 1069 (7th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 1364, 35 L.Ed.2d 590 (1973)). <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1010 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1982). \u201c[I]n the context of a prosecution for aiding and abetting the possession of [marijuana] with intent to distribute, the government \u2018must introduce evidence connecting defendant with both aspects of the crime, possession and intent to distribute.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Schwartz, </em>666 F.2d 461, 463 (11th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>United States v. Longoria, </em>569 F.2d 422, 425 (5th Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-10\">In this ease, at least Zeigler and Blackston possessed marijuana from the \u201cJeannette Murray\u201d in the Southern District of Georgia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Brantley and Washington deny that they aided or abetted these possessions in any way, claiming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>any connection they had with this drug venture was severed after they offloaded the \u201cJeannette Murray\u201d in Frogmore. These claims ring false. Brantley and Washington knowingly aided Blackston and Zeigler by supplying them with marijuana. Their shared criminal intent in Blaekston\u2019s and Zeigler\u2019s possession with intent to distribute can be inferred from their own possession of the marijuana en route to South Carolina and the fact that they willingly engaged in a criminal venture that had as its ultimate object the distribution of the marijuana they brought to South Carolina.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These same facts connect Brantley and Washington with both possession and an intent to distribute. A further connection with the intent to distribute, which also refutes Brantley\u2019s and Washington\u2019s claims that their connection with the venture was severed after delivery, is that they had a continuing interest in the success of the entire venture. The interest was partly financial \u2014 each received $500 immediately after the voyage, but that was only a small portion of the sum that they were to receive ultimately<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 and partly an interest in not getting caught. Blackston and Washington cannot insulate themselves from Blackston\u2019s and Zeigler\u2019s possession when their actions made that possession possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-5\">This case is very much like <em>United States v. Buckhanon, </em>505 F.2d 1079 (8th Cir.1974). In <em>Buckhanon, </em>Arthur Buckhanon was arrested at the Minneapolis airport with 29 ounces of heroin in his possession. Arthur\u2019s source for the heroin was his wife Katherine, who obtained the drug through a contact in Mexico and then supplied it to her husband. Katherine was charged under \u00a7 841 with possession with intent to distribute. The government\u2019s theory was that she had aided and abetted Arthur\u2019s possession and was therefore liable as a principal under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2. A jury properly instructed on this theory convicted Katherine. On appeal, she maintained that venue was improper in Minnesota because she had not been in the state during Arthur\u2019s possession. Noting that an aider and abettor may be tried where the principal committed the substantive crime, the court rejected Katherine\u2019s claim: \u201cThere is no question but that Arthur was in the District of Minnesota when he was apprehended in the crime of possession of heroin. There was adequate proof that Katherine aided and abetted him in that possession. Therefore, venue was proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-9\">Similarly, there was adequate proof in this case to allow the properly instructed jury<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to find that Brantley and Washington aided and abetted Zeigler\u2019s actual and Blackston\u2019s constructive possession of marijuana in the Southern District of Georgia by obtaining the marijuana for them. Accordingly, venue in the Southern District of Georgia was proper.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>III. SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"AU7D\">Appellant Blackston argues that he was improperly convicted and sentenced on Counts II, III &amp; V. Blackston was convicted on Count I of continuing criminal enterprise under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 848, on Counts II &amp; III of conspiracy to import marijuana and conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846, and on Count V of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841. He was sentenced on Count I to 25 years, on Count II to 5 years, on Count III to 15 years, and on Count V to 15 years. The sentences on Counts I, II, and III are concurrent to each other and consecutive to the sentence on Count V; thus, Blackston\u2019s total sentence is 40 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">Counts II, III, and V were the predicate offenses for the \u00a7 848 conviction, which required, among other elements, proof of \u201ca continuing series of violations\u201d of the relevant subchapters of Title 21. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 848(b)(2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This circuit interprets \u201ca continuing series of violations\u201d to mean three or more violations. <em>United States v. Graziano, </em>710 F.2d 691, 697 n. 11 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1013 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-11\">Blackston contends that the \u00a7 846 conspiracy and \u00a7 841 possession counts are lesser-included offenses of the \u00a7 848 continuing criminal enterprise offense and that we must therefore vacate both the convictions and sentences of these lesser-included offenses under <em>Jeffers v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 137, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977); <em>United States v. Michel, </em>588 F.2d 986, 1000 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 825, 100 S.Ct. 47, 62 L.Ed.2d 32 (1979); and <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>575 F.2d 1347 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 907, 99 S.Ct. 1214, 59 L.Ed.2d 454 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-12\">The government concedes that the \u00a7 846 offenses merge with the \u00a7 848 offense. Therefore, we vacate the convictions and sentences on counts II and III.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-13\">Blackston\u2019s argument that he cannot be cumulatively punished for the \u00a7 848 count and the underlying \u00a7 841 offense runs aground on the shoals of <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1982), and <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>727 F.2d 1003 (11th Cir.1984). <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Garrett </em>hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>in a subsequent \u00a7 848 prosecution, double jeopardy does not prevent reliance upon a prior \u00a7 841 conviction as a predicate offense. Those cases hold essentially that the \u00a7 841 offense and the \u00a7 848 offense are distinct for double jeopardy purposes. <em>See Garrett, </em>727 F.2d at 1009; <em>Phillips, </em>664 F.2d at 1009. In light of the \u201cbasic design [of double jeopardy] as a bar against repeated attempts to convict,\u201d <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), if successive prosecutions (involving of course cumulative punishment) are not barred, it follows logically that double jeopardy does not bar cumulative punishment in a single prosecution for \u00a7 841 predicate offenses and the \u00a7 848 offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-8\">IV. ADMISSION OF PRIOR WRITTEN STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"Agoc\">Appellant Canas, who was convicted on Count II, objects to the admission into evidence of a prior written statement of government witness Frank Senior. Senior was charged in Count II with conspiracy to import marijuana. He and his lawyers prepared the statement after his arrest in New York, presumably in the hopes of striking a better plea bargain with the government and obtaining a less severe sentence from the trial judge. Subsequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>ly, Senior pled guilty. Senior\u2019s statement details his participation in the drug smuggling business; it includes an account of the \u201cMiss Mary\u201d and \u201cLady Lynn\u201d loads, which were the overt acts charged in Count II. Senior testified about these same matters at trial and was cross-examined by the attorneys for Blackston, Zeigler, and Can-as.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-4\">Canas argues that the government had no grounds to offer the statement into evidence. The district court found, however, and we agree, that the statement was properly admissible as a prior consistent statement under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B), offered to rebut implied charges of recent fabrication. Senior testified on direct examination that the destination of the \u201cMiss Mary\u201d and \u201cLady Lynn\u201d loads was the United States. On cross-examination, Can-as\u2019 attorney asked Senior to examine his statement, which he had testified on direct was a \u201cfull disclosure,\u201d 17 R. 96, to see if it said anything about the destination of the two loads. 17 R. 173. Senior conceded that it did not. In fact, however, the statement, on pages 14 and 15, did demonstrate that the destination was the United States. The district court therefore allowed admission of the statement to show that Senior\u2019s direct testimony was not a fabrication. 547 F.Supp. at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-5\">Canas further argues that admission of the entire 31-page statement was error because it was extremely prejudicial to him. The district court found that although the statement was lengthy, its complete submission did not prejudice Canas because his counsel had cross-examined Senior on the statements in the document. <em>Id. </em>We do not think that admission of the complete statement constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion regarding the admission of prior consistent statements.\u201d <em>United States v. Goodson, </em>502 F.2d 1303, 1307 (5th Cir.1974). Although a trial court has discretion to exclude those parts of prior consistent statements that do not relate specifically to matters on which the defendant has been impeached, <em>United States v. Mock, </em>640 F.2d 629, 632 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B), it is not required to do so. <em>Cf. United States v. Lombardi, </em>550 F.2d 827, 828 (2d Cir.1977) (when defense counsel challenges witness\u2019 credibility on basis of facts <em>absent </em>from prior statement, prior statement still admissible to prove consistency with other portions of testimony), <em>cited with approval in United States v. Hamilton, </em>689 F.2d 1262, 1273 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 911, 103 S.Ct. 218, 74 L.Ed.2d 174 (1982). Moreover, we find no merit in this assertion of error because, although Canas objected generally to admission of the statement, he did not request the excision of portions of the statement prejudicial to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-7\">Finally, Canas argues that allowing Senior\u2019s statement into evidence impermissibly placed a neat condensation of the government\u2019s case before the jury and in effect allowed the government\u2019s witness to accompany the jury into the jury room. Canas cites three cases that reversed narcotics convictions because the jury received drug evidence envelopes, on the fronts of which were printed forms filled out by narcotics agents that \u201cpresent[ed] in officially impressive manner\u201d capsule summaries of the government\u2019s case. <em>Sanchez v. United States, </em>293 F.2d 260, 268 (8th Cir.1961); <em>United States v. Adams, </em>385 F.2d 548 (2d Cir.1967); <em>United States v. Ware, </em>247 F.2d 698 (7th Cir.1957). The error in those cases, however, was that the statements on the envelopes had either not been introduced into evidence, <em>Adams, </em>385 F.2d at 550, or were inadmissible hearsay, <em>Sanchez, </em>293 F.2d at 269; <em>Ware, </em>247 F.2d at 700, and thus were not properly before the jury at all. The eases discussed the prejudicial effect of placing written condensations of the government\u2019s case before a jury in the course of determining that the error in giving the jury the statements was not harmless. Thus, these cases have no applicability to this case in which Senior\u2019s statement was not hearsay and was properly before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-8\">V. EXTRINSIC INFLUENCE ON THE JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-9\">The appellants allege that an extrinsic influence on the jury denied them a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>trial. After the trial was over, counsel for defendant Canas filed a motion to interview jurors. The motion was supported by an affidavit by Leroy Anderson, the boyfriend of juror Barbara Miller. Anderson swore that Miller had told him after trial that during jury deliberations about defendant James Murray, juror Angela Blige had informed the other members of the jury that she knew Murray\u2019s daughter and that Murray had \u201cbeen in this kind of trouble before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\">The district court held two <em>in camera </em>hearings to test the accuracy of this allegation and other allegations of extrinsic influence on the jury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> At the first hearing, Miller and Anderson testified, but the trial judge did not question them about juror Blige's remark. Defense counsel requested permission to question juror Miller on this subject, but the judge denied these requests. At this first hearing, the trial judge also denied the motion to interview the jurors about alleged improprieties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-5\">At the second hearing, juror Blige testified and flatly denied having made the remarks attributed to her by juror Miller, although she admitted that she knew Murray\u2019s daughter. The court conducted the inquiry at this second hearing and allowed only written questions from the attorneys present. He refused to ask many of the questions submitted by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-6\">Following the two hearings, the trial court concluded that the defendants had failed to prove the allegation that juror Blige had brought into the jury room the extrinsic fact that Murray had been involved with drug smuggling before. It therefore declined to set aside the verdict on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-7\">\u201cA party claiming that an improperly influenced jury returned a verdict against him must be given an opportunity to prove that claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Forrest, </em>620 F.2d 446, 457 (5th Cir.1980). In response to such an allegation, the trial judge \u201cmust conduct a <em>full investigation </em>to ascertain whether the alleged jury misconduct actually occurred; if it occurred, he must determine whether or not it was prejudicial.\u201d <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>429 F.2d 1019, 1026 (5th Cir.1970) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 922, 91 S.Ct. 910, 27 L.Ed.2d 825 (1971). <em>See Port Terminal &amp; Warehousing v. John S. James Co., </em>695 F.2d 1328, 1341 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 999 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-10\">In concluding that it need not conduct a full jury investigation, <em>i.e., </em>question all the jurors, to insure that the alleged extrinsic influence did not occur, the district court relied on <em>United States v. Sedigh, </em>658 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. Oct. 9, 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 921, 102 S.Ct. 1279, 71 L.Ed.2d 462 (1982).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There the trial court received an affidavit at trial\u2019s end from a defendant\u2019s wife, swearing that an anonymous telephone caller had told her that a U.S. Marshal had informed two jurors that the defendant had a prior conviction. The trial court held an <em>in camera </em>hearing at which it questioned the wife and two Marshals under oath. The wife repeated her affidavit and the Marshals denied the allegations. On the basis of this hearing the trial court determined that there was no need for further investigation. The appeals court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in refusing to conduct a full jury investigation because the allegation of extrinsic influence remained speculative even after the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-11\">The <em>Sedigh </em>case is distinguishable from the case before us in two important respects. First, the allegation of extrinsic influence in <em>Sedigh </em>sprang from an anonymous source and was relayed by the defendant\u2019s wife. Neither of these facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>would inspire confidence in its validity. Here, juror Miller made the allegation on personal knowledge, lending more credibility to the allegation. Second, the trial judge in <em>Sedigh </em>questioned both the accuser and the possible wrongdoers about the allegation. His decision that the appellant had failed to prove a jury breach could logically have been based on a credibility choice. Here, the trial judge did not question juror Miller about juror Blige\u2019s alleged remark and refused to allow defense counsel to question Miller. His conclusion that appellants failed to prove jury misconduct was based entirely on juror Blige\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-4\">Binding precedent in this circuit holds that a juror\u2019s denials of misconduct are an insufficient basis upon which to reject a claim of misconduct, under circumstances similar to this case. In <em>United States v. Forrest, </em>620 F.2d 446 (5th Cir.1980), a juror named Mrs. Watson confirmed to the trial judge in the middle of the trial that her niece had sought to influence her to acquit the defendants. Watson said that none of the other jurors was aware of the tampering attempt. The trial judge dismissed Mrs. Watson and replaced her with an alternate. The trial continued and resulted in a conviction. On appeal, this court held that the trial court\u2019s investigation into the occurrence of prejudicial contacts with the jury had been inadequate:</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-5\">Other than Mrs. Watson\u2019s statement that the others knew nothing about the contact, the record is silent as to the knowledge the other jurors might have had. Watson\u2019s testimony on this point is insufficient. We must be mindful of the fact that at the outset of the trial the judge told the jurors to avoid contacts with anyone involved with the ease and not to discuss the case among themselves until they retired. Watson\u2019s natural disposition would be to claim she had complied with those instructions. <em>Only the other jurors can enlighten us properly on this subject.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1508-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 457 (emphasis added). Thus, the court remanded for a full jury investigation to determine whether impermissible contacts with the other jurors occurred and, if so, whether they were prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-10\">Similarly, juror Blige\u2019s testimony alone was an insufficient basis for concluding that she did not in fact make the remarks attributed to her by juror Miller. Blige\u2019s natural inclination would be to deny making those remarks. The jury was repeatedly admonished to consider only the evidence admitted in the case by the trial judge. 21 R. 3, 4. That also was part of the jurors\u2019 oath. <em>Id. </em>at 3.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in not inquiring further into this allegation of extrinsic influence. By preventing defense counsel from questioning Miller and the other jurors about this allegation, the trial court denied them the opportunity to prove their claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1508-11\">We need not remand this entire case, however. Although all the appellants raised this issue on appeal, taking the allegation of extrinsic influence as established, the jury misconduct was harmless as to all but appellant Murray. The extrinsic fact that Murray had been in this kind of trouble before pertained only to Murray and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>any spillover prejudice to the other defendants would have been negligible, particularly in view of the overwhelming evidence against these defendants. <em>See United States v. Winkle, </em>587 F.2d 705, 715 (5th Cir.) (considering weight of evidence against defendants in determining prejudice of extrinsic evidence), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 827, 100 S.Ct. 51, 62 L.Ed.2d 34 (1979). Therefore, our finding of error in the investigation of the allegation of extrinsic influence does not affect the convictions of Blackston, Brantley, Washington, Zeigler, or Canas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-5\">In regard to appellant Murray, however, \u201c[w]e cannot doubt the prejudicial potential of a report \u2014 which the criminal defendant had no opportunity to challenge \u2014 that he had been in trouble before.\u201d <em>United States v. Howard, </em>506 F.2d 865, 867 (5th Cir.1975) (remanding for full jury investigation of whether a juror had stated that defendant had been in trouble before and if so, whether defendant was thereby prejudiced). Accordingly, we remand for further investigation of Miller\u2019s allegation that Blige told the jury that Murray previously had been involved in drug smuggling. The district court should question all available jurors as to whether the incident occurred. If it appears that it did, the district court must determine whether there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of prejudice to Murray. <em>United States v. Savage, </em>701 F.2d 867, 871 (11th Cir.1983). If the district court concludes that there was such a possibility of prejudice, Murray\u2019s conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. If, on the other hand, the extrinsic influence did not occur or there was no reasonable possibility of prejudice, Murray\u2019s conviction will stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-6\">In the interest of judicial economy, we follow the procedure utilized in <em>United States v. Renteria, </em>625 F.2d 1279, 1284 (5th Cir.1980), and <em>United States v. Preston, </em>608 F.2d 626, 640 n. 19 (5th Cir.1979), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>446 U.S. 940, 100 S.Ct. 2162, 64 L.Ed.2d 794 (1980):</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-7\">We declare as the law of this case that an appeal will lie to this court on any decision by the district court on remand which is adverse to [Murray]. Such appeal shall be handled, without the necessity for a new appeal, on the basis of the record now before us together with the record of the remand hearing and the district court\u2019s supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law which shall be certified to this court and referred for further disposition to this panel. In the event of such an appeal, the clerk of this court will set a reasonable schedule for the filing of supplemental briefs without further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-9\"><em>United States v. Renteria, </em>625 F.2d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-10\">VI. FOURTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"Ac_y\">Appellants Canas, Blackston, and Zeigler contest the legality of the Coast Guard\u2019s stop, search, and seizure of the \u201cLady Lynn,\u201d and the introduction of evidence obtained against them as a result of that search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-11\">On the night of August 21, 1981, the Coast Guard cutter \u201cSteadfast\u201d spotted a small vessel 50 miles from the Colombia coast. The \u201cSteadfast\u201d unsuccessfully tried to make radio contact with the vessel. A searchlight revealed that the vessel was the shrimper \u201cLady Lynn\u201d out of the port of Savannah, Georgia. Suspicious because shrimping boats are not normally found off the coast of Colombia, the Coast Guard assembled a boarding party to make a safety and documentation check pursuant to 14 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 89 (West 1956). After the party boarded the \u201cLady Lynn,\u201d the \u201cSteadfast\u201d relayed to it a radio message from the Federal Intelligence Service in El Paso that the \u201cLady Lynn\u201d might contain contraband. The boarding party nevertheless asked to inspect only the ship\u2019s documents, at which point a \u201cLady Lynn\u201d crewmember escorted them to the pilot house. The route to the pilot house led through the ship\u2019s living quarters, where the boarding party observed numerous burlap bales of marijuana in plain view. The bales tested positively for THC. The Coast Guard thereupon seized the \u201cLady Lynn\u201d and arrested its crew members. Information provided by William Welch, one of the crew members, led to the indictment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>We agree with the district court that the boarding of the \u201cLady Lynn\u201d was proper under 14 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 89(a),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which gives the Coast Guard plenary power to stop and board American vessels on the high seas to inspect for safety, documentation, and obvious narcotics violations without probable cause or reasonable suspicion. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>664 F.2d 1174, 1175 (11th Cir.1981). Appellants argue that the Coast Guard\u2019s stated purpose in boarding the \u201cLady Lynn\u201d was not just to conduct a safety and documentation inspection, but to insure \u201ccompliance with all applicable U.S. laws for the class of vessel.\u201d The two are clearly one and the same. Even if the boarding was also motivated by suspicions of narcotics violations, this does not \u201c \u2018taint the validity of the safety and documentation inspection [under \u00a7 89(a) ].\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jonas, </em>639 F.2d 200, 203 (5th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>United States v. Hillstrom, </em>533 F.2d 209, 211 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1038, 97 S.Ct. 734, 50 L.Ed.2d 749 (1977)); <em>see also United States v. Luis-Gonzalez, </em>719 F.2d 1539,1549 (11th Cir.1983) (upholding similar search).</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-4\">Once on board, the Coast Guard found marijuana in plain view. The appellants. seem to suggest that the marijuana was found in a part of the boat (the crew\u2019s living quarters) that would not have been entered if the boarding party had confined itself to a document inspection. Trial testimony by Ensign Paul Sanchez, a member of the boarding party, clearly demonstrated, however, that the route to the pilot house containing the ship\u2019s documents led through the living quarters. 16 R. 337, 344. Therefore, there was no illegal search of the \u201cLady Lynn\u201d for contraband. The trial court properly denied the appellants\u2019 motions to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the seizure of the \u201cLady Lynn.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1510-8\">VII. SUPPLEMENTAL JURY CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"Azse\">Appellants Murray, Brantley, Washington and Zeigler argue that they were denied their right to have an Article III judge rule on their objections to a supplemental jury charge given by a U.S. Magistrate in the district court\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-9\">After the jury retired to deliberate, the trial court asked counsel if they had any objection to the magistrate receiving the verdict. The trial judge explained that he could not be in court that evening, but would return in the morning. There were no objections. The judge instructed counsel that if the jury requested recharging, the counsel \u201cshould get together on it, if you can. If you cannot, then they will just have to remain in there until I get up here____ Again, if there is any question of law see if you can\u2019t agree on it and find it where it is here and decide what needs to be done. And, I will check back with you in the course of the evening.\u201d 21 R. 37-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-12\">Later in the course of the evening, the magistrate informed counsel that the jury had requested a supplemental instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>and that he had made a response. He then had the clerk read the response and invited counsel to put their objections in the record. Apparently the magistrate then left the courtroom. Counsel put no objection in the record to the magistrate\u2019s having given the instruction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Apparently, the trial judge did not return until after the verdict was rendered the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-4\">On appeal, appellants rely on <em>United States v. De la Torre, </em>605 F.2d 154 (5th Cir.1979). In <em>De la Torre, </em>the court held that \u201c[i]t is the defendant\u2019s right to have an Article III judge rule on his counsel\u2019s objections and requests for instructions to the jury, at least absent waiver of that requirement by counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we think that counsel waived the requirement. The trial court\u2019s clear instructions were that if counsel could not agree to a supplemental charge, the charge should not be made. Although the record indicates that the magistrate was at fault in not following these instructions, counsel neither objected nor made any effort to draw this error to the magistrate\u2019s attention. Although the magistrate left the courtroom after advising the attorneys of the supplemental charge, presumably he remained in the courthouse awaiting jury requests and the verdict and thus was available to hear any motions the attorneys might have made regarding the instruction. Nor did the attorneys attempt to locate the trial judge. Defense counsel had ample time to raise the issue at least with the magistrate inasmuch as the verdict was not rendered until late the next afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-6\">Even if there was no waiver and the defendants\u2019 right to have an Article III judge rule on the objections to the supplemental charge was violated, the error was harmless. As stated <em>supra, </em>note 27, we have reviewed the objections to the supplemental charge and find no merit in them. <em>See United States v. Boswell, </em>565 F.2d 1338, 1341-42 (5th Cir.) (finding harmless error under similar circumstances), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 819, 99 S.Ct. 81, 58 L.Ed.2d 110 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-9\">VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AM71\">We have reviewed the other issues raised by the appellants and find no reversible error. Therefore, we affirm the convictions of Brantley, Washington, Zeigler, and Canas. We conditionally affirm Murray\u2019s conviction, subject to a full investigation of the alleged jury impropriety involving juror Blige. We affirm the convictions of Blackston on Counts I and V, but vacate his convictions and sentences on Counts II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1500-10\">. Thirteen other individuals were also named in the indictment. One was convicted, but does not appeal his conviction; two were acquitted; eight pled guilty before trial; and two remain fugitives.

City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209. <em>Cf. Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>667 F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir.1982) (adopting as binding precedent all of the post-September 30, 1981, decisions of Unit B of the former Fifth Circuit).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1502-7\">. Zeigler had actual possession in Georgia of the marijuana he trucked to Savannah. Blackston, who was in the Southern District of Georgia, had constructive possession in Georgia of that same marijuana. The evidence at trial showed that Blackston constructively possessed the marijuana by virtue of his dominion and control over it. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>666 F.2d 195, 200 n. 7 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B). Blackston also had control and thus constructive possession in Georgia of the marijuana that remained stashed in Frogmore, for as the district court noted, a party may constructively possess an object across state lines. <em>United States v. Blackston, </em>547 F.Supp. 1200, 1206 (S.D.Ga.1982). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>503 F.2d 50, 52-53 (6th Cir.1974) (defendant in Cleveland constructively possessed suitcase in Chicago). <em>Cf. United States v. Davis, </em>666 F.2d 195, 200 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B) (venue in Georgia improper because no actual possession of drugs in Georgia and no constructive possession by defendant in Georgia of drugs in Florida).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1503-6\">. The aiding and abetting requirement of shared intent between the aider and abettor and the principal, sometimes referred to as the \"community of unlawful intent,\u201d <em>see, e.g., United States v. Austin, </em>585 F.2d 1271, 1277 (5th Cir.1978), is similar to the requirement in conspiracy cases that there be an \"agreement.\u201d However, shared intent need not rise to the level of agreement. <em>United States v. Cowart, </em>595 F.2d 1023, 1031 (5th Cir.1979). The fact that here Brantley and Washington, although not charged with conspiracy, were almost certainly conspirators in fact, emphasizes the strength of \"the community of unlawful intent\u201d between Brantley, Washington, Zeigler, and Blackston.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1503-7\">. There was testimony at trial that Brantley and Washington were promised $50,000 for making the marijuana run on the \"Jeanette Murray.\u201d 17 R. 227. That these payments were contingent on the success of the venture is demonstrated by Clarence Outler\u2019s reaction to the Effingham County bust, which he thought involved the load of marijuana from the Jeanette Murray: \"G.D. there goes some of our money.\u201d 18 R. 156.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1503-11\">. The jury received a complete and proper aiding and abetting instruction. 21 R. 21-22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1503-12\">. Appellants Zeigler and Murray also contest venue as to Count V. Because Zeigler had actual possession of the Jeannette Murray marijuana in the Southern District of Georgia, venue was proper in his case. Venue was proper in Murray\u2019s case for the same reason it was in the case of Washington and Brantley. As owner of the \"Jeannette Murray,\u201d Murray aided and abetted Zeigler\u2019s and Blackston's possession in the Southern District of Georgia. In addition, there was testimony indicating that Murray was in Savannah when his boat full of marijuana was in South Carolina. 17 R. 230-31. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>while in the Southern District of Georgia he had constructive possession of that marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1504-6\">. The trial court charged the jury on Count I that the government must prove that Blackston committed the offenses charged in Counts II, III, and V as part of a continuing series of violations of the federal drug laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1504-7\">. Because Blackston was convicted on all three counts, we need not decide an open question in this circuit, namely, whether an overt act in violation of the drug laws can be a predicate offense under \u00a7 848 when it is not the basis for a separate count and conviction. <em>See United States v. Raffone, </em>693 F.2d 1343, 1349 n. 12 (11th Cir.1982) (leaving question open), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2094, 77 L.Ed.2d 303 (1983); <em>United States v.

Johnson, </em>575 F.2d 1347, 1357 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 907, 99 S.Ct. 1214, 59 L.Ed.2d 454 (1979), indicates that such overt acts can constitute \u00a7 848 predicate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-14\">We necessarily decide another question previously undecided in this circuit, namely, whether conspiracies under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846 can be predicate offenses under \u00a7 848. <em>See United States v. Raffone, </em>693 F.2d at 1349 n. 12 (leaving question open); <em>United States v. Michel, </em>588 F.2d at 1001 (same). We now hold that they can be. <em>See United States v. Middleton, </em>673 F.2d 31, 33 (1st Cir.1982). <em>Cf. United States v. Stricklin, </em>591 F.2d 1112, 1124 (5th Cir.) (indicating that conspiracy offense may be \"part of the foundation of the \u00a7 848 charge\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 963, 100 S.Ct. 449, 62 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979). <em>But see United States v. Jefferson, </em>714 F.2d 689, 702 n. 27 (7th Cir.1983) (only substantive offenses may serve as \u00a7 848 predicate offenses).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1504-15\">. The law in this circuit is clear that both the sentences and convictions must be vacated under these circumstances. <em>United States v. Michel, </em>588 F.2d at 1001; <em>United States v. Buckley, </em>586 F.2d 498, 504-05 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 982, 99 S.Ct. 1792, 60 L.Ed.2d 242 (1979). Because Blackston\u2019s \u00a7 846 sentences are concurrent with his \u00a7 848 sentence, vacating his \u00a7 846 sentences does not reduce his total sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1505-4\">. We note that <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Garrett </em>are inconsistent with a First Circuit case disallowing subsequent prosecution of \u00a7 848 offenses and predicate \u00a7 841 offenses. <em>United States v. Middleton, </em>673 F.2d 31, 33 (1st Cir.1982). The result in the instant case is inconsistent with the decisions of several other circuits barring cumulative punishment for \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 848 offenses in a single prosecution. <em>See United States v. Gomberg, </em>715 F.2d 843, 851 (3d Cir.1983) (double jeopardy bars cumulative sentences for substantive predicate offense and continuing criminal enterprise); <em>United States v. Jefferson, </em>714 F.2d 689, 701-03 (7th Cir.1983) (same); <em>United States v. Samuelson, </em>697 F.2d 255, 260 (8th Cir.1983) (same); <em>United States v. Chagra, </em>669 F.2d 241, 261-62 (5th Cir.) (Congress did not intend cumulative punishment for \u00a7 841 predicate offense and \u00a7 848 offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 846, 103 S.Ct. 102, 74 L.Ed.2d 92 (1982). <em>But see United States v. Mourad, </em>729 F.2d 195, 203 (2d Cir.1984) (Congress intended cumulative punishment for \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 848 offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">We note also that <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Garrett </em>conclude that the \u00a7 841 predicate offense is not a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 848, without applying the test announced in <em>Blockberger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), notwithstanding that <em>Blockberger </em>is the established test. <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). Application of the <em>Blockberger </em>test in <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Garrett </em>apparently would indicate that the \u00a7 841 predicate offense <em>is </em>a lesser-included offense of the \u00a7 848 count. In this regard, <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Garrett </em>are also potentially inconsistent with <em>United States v. Stricklin, </em>591 F.2d 1112, 1123 (5th Cir.1979) (applying the <em>Blockberger </em>test to conclude that a \u00a7 846 conspiracy was a lesser-included offense of a \u00a7 848 count). <em>See also United States v. Michel, </em>588 F.2d 986, 1001 (5th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>575 F.2d 1347, 1354 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">Having noted the foregoing inconsistencies, we observe on the other hand potential support for <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Garrett. </em>In the context of deciding the propriety of cumulative punishment in a single trial, the law is now clear that the <em>Blockberger </em>test is merely a rule of statutory construction to assist in ascertaining whether the legislative body intended cumulative punishment under the two statutes at issue. <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). In the context of successive prosecutions, as in <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Garrett, </em>it is true that <em>Blockberger </em>is the established test. <em>Brown v. Ohio, supra. </em>However, Supreme Court precedent does not unequivocably rule out a conclusion that the <em>Blockberger </em>test operates primarily as a rule of statutory construction even in the context of successive prosecutions. <em>See Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. at 165, 97 S.Ct. at 2225 (\"The Fifth Amendment double jeopardy guarantee serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors. The legislature remains free under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define crimes and fix punishments\u201d). More particularly, the Supreme Court has not yet definitively established the role of the <em>Blockberger </em>test in the context of a subsequent prosecution of a compound offense, based in part on a previous conviction of a predicate offense. <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 710-11, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1447-48, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980) (Relinquish J-, with Burger, C.J., dissenting). Although a plurality of four justices in <em>Jeffers v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 137, 151, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2216, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977), apparently rejected an argument that the usual double jeopardy principles should not apply to complex crimes, both Justice Rehnquist and Chief Justice Burger were among that plurality, and their comment in <em>Whalen </em>leaves the issue in some doubt. If the <em>Blockberger </em>test operates only as a rule of statutory construction, the Supreme Court may well conclude that Congress intended that a subsequent \u00a7 848 prosecution could rely in part upon, as one of the predicate offenses, a previous \u00a7 841 conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1507-8\">. Although appellants also appeal the trial court\u2019s treatment of these other allegations, we find no reversible error in their disposition. Our discussion here relates only to the allegation involving juror Blige.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1507-12\">. Because <em>Sedigh </em>was decided after September 30, 1981, and is a Unit A case, it is not binding on this panel. <em>Bonner v.

We also note that there are latent questions about Blige\u2019s testimony that she did not tell the jury that she knew Murray\u2019s daughter. Arguably, if she did not tell the jury, juror Miller might not have known that Blige knew Murray\u2019s daughter. Of course, we express no opinion on juror Blige\u2019s credibility; we hold merely that the circumstances required a fuller investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1508-7\">.
