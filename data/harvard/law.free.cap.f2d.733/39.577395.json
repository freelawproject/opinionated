Denley (\u201cDenley\u201d) appeals from the District Court orders staying his action under the Commodity Exchange Act pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">Denley\u2019s complaint alleged fraud, negligence, misrepresentation, and Commodity Exchange Act claims against his broker and his broker\u2019s employer. Denley alleged that the broker \u201cchurned\u201d his account and invested in highly speculative commodities futures when the broker knew Denley needed a stable investment, and Denley thereby lost $64,000 of his $93,000 life savings. Denley had signed an agreement with Shearson that provided that any dispute arising out of the agreement would be settled through arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">On October 5, 1982 the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration. On October 27, 1982, the defendants moved the court to clarify or amend its order, primarily seeking a ruling that the defendants could pick the arbitrators rather than the plaintiff as stated in the October 5 order. Also on October 27 Denley submitted a \u201cpetition for re-consideration,\u201d which Denley wrote pro se (although he had been represented by counsel) and sent directly to the District Judge rather than filing it with the clerk. In his petition Denley extensively argued the merits of his claim and the inconvenience of arbitration, and also raised the possibility that he had been fraudulently induced to sign the arbitration clause and that the wording of the clause did not comply with Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">On November 26, 1982 the District Court entered another order reaffirming its order of October 5. The November 26 order did not alter or expand the October 5 order in any substantive respect. The November 26 order also stated that \u201cany appeal made from this Order must be made within thirty (30) days of this Order.\u201d On December 22, 1982 \u2014 within thirty days of the November 26 order but more than sixty days after the October 5 order \u2014 Denley filed a notice of appeal from both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">On December 27 Denley asked the District Court to either certify the arbitration question under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or rule that the November 26 order was a final order and Denley\u2019s appeal was timely. On March 25, 1983, the District Court issued an order ruling that the November 26 order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>was a final order and refusing to certify the question under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Before reaching the merits of Denley\u2019s case, we must first consider whether this appeal must be dismissed for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">1. Appealability of October 5 Order</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The October 5 order was not a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, as it did not finally dispose of the case. Its effect was merely to stay the proceedings pending arbitration, after which further proceedings would be needed to enforce the arbitration award. It was, however, an appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), which provides that orders \u201cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions\u201d are generally appealable interlocutory orders. An \u201cinjunction\u201d under this statute generally includes only orders granting all or part of the relief sought in the case. <em>See 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 110.20[1]. An exception is the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule, which provides that a stay of an action at law pending other proceedings is an appealable injunction. Although deriving from the distinction between law and equity (to allow presentation of an equitable defense in an action at law the chancellor must enjoin the proceeding at law pending the equitable proceeding), the Supreme Court has held that the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule has survived the merger of law and equity. <em>Baltimore Contractors v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 75 S.Ct. 249, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955). The rule\u2019s primary effect today is that orders granting or denying jury trials and orders concerning stays of legal actions pending arbitration are appealable. <em>See generally 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 110.20[3]. The Sixth Circuit has specifically held that a grant, <em>Mansbach v. Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, </em>598 F.2d 1017 (6th Cir.1979), and a refusal, <em>Liskey v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., </em>717 F.2d 314 (6th Cir.1983), of a stay of an action for damages pending arbitration are appealable interlocutory orders. Denley\u2019s suit is an action for damages, so the District Court\u2019s October 5 order was an appealable interlocutory order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The appeal from that order was, however, not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) provides that a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days of the date of entry of the order appealed from. Denley\u2019s notice of appeal was filed seventy-eight days after the October 5 order. The thirty-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional and may not be extended for substantial compliance or otherwise. <em>E.g., Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>Moorer v. Griffin, </em>575 F.2d 87 (6th Cir.1978); <em>Schlink v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., </em>276 F.2d 116 (6th Cir.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) provides that the filing of a timely motion for reconsideration will extend the period for filing an appeal until thirty days after the order disposing of the motion. Denley\u2019s pro se petition was considered a motion for reconsideration by the District Court, although never docketed. Reconsideration was not denied until November 26, within thirty days of the notice of appeal. However, in order to extend the time for appeal a motion for reconsideration must be timely. <em>Browder, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264-65, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560-61, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>Schlink, </em>276 F.2d 116, 117 (6th Cir.1960). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) provides that such a motion must be brought within ten days after entry of the judgment. The October 27 motions were brought twenty-two days after the order appealed from, and were therefore untimely. That the District Court nonetheless considered the motion cannot affect the timeliness of the appeal; the District Court is without power to enlarge the time for making Rule 59(e) motions. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b). <em>See also, e.g., Textile Banking Co. v. Rentschler, </em>657 F.2d 844, 849 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Scola v. Boat Frances, R., Inc., </em>618 F.2d 147, 154 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The District Court\u2019s pronouncement of November 26 that the appeal could be taken within thirty days of that date can also not be considered an extension of time in which to appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5). An extension can be made only after a motion is filed within thirty days of the order and notice is given to the other party. Even if Denley\u2019s October 27 communication had asked for an extension, it would still have been insufficient because the other side was not given notice. In any event, the District Court may extend the time for appeal a maximum of thirty to forty days, and the notice of appeal in this case was forty-eight days late.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Had Denley been in a position to rely on the District Court\u2019s statement that he had thirty days after November 26 to appeal, the appeal might have been timely under <em>Thompson v. INS, </em>375 U.S. 384, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964). In <em>Thompson, </em>a motion for a new trial was made twelve days after the judgment, but the district court immediately told the movant that the motion had been made in time to suspend the appeal period. An appeal was taken within thirty days of denial of the motion for a new trial. The Supreme Court held that the appeal would be considered timely because the appellant had done something which would have extended the time for appeal if properly done, and relied on the district court\u2019s statement that it was done properly. The <em>Thompson </em>district court\u2019s statement that the appeal period had been suspended was made before the original thirty-day appeal period had expired. Denley, however, could not have relied on the District Court\u2019s ruling that the time to appeal ran until December 26. The District Court did not express its views until November 26, too late for Denley to have taken an appeal or asked for an extension. This case is essentially indistinguishable from <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). In <em>Browder </em>the defendant moved to stay a habeas writ twenty-eight days after it was granted, and the district court ruled that the motion was timely twenty-one days after that. The Supreme Court held that the appeal filed after the eventual denial of reconsideration of the writ was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">This Court is therefore without jurisdiction to consider the appeal of the October 5 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">2. Appealability of the November 26 Order</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of the November 26 order. However, that order was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">In its March 25 order the District Court held that the November 26 order was a final order. The court cited <em>Rogers v. Sobering Corp., </em>262 F.2d 180 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 991, 79 S.Ct. 1121, 3 L.Ed.2d 980 (1959). The District Court then found that:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">its Order to arbitrate, first issued on October 5, 1982, would not, in the normal course of procedure, be followed by another judicial order which would be required to carry the arbitration award into effect and, therefore, the Order to arbitrate is final. The only reason that this Court had to issue another order to arbitrate is that the plaintiff in this case, Robert Denley, has demonstrated an extraordinary tendency to protract the litigation in the instant lawsuit. The Court notes further, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s petition for reconsideration and the defendants\u2019 Motion to Alter or Amend, both dealt with by the Court in its Order of November 26, 1982, had the effect of making November 26, 1982, the operative date for determining the timeliness of the plaintiff\u2019s Notice of Appeal. This Court, therefore, concludes that its Order of November 26, 1982 is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d from which an appeal as of right may be taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ____</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The District Court\u2019s reliance on the <em>Rogers </em>case was clearly misplaced. In <em>Rogers </em>the Third Circuit held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">It is settled that an order for arbitration is a final appealable decision where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>it is not merely a step in the judicial enforcement of a claim nor auxiliary to a main proceeding but is the full relief sought____ Such cases are to be distinguished from those in which an order for arbitration is made in the course of a continuing suit for other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">262 F.2d at 182. The present case is clearly of the latter type; it is a suit for damages and if the arbitrator were to award damages further proceedings in the court would be necessary to collect those damages. The District Court apparently misconstrued the law to mean that the order was final as long as no other order was needed to effectuate the arbitration, rather than considering whether another order would be necessary to carry the arbitration award into effect. The November 26 order was not \u201cfinal\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">If the November 26 order was appealable, it must be as an interlocutory order \u201crefusing to dissolve or modify\u201d an injunction appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). The October 5 stay was an \u201cinjunction\u201d under this section, as discussed above, and the November 26 order refused to modify or dissolve it. However, courts have generally held that an order is not one refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction under this section unless new matter is presented to the court on a motion to dissolve or modify the injunction. <em>See 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 110.20[2]. The rationale for this rule was articulated by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Stiller v. Squeez-A-Purse Corp., </em>251 F.2d 561, 563 (6th Cir. 1958): section 1292(a)(1) \u201cdoes not contemplate that a party may repeatedly move to dissolve an injunction, and, after repeated orders of denial, appeal from the last order of denial entered by the court.\u201d In <em>Stiller </em>the plaintiff twice asked the district court to rescind its injunction and appealed from the district court\u2019s second refusal. The Sixth Circuit noted that although the second request alleged that new evidence supported the plaintiff\u2019s position all of the \u201cnew\u201d relevant evidence had been in existence before the court\u2019s first two rulings, and held that the second denial was not appealable. The appealability of the November 26 order in the present case is controlled by <em>Stiller. </em>Although Denley alleged in his petition for reconsideration that he had just become aware of various regulations he thought were applicable, the regulations did not constitute new evidence and were certainly in existence before the original October 5 order. Denley therefore never made a cognizable request for modification or dissolution of the stay and the November 26 order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Denley asks this Court to amend the District Court\u2019s order to add a certification of the question under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The District Court expressly declined to make such a certification and this Court is without power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">This Court is therefore also without jurisdiction to consider the appeal of the November 26 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
