The issue presented is whether the petitioner was deprived of effective assistance of counsel when the trial judge denied petitioner\u2019s repeated requests for substitute counsel. We conclude that, on the facts of this case, the trial court should have allowed petitioner to retain new counsel and thus we reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The petitioner had been previously convicted by a jury of carnal knowledge of a female over 16, M.C.L.A. 750.520, in February 1974. The Michigan Supreme Court, however, reversed this conviction on the grounds that the petitioner should have been given a reasonable continuance following the prosecution\u2019s late endorsement of two expert witnesses. <em>People v. Wilson, </em>397 Mich. 76, 83, 243 N.W.2d 257 (1976). Prior to the second trial, petitioner filed a motion to disqualify the original trial judge from rehearing the case. This motion was denied by an alternate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">On the second day of the second trial, the record indicates that a serious verbal altercation took place between the trial judge and defendant\u2019s retained counsel shortly after defense counsel began his cross-examination of Sgt. Audrey Martini, the officer in charge of the investigation. Defense counsel began his cross-examination by asking the officer for a copy of the search warrant which the officer had used to seize certain pieces of incriminating evidence. The officer replied that the warrant was in \u25a0the court\u2019s file. After a brief exchange between the trial judge and defense counsel, the judge excused the jury and then asked defense counsel when he \u201clast looked at the Court file for this case.\u201d Defense counsel replied that he had never looked at the actual court file, but that he had made an extensive review of his office file for the case. At that point, the trial judge expressed his concern over defense counsel\u2019s lack of preparation and asked petitioner if he wished to discharge his lawyer \u201cas being incompetent\u201d. When petitioner answered that he did' not wish to continue with his attorney, the trial judge asked petitioner to state his reasons for wanting substitute counsel. Petitioner replied that he wanted new counsel because his attorney \u201chasn\u2019t prepared for the case.\u201d The trial judge did not rule on petitioner\u2019s request, but rather denied defense counsel\u2019s subsequent request to leave the courtroom in order to make a phone call. In response, defense counsel became very agitated and repeatedly expressed his belief that he would be arrested if he left the courtroom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>After denying defense counsel\u2019s request for a mistrial, the trial judge brought the jury back into the courtroom and instructed the prosecutor to continue the trial. Defense counsel, however, continued to state that he was under arrest and that the jury should be so informed. Defense counsel also refused to cross-examine Sgt. Martini and indicated that (1) he refused to continue the trial and (2) he was no longer petitioner\u2019s attorney. At that point, court was adjourned for the day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The following day, prior to the jury\u2019s admission to the courtroom, the petitioner expressed his belief that he could not get a fair trial due to the previous day\u2019s altercation. The trial judge replied that the jury \u201cwas not here when that took place,\u201d and further stated that \u201c[i]f [defense counsel] had properly prepared and read the court file, he would not have asked [certain questions].\u201d This statement triggered a new exchange between the trial judge and defense counsel regarding defense counsel\u2019s preparation for the case. Following this exchange, petitioner again indicated that he was not satisfied with his attorney due to \u201cthe events that took place yesterday.\u201d The court again stated that the incident took place outside the presence of the jury and the trial proceeded. Petitioner was later found guilty of rape and received a life sentence. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and the Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal. Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the district court denied in June 1981. Petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Although an essential element of a criminal defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is the right to retain an attorney of the defendant\u2019s choice, <em>Linton v. Perini, </em>656 F.2d 207, 208-09 (6th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1162, 102 S.Ct. 1036, 71 L.Ed.2d 318 (1982); <em>United States v. Burton, </em>584 F.2d 485, 488-89 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1069, 99 S.Ct. 837, 59 L.Ed.2d 34 (1979), this right is not absolute. \u201cThe right \u2018cannot be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct an orderly procedure in courts of justice, and deprive such courts of the exercise of their inherent powers to control the same\u2019.\u201d <em>United States v. Burton, </em>584 F.2d at 489. Accordingly, \u201c[i]n order to warrant a substitution of counsel during trial, the defendant must show good cause, such as a conflict of interest, a complete breakdown of communication or an irreconcilable conflict which leads to an apparently unjust verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Catabro, </em>467 F.2d 973, 986 (2d Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 926, 93 S.Ct. 1358, 35 L.Ed.2d 587 (1973). <em>See United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185, 188 (3rd Cir.1982); <em>Maynard v. Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Young, </em>482 F.2d 993, 995 (5th Cir.1973). The petitioner must also demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ney\u2019s performance. <em>Hindman v. Wyrick, </em>702 F.2d 148, 152 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Owens v. Wainwright, </em>698 F.2d 1111, 1113 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 117, 78 L.Ed.2d 116 (1983); <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>694 F.2d 1348, 1349 (2d Cir. 1982); <em>United States v. Baynes, </em>687 F.2d 659, 670 (3rd Cir.1982). Finally, it is well settled that when a defendant voices a seemingly substantial complaint about counsel, the trial judge should make a thorough inquiry into the reasons for the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction. <em>See Hudson v. Rushen, </em>686 F.2d 826, 829 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1896, 77 L.Ed.2d 285 (1983); <em>McKee v. Harris, </em>649 F.2d 927, 933 (2d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 917, 102 S.Ct. 1773, 72 L.Ed.2d 177 (1982); <em>United States v. Hart, </em>557 F.2d 162, 163 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 906, 98 S.Ct. 305, 54 L.Ed.2d 193 (1977); <em>United States v. Young, </em>482 F.2d at 995; <em>Sawicki v. Johnson, </em>475 F.2d 183, 184 (6th Cir.1973). Such an inquiry is necessary if the court is to determine whether good cause for substitution of counsel exists. <em>United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">When petitioner enunciated his reasons for his dissatisfaction with counsel, the record indicates that the trial judge was already engaged in an ongoing verbal altercation with defense counsel and thus the court made only a perfunctory, surface inquiry to determine the truth and scope of petitioner\u2019s allegations. While the trial court\u2019s failure to make a thorough inquiry is not in and of itself a sixth amendment violation, we hold that petitioner did in fact have good cause to request new counsel and that the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request deprived petitioner of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">We note at the outset that the state appellate court\u2019s ultimate finding that petitioner had effective counsel is not entitled to a presumption of correctness pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Adams v. Jago, </em>703 F.2d 978, 980 (6th Cir.1983). Such a conclusion is legal in nature and is freely reviewable by this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We also note that while petitioner\u2019s request for new counsel came during the trial, there is no evidence that petitioner\u2019s request was contrived for purposes of delay. <em>See United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d at 190. During the verbal altercation between the trial judge and defense counsel, the record indicates that defense counsel became extremely agitated at the trial judge\u2019s comments and essentially sought to protect himself r.ather than the interests of his client. Although most of the altercation took place outside the presence of the jury, the jury was present when defense counsel stated that (1) he refused to make any further objections, (2) he refused to continue the trial, and (3) he was no longer petitioner\u2019s attorney. Although we agree with the state court of appeals that the conduct of the trial judge was, at times, abrasive, we nevertheless hold that defense counsel\u2019s attempt to remove himself from the case in front of the jury was inexcusable and prejudicial. Defense counsel also chose to continue his heated exchange with the trial judge rather than cross-examine the police officer in charge of the investigation. That defense counsel failed to cross-examine a key government witness is further evidence that he was, at that time, unwilling or unable to protect the interests of his client. In short, we hold that this conduct, along with petitioner\u2019s unheeded statements of dissatisfaction with his counsel, evidence an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of defense counsel and petitioner which prejudiced petitioner\u2019s case and thus deprived petitioner of his sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. In light of our holding on petitioner\u2019s effective assistance of counsel claim, we do not address petitioner\u2019s claim that he was denied a fair trial due to bias on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is Reversed and the case is Remanded to the district court with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">. The text of this exchange is reproduced in pertinent part below:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">THE COURT: You wish to discharge your lawyer as being incompetent?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">DEFENDANT WILSON: You asked me did I wish to continue with this attorney and I said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">THE COURT: Why? State your reasons on the record. He had not prepared the case well?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">DEFENDANT WILSON: No he hasn\u2019t prepared the case \u2014 prepared for the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">THE COURT: He what?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">DEFENDANT WILSON: He hasn\u2019t prepared for the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">THE COURT: Do you have money to hire another lawyer? We have a question of incompetency of Counsel\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">DEFENDANT WILSON: I My family may\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"A1g\">THE COURT: Is your family here?</p>\n<p id=\"AJ_\">DEFENDANT WILSON: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">THE COURT: Mr. Patterson, don\u2019t call out.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-19\">MR. PATTERSON: You\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t use the phone?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-20\">THE COURT: I\u2019m telling you that during the trial, you can\u2019t use the phone in the course of a trial. Mr. Patterson, do not leave the area of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-21\">Now Mr. Wilson, are you prepared to discharge your lawyer? I have a problem. I have been reversed three times for incompetence of Counsel. I don\u2019t know how to solve the question. Each one has to be handled on its own merits. I find here a lawyer who is trying his third or fourth capital case, two years of experience; never bothered to check the court file; didn\u2019t start his preparation until yesterday when he asked the Prosecutor for a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-22\">We have a firm that\u2019s been on this case for over a year as I recall\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b493-23\">MR. PATTERSON: I should state for the record that the firm of Stone, Richardson, Greer and Allen represents this man and if he discharges me personally, fine. I should also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>state for the record that the Court has made statements to this man that he has answered yes or no to and I don't care what the Court happens to believe, Mr. Wilson \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what the motive for the Court is. The fact that this Court has been reversed before is not my problem but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I have properly prepared for this case and unless I\u2019m a criminal defendant myself all of a sudden, I don't understand what the problem is.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">THE COURT: Well at least on three occasions the Supreme Court has said, \"Judge Gillis, you should not have let that trial go on with incompetent Counsel. This man was not properly represented\".</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Now, I\u2019m asking Mr. Wilson\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">MR. PATTERSON: That\u2019s your opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">THE COURT: I am saying, the record discloses for one that you\u2019ve never looked at the court file.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">MR. PATTERSON: Nor any other court file.</p>\n<p id=\"AOJ\">THE COURT: Two, you\u2019ve had only two years of experience and this is your third or fourth capital trial. You didn\u2019t ask the Prosecutor for the search warrant until yesterday after the trial was in progress or the day of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">MR. PATTERSON: I would like the record to reflect that our office has had this case for at least two years that I know of before I was ever there. And that all of this has been discussed and the opinions and the research done by our office by two different attorneys other than myself and that I have read our file and that Counsel did not feel it was necessary to go up and look at the court file.</p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">THE COURT: Mr. Wilson, he's the boss. Do you wish to continue this trial with this law firm?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">MR. PATTERSON: I don\u2019t think the question is the law firm; I think the question is this lawyer? \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">THE COURT: And this lawyer in particular? MR. PATTERSON: Not 'and this lawyer\u2019; this lawyer period. That\u2019s the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">THE COURT: All right; that's the question Mr. Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">MR. WILSON: Can I confer with my family?</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">THE COURT: Yes, you can talk to your family-</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">MR. PATTERSON: Can I go make a telephone call?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">THE COURT: No, you will not. What do you have to make a phone call about? You\u2019re committed to this trial\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b494-18\">MR. PATTERSON: Since all of a sudden I\u2019m a defendant, if I make a move these Police Officers are going to arrest me and you can hold me for contempt and put me in the Wayne County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-19\">THE COURT: That is not so\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b494-20\">MR. PATTERSON: If I walk out this door, the Court is not going to put me in jail or fine me because if you tell me yes, I'm going out that door.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-21\">THE COURT: I am saying the Court has ordered you\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b494-22\">MR. PATTERSON: Am I under arrest? Am I under Arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-23\">THE COURT: I said do not leave this courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">Mr. Wilson, you can talk to your family.</p>\n<p id=\"AuEa\">MR. PATTERSON: Don\u2019t answer another question.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-26\">I don\u2019t believe that you can hold me in this courtroom against my will, not and conduct this kind of proceeding and damn it if I don\u2019t move for a mistrial on the basis of the statements made here in front of me, my client, the Prosecutor, the Judge and the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-27\">THE COURT: Nothing has been said in front of the jury about this.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-28\">MR. PATTERSON: This is the most illegal I have ever seen in my life; your holding me here against my will. You\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t walk out that door and I\u2019m under Court order to stay here. That\u2019s just what you just said, right? And you can enforce your orders by criminal contempt proceedings. And if I walk out that door one of these Officers can arrest me and shoot me if he wants to.</p>\n<p id=\"Asx\">THE COURT: Do you want to continue the trial Mr. Wilson?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-29\">MR. PATTERSON: I don\u2019t; I move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-30\">THE COURT: The motion is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-31\">.
