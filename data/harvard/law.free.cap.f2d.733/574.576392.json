SWYGERT, United States Senior Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b642-25\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b642-26\">Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (Pioneer) brought this action against Wilson Hybrids, Inc. (Wilson) for trademark infringement under federal law (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125) and unfair competition under Iowa law (Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 548.10 and 548.11).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-27\">Both corporations, headquartered in Iowa, produce and sell hybrid seed corn and other agricultural products.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-28\">Since 1964, Pioneer has used, in its advertising, an oblong hexagonal emblem or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>sign, the top portion of which contains, in black letters on a white background, the name and identifying symbol of the company. The bottom portion of Pioneer\u2019s emblem contains white lettering, usually identifying a particular Pioneer product by number, on a red background.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In 1968, Wilson began using an oblong hexagonal emblem, the top portion of which contains, in red letters on a white background, the name of the company; the bottom portion of the emblem is red, and contains a white rectangle within which, in red letters, appears the word \u201cseeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In 1976, Wilson developed a new emblem, which has since largely replaced the 1968 emblem in Wilson\u2019s advertising. The new emblem, like Pioneer\u2019s emblem, was an oblong hexagon containing, across the top, the company name in black letters on a white background, and across the bottom, white lettering on a red background.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that Pioneer had a protectible interest in the emblem it has used since 1964.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It held that the emblem Wilson used from 1968 to 1976 did not infringe Pioneer\u2019s rights, because differences in the respective color schemes of the Pioneer emblem and the 1968 Wilson emblem sufficiently distinguished the emblems from each other. But the court also held that Wilson\u2019s 1976 emblem, closely resembling Pioneer\u2019s in color combination (black-on-white top, white-on-red bottom) as well as shape, did infringe Pioneer\u2019s rights. The court accordingly enjoined Wilson from using its 1976 emblem.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">From the district court\u2019s decision enjoining Wilson from using one but not the other of its emblems, both parties appeal. Pioneer contends that the district court should have enjoined Wilson from using both the 1968 and 1976 emblems. Wilson argues that the court should not have enjoined the use of either of the Wilson emblems.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">We reject the arguments of both parties and affirm the judgment of the district court. These appeals raise primarily issues of fact. The district court\u2019s findings of fact cannot be characterized as clearly erroneous, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and its conclusions of law follow from those findings. Because no useful purpose would be served by the detailed repetition of those facts and conclusions here, we affirm the decision of the district court on the basis of its well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">.

The court rejected Pioneer's broader claim that it had a protectible interest in a \u201cblank\u201d red-and-white oblong hexagon, devoid of any lettering or other identifying marks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
