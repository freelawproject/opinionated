Freeman,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a former employee of the company. We hold that the Administrative Law Judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d) applied an improper legal standard to the evidence, and therefore we vacate the Board\u2019s decision and order and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-13\">Freeman was employed from July 1940 until June 1974 by the Marigold Coal Company, first as a coal truck driver for four years and then as a welder at a coal strip mine for thirty years. From July 1974 until June 31, 1977, Freeman worked as a welder for Drummond. All of Freeman\u2019s coal mine employment involved surface work at strip pit locations. Freeman retired in May 1977, at age sixty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-14\">On June 21, 1977, Freeman filed a claim for benefits under the Act for alleged total disability due to pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis, which is commonly known as \u201cblack lung,\u201d is a dust disease of the lungs arising from coal mine employment. The Department of Labor approved the claim, holding the coal mine operator, Drummond, liable. Drummond contested its potential liability and a formal hearing was held on August 6, 1980 before an ALJ, who awarded benefits to Freeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-15\">I. MEETING THE PRESUMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"AWUp\">Freeman sought benefits on the basis of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a), which provides that a miner is presumed to be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if he or she has engaged in coal mine employment for at least ten years and one of four medical requirements is satisfied. The first medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>cal requirement is described in subsection (a)(1), which states that the miner can meet the presumption with a chest x-ray establishing the existence of pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(1). Before the ALT, five x-ray films which had been read approximately ten times were submitted in evidence. The earliest x-ray was dated May 22, 1974 and was read by Dr. Terrell Bird, a radiologist, as indicating simple pneumoconiosis (category I/O).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Juan Gonzalez, a radiologist, read an x-ray dated October 24, 1977 as consistent with pneumoconiosis (category 1/0). This film was later reread by Dr. George Risman and Dr. William S. Cole, both of whom are \u201cB\u201d readers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as negative for pneumoconiosis. An x-ray dated April 17, 1979 was read by Dr. Lowell Clemmons as positive for pneumoconiosis. This film was reread by Dr. Cole, who found the film to be unreadable due to poor quality. Next, Dr. Ben V. Branscomb, who is also a \u201cB\u201d reader, read a film dated June 26, 1979 as negative for pneumoconiosis. Finally, a film was taken on March 14, 1980 and classed by Dr. Arthur Calix (who apparently is not classified as a reader) as compatible with pneumoconiosis (categories 2/1 and 1/1). This film was reread twice by two \u201cB\u201d readers, Dr. Thomas J. Payne III and Dr. Risman, as negative for pneumoconiosis. The ALT found that the requirements of subsection (a)(1) had been met because of the four x-ray readings that were positive for pneumoconiosis: those of Drs. Bird, Gonzalez, Clemmons, and Calix.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-8\">Under subsection (a)(2), the miner meets the presumption by introducing ventilatory studies that establish the presence of a chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(2). Six pulmonary function tests were put into evidence, but the ALT credited only the study of Dr. Gilbert Hamilton as \u201csubstantially valid in form.\u201d The test demonstrated a one second forced expiratory volume (FEVi) of 2.33 liters per second and a maximal voluntary ventilation (MW)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of 81.88 liters per minute. Under section 727.203(a)(2), the presence of a chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease is established if an individual of Freeman\u2019s height (70\") has an FEVi equal to or less than 2.5 and an MW equal to or less than 100. The ALT concluded that \u201c[t]he five remaining ventilatory studies, while formally flawed or inadequate do at the minimum point to an undeniable pulmonary dysfunction in Claimant Freeman, as the reported FEVi\u2019s and MW\u2019s are <em>far </em>below normal\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>Under subsection (a)(4), the medical requirement necessary to create the presumption is met if \u201cother medical evidence, including the documented opinion of a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment, establishes the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4). A number of medical reports were submitted into evidence. In Dr. Calix\u2019s opinion, Freeman has pneumoconiosis and is disabled from performing his usual coal mine work. Dr. Clemmons concluded that Freeman has extensive pneumoconiosis and is totally and permanently disabled \u201cfrom a pulmonary standpoint.\u201d Dr. Hamilton diagnosed pneumoconiosis in conjunction with bronchitis, and indicated that Freeman is disabled from performing rapid or frequent repetitious lifting of weight. Dr. Gonzalez likewise diagnosed simple pneumoconiosis. The AU noted that Dr. Ben V. Branscomb offered a contrary opinion as to the cause and state of Freeman\u2019s disability but concluded that the clear weight of evidence supported a finding of total pneumoconiosis disability pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4). The AU also considered Freeman\u2019s testimony that he was compelled to cease his coal mine work because of his coughing and breathing problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-9\">II. REBUTTING THE PRESUMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"AB_W\">Drummond claims that the AU applied an improper legal standard to the rebuttal evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The regulations provide four ways for the operator to rebut the presumption of total disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In determining if the presumption is rebutted, the factfinder must consider \u201call relevant medical evidence.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b). The AU found that the presumption had not been rebutted:</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-10\">Although Respondent/Employer herein attempted to elicit convincing evidence from Dr. Branscomb ... that Claimant\u2019s respiratory difficulties were due to cigarette smoking and not to pneumoconiosis, I do not feel that this particular medical documentation has sufficiently satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>Blevins v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>9 BRBS 510, BRB No. 78-406 BLA, (December, 1978), for proving cigarette smoking in isolation as the cause of disability, in that his reasoning is not based on the totality of evidence on Mr. Freeman\u2019s pulmonary condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-11\">Drummond contends that the AU erred in applying the requirement of <em>Blevins v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>9 BRBS 510 (1978) (\u201cBlevins II\u201d) to Dr. Branscomb\u2019s report and deposition testimony<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>erred in finding that the presumption had not been rebutted under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(3). We agree with Drummond that the ALJ applied an improper legal standard in his consideration of Dr. Branscomb\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-5\">In <em>Blevins II, </em>the Board held that a physician\u2019s medical opinion offered to rebut an interim presumption of pneumoconiosis must be expressed in terms of a \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d before that opinion may be considered by an ALJ in rebuttal. The Seventh Circuit has specifically rejected the \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d standard. <em>Peabody Coal Co. v. Lowis, </em>708 F.2d 266 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Underhill v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>687 F.2d 217 (7th Cir.1982). The <em>Underhill </em>court explained that the Department of Labor cannot establish a standard that treats the same proof differently depending on which side offers it. Because claimants are permitted to invoke the pneumoconiosis presumption merely on the basis of \u201cthe documented opinion of a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4), mine operators must be permitted to rebut the presumption under the same standard. 687 F.2d at 223. The <em>Underhill </em>court held that a physician\u2019s opinion, expressed in clear and uncontradicted terms and based on a physical examination, a ventilatory study, chest x-rays, and a review of the miner\u2019s employment history satisfied the \u201creasoned medical judgment\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 223. In <em>Lowis, </em>the court found that a physician\u2019s clear and uncontradicted opinion based on a review of the miner\u2019s employment history and a thorough examination satisfies the \u201creasoned medical judgment\u201d standard; 708 F.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-6\">Furthermore, the Board recently has held: \u201cTo the extent that <em>Blevins II </em>required a medical opinion to satisfy the standard of a \u2018reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u2019 we overrule the decision. It is sufficient that a doctor\u2019s opinion constitutes a reasoned medical judgment.\u201d <em>Blevins v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>\u2014 BLR - (BRB No. 81-2085 BLA, Dec. 21, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-11\">Therefore, because the ALT applied an incorrect standard, we remand to the ALJ to consider the rebuttal evidence of Dr. Branscomb and the other doctors under the \u201creasoned medical judgment standard.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1595-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the Board\u2019s decision is VACATED and the case is ordered REMANDED for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1592-11\">. Title IV of the Act has been amended three times since 1969: first by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-303, 86 Stat. 150; then by the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-239, 92 Stat. 95; and most recently by the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-119, 95 Stat. 1635. Prior to the 1972 amendments, a large number of claims were denied under the standards of the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\u201d). The 1972 amendments, which were implemented as interim presumptions at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490, were passed to liberalize eligibility requirements. The 1972 amendments also shifted responsibility for Part C claims (claims filed after December 31, 1973) to the Department of Labor (\"DOL\u201d). The DOL's claims approval rate, however, was significantly lower than that of the SSA because the SSA\u2019s liberal interim presumption was inapplicable to DOL cases. Congress responded with the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, which was enacted to expand coverage and to liberalize claim awards. The Secretary of Labor was authorized to adopt new criteria which were to be no more restrictive than the SSA\u2019s interim presumption. The Secretary promulgated interim criteria at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.200 <em>et seq. </em>including the presumption at issue in this case, at \u00a7 727.203. In addition, financial responsibility for Part C claims passed from the federal government, which pays Part B claims, to the employer or its insurance carrier, unless an appointed state workers\u2019 compensation program exists. <em>See Underhill v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>687 F.2d 217, 219-20 (7th Cir.1982), for a discussion of the Act's history. <em>See generally, </em>Solomons, A Critical Analysis of the Legislative History Surrounding the Black Lung Interim Presumption and a Survey of its Unresolved Issues, 83 W.Va.L.Rev. 869 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1592-17\">.

Pneumoconiosis is customarily classified as \"simple\u201d or \u201ccomplicated.\u201d Simple is caused by dust alone and is identified by small opacities in the lung fields visible on a chest x-ray. Complicated, which is generally more serious, involves progressive massive fibrosis as a complex reaction to dust and other factors. <em>Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 7, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2888, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-6\">Simple pneumoconiosis is classified into categories 1, 2, and 3 according to the profusion of small rounded opacities in the lung fields visible on x-ray, with category 1 indicating the least profuse and category 3 indicating very profuse. When the number of small opacities is insufficient for a diagnosis of category 1, the x-ray is classified as category 0.
