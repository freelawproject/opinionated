KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b307-21\">Roman Welyczko appeals from the dismissal of his hybrid claim against his employer for wrongful discharge, and against his union for breach of its duty of fair representation. The district judge based his action upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983), which established a six-month statute of limitations for claims under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). We hold that the <em>DelCostello </em>decision has both retroactive and prospective application, and therefore affirm the dismissal of Welyczko\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b307-23\">We shall briefly review the facts. The parties have agreed that Welyczko was an employee of U.S. Air, Inc. (\u201cU.S. Air\u201d) and that the terms and conditions of his employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement between U.S. Air and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\u201cIAM\u201d). Welyczko was granted a 90-day medical leave of absence on May 5, 1975. On or about July 31 of that year, he wrote to his employer requesting an extension of leave. He reiterated that request by telegram on August 3. Approximately three days later, Welyczko received a letter from a U.S. Air executive, notifying him that his request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>for extended leave would be considered only upon receipt of corroboration from a physician that additional leave was necessary. Because his doctor was then on vacation, Welyczko decided to forward to U.S. Air a second copy of the physician s note, dated May 5. This document had accompanied his original application for leave.</p>\n<p id=\"pAqj\">U.S. Air refused to accept the copy as adequate substantiation. Accordingly, when Welyczko did not return to work, the company terminated his employment on August 26, 1975. This discharge was made retroactive to August 5, the day his authorized leave expired. Welyczko responded by requesting an officer of the IAM to arrange a special hearing on his discharge, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. The IAM contradicts this by replying that Welyczko was advised that he himself would have to make a written request for such a hearing. In any event, the hearing was never held, and the discharge action became final.</p>\n<p id=\"pA8mN\">The instant suit was commenced in New York State Supreme Court on March 5, 1981, and was subsequently removed to federal court. After <em>DelCostello </em>was decided, appellees moved for summary judgment asserting that the statute of limitations adopted in that case should apply retroactively to Welyczko\u2019s cause of action, which accrued in 1975. On November 1, 1983, in a ruling from the bench, Chief Judge Munson granted the motion. Welyczko appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"pAGU\">II</p>\n<p id=\"pAsT\">In <em>DelCostello, </em>the Supreme Court decided that a uniform federal statute of limitations should apply to claims under \u00a7 301 of the LMRA. In the absence of an expressly applicable federal limitations period, the Court acknowledged, the \u201cmost closely analogous statute of limitations under state law\u201d would normally govern. 103 S.Ct. at 2287. The Court concluded, however, that the \u201cfederal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make [federal law] a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking\u201d in this instance. <em>Id. </em>at 2294. It therefore held that the six-month time limit on unfair labor practice complaints under \u00a7 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act applied to \u00a7 301 claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"pAXJ\">Welyczko\u2019s claim must be construed as arjsing un(jer the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>which governs air carriers in lieu of the LMRA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 142, 152; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181. We agree with the Ninth Circuit, however, that this distinction is \u201cwithout import.\u201d <em>Barina v. Gulf Trading and Transportation Co., </em>726 F.2d 560, 563 n. 6 (9th Cir.1984). The same policies which led the Supreme Court to apply a federal statute of limitations to claims under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act apply with equal force to substantively identical claims under the Railway Labor Act.</p>\n<p id=\"pA2k\">We have a]ready applied the <em>DeiCostello </em>ru]e retroactively, although the issue was noj. specifically discussed. <em>Assad v. Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>703 F.2d 36 (2d Cir.), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 54, 78 L.Ed.2d 73 (1983), <em>on remand, </em>725 F.2d 837 (1984). Our action there was consistent with the \u201cgeneral rule of long standing\u201d that \u201cjudicial precedents normally have retroactive as well as prospective effeet.\u201d <em>National Association of Broadcasters v. FCC, </em>554 F.2d 1118, 1130 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>quoted in Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>623 F.2d 786, 788 (2d Cir.1980), <em>aff'd, </em>456 U.S. 461, 101 S.Ct. 3107, 69 L.Ed.2d 970 (1982). All but one of the circuits considering the retroactivity of <em>DelCostello </em>have reached the same result. <em>Perez v. Dana Corp., Parish Frame Division, </em>718 F.2d 581 (3rd Cir.1983); <em>Murray v. Branch Motor Express Co., </em>723 F.2d 1146 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Edwards v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>720 F.2d 857 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Curtis v. Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 299, </em>716 F.2d 360 (6th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (dictum); <em>Storck v. Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local Union No. 600, </em>712 F.2d 1194 (7th Cir.1983) (per curiam); <em>Lincoln v. District 9 of the Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, </em>723 F.2d 627 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Hand v. Int\u2019l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Chemical Workers Union, </em>712 F.2d 1350 (11th Cir.1983) (per curiam); <em>contra, Edwards v. Teamsters Local No. 36, </em>719 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1599, 80 L.Ed.2d 130 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Appellant urges us to carve out an exception to the retroactivity principle so that his claim may proceed, arguing that under the three-factor test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), the <em>DelCostello </em>holding should be given only prospective application. Most of the authorities just cited, however, applied the <em>Chevron </em>test and found that <em>Del-Costello </em>should be applied retroactively. <em>See Perez v. Dana Corp., Parish Frame Division, supra, </em>718 F.2d at 584-85; <em>Murray v. Branch Motor Express Co., supra </em>(adopting reasoning of <em>Perez); Edwards v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., supra, </em>720 F.2d at 860-62; <em>Lincoln v. District 9 of the Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, supra, </em>723 F.2d at 629-30. Moreover, in our view this case does not present circumstances in which the use of the <em>Chevron </em>test would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Were we asked to decide if retrospective effect should be given to a new rule which our court had pronounced, the policy factors enumerated in <em>Chevron Oil </em>would indeed be determinative. <em>See United States v. Fitzgerald, </em>545 F.2d 578, 582 (7th Cir. 1976) . Similarly, had the Supreme Court given no indication whether <em>DelCostello </em>should apply retroactively, a <em>Chevron Oil </em>analysis would also be in order. But these factors are not present here. The Supreme Court not only adopted a new statute of limitations in <em>DelCostello; </em>it applied that time bar retroactively to govern the very claim at issue in the case before it. We have noted that \u201cthe Supreme Court is well aware of how to avoid the effects of applying one of its rulings retroactively to the case at bar.\u201d <em>Cates v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>561 F.2d 1064, 1073 (2d Cir. 1977) . Thus, when that Court itself has given retrospective application to a newly-adopted principle, \u201cno sound reason exists for not doing so here.\u201d <em>Holzsager v. Valley Hospital, </em>646 F.2d 792, 797 (2d Cir. 1981). A court of appeals must defer to the Supreme Court\u2019s directive on this issue, explicit or implicit. <em>See United States v. Fitzgerald, supra, </em>at 582. Certainly, its intended application is clear in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">We therefore decline appellant\u2019s invitation to exclude his suit from the <em>Del-Costello </em>holding. Rather, we adopt for this circuit the rule that in employment termination cases, a six-month statute of limitations applies both retroactively and prospectively to wrongful discharge/failure to represent claims. Because Welyczko\u2019s complaint was filed more than five years after his termination, it is clearly time-barred. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing Welyczko\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
