Teasdale. American also appeals the district court\u2019s <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> award to Teasdale of $63,287.21 in attorney\u2019s fees expenses, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We affirm the jury verdict and the district court\u2019s, 564 F.Supp. 1571, award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b629-20\">On April 24, 1981, American filed a monumental nine million dollar lawsuit against former Governor Teasdale, claiming Teasdale violated its federally protected civil rights (\u00a7 1983), tortiously interfered with its state contractual rights, and uttered injurious falsehoods against it. The suit, filed after Teasdale had lost his re-election bid for Governor, stemmed from a May, 1980, press release issued by Teasdale, in his capacity as Governor. The press release said that Governor Teasdale was directing the Division of Insurance to ban the future sale of cancer policies in Missouri; existing policies were to be left in force. The stated reasons for the directive were: (1) cancer insurance policies, though generally understood by consumers to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>broad protection, actually afforded extremely limited payment of benefits \u2014 averaging less than 35 cents of every dollar in .premiums; (2) sellers of cancer policies employed trickery and deception to lure unsuspecting elderly consumers into purchasing the policies. At the time, one hundred and nine insurance companies were selling cancer policies in Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"AQjo\">On the heels of the press release, the Division issued an order to show cause why cancer insurance policies should not be prohibited. After conducting hearings, the Division, on November 3, 1980, issued a cease and desist order, withdrawing approval of all cancer insurance policies in Missouri, In early 1981, Teasdale\u2019s term as Governor ended and the newly elected administration took over. This new administration did not oppose the efforts to have a state court overrule the November 3, 1980 cease and desist order. Without conducting any adversarial proceeding or making any findings of fact, the state court issued a one page consent decree lifting the cease and desist order of November 3, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"AE0\">In its complaint, American alleged Teasdale knew he was without statutory or constitutional authority to direct the ban on the sale of cancer insurance, but he did so anyway as part of a politically motivated propaganda scheme. The press release allegedly led the public to brand all cancer insurance sellers as culprits and caused the Division to hold biased and perfunctory hearings bluntly referred to by American as \u201csham hearings\u201d. As ground for relief, American claimed the press release deprived it of its property rights without due process, tortiously interfered with its contractual relations with policyholders, and severely damaged its business reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"AjX\">Teasdale responded by filing a motion for summary judgment dismissal of the complaint, asserting a qualified good faith immunity defense. On November 24, 1981, the district court denied Teasdale\u2019s motion, holding that there were material factual issues concerning whether Teasdale \u201cknew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of [plaintiff] or ... took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury\u201d. <em>Quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 815, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2737, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"Aro\">Subsequently, American conducted sweeping discovery; it deposed every defense witness, served motions for production of voluminous documents, and served a set of interrogatories and four sets of requests for admissions on Teasdale. With some reluctance, the district court allowed this extensive discovery to continue because American\u2019s attorneys represented that it was needed to uncover evidence of Teasdale\u2019s bad faith. Just prior to trial, the court concluded that American\u2019s persistent and probing discovery efforts \u201cfailed to uncover any of [former Governor Teasdale\u2019s] bad faith\u201d. The district court nevertheless indulged this absence of proof, accepting American\u2019s assurances that during trial it could adduce evidence of Teasdale\u2019s bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"ATKN\">American\u2019s trial strategy focused on attempts to show: (1) the press release caused it to suffer enormous financial losseSj and (2) Teasdale acted in bad faith. As to the first aspect, American tried to demonstrate, principally through testimony of its own corporate officers, that Teasdale\u2019s press release led policyholders to cancel existing policies or permit them to lapse, causing premiums and profits to plummet, American\u2019s key witness, Senior Vice-president Frank Kimbrough, conceded that he Could not say why Missourians cancelled policies or allowed them to lapse since American undertook no customer surveys, Kimbrough also acknowledged that American had experienced a significant downturn in premiums before the press release. The former customers testifying about their lapsed policies almost uniformly admitted that they were unaware of the press release and that it had no effect on their decisions not to renew. Only a couple of customers stated that the press release had \u201csome bearing\u201d on their decision not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>renew. An actuary, who had previously testified for American in various other court actions, testified that American suffered sales losses between 1980 and 1982. Like Kimbrough, however, he was both unable and unqualified to offer reason(s) why premiums dropped and cancellation and lapses rose. In its closing argument, American \u2014 apparently recognizing it had not supported a claim for any actual and punitive damages, let alone a claim for nine-million dollars \u2014 merely asked the jury to return a nominal sum against Teasdale because of his alleged bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In attempting to demonstrate Teasdale\u2019s bad faith, American focused almost entirely on Teasdale\u2019s admission that he knew the contents of the news release and was aware that Missouri insurance laws required a hearing prior to any attempt to revoke approved policy forms. Teasdale took the position that he had the authority, as chief executive officer of the state, to order the Division to take necessary steps to prohibit the sale of cancer policies. Teasdale also admitted that he gave speeches, after the press release, stating he had ordered the Division to ban the sale of cancer insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Perhaps more revealing than any other aspect of American\u2019s case were the frank admissions of its key witnesses as to why suit was brought against Teasdale. American\u2019s Senior Vice-president Kimbrough and Chief Financial Officer Jeter testified, on cross-examination, that five states had either banned entirely or severely restricted the sale of cancer policies. In March, 1980, a comprehensive 292 page congressional committee report, entitled \u201cCancer Insurance: Exploiting Fear for Profit\u201d, leveled scathing criticisms against the cancer insurance business for atrociously low loss ratios and generally deceptive selling practices. Jeter admitted that American\u2019s own loss ratio over the next thirty years would not rise above 56%, sharply contrasting with the 80% to 90% loss ratios experienced by general health insurance providers. Kimbrough and Jeter also acknowledged that, following the adverse congressional report, American filed numerous lawsuits, similar to this one, against its various public critics, including a congressional investigator, the American Broadcasting Company, the <em>Changing Times </em>magazine, and a former insurance commissioner in Pennsylvania. Kimbrough candidly admitted that these suits, none successful on the merits, were part of American\u2019s hard-nosed policy that \u201canyone who does not take American Family seriously is a fool and should be fully prepared to legally defend its position\u201d. This policy may have entailed filing frivolous lawsuits against critics.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">After American completed its three day case-in-chief, the district court told the parties, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, that, while Teasdale was entitled to a directed verdict, it would allow the case to proceed. Teasdale and his numerous defense witnesses then presented testimony detailing the events and factors leading to the press release. Two of Teasdale\u2019s administrative assistants testified that, from the beginning of his term, Teasdale sought to implement a more consumer-oriented regulatory policy with respect to the insurance industry. As part of that policy, Teasdale\u2019s administration investigated and attempted to correct abuses in various areas in the insurance business. Teasdale\u2019s consumer affairs director testified that as early as 1978, the Division of Insurance had supplied the Governor with information regarding abusive and deceptive practices employed in the sale of cancer insurance policies in Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Governor Teasdale\u2019s chief of staff testified that the Governor conducted numerous staff meetings to discuss the abuses in the sale of cancer policies. During these meetings, the Governor and his staff reviewed the reports of two congressional committees, the Federal Trade Commission, the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, and the Missouri Division of Insurance. Those reports collectively documented that the cancer insurance business had experienced extremely low loss ratios and had employed various deceptive and misleading sales tactics. Key Teasdale staff members testified that, after reviewing these reports, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>advised the Governor to direct the Missouri Division of Insurance to prohibit the sale of cancer policies in the state. Governor Teasdale\u2019s legal counsel advised him that he had the authority, as chief executive of the state, to direct a division head to take action when evidence was presented showing a violation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Teasdale testified that, based upon the various reports detailing abuses, the recommendations of his staff, and the advice of his legal counsel, he decided that he had to act to protect the citizens of the state from cancer insurance sellers\u2019 widespread abuses in the sale and marketing of cancer insurance. He therefore exercised his discretionary authority as governor and chief executive of the state to direct the Division to ban the sale of cancer policies in Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The former Director of the Division of Insurance testified that even before former Governor Teasdale directed the Division to take action, the Division had already decided to issue a cease and desist order prohibiting the sale of cancer policies, based upon the documented abuses by cancer insurance policy sellers. Both the former Director and former General Counsel of the Division of Insurance testified that all cancer insurers named in the cease and desist order, including American, were given a full and fair hearing after they requested them; Teasdale\u2019s administration did not interfere with these hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">After Teasdale\u2019s defense, the trial judge told the parties, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, that Teasdale was entitled to a directed verdict because American had failed to prove a case under any three of its claims. Characterizing American\u2019s suit as frivolous, the Court reluctantly submitted the ease to the jury, but told the parties he would set aside any jury verdict in favor of American. The jury took less than one hour and fifteen minutes to return a verdict in favor of Governor Teasdale on all three counts. Later, the district court, finding the suit was \u201cfrivolous\u201d, \u201cvindictive\u201d and \u201cvexatious\u201d, awarded Teasdale attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in the amount of $63,287.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">II. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In the trial court, American\u2019s due process argument went as follows: American claimed legitimate entitlement, under Missouri law, to sell approved cancer insurance policies in Missouri. Under Missouri law, the Division could issue a cease and desist order prohibiting or banning the sale of cancer policies, but only after American was given a fair and impartial hearing and the Division determined that there was competent and substantial evidence that a subject company had violated the insurance laws of Missouri. <em>See </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 374.-046. American claimed Teasdale was without legal authority to ban the sale of insurance. Allegedly, however, Teasdale\u2019s press release \u2014 directing the Division to prohibit the sale of insurance \u2014 was interpreted by the public as a ban on the sale of cancer insurance, thereby tainting American\u2019s business good will and crippling its sale of policies in the state. Thus, according to American, Governor Teasdale, in issuing the press release, knew or reasonably should have known that he was depriving American of its constitutionally protectible property interest \u2014 i.e., its right to sell cancer policies \u2014 prior to the statutorily required hearing before the Division. American further asserted that the Governor\u2019s directive precluded the Division from granting American a fair and impartial hearing prior to issuance of the cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Teasdale\u2019s good faith immunity defense to this claim was that he reasonably believed he had the discretionary authority, as supreme executive of the state, to direct the Division to issue a cease and desist order. American urges that the jury could not properly evaluate the objective reasonableness of Teasdale\u2019s purportedly erroneous belief that he had such authority unl\u00e9ss the trial court instructed that: (1) Teasdale lacked the legal authority to direct the Division to issue a cease and desist order; (2) the Insurance Division had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>authority to issue a cease and desist order but only after a fair and impartial hearing adduced \u201ccompetent and substantial\u201d evidence that the subject company had violated the law. Without these jury instructions, American asserts, the jury erroneously assumed Teasdale acted within the scope of his lawful authority and, therefore, improperly rejected American\u2019s due process claim. American points to the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it should presume, until the evidence showed the contrary, that Teasdale obeyed the law, and that if he acted within his lawful authority, then there could be no due process violation. Thus, American claims the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to give the proffered instructions on Teasdale\u2019s lack of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We conclude that there was no error in the jury instructions, and the district court properly found that the evidence warranted a directed verdict against American. <em>See Windsor Corp. v. Miller, </em>309 F.2d 68, 69 (1st Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">First, American failed to adduce any credible evidence that Teasdale\u2019s press release deprived it of any tangible property interest without due process of law. American alleges on appeal, as it did in its complaint, that sales dropped and cancellation rose after the press release, but during trial it completely failed to demonstrate that these losses were traceable to the objectionable press release. Nor was American even able to show that the public generally understood the press release as a final determination that American was \u201cguilty\u201d of wrongdoing and therefore \u201cprohibited\u201d from selling cancer policies in the state. However, even if American were stigmatized by the press release, this alone does not constitute such a property or liberty deprivation as to trigger federal due process protections. Under the \u201cchange in legal status\u201d test enunciated in <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 708, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1164, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), the offending state action \u2014 in this case the press release \u2014 must deprive the stigmatized party of a right to a benefit previously held under state law. <em>See also Hughes v. Whitmer, </em>714 F.2d 1407, 1417 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1275, 79 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984). American clearly did not demonstrate that its right or ability to sell cancer policies in the state was deprived by virtue of Teasdale\u2019s press release.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Of course, the subsequently issued cease and desist order did deprive American of its right to sell cancer policies. However, this order was made only after the Director of the Division, closely following procedures set forth in Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 374.046, afforded American a fair and impartial hearing and determined, based upon what was considered \u201csubstantial and competent\u201d evidence, that American was violating the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The former Director of the Division testified that American was given a fair and impartial hearing and that Teasdale\u2019s administration did not attempt to improperly influence the Division\u2019s independent judgment. In fact, even prior to Teasdale\u2019s press release, the Division had determined to seek a cease and desist order against the entire cancer insurance industry based upon various reports documenting widespread abuses and deceptive selling practices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rebuttal evidence American produced at the hearing was, in the Director\u2019s views, simply unable to overcome the overwhelming weight of the evidence showing widespread abuse. American offered absolutely no support for its conclusory and derogatory assertion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the hearings before the Division were \"a sham\u201d and that the Division\u2019s order was devoid of support and dictated by the ea-price and whim of former Governor Teasdale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Auo\">As an additional ground for rejecting American\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions, we, like the district court, con-elude that Teasdale was entitled to a directed verdict based upon his qualified good faith immunity defense. <em>Cf. Prebble v. Brodrick, </em>535 F.2d 605, at 613. First, the record clearly reveals that Teasdale s announced directive was not taken m bad \u201e ,, . , , . . faith or with the intention of depriving . . . . . . f , \u201c Amencan of its due process rights, but ,, ,, . ,, j. rather with the welfare of the citizens of . . . Missouri m mmd. Various comprehensive reports documented widespread abuses by the cancer insurance industry to the detriment of Missouri consumers. After reviewing these reports, Teasdale\u2019s key administrative assistants, and the Director of the Division of Insurance, recommended that steps should be taken to prohibit the sale of cancer insurance policies in Missouri. Second, Teasdale was advised by his staff assistants and by his legal counsel that they had the legal authority to issue a press release directing the Division to take action; the former Director of the Division also agreed that he had such authority. Finally, Teasdale testified that he believed his directive was taken pursuant to his discretionary executive authority and with the- best interest of Missourians in mind. In view of the foregoing, it is clear that Teasdale \u201cneither knew nor had any reason te know that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 815, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2737, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"AIp\">We should add that, despite American\u2019s claims to the contrary, it is far from well settled or clear that Governor Teasdale lacked the legal authority to direct the Director of the Division to take steps to issue a cease an(j desist order against insurance sellerg belieyed to be yiolating the laws. Dur\u00a1 ^ Teasdale steadfastly main- , . , ,, , , , , , ., , ,, tamed that he had such authority and the , . , , ,, , district court apparently agreed. The Mis- . \u201e ... <em>J </em>, soun Constitution vests supreme executive . ,, , . , power m the Governor, who is charged \u2122th the duty intake care ?at tbelaws of this atate fuly eXT^Ut\u00aed1by tkeo\u201c tlve branch \u2022 Art IV \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2- Ma Const (1945)' The Division of Insurance is charged with the execution of the insurance ^aws; Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 374.010 (1978). 1-be Division, however, is part of the Department of Consumer Affairs, Regulation and Licensing (DCARL), which, in turn, is part of the executive branch; and the Directors of both the Insurance Division and DCARL are appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 620.010(1) and (10) (1978); Art. IV \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 51, Mo. Const. (1945) (Vernon 1984 SuppL); <em>see also </em>Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 374.020(1) (1978). The Director of Insurance is subject to removal from office by the Governor at his pleasure. Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 374.020(1). There is no constitutional or statutory provision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or Missouri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>case<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> indicating that the Governor, in his capacity as chief executive of the state, is without the authority to direct the Division of Insurance to take action to prohibit the sale of cancer insurance, where, as here, the Governor has good reason to believe that an insurance seller is violating the insurance laws and its operations are detrimental to the best interest of the public.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We, like the district court, reject American\u2019s contention that Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 374.-046 deprives the Governor of authority to direct the Division to take action. As mentioned above, \u00a7 374.046 provides that the Director of the Division may, as he did here, issue a cease and desist order against a company whenever it believes there is \u201ccompetent and substantial\u201d evidence that an insurance company has violated the law. If it so requests, the subject company will receive a hearing at which it can show cause why the order should not be issued. \u00a7 374.046(2)(b) &amp; (d). And, the subject company may seek judicial review of the order in Cole County Circuit Court. \u00a7 374.-046(2)(g). However, nothing in \u00a7 374.046 indicates that the Division is precluded from issuing a cease and desist order simply because the Governor has so advised. And, the fact that the Governor has directed the Division to take steps to issue such an order does not render the Division unable either to provide the subject company with a fair hearing or to make an independent determination of wrongdoing based upon competent and substantial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Finally, in view of American\u2019s inability to point to any clear expression of state law prohibiting the Governor from directing the Insurance Division to take remedial action, we think the district court gave instructions which adequately and fairly stated plaintiff\u2019s due process theory of recovery. At American\u2019s request, the court instructed the jury that American was entitled to a verdict if the jury found that: 1) Teasdale knowingly issued the press release stating that he had ordered the Division to prohibit the sale of cancer insurance; 2) Teasdale knew or reasonably should have known that the press release would deprive plaintiff of its property rights without due process by interfering with American\u2019s right to a fair and impartial hearing; and 3) as a direct and proximate result of Teasdale\u2019s actions, plaintiff was damaged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we have discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>above, American did not establish either the second or third elements of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">III. Evidentiary Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A. Testimony of Morton Paulsen</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Teasdale was permitted to cross-examine, without objection by American, American\u2019s key witnesses Kimbrough and Jeter about American\u2019s multimillion dollar suit against <em>Changing Times </em>Magazine for its article criticizing cancer insurance companies. Kimbrough testified that the suit had been settled. Later, Teasdale called Morton Paulsen, the reporter who wrote the article, to testify about the various reports he reviewed before writing the article and about the lawsuit American filed against him and <em>Changing Times. </em>Paul-sen was permitted to testify, over American\u2019s objections, concerning the various settlement negotiations, offers tendered and rejected, and final settlement terms. Paulsen specifically testified that American had surrendered its multimillion dollar suit in exchange for the publication of a one paragraph letter-to-the-editor; and that the magazine refused to settle on any terms, but published the letter as a matter of course and would have done so regardless of the suit. American claims Paulsen\u2019s testimony about the article and suit was irrelevant and highly prejudicial and thus should have been excluded under Fed.R. Evid. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The district court clearly did not abuse its broad discretion in admitting Paulsen\u2019s testimony. Paulsen\u2019s testimony regarding the <em>Changing Times </em>suit was relevant and admissible for the purpose of showing the hostility American and its key witnesses harbored toward anyone who was critical of its product. <em>United States v. Gambler, </em>662 F.2d 834, 839 (D.C.Cir.1981). Further, Kimbrough and Jeter had already testified on cross-examination, without American\u2019s objection, about the four lawsuits, including one against <em>Changing Times, </em>that were filed against those who criticized American. Paulsen\u2019s testimony served to rebut Kimbrough\u2019s testimony that American\u2019s suit against <em>Changing Times </em>was \u201csettled\u201d. Finally, Paulsen\u2019s testimony about the suit and the various critical reports he used in writing the article was relevant to rebut American\u2019s claim that its sales dropped solely because of Teasdale\u2019s press release.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">B. Excluded rebuttal testimony of William McCaskell</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The district court refused to permit American to call, as a rebuttal witness, William McCaskell, the Director of the Missouri Division of Insurance in 1971, during Governor Warren Hearnes\u2019 term. Presumably, McCaskell would have testified: (1) while serving as Director, he was never ordered by Governor Hearnes to issue a cease and desist order; (2) before issuing a cease and desist order, he would have consulted Mr. Mullen, the former superintendent of the Division, and Mr. Chase, the supervisor of the consumer complaints section. American claims McCaskell\u2019s proffered testimony was needed to rebut Teasdale\u2019s testimony that he had the authority to direct the Division to ban the sale of cancer insurance and former Director Frederick\u2019s testimony, on cross-examination, that he did not find it necessary to consult with subordinates Mullen or Chase before issuing the cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">The district court properly disallowed the proffered rebuttal testimony of McCaskell; such testimony was not relevant to explain, repel, or disprove any evidence presented in the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief. Teasdale\u2019s own witnesses admitted, on cross-examination, that Governor Hearnes never directed the Division to issue a cease and desist order. And McCaskell\u2019s practice of consulting particular subordinates before issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ing a cease and desist order reflected neither a statutory requirement nor a benchmark for judging the reasonableness or propriety of the May, \u00cd980 order issued by Director Frederick.</p>\n<p id=\"Alkg\">IV. Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"A4-\">A. Vindictive and frivolous nature of suit</p>\n<p id=\"AvJ\">The district court found that American\u2019s lawsuit was \u201cvindictive\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d, awarding Teasdale attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in the amount of $63,287.21. The court emphasized that American brought the suit to harass and attack the integrity of former Governor Teasdale. American claims the district court\u2019s award of fees was erroneous since American established a <em>prima facie </em>case under its three theories of recovery. Rehashing its arguments challenging the jury instructions, American makes the rather extraordinary claim that it proved Teasdale\u2019s press release deprived it of its property interest \u2014 in selling and maintaining policies \u2014 without due process of law. American finds special comfort in the district court s denial of Teasdale s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AMV\">We believe the district court acted within its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and expenses to Teasdale under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, based upon its well-supported findings that American\u2019s suit was frivolous, unfounded, and vexatiously brought and pursued. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, 48 n. 2 (1983); <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978); <em>F.D. Rich Co. v. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 129, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2165, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974). First, as discussed above, American was unable to produce any admissible evidence supporting its claim that Teasdale\u2019s press release caused American to suffer tangible injury. Apparently recognizing this and probably fearing an \u201cabuse of process\u201d suit by Governor Teasdale, American surrendered its claims for damages during closing argument. As the district court aptly stated, \u201c[American] sought a nominal verdict in order to defend any future lawsuit and to blunt any grounds for an attorney\u2019s fee award\u201d. Second, American was unable to produce a scintilla of evidence showing Teasdale\u2019s despite its repeated representati\u00b0ns to the court that it could do so through extensive discovery and during tri\u00aeven if American initially believed it cou^ support the sweeping allegations of Teasdale\u2019s bad faith, it continued to litigate su^ after it became apparent that its claims were groundless and unreasonable, <em>Christiansburg, </em>434 U.S. at 422, 98 S.Ct. at 700. The district court permitted the ease proceed to trial only because, accepting tlie purported good faith representations of American, the court thought it would be prudent to let the jury hear and decide the question of Teasdale\u2019s intent. After the verdict was rendered, several jurors stated publicly that the suit was \u201cfrivolous\u201d,</p>\n<p id=\"ARD\">There is also support in the record for the district court\u2019s finding that American <em>initiated </em>the suit in bad faith, with the sole purpose of harassing Teasdale and attacking his integrity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The testimony of American\u2019s own key witnesses revealed American\u2019s policy of filing baseless lawsuits against any person who publicly criticized the business practices of cancer insurance companies. American clearly wanted to punish past critics and silence future critics, regardless of the well-founded bases for their criticisms. Teasdale became the unfortunate subject of American\u2019s wrath when he, seeking to protect the citizens of Missouri, joined numerous other public officials in denouncing cancer insurance companies for their low loss ratios and deceptive selling practices. Of the one hundred and nine insurance companies selling cancer policies in Missouri, American was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>only company who filed suit against Teasdale because of the press release. Yet American never sought to enjoin the executive branch from proceeding during the period when its civil rights were allegedly being intentionally and/or recklessly violated. Moreover, despite claiming nine and one half million dollars in actual and punitive damages, American never undertook any reasonable effort to establish that monumental claim or to establish a causal connection between the press release and American\u2019s purportedly falling sales. As mentioned above, American conducted no surveys of customers to find out the reason why they let their policies lapse. American\u2019s failure in this regard may have been self serving since the customers who did testify almost uniformly admitted the press release had no bearing on their decision not to renew.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">It thus appears that American\u2019s multimillion dollar lawsuit was designed not to vindicate its legal rights, but to expose Teasdale to public obloquy, harassment, and the enormous financial and emotional hardships of defending groundless charges that he misused his public office for personal gain. However, Teasdale was not the only victim; the entire public inevitably suffers when a vindictive plaintiff squanders limited judicial resources by prosecuting frivolous lawsuits. Unfortunately, typically weighty financial and ethical concerns did not serve to deter American, an untypical civil rights plaintiff, from burdening the judiciary with a frivolous lawsuit. As noted in <em>Christiansburg, </em>412 U.S. at 422, 98 S.Ct. at 701, \u201c[i]f a plaintiff is found to have brought or continued such a claim in <em>bad faith, </em>this will be an even stronger basis for charging him with the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">B. Amount of fees and expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">American raises two objections to the amount of the fees and expenses awarded. First, American claims the court erred in reimbursing the state for the time spent by three Missouri Assistant Attorney Generals in defending Teasdale. In support, American argues that Teasdale was not contractually obligated to pay these attorneys, who were full-time salaried employees of the state. This contention is frivolous. It is well established that a publicly funded legal organization representing a prevailing party in a \u00a7 1983 suit can recover attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. <em>Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, </em>458 U.S. 457, 487-88 n. 31, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 3204 n. 31, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982); <em>Oldham v. Ehrlich, </em>617 F.2d 163, 168-69 (8th Cir.1980); <em>Watkins v. Mobile Housing Board, </em>632 F.2d 565, 567 (5th Cir.1980). There is no sensible basis for treating the Missouri Attorney General\u2019s Office, which represented former Governor Teasdale, any differently from other publicly funded legal organizations. Moreover, although Teasdale\u2019s own privately retained attorney was awarded fees, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that the time spent by the state\u2019s attorneys did not represent a duplication of effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Second, American contends the district court abused its discretion in awarding the actual expenses incurred by the state for costs of bringing witnesses to testify. It specifically contends that various witnesses\u2019 live testimony was unnecessary and that their expenses should have been limited to a $30.00 per day witness fee, a $50.00 total subsistence allowance, and $25.00 to cover travel expenses under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920. We believe the district court acted within its discretion in rejecting American\u2019s contention that various witnesses\u2019 live testimony was unnecessary. Moreover, there is no support for the contention that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 or 1920 limits the travel expenses to a maximum of $25.00. In fact, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(c) provides that actual travel costs of witnesses are covered. Nor does \u00a7 1821(d) provide that a witness is entitled to only one payment of $50.00 for subsistence; instead \u00a7 1821 suggests that if a witness must attend a trial for two days, a $50.00 per day subsistence is allowed. And, under \u00a7 1821(b), the $30.00 per day witness fee applies to one day of testimony and at least one travel day. Considering the foregoing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the court\u2019s award of actual witness expenses incurred is less than what it could have awarded under the <em>per diem </em>provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821. Thus, American has no cause to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Finally, the court properly awarded the state its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in preparing for and conducting litigation. These expenses included the costs of consulting experts necessary to meet the opponent\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">V. Conclusion: Appellate Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We conclude, after careful consideration, that American\u2019s numerous claims on this appeal were frivolous and unreasonable. This appeal has served only to prolong the plight of Teasdale and needlessly burden and inconvenience the judiciary. We therefore assess attorney\u2019s fees and costs against American in connection with this appeal. <em>Compare Middleton v. Remington, </em>594 F.2d 1210, 1213 (8th Cir.1979). Appellee is requested to submit a verified itemization of costs and expenses together with application for attorney\u2019s fees in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b629-21\"> The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge, Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">. American does not and indeed cannot tenably urge that the procedures set forth in Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 374.046, which govern the issuance of cease and desist orders, are constitutionally defective. Those procedures clearly provided \"an opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner' <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). (Citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-12\">.

American suggests that the state court\u2019s one page decision lifting the cease and desist order supports its claim that it was denied a fair and impartial hearing. This claim is frivolous. First, the state court never dealt with the issue of a fair and impartial hearing. Second, the state court\u2019s decision was made pursuant to a consent agreement between the new governor\u2019s administration and American; no adversial proceedings were ever conducted and no support-p. j. p r . j , . <em>r </em>* mg finding of fact and conclusions or law were j ^ ^ ^ , X&lt;J.| , made Thus, the state court s order is entitled to little, if any weight. <em>(See </em>district court memorandum opinion 564 F.Supp. at 1574, note 2.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A6N\">. American makes passing reference to the Reorganization Act of 1974 (Mo.Rev.Stat. Appendix B (1978)), which provides that power, duties, and function vested in the Insurance Division \u201care transferred by a Type II transfer to the department of consumer affairs, regulad\u00b0n and licensing and that [supervision by the director of the department under a Type II transfer I1-*- DCARL] shall not extend to sub-fantIve matters re,Ia&lt;fe t0P0*raes regulative functions or appeals from the decisions of the ^ <em>c , </em>T .c. \u201e transferred ... division ... unless specifically ded ^ \u00a7 4(10) and \u00a7 Despite American-S broad reading_ these provi. sions do not purport to limit the Governor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>executive authority to direct the Division to take action against those believed to be violating the insurance law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">. American relies on <em>Theodoro v. Department of Liquor Control, </em>527 S.W.2d 350, 354 (Mo. banc 1975) to support its claim that Teasdale lacked authority to direct a department head to take remedial action. <em>Theodoro </em>simply held that a governor could not order the supervisor of liquor control to set aside its decision revoking a license. Nothing in <em>Theodoro </em>can be interpreted as a restriction on the Governor\u2019s power to direct a department head to take action to stop a violation of the law known to the Governor and the division head.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">. Where there is no state court precedent, ordinarily we will give substantial weight to the interpretation of the district court judge who sits in the <em>lex loci </em>state. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 346 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2078 n. 10, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>Hughes v. Whitmer, </em>714 F.2d at 1415 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">. In urging Teasdale\u2019s lack of authority, American again relies on the state court\u2019s decision lifting of the cease and desist order. However, the state court\u2019s one page consent order addressed neither whether Teasdale exceeded his executive authority nor whether American was denied a fair hearing. In fact, the state court conducted no adversial proceedings and made no supporting findings of fact or conclusions of law. <em>(See </em>footnote 2, supra).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b635-14\">.
