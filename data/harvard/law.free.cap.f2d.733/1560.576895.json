We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-26\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On September 9, 1981 Askin caused Clark Conner\u2019s employer to be served with a summons of garnishment. On October 14,1981 the garnishee answered the summons and paid into the Georgia state court the funds subject to garnishment. The court disbursed these funds to Askin, along with other funds previously paid into court by the garnishee in connection with another creditor\u2019s garnishment, on January 4,1982. The Conners filed a joint bankruptcy petition on February 2, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-27\">Under the Bankruptcy Code the trustee in bankruptcy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may avoid \u201cany transfer of property of the debtor\u201d that gives a creditor a preferred position among creditors of the bankrupt and that meets other enumerated requirements. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b). A transfer is a voidable preference under section 547 only if made \u201con or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the [bankruptcy] petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 547(b)(4)(A). Both the bankruptcy judge and the district court declared without discussion that the transfer in this case took place upon the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>court\u2019s distribution of funds to Askin on January 4, well within the ninety day period. Their opinions focused on whether the garnished funds were still \u201cproperty of the debtor\u201d at that point, and concluded that they were. Since no other elements of a voidable preference were denied by Askin, each court entered judgment for the Conners. The Conners on appeal carry the lower courts\u2019 analysis a step further, arguing that as long as the debtor retains any interest in the property, legal or equitable, no \u201ctransfer\u201d under section 547 can occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-4\">Both the Conners\u2019 explicit definition of a transfer and the lower courts\u2019 tacit one are incorrect. Under the Bankruptcy Coda a \u201ctransfer\u201d includes \u201cevery mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or parting with property or with an interest in property, including retention of title as a security interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101(41). This exceptionally broad definition encompasses garnishment liens. <em>Compare id. and </em>2 L. King, K. Klee, R. Levin, H. Miller &amp; M. Murphy, Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 101.41 (15th ed. 1979) <em>and </em>4 L. King, M. Cook, R. D\u2019Agostino, &amp; K. Klee <em>id. </em>\u00b6 547.12[1] <em>with </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(30) (current version codified at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(41)) <em>and </em>1 J. Moore, L. King &amp; A. Herzog, Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1.30, at 130.31 (14th ed. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-5\">Under section 547 the transfer generally is made when the transfer is \u201cperfected.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(e)(2)(A)-(B). For property other than realty, the transfer is perfected \u201cwhen a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire a judicial lien that is superior to the interest of the transferee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 547(e)(1)(B). This determination must be made by reference to state law. <em>Palmer v. Radio Corp. of America, </em>453 F.2d 1133, 1138 (5th Cir.1971). Under Georgia law a lien attaches to garnished funds upon service of the summons of garnishment. Off. Code Ga.Ann. \u00a7 18-4-20(b); <em>Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank v. Wray, </em>144 Ga.App. 769, 242 S.E.2d 365, 366 (1978); <em>In re Georgia Steel, Inc., </em>25 B.R. 781, 787-88 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Ga.1982). Once the lien attaches, no contract creditor can obtain a superior judicial lien. <em>See </em>Off.Code Ga. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 18-4-96, 44-14-323.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1630-12\">We therefore conclude that the \u201ctransfer\u201d in this case was made on September 9, 1981, over ninety days before the Conners\u2019 petition in bankruptcy was filed. Thus, the Conners are not entitled to set aside the transfer as a voidable preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1629-17\">. In light of our disposition of this appeal it is unnecessary for us to consider the propriety of the Conners, as the debtors, seeking to set aside this transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1630-6\">. It is true that in Georgia a prior judgment creditor takes ahead of a subsequent judgment creditor even though the latter creditor first causes a summons of garnishment to issue. <em>Cale v. Hale, </em>157 Ga.App. 412, 277 S.E.2d 770, 771-72 (1981); <em>Wray, </em>242 S.E.2d at 366-67. This scheme of priorities does not aid the Conners, however, since section 547(e)(1)(B) contemplates a creditor that has yet to reduce its claim to judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
