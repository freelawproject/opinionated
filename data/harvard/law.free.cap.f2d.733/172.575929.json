Amana terminated its contract, however, because in Amana\u2019s view, Rosario\u2019s performance was poor; it sold few of Amana\u2019s products, it did not run its own service organization, it did not have an adequate inventory of Amana parts and products and it did not extend financial terms to its clients. Rosario sued Amana under the Puerto Rico Dealer\u2019s Act, 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278 <em>et seq. </em>(commonly known as \u201cAct 75\u201d) which prohibits dealer termination without \u201cjust cause.\u201d 10 L.P.R.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00a7 278a. Rosario sought a preliminary injunction under Article 3A of that Act, 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278b-1, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In any litigation in which there is ... involved the termination of a dealer\u2019s contract ..., the Court may grant, during the time the litigation is pending solution, any provisional remedy ... ordering any of the parties, or both, to continue, in all its terms, the relation established by the dealer\u2019s contract____ In any case in which the provisional remedy herein provided is requested, the Court shall consider the interests of all parties concerned and the purposes of the public policy contained in this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The district court, considering the \u201cinterests of ... [the] parties\u201d as well as Act 75\u2019s purposes and public policies, denied Rosario a preliminary injunction. The court believed, on the basis of evidence presented to that point, that Rosario had breached essential provisions of its contract with Amana, it had not met the contract\u2019s standard of performance, it had not adhered to the contract\u2019s provisions, and, consequently, Amana had \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Rosario appeals the denial of its request for a preliminary injunction. It seeks to show that the district court acted outside the Act\u2019s broad grant to the district court of authority to decide whether or not, in the light of the particular circumstances, to issue ' a preliminary injunction. <em>See </em>Informe de la Comisi\u00f3n de Industria y Comercio del Senado de Puerto Rico, <em>reprinted in, </em>25 Diario de Sesiones 830, 831 (1971); Informe de la Comisi\u00f3n de lo Jur\u00eddico Civil del Senado de Puerto Rico, <em>reprinted in, </em>25 Diario de Sesiones 831 (1971); Report of May 18, 1971 by Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico rendered to the Commission of Planning, Commerce and Industry of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, as cited in <em>Aybar v. F &amp; B Manufacturing Co., </em>498 F.Supp. 1184, 1190-91 n. 14 (D.P.R.1980). We find its arguments unconvincing and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">First, Rosario points out that the presence or absence of \u201cjust cause\u201d is the basic issue in the case; that to take its likely presence into account in denying the injunction is to judge Rosario\u2019s \u201clikelihood of success\u201d on the merits; but that Article 3A of Act 75, unlike the common law, does not make \u201clikelihood of success\u201d a precondition for a preliminary injunction. Rosario is correct in stating that under Article 3A the district court <em>need not </em>automatically take \u201cprobability of success\u201d into account, <em>DeMoss v. Kelly Services, Inc., </em>493 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir.1974); but nothing in Article 3A says that it <em>may not </em>ever do so. To the contrary, Article 3A requires the court to look both to the parties\u2019 \u201cinterests\u201d and to the Act\u2019s \u201cpublic policy.\u201d The basic \u201cpublic policy\u201d of the Act is to prevent dealer termination without \u201cjust cause.\u201d <em>Marina Industrial, Inc. v. Brown Boveri Corp., </em>\u2014 D.P.R.-, 83 J.T.S. 31 (March 18, 1983); <em>San Juan Mercantile Co. v. Canadian Transport Corp., Ltd., </em>108 D.P.R. 211, 216 (1978); Statement of Motives of Act 75, 1964 P.R. Laws, 4th Reg.Sess. 231; <em>see Sudouest Import Sales Corp. v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>732 F.2d 14, at 16 (1st Cir. 1984). The strength of the parties\u2019 interests also may depend upon the likelihood that \u201cjust cause\u201d will be found. Thus, in <em>Pan American Data Computer Corp. v. Data General Corp., </em>652 F.2d 215, 217 (1st Cir. 1981), we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">While the statute does not require a finding of likelihood of success as a prerequisite to issuance of an injunction, the court\u2019s view of the merits would certainly affect its judgment of the weight of the parties\u2019 interests and of the injunction\u2019s effect on the statutory policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\"><em>Pan American </em>disposes of Rosario\u2019s argument that Article 3A forbids the district court to take the likely presence or absence of \u201cjust cause\u201d into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">We also note (since Rosario seems to argue the contrary) that Rosario will still have an opportunity to present evidence and to argue the absence of \u201cjust cause\u201d at trial. <em>University of Texas v. Camenisch, </em>451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 1834, 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>L.Ed.2d 175 (1981); <em>Lebeau v. Spirito, </em>703 F.2d 639, 643 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Second, Rosario argues that the district court\u2019s preliminary view of the merits is contradicted by the record, which (Rosario claims) shows that Amana owes Rosario money, and that Rosario\u2019s performance was adequate. We have read the references that Rosario cites, including the letter from Amana dated February 23, 1982. We find nothing there to warrant overturning the findings of the district court. The only reference to Rosario\u2019s performance in the February 23, 1982 letter, for example, simply states:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We take this opportunity to thank you for your past support in purchasing Amana products. While 1981 was a reasonably good year, we hope 1982 will be even better for everyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">On the same issue, Amana presented testimonial and documentary evidence (including a letter sent to Rosario on December 7, 1982 with tables and schedules attached) which showed that Rosario\u2019s purchase of Amana products fell progressively in the last years of the dealership to less than $7,000 from January to October 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Third, Rosario seems to argue that the district court did not consider the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d that it will suffer as a result of the failure to obtain preliminary relief. The district court, however, did consider the issue. It wrote \u201cif Rosario is ultimately successful he will be compensated for the damages caused by Amana\u2019s pursuance of its business through another distributor.\u201d We have no grounds for doubting this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Finally, Rosario points out that it only sought an injunction that would require Amana to sell to it on a <em>non </em>-exclusive basis; Amana would remain free to distribute through others as well. As the district court noted, however, such an injunction would rewrite the Amana-Rosario contract. And, it would automatically make Amana\u2019s substitute dealership arrangments non-exclusive as well. The fact that the Amana-Rosario contract was exclusive suggests that Amana may have difficulty finding other dealers willing to distribute on a non-exclusive basis. And, Rosario provides no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">In sum, the district court\u2019s decision not to issue a preliminary injunction is adequately supported. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
