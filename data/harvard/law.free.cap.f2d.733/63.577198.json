(\u201cState Farm\u201d). Convinced that Odom was at fault, Bullock submitted a claim with State Farm for damages to her car. On September 16, 1980 State Farm denied the claim based upon the claim specialist\u2019s determination that Odom was not the sole proximate cause of the accident. On October 7, 1980, State Farm further explained that the claim was denied because of Mrs. Odom\u2019s representation on September 26, 1980 that she was not at fault and that Bullock admitted \u201cthat she was in a hurry and didn\u2019t look where she was going\u201d at the time of the accident. Bullock then filed suit against State Farm in state court seeking $500.00 in damages. The court found Odom\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the collision and awarded Bullock $500.00. Bullock then filed this tort action, claiming State Farm acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d in wrongfully refusing to investigate or settle a valid claim against an insured. Bullock also claimed that State Farm had a policy of summarily denying claims against its insureds for damages sustained in parking lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">In an opinion letter dated November 7, 1983, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Bullock\u2019s claim. In doing so, the court recognized: (1) an insurer\u2019s bad faith in wrongfully refusing to investigate or settle a valid claim with its insured makes the insurer liable to the policy holder for a 12% penalty and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Ark. Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 66-3238 (Supp.1977); and (2) any separate damages under the \u201ctort of bad faith\u201d were not recoverable unless affirmative misconduct amounting to deceit is alleged. <em>Sturgeon v. American Co. of Columbus, </em>266 Ark. 1040, 589 S.W.2d 207, 209 (Ark.App.1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, in concluding no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding State Farm\u2019s liability the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">\u201cAssuming plaintiff can maintain a cause of action as a third party beneficiary of the insurance policy, for defendant\u2019s alleged bad faith failure to investigate, plaintiff offers no facts in support of her allegations____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">... The uncontested facts are that at least by September 26, 1980, defendant had investigated the claim and denied plaintiff\u2019s claim on the basis of its insured\u2019s representations that she was not at fault and that plaintiff admitted fault at the time of the collision. The most that can be made of the facts presented is that defendant had not interviewed Mrs. Odom at the time it initially denied the claim on September 16, 1980, but did so only after plaintiff hired an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-15\">Regarding plaintiff\u2019s allegations that defendant has a policy of summarily denying parking lot claims, plaintiff points to the portions of the three letters from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>defendant quoted above wherein it is mentioned that this is a parking lot case. Plaintiff also offers a response to request for admission whereby defendant admits \u201cthat one factor considered by defendant in failing and refusing to pay plaintiffs demand was that the collision occurred on a parking lot.\u201d Presenting a question of fact that such a policy existed is meaningless unless there is a question of fact presented that the policy was utilized in this instance. The Court has found the undisputed facts to be that plaintiffs claim in this case was investigated and not summarily denied, at least as of September 26, 1980. Therefore any \u201cpolicy\u201d which may exist to summarily deny parking lot claims is not relevant after September 26, 1980.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">Regarding the time period from September 16, 1980, when the claim was initially denied, and September 26, 1980, when the claim was investigated, even if there was a failure to investigate and a policy in effect to summarily deny claims, the question is moot in this case because the result would have been no different had defendant investigated earlier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Viewing the undisputed material facts in a light most favorable to Bullock, we agree with the district court\u2019s opinion letter and therefore conclude that State Farm was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Bullock\u2019s conclusive assertions of ultimate fact \u2014 viz., that State Farm \u201cwillfully failed to investigate [Bullock\u2019s] claim\u201d and \u201cacted arbitrarily and capriciously with respect to [Bullock\u2019s] claim\u201d \u2014 were insufficient to withstand summary judgment in this case because the undisputed evidence showed that State Farm investigated Bullock\u2019s claim and denied it on the basis of the insured\u2019s representation that she was not at fault. <em>See Johnson v.
