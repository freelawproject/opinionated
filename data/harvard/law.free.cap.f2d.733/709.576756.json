They contend their wages are not \u201cincome\u201d within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-25\">The government moved to dismiss on the grounds that the district court lacked jurisdiction and the taxpayers failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court granted this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-26\">The district court clearly lacked jurisdiction to \u201cabate the findings\u201d that taxpayers had taxable income for the years in question. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201-02, denies federal courts jurisdiction over declaratory actions \u201cwith respect to federal taxes____\u201d The Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a), provides that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>shall be maintained in any court by any person ____\u201d Taxpayers\u2019 action clearly falls within these statutory prohibitions. They have not shown that any exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Taxpayers\u2019 suit would fail as a refund action because it does not allege that they paid the full amount of the assessed tax liabilities for the years in question. <em>See Flora v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 145, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960). Taxpayers\u2019 claim that their wages are not income is frivolous. <em>See United States v. Romero, </em>640 F.2d 1014, 1016 (9th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Buras, </em>633 F.2d 1356, 1361 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Funk v. CIR, </em>687 F.2d 264, 265 (8th Cir.1982) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">This appeal is frivolous because the result is obvious and the arguments of error are wholly without merit. <em>DeWitt v. Western Pacific R. Co., </em>719 F.2d 1448, 1451 (9th Cir.1983). We have discretion to award attorneys fees and double or single costs against litigants who prosecute frivolous appeals. <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.App.P. 38; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912. <em>See also United States v. Hart, </em>701 F.2d 749, 750 (8th Cir.1983) (attorneys fees and double costs awarded to government against pro se litigant).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">We choose to exercise this discretionary authority here. \u201cMeritless appeals of this nature are becoming increasingly burdensome on the federal court system.\u201d ' <em>Edwards v. CIR, </em>680 F.2d 1268, 1271 (9th Cir.1982). Taxpayers\u2019 arguments \u201cconstitute an imposition both on [the government] and on this court. \u2018Some penalty should attach to taking up our time with such a meritless contention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Sentry Life Ins. Co., </em>729 F.2d 652, 656 (9th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Catalina Yachts, </em>679 F.2d 180, 182 (9th Cir.1982)) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">We affirm. Taxpayers are assessed double costs and reasonable attorney fees payable to the government. The appellees will file affidavits and other appropriate material with the clerk within 21 days. The fees will be fixed by a separate order. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
