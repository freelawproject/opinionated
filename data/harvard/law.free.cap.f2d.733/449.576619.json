We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">The record reveals that on the afternoon of July 29, 1982, Daniel Rothering met appellant Ramon Torres, and his sister, Anita Torres, in Reedsville, Wisconsin. Rothering, at that time, sold a quantity of \u201cpot\u201d and \u201cfronted ... a hundred hits of acid\u201d to Ramon Torres. In return, Torres invited Rothering to attend the Blue Grass music festival being held in Mole Lake, Wisconsin, the following day. Rothering accepted the invitation and accompanied Torres and his sister to the Menominee Indian Reservation where they visited appellant, Tony Fish, and his wife, Theresa Fish. Following a visit where everyone \u201cjust sat around,\u201d Torres, his sister Anita, and Rothering left Fish\u2019s house and proceeded to a local gas station where they purchased a quantity of beer. Torres then returned to pick up Fish and his wife, Theresa, and the group of five drove to Diane Thunder\u2019s house, located on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin. When they arrived at Thunder\u2019s house, the group was joined by Ricky Fisher (a/k/a Ricky Katchenago) and Laurie Penass, who was visiting Thunder at the time. While at Thunder\u2019s house, members of the group consumed beer, \u201csnorted\u201d crystal methamphetamine (a controlled substance), and smoked sinsemilla, a refined grade of marijuana. The entire group eventually settled in the front room of Thunder\u2019s house, and at that time Ramon Torres displayed to members of the group, a knife that he had recently purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">At approximately 1:00 a.m. on the morning of July 30, 1982, the group of seven (consisting of Torres, his sister Anita, Fish, his wife Theresa, Rothering, Fisher, and Penass) left Thunder\u2019s house, loaded into Torres\u2019 Camaro, and proceeded to Martin\u2019s Lodge, a local tavern in Keshena, Wisconsin. The group purchased a case of beer and remained in the tavern\u2019s parking lot consuming the alcohol. At approximately 1:30 a.m., Officer Miller of the Menominee Tribal Police Force responded to a complaint that loud noises were emanating from the parking lot of Martin\u2019s Lodge. When Officer Miller arrived at the tavern, he observed appellants Fish and Torres along with five other individuals, standing around Torres\u2019 Camaro. Officer Miller instructed the group to leave the parking lot or go inside the tavern. The group purchased \u201csome more beer,\u201d piled into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Torres\u2019 car, and drove five or six miles to a wayside rest area located on Highway 47 in Shawno County, bordering the Menominee Indian Reservation. After arriving at the wayside and consuming more beer, members of the group vandalized the premises by breaking the handle off a water pump and tipping over a metal housing that covered the water well.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Following these acts of vandalism, an automobile traveling along Highway 47 pulled off the roadway and into the wayside. The appellants, Fish and Torres, approached the vehicle and observed that the driver was alone at the time. As Fish began to speak with the driver, Torres returned to the other members of the group and informed them that, \u201cWe are going to rip this guy off.\u201d Fish and Torres forcibly removed the driver, later identified as Thomas Peterson, from his vehicle, and proceeded to overpower him. Torres removed a blue windbreaker from Peterson and tied it over his head, while Fish used shoe laces to tie Peterson\u2019s hands behind his back. During this period, Ricky Fisher jumped on the hood of Peterson\u2019s vehicle and began smashing the windshield. Danny Rothering used the knife that Torres had displayed earlier in the evening at Diane Thunder\u2019s house to slash the vehicle\u2019s tires. Certain members of the group entered the vehicle, seized the radio and other valuable items, and placed them all in Torres\u2019 Camaro. Following the theft of these items from Peterson\u2019s vehicle, appellant Fish stated \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of him.\u201d Fish, Torres, and Rothering tossed the bound and blindfolded Peterson into the back seat of Torres\u2019 Camaro, entered the automobile themselves, and traveled north on Highway 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Torres drove his automobile approximately a mile to a mile and a half north on Highway 47 to Camp 24 road, a dirt-covered logging road located on the Menominee Indian Reservation. Torres turned onto the dirt road, heading east, and as he followed the winding road through the wooded Reservation, Rothering asked the still bound and blindfolded Peterson if he had any money. When Peterson failed to respond, Rothering twice punched Peterson in the face. Torres continued down the dirt-covered road for about five or six miles until he reached that area of the Indian Reservation where the Napone Bridge crosses the Little West Branch of the Wolf River. At that point Fish, Torres, and Rothering exited Torres\u2019 automobile, removed Peterson from the back seat, and laid him on the dirt-covered logging road. Fish tied a cloth around Peterson\u2019s neck and appellants Fish and Torres, along with Rothering, pulled on the cloth thereby strangling Peterson as they dragged him along the dirt road. The cloth broke and Peterson\u2019s body went limp. Fish and Torres lifted the limp body and carried it into a wooded area where Fish gave instructions to stab the bound and blindfolded Peterson. Rothering used the knife that Torres had displayed earlier in the evening at Diane Thunder\u2019s house and stabbed the rear calf on each of Peterson\u2019s legs. Appellants Fish and Torres carried the bleeding and limp Peterson to the edge of the Wolf River and dumped him into the water so that his torso and head were submerged but his legs remained on shore. Fish placed his foot on Peterson\u2019s head in order to keep the head submerged under, water and gave instructions to \u201cstab him.\u201d Torres took the knife from Rothering and stabbed Peterson twice in the stomach. Peterson\u2019s body was then pushed out into the flowing water of the Wolf River.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Fish, Torres, and Rothering returned to Torres' Camaro, and after making a U-turn on the other side of the Napone Bridge, Torres proceeded west on Camp 24 road toward Highway 47. After traveling \u201ca little ways down\u201d the dirt-covered road, Torres stopped the automobile so that he could \u201cget rid of the gloves\u201d that he and Fish had been wearing during the attack of Peterson. Torres and Rothering buried the blood-stained gloves, a sheath containing the knife used to stab Peterson, and the various items stolen from Peterson\u2019s automobile in a nearby tree stump and covered the area with dirt. Fish, Torres, and Rothering then exited the Menominee Indian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Reservation, returned to the wayside, and picked up the other four members of the group. Upon entering Torres\u2019 automobile, Laurie Penass noticed that Fish, Torres, and Rothering all had blood stains on their clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Torres drove the entire group to Fish\u2019s residence, located on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Zor, Wisconsin, and after their arrival, Fish, Torres, and Rothering changed out of their blood-stained clothes. Later that morning Fish instructed Rothering to \u201c[g]et rid of [his] clothes. Just say we were riding around drinking beer.\u201d Torres\u2019 sister, Anita, instructed Laurie Penass not to \u201csay anything now, because everybody is afraid that you are the only one that\u2019s going to say something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">At approximately 6:00 a.m. on the morning of July 30, 1982, Officer Snow of the Menominee Tribal Police Force received a radio dispatch from Officer Bovene to proceed to the wayside on Highway 47, where Officer Bovene and two members of the Menominee Sheriff\u2019s Department had discovered Peterson\u2019s abandoned and vandalized automobile. Upon his arrival, Officer Snow was instructed to search Camp 24 road on the Menominee Indian Reservation, in the area of the Napone Bridge. Snow proceeded to the bridge and at approximately 8:00 a.m., he detected a blue object that had become \u201csnagged\u201d in the Wolf River, about one hundred yards downstream from the Napone Bridge. Upon closer examination, Officer Snow believed the object to be a human body with hands tied behind the back and a blue windbreaker covering the head. Snow immediately returned to his squad car and radioed for assistance. When additional officers arrived at the scene, the body was removed from the Wolf River and sealed in a plastic body bag. Later that evening, Dr. Huntington, a professor of pathology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School, performed an autopsy and determined that the person, a Caucasian identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a Thomas Peterson, died of \u201cmultiple modes of homicidal assault.\u201d Dr. Huntington listed those modes specifically as \u201c[b]lunt injury, drowning while restrained, deep cutting in the abdomen, and strangulation.\u201d Dr. Huntington stated that due to the amount of water and debris in the victim\u2019s lungs, Peterson was still alive when he was submerged beneath the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">On August 25, 1982, a Federal Grand Jury returned a three count indictment against Tony Fish and Ramon Torres for first degree murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1111, 1153, conspiracy to commit murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1117, 1152, and kidnaping in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1201, 1153.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, the jury found appellants Fish and Torres guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, kidnaping, and the lesser included offense of second degree murder. The trial judge entered judgments of conviction and sentenced each appellant to three consecutive terms of life imprisonment. On appeal, Fish and Torres contend that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that the crimes were punishable in Federal court and, in the alternative, that the sentences imposed by the district court were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The appellants were prosecuted for first degree murder and kidnaping under the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, and for conspiracy to commit murder under the General Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to prosecute un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>der 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, the Government must prove, as a jurisdictional requisite, that an Indian committed one of fourteen enumerated crimes against another Indian, or any person, within Indian country.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Antelope, </em>430 U.S. 641, 646-47 n. 7, 97 S.Ct. 1395, 1398-99 n. 7, 51 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977); <em>United States v. Jewett, </em>438 F.2d 495, 497 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 947, 91 S.Ct. 1640, 29 L.Ed.2d 117 (1971); F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law, </em>300-04 (1982). In order to prosecute under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, the Government must prove, as a jurisdictional requisite, that the crime was in violation of a Federal enclave law, and that the crime occurred between an Indian and a non-Indian within Indian country.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>435 U.S. 313, 324-25, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 1086-87, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978); <em>United States v. Blue, </em>722 F.2d 383, 384-85 (8th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. John, </em>587 F.2d 683, 686-87 (5th Cir.) (on remand from the United States Supreme Court), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 925, 99 S.Ct. 2036, 60 L.Ed.2d 399 (1979); F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law, </em>287-300 (1982). The appellants contend that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to prove the jurisdictional requisite of their Indian status for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, and further, that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the jurisdictional requisite of Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152. In addition, the appellants claim that the evidence clearly showed that the conspiracy to commit murder and the kidnaping originated in non-Indian country, and thus should have been prosecuted in the Wisconsin state court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">We initially address the appellants\u2019 jurisdictional claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">\u201cAny Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of the following offenses, namely, murder ... kidnaping ... within the Indian country, shall be subject to the same laws and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">According to this language, in order to prosecute the appellants under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, the Government had to establish that the appellants were Indians who committed murder and kidnaping against an Indian, or any other person, within Indian country. In the instant case, the indictment charged that appellants Fish and Torres were \u201cIndians\u201d who committed first degree murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111, and kidnaping in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, against the person of Thomas Peterson, within \u201cIndian country.\u201d Thus, the indictment contained sufficient information to invoke federal jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153. <em>See United States v. Broncheau, </em>597 F.2d 1260, 1262-63 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 859, 100 S.Ct. 123, 62 L.Ed.2d 80 (1979); <em>United States v. Indian Boy X, </em>565 F.2d 585, 594 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 841, 99 S.Ct. 131, 58 L.Ed.2d 139 (1978). <em>Cf. United States v. Heath, </em>509 F.2d 16, 20 (9th Cir.1974) (tribal enrollment sufficient to allege jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152). The question then becomes whether the evidence intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>duced at trial was sufficient to prove that appellants Fish and Torres, were, in fact, Indians and that the murder and kidnaping did, in fact, occur within Indian country.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">It is a well-settled principle of Federal law that when the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal conviction is questioned, the reviewing tribunal examines the record in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>720 F.2d 941, 946 (7th Cir.1983). The record reveals that in the instant case, the Government introduced certificates of tribal enrollment, certifying that appellants Fish and Torres were each listed on the Menominee Tribal Roll.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant Fish\u2019s certificate of enrollment provided that Tony Anthony Fish, identified as one of the defendants in this action, was born on November 11, 1961, was <em>ih/m </em>degree of Menominee Indian blood, and had been assigned Roll Number 00001077. Appellant Torres\u2019 certificate of enrollment provided that Ramon Joseph Torres, identified as the other defendant in this action, was born on August 28, 1962, was <em>nk\u00bf </em>degree of Menominee Indian blood, and had been assigned Roll Number 00004246. Indeed, courts have held that uncontradicted evidence of tribal enrollment and a degree of Indian blood constitutes adequate proof that one is an Indian for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153. As the court stated in <em>United States v. Lossiah, </em>537 F.2d 1250 (4th Cir.1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cWithout objection, the Government introduced ... the certificate of the Tribal Enrollment officer of the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians that defendant is on Revised Roll No. 3902, was born May 8, 1943, and possesses three-fourths degree of Indian blood. <em>That was adequate proof that defendant was a Cherokee Indian.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">537 F.2d at 1251. <em>See also United States v. Dodge, </em>538 F.2d 770, 786 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Alvarado v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 1099, 97 S.Ct. 1119, 51 L.Ed.2d 547 (1977) (tribal enrollment and one-fourth Indian blood is sufficient proof that one is an Indian). Additionally, in <em>United States v. Antelope, </em>430 U.S. 641, 97 S.Ct. 1395, 51 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977), proof that defendants were \u201cenrolled members of the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe and thus not emancipated from tribal relations,\u201d 430 U.S. at 646-47 n. 7, 97 S.Ct. at 1398-99 n. 7, was sufficient proof that defendants were Indians for purposes of Federal jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153. In the instant case, the Government introduced not only the certificates of tribal enrollment, which included appellants\u2019 degree of Indian blood, but also certified copies of cancelled checks that the Menominee Tribal Enterprises had issued to Tony Fish and Ramon Torres as shared dividend payments. According to the testimony of Dolores Ninham, the payroll supervisor for the Menominee Tribal Enterprises, these shared dividend payments were made only to persons who appeared on the Menominee Tribal Roll.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>light of appellants\u2019 status as enrolled Indians of the Menominee Indian Tribe, and their receipt of shared dividend payments issued only to enrolled members of the Menominee Indian Tribe, we hold that there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that appellants Fish and Torres were Indians for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Appellants further claim that the district court\u2019s jury instruction on what constitutes an Indian for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 was improper. The trial judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cTo be considered an Indian, a person must have some degree of Indian blood, and must be recognized as an Indian. In considering whether a person is recognized as an Indian, you may consider such factors, whether a person is recognized as an Indian by an Indian tribe, or society of Indians. Whether a person is recognized as an Indian by the federal government, whether a person resides on an Indian reservation, and whether a person holds himself out as an Indian. It is not necessary that all of these factors be present, rather you as jurors must consider the totality of circumstances in determining as a factual matter whether each defendant is an Indian.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Upon our review of relevant case law, it is clear that the district court\u2019s definition of what constitutes an Indian for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 is in accord with present Federal law. \u201cThe test, first suggested in <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>45 U.S. 567, 4 How. 567, 11 L.Ed. 1105 (1845), and generally followed by the courts, considers (1) <em>the degree of Indian blood; </em>and (2) <em>tribal or governmental recognition as an Indian.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) <em>United States v. Broncheau, </em>597 F.2d at 1263. <em>See also United States v. Dodge, </em>538 F.2d at 786; F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law, </em>23-27 (1982). In the instant case, the trial judge instructed the jury that in order to be considered an Indian, a person must have some degree of Indian blood and must be recognized as an Indian by the Indian tribe and/or the Federal government. Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly instructed the jury on the issue of what constitutes an Indian for purpose of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, and we will not disturb the jury\u2019s finding that appellants Fish and Torres were, in fact, Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The appellants next jurisdictional claim is that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that in order to find Fish and Torres guilty of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, the jury had to find that Peterson was a non-Indian. The statute in question, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">According to the appellants, the second paragraph of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152 requires the Government to prove as a jurisdictional element of its case, that the conspiracy to commit murder was not committed by one Indian against the person or property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>another Indian.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellants claim that Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status was a question of fact to be decided by the jury and the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on this jurisdictional element constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In <em>Famous Smith v. United States, </em>151 U.S. 50, 14 S.Ct. 234, 38 L.Ed. 67 (1894), the United States Supreme Court interpreted Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 2145, 2146,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the predecessor of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, <em>see United States v. Cowboy, </em>694 F.2d 1228, 1232-33 (10th Cir. 1982), and stated:- \u201cThat [the victim] was a white man, and not an Indian, was a fact which the government was bound to establish, and if it failed to introduce any evidence upon that point, the defendant was entitled to an instruction to that effect.\u201d 151 U.S. at 55, 14 S.Ct. at 235, 38 L.Ed. 67. Two years later, the Court, in <em>Lucas v. United States, </em>163 U.S. 612, 16 S.Ct. 1168, 41 L.Ed. 282 (1896), again interpreted Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 2145, 2146 and stated that \u201c[t]he burden of proof was on the government to sustain the jurisdiction of the court by evidence as to the status of the deceased, and the question should have gone to the jury as one of fact and not of presumption.\u201d 163 U.S. at 617, 16 S.Ct. at 1170. Based upon the Court\u2019s foregoing analysis of Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 2145, 2146; the predecessor of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, it is apparent that for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, the jury must determine, as a question of fact, the victim\u2019s status as an Indian or non-Indian.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>42 C.J.S. Indians \u00a7 83(a) (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In the instant case, the district court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">\u201cIn order to establish the offense of conspiracy, the government must prove these elements beyond a reasonable doubt, one, that the alleged conspiracy existed, and, two, that an overt action was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, three, that the defendant knowingly and intentionally became a member of the conspiracy, and, of course, four that the defendant is an Indian and, five, that the conspiracy occurred within Indian country.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">For purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, the Government had to prove not only that Fish and Torres were Indians but also that the victim, Peterson, was a non-Indian. <em>See </em>F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>an Law, </em>301 n. 157 (1982) (allegation and proof that the crime was interracial).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The record reveals that the district court never instructed the jury on Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status. The record further reveals that appellants Fish and Torres never objected to the above jury instruction at the time of the jury instruction conference, immediately after the jury instruction was given by the trial judge, or at any time before the jury retired to consider its verdict. According to Fed.R.Crim.P. 30:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfG\">\u201c[T]he court shall instruct the jury after the arguments are completed. <em>No party may assign as error any portion of the charge of omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d (emphasis added).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In the instant case, the appellants failed to file a timely objection to the jury instruction, and thereby allow the district court to correct its instruction on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder. Accordingly, the appellants have waived their claim of an improper jury instruction on this appeal. <em>United States v. Verkuilen, </em>690 F.2d 648, 652-53 (7th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>569 F.2d 1003, 1008-10 (7th Cir.1978) <em>(\u201cJackson </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Despite the appellants waiver on the issue of the improper jury instruction, this court must still determine if the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Verkuilen, </em>690 F.2d at 653; <em>Jackson, </em>569 F.2d at 1010. As we stated in <em>Jackson, </em>\u201c[i]n deciding whether a defect in a jury instruction is \u2018plain error,\u2019 we must examine the entire record before \u00fas, and determine whether the instructional mistake had a probable impact on the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was guilty.\u201d (citations omitted). 569 F.2d at 1010. <em>See also United States v. Verkuilen, </em>690 F.2d at 653. Based upon our review of the record and the applicable case law, it is clear that in the instant case, the district court\u2019s failure to submit the question of Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status to the jury did not impact upon the jury\u2019s finding of guilty, and thus did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">At trial, the Government introduced into evidence an eleven page autopsy report, prepared by the pathologist, Dr. Huntington, that referred to Peterson as \u201ca somewhat obese <em>Caucasian </em>male appearing to be of middle age.\u201d (emphasis added). In addition, the jury observed several photographs of Peterson before and after his death, each of which revealed that Peterson was a white man with Caucasian features. Finally, the indictment that was read to the jury immediately preceding the conspiracy instruction, referred to Peterson as a non-Indian. At no time throughout the entire trial did appellants Fish and Torres ever suggest, challenge, or even attempt to elicit evidence that Peterson <em>was </em>an Indian. As a result, when Fish and Torres moved, at the close of all the evidence, to dismiss the conspiracy charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, for the Government\u2019s failure to establish Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status, the district court denied the motion and ruled that, \u201cI think there's evidence in the case, from which [Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status] can be amply determined____ You have got photographs. You have got residence.\u201d We agree with the district court that the record contained ample evidence, including the reference to Peterson as a Caucasian in the autopsy report, the photographs, and the reference to Peterson as a non-Indian in the indictment, to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that Peterson was a non-Indian. Accordingly, we hold that in light of the totality of the circumstances, the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the issue of Peterson\u2019s non-Indian status did not impact upon the jury\u2019s finding of guilt and, therefore, did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The appellants\u2019 next jurisdictional claim is that the Government, for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1152 and 1153, had to prove that the crimes of first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and kidnaping were all committed within Indian country. Appellants do not contest the fact that the murder occurred in Indian country, rather the appellants claim that, according to the Government\u2019s evidence, the conspiracy to commit murder and the kidnaping originated outside the Menominee Indian Reservation, at the wayside in Shawno County. To support their position, the appellants rely upon the evidence presented at trial which showed that the plan to \u201cget rid of\u201d Peterson was first discussed and entered into at the wayside, and that the abduction of Peterson, including the binding of his hands and the blindfolding of his eyes, was initiated at the wayside. The evidence further revealed that the wayside only bordered the Menominee Indian Reservation and was not located within Indian country. Appellants contend that because the conspiracy to commit murder and the kidnaping originated outside of Indian country, the crimes should have been prosecuted in the Wisconsin state court system rather than in the Federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It is undisputed that the Wisconsin state court has jurisdiction to punish an Indian who commits a crime off the Menominee Indian Reservation, and within state territory, if such crime is in violation of state law. <em>Sturdevant v. State, </em>76 Wis.2d 247, 250-51 251 N.W.2d 50, 52-53, <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 970, 97 S.Ct. 2931, 53 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1977). <em>See also Mescalero Apache Tribe v.

It is equally clear, however, that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, the Federal court has exclusive jurisdiction to punish an Indian who participates in a conspiracy to murder a non-Indian within the federal territory of the Menominee Indian Reservation, provided that the Indian has not been punished by the tribe and the crime is not in the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribe.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Williams v.

John, </em>587 F.2d at 687 (Congress has stripped the states of power to punish Indians for offenses committed against non-Indians in Indian country). Such federal jurisdiction attaches if \u201cat least one of the conspirators commits an overt act in the territorial jurisdiction of the United States district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Schmucker-Bula, </em>609 F.2d 399, 402 (7th Cir.1980). <em>See also United States v. Winter, </em>509 F.2d 975, 982 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Parks v.

The appellants agreed to murder Peterson, and in order to effect that object, transported Peterson five or six miles through the Reservation to the location of the Na-pone Bridge. While on the Reservation, appellants tied a cloth around Peterson\u2019s neck and strangled him as they dragged him along the dirt-covered road, carried Peterson into the woods and stabbed him in both legs, tossed Peterson into the Wolf River so that his head remained submerged under water, and stabbed Peterson in the abdominal region. Further, the Federal kidnaping statute under which appellants were prosecuted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 provides that \u201c[w]hoever unlawfully ... confines ... any person ... when ... any such act is done within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.\u201d The uncontradicted testimony at trial also revealed that the major portion of the appellants\u2019 on-going kidnaping of Peterson occurred on the Menominee Indian Reservation. The appellants overpowered Peterson at the wayside, tied his hands, blindfolded him, tossed him into Torres\u2019 automobile and then drove onto the Reservation. Peterson remained bound, blindfolded, and forcibly confined in Torres\u2019 automobile as the appellants proceeded five or six miles through the Reservation along Camp 24 road. After arriving at the Na-pone Bridge, appellants kept Peterson\u2019s hands tied and his eyes blindfolded as they strangled him, dragged him along the dirt-covered road, stabbed him, and submerged his head under water. This uncontradicted evidence clearly reveals that the appellants conspired to murder Peterson in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117 and that the appellants forcibly confined Peterson in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201. Moreover, the evidence clearly reveals that these on-going crimes occurred within the federal territory of the Menominee Indian Reservation. Accordingly, we hold that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1152, 1153, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin had jurisdiction to punish appellants Fish and Torres for their participation in the conspiracy to commit murder, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, and their kidnapping in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, on the Menominee Indian Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Appellants next contend that the testimony of Agent Richard Reem, a blood analyst for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was unduly prejudicial. At trial, Agent Reem was qualified as an expert in blood analysis and testified that he found blood on the knife used to stab Peterson, the knife sheath, and on three of the gloves found buried in the tree stump on the Menominee Indian Reservation. Reem further testified that he was unable to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>mine if the blood spots on the knife were human blood but he did confirm that the blood spots appearing on the knife sheath and the three gloves were, in fact, human blood. Reem marked the blood spots appearing on all the exhibits but could only identify the blood type of one spot that appeared on one of the gloves. Reem testified that the glove contained type 0 blood. Following the close of the Government\u2019s case, the defendants moved to strike Agent Reem\u2019s testimony due to the Government\u2019s failure to establish the requisite chain of custody for the knife, sheath, and gloves. The court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike the testimony but denied a motion for mistrial because \u201cthere is a lot of additional testimony with respect to blood at various places in the testimony of the case, so I don\u2019t think the mere existence of blood in and of itself means a mistrial has to be granted ____\u201d The court then recited a specific cautionary instruction to the jury, requesting them to exclude and disregard Agent Reem\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201cThe testimony of Special Agent Reem related to observations that he made of these items of evidence, but in his testimony, there was no establishment of the unfailing chain of custody from the time that those items were taken into the possession of the authority until he examined them, and the law views that as a fatal flaw because there\u2019s always the fact that you could have contamination or various sorts of problems with whatever the substance was or whatever the mark was or whatever it was that you were having the expert analyze. For that reason, you are advised by the Court that you should disregard it in its entirety the evidence of Special Agent Reem. I know it\u2019s difficult, but you\u2019re sworn to observe the directions of the Court with reference to the evidence, and I am telling you that that evidence should be excluded from your mind. As you enter your deliberations at the conclusion of this case, don\u2019t consider in any fashion the testimony of Special Agent Reem this afternoon. Is that clear to everyone on the jury? All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">At the time of the final jury instructions, the district court recited a second specific cautionary instruction to the jury, requesting them to \u201cconsider only the evidence received in this case____ [Y]ou are to disregard any evidence to which I sustained an objection, or which I ordered stricken. In this regard you are to disregard the testimony of Special Agent Reem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">In order to determine the prejudicial impact of Agent Reem\u2019s stricken testimony, we must place such testimony \u201c[i]n the context of the entire trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>507 F.2d at 437. A review of the trial record reveals that the bloodstained knife, sheath, and gloves had already been admitted in evidence and observed by the jury before Agent Reem testified. In addition, the Government had already introduced uncontradicted evidence that the knife was used to stab Peterson, appellants Fish and Torres wore gloves during the stabbing, the blood-stained gloves were buried in a tree stump following the stabbing, appellants had bloodstained clothes when they returned to the \u201cwayside,\u201d and upon their arrival at Fish\u2019s residence on the morning of July 30, 1982, appellants changed out of their bloodstained clothes. Thus, Agent Reem\u2019s testimony that human blood spots appeared on the sheath and the three gloves was merely cumulative evidence. In effect, the only evidence added by Agent Reem was that one of the gloves contained type 0 blood. Though Dr. Huntington, the pathologist, had earlier identified Peterson\u2019s blood as type 0, the impact of Agent Reem\u2019s testimony was substantially lessened by his inability to determine the type of blood present on the knife, sheath, and the other two gloves, Dr. Huntington\u2019s admission to defense counsel that \u201ctype 0 blood is fairly common,\u201d and the total lack of evidence that the type 0 blood appearing on the glove was that of the victim, Peterson. Moreover, the record reveals that the Government introduced Agent Reem\u2019s testimony in good faith and was unable to establish a proper chain of custody because the testimony was stricken, upon defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>counsel\u2019s objection, after the close of the Government\u2019s case. Accordingly, we agree with this court\u2019s language in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>that \u201c[i]n the context of the entire trial, ... reversible error was avoided by the district court\u2019s action in striking the testimony and instructing the jury to disregard [such] testimony ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of the totality of the circumstances, including the district court\u2019s specific cautionary instructions to disregard Agent Reem\u2019s testimony, after granting the motion to strike and again at the close of trial, and the cumulative nature of the testimony, we hold that the stricken evidence did not unduly prejudice the appellants and thus the district court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for mistrial was proper. <em>Accord Id.; United States v. Catalano, </em>450 F.2d 985, 990 (7th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Moscatello v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 928, 92 S.Ct. 980, 30 L.Ed.2d 802 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Appellants finally contend that the district court committed reversible error by sentencing each of them to three consecutive life sentences. Appellants claim that the district court mechanically imposed sentence because it failed to consider individual factors, improperly considered appellants\u2019 status as Indians and the occurrence of unrelated crimes on the Menominee Indian Reservation, and speculated as to appellants\u2019 release by the Parole Commission. Appellants do not contest the fact that the crimes for which they were convicted, second degree murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111, conspiracy to commit murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, and kidnaping in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, each carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The law is well-settled that a trial judge \u201chas wide discretion in sentencing and his exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed absent a showing of gross abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilkins, </em>659 F.2d 769, 773 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1102, 102 S.Ct. 681, 70 L.Ed.2d 646 (1981) (citing <em>United States v.

Furthermore, \u201ca sentence within the statutory maximum provided by Congress is only subject to review on appeal for manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>720 F.2d 941, 951 (7th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Madison, </em>689 F.2d 1300, 1312 (7th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1117, 103 S.Ct. 754, 74 L.Ed.2d 971 (1983); <em>United States v. Main, </em>598 F.2d 1086, 1094 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 943, 100 S.Ct. 301, 62 L.Ed.2d 311 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">In the instant case, the trial judge observed appellants Fish and Torres throughout the trial, thoroughly reviewed the presentence reports, listened to the defense counsels\u2019 statements of mitigation, and afforded appellants a right of elocution. In addition, at the sentencing hearing the trial judge reviewed the evidence presented at trial and made express reference to each appellant\u2019s individual record and personal life before imposing sentence. The trial judge\u2019s reference to other crimes committed on the Menominee Indian Reservation and his comment that \u201cI think its imperative that a message go forth to the Menominee Nation,\u201d was well within the judge\u2019s discretion to consider general deterrence when imposing sentence. As this court stated in <em>United States v. Brubaker, </em>663 F.2d 764 (7th Cir. 1981), \u201c[consideration of general deterrence is proper provided that it does not result in a mechanistic imposition of sentence.\u201d 663 F.2d at 769 (citing <em>United States v. Miller, </em>589 F.2d 1117, 1138 (1st Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 958, 99 S.Ct. 1499, 59 L.Ed.2d 771 (1979)). The trial judge\u2019s consideration of each appellant\u2019s individual record and his comments on each appellant\u2019s personal life before imposing sentence clearly demonstrates that the three consecutive life sentences were not mechanically imposed. Moreover, the judge\u2019s remark that \u201cwhen you get over 30 years you don\u2019t stack life sentences as far as impact on parole is concerned\u201d was in no way a speculation as to when the Parole Commission would release appellants. Indeed, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>added that \u201cregardless of what I do here, [defendants\u2019 futures are] pretty largely in the hands of the prison authorities and the parole board.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by sentencing appellants Fish and Torres to the maximum statutory penalty of three consecutive terms of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. Appellants Fish and Torres were prosecuted under Federal statutes due to their enrollment in the Menominee Indian Tribe and the fact that the alleged murder occurred on a Federal Indian Reservation. It appears from the record that Rothering was not a member of an Indian tribe and, therefore, was not prosecuted in the same case with the appellants Torres and Fish. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1152, 1153.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-12\">. We note that conspiracy to commit murder is not one of the fourteen enumerated crimes of the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, thus, the Government prosecuted the charge of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>spiracy to commit murder under the General Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152. <em>See </em>Footnote 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\">.

The United States Supreme Court has held that for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152, crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians, in Indian country, are subject to state jurisdiction. <em>United States v. McBratney, </em>104 U.S. 621, 26 L.Ed. 869 (1881); <em>New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, </em>326 U.S. 496, 66 S.Ct. 307, 90 L.Ed. 261 (1946). In addition, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152 does not include offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, offenses where the Indian has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or offenses, which by treaty stipulation, are in the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\">. Appellants argue that the certificates of enrollment constitute hearsay and are therefore inadmissible to prove appellants' Indian status. The record reveals that at trial, the Government introduced copies of the original Menominee Tribal Roll, in the form of certificates of enrollment which contained each appellant\u2019s name, birth date, and degree of Indian blood, and were prepared by Theresa Pitts, the enrollment clerk for the Menominee Indian Tribe. The Menominee Tribal Roll clearly constitutes a public record setting forth matters observed pursuant to a duty imposed by law as to which matter there was a duty to report. <em>See 25 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 903b(c) (1982). Thus, pursuant to Fed.R. Evid. 803(8)(B), the Menominee Tribal Roll qualifies as an exception to the general hearsay rule set forth in Fed.R.Evid. 802. Due to the fact that the Menominee Tribal Roll was admissible into evidence, the certificates of enrollment, prepared by the Menominee enrollment clerk and certified by her at trial to be accurate representations of the information contained in the original Tribal Roll, were admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 902(4) as certified copies of the original public record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b523-11\">. Appellants argue that the Government made no attempt to prove that the Tony Fish and Ramon Torres appearing on the Menominee Tribal Roll and the shared dividend checks issued by the Menominee Tribal Enterprises were, in fact, the defendants. However, at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the defendants introduced no evidence to show that they were not the Tony Fish and Ramon Torres who were identified on the Tribal Roll and who received the shared dividend checks from Menominee Tribal Enterprises. In light of the Government\u2019s uncontradicted evidence, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that the Tony Fish and Ramon Torres appearing on the Menominee Tribal Roll and the shared dividend checks, were, in fact, the defendants. <em>See Corona-Palomera v.
