The defendant\u2019s first separate defense admits certain allegations of the complaint, and \u201cas to each and every other allegation of the complaint the defendant denies that he has any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief.\u201d The plaintiff moved for an order of tlie court to compel the defendant to make this defense definite and certain, and, this motion having been denied, appeal is made to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We are clearly of the opinion that the order appealed from should not be disturbed. The answer is sufficiently definite and certain to raise an issue. It admits certain facts and puts in a general denial as to the remainder, and this is all that the Code of Civil Procedure requires. Whether the denial of information and belief is sufficient is a question of law to be determined upon the trial, but is not properly to be tested by a motion to make definite and certain. \u201cThe law does not allow of a captious and strained intendment, for such nice pretense of certainty confounds true and legal certainty\u201d (Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims [8th Ed.] 187), and so it has .been held that a pleading is not objectionable as ambiguous or obscure if it be certain to a common intent; that is, if it be clear enough according to reasonable intendment or construction, though not worded with absolute precision (Stephen on Pleadings [6th Ed.] 312). Here the pleading follows the common form and puts in issue the matters not denied, and there can be no question of its reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
