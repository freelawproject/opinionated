See Altmark v. Haimowitz, 55 Misc. Rep. 195, 105 N. Y. Supp. 205; Rhodes v. Union Ry. Co., 108 N. Y. Supp. 949. This objection would be fatal, if a settled case was not before the court; but a case has been made and settled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>and is with the return upon this appeal, and from its examination we are satisfied that the motion in the lower court was properly granted. Technicalities must give way to substance, and we think that the interests of justice will be best subserved by affirming the order of the lower court, which granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">Order affirmed, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
