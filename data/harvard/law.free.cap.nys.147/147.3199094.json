Ray et al., 147 N. Y. Supp. 138, were tried together, and most of the material facts are the same in each.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">In this case it appeared that the Searchlight Gas Company\u2019s labels on the tanks sold by the defendant completely covered the word \u201cPrest-O-Lite\u201d appearing on the body of the tank, and it was represented by the employe of the defendant, who exchanged the tanks for the defendant in this instance, that he was delivering to the purchaser \u201ca Prest-O-Lite,\u201d and, on being asked where the name \u201cPrest-O-Lite\u201d appeared, he scratched off the label and revealed it. The decision of the case, therefore, is controlled by the views expressed in the opinion in the companion case to which reference has been made, and on the authority of the decision in that case the determination of the Appellate Term is reversed, with costs to appellant, and the judgment of the Municipal Court is reversed, and the complaint is dismissed with costs. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">INGRAHAM, P.
