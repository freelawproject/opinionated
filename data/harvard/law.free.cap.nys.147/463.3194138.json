It was not specifically mentioned in the lease. On May 1, 1912, defendant obtained a fire department permit to keep celluloid on the premises, which permit was revoked on August 12, 1913; an inspector of the fire department having officially reported that the business conducted in said premises, in the manufacture of celluloid products, was conducted in a way that constituted it a menace to surrounding property. \u25a0On September 5, 1913, the fire commissioner issued an order that defendant should discontinue the use of the premises for the manufacture of celluloid buttons within five days unless the regulations of the municipal explosive commission were complied with. On September 11th defendant\u2019s time to comply with this order was extended to October 1, 1913. On the same date two further orders were made by the fire commissioner, requiring the owner to install a wet sprinkler system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>throughout the building, also to make the doors to stairways, halls, and rear fire escapes self-closing, and to provide a fireproof passageway from rear fire escape to.Twenty-Fourth street. The evidence shows that plaintiff, in compliance with said orders, entered into a contract for the making of these very extensive improvements on September 29, 1913, prior to the date when the defendant tenant abandoned the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> No sufficient proof of surrender and acceptance was offered by defendant. It is well established that an entry by a landlord upon demised premises, to comply with an order of a city department to make repairs therein, is not an eviction, nor the acceptance of a surrender. White v. Thurber, 55 Hun, 447, 448, 8 N. Y. Supp. 661; Campbell v. Porter, 46 App. Div. 628, 61 N. Y. Supp. 712; Markham v. Stevenson Brewing Co., 51 App. Div. 463, 465, 466, 64 N. Y. Supp. 617, affirmed 169 N. Y. 593, 62 N. E. 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> All tenants hold the premises demised to them subject to the full exercise of the police power of the government. The exercise of an act of sovereignty \"by the government is not a breach of, nor will it discharge, the covenant of a lease for the payment of rent. Rawle on Covenants for Title, \u00a7 129; Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall, 549, 550, 20 L. Ed. 287; Gallup v. Albany Ry. Co., 65 N. Y. 1, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is contended by the defendant respondent that, the building having become untenantable for the purposes stated in the lease, though through no default of the owner, the defendant was entitled, as matter of law, to surrender the premises, as he would, had they become unusable for any purpose, as through destruction by fire. It is unnecessary, however, to consider this doubtful proposition, inasmuch as it is clearly shown by the evidence that the premises only became unusable for one of the purposes contemplated by the lease, though not specifically mentioned therein, and were usable for the general purposes contemplated; i. e., the manufacture of other kinds of buttons and of the cloak and suit trimmings as specified in the lease. Hardships resulting from acts of sovereignty, or the exercise of police power, must be borne by those affected thereby, whether tenants or landlords, and must be deemed to have been in contemplation of the contracting parties at the time they entered into the contract of hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Defendant having established no defense to plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, the judgment must be reversed, with costs, and judgment ordered for plaintiff for $225 and costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
