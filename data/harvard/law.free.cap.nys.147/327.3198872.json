At the beginning of the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel elected to discontinue the action as against the city of New York and to proceed against the board of education alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Upon the pleadings and opening of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the complaint was dismissed upon the merits, and from the judgment entered to that effect, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> It is sought to sustain the judgment on the ground that the action was brought to recover damages caused by the maintenance of a nuisance. The complaint clearly states a cause of action for negligence. It charges that, while the plaintiff was a scholar in one of the public schools of the city of New York, he was directed by the authorities and teachers in said school to engage in certain games and exercises in the playground, and\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-15\">\u201cthat, while so engaged, plaintiff, because of the defective, worn, and dilapidated condition of the flooring of said playground and the defective construction of the same, was caused to fall, sustaining severe, painful, and permanent injuries; * * * that the said defendants maintained said school building and the playground and flooring thereof aforesaid as a public school, and there received and instructed many pupils, of which plaintiff was one, for a long time after the same whs, and was well known to the defendants to be, in an unsafe and dangerous condition, and it was in said condition at the time of the accident above described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Not only the complaint, but the opening of plaintiff\u2019s counsel as well, indicates that a recovery was sought on the ground that the injuries were caused solely by defendant\u2019s negligence. It is true, after the complaint had been dismissed and an exception taken to the ruling, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked to go to the jury on the ground that the allegations of the complaint were sufficient to charge the board of education with maintaining a nuisance; but this request did not change the allegations of the complaint, or what counsel stated in the opening would be proved. Where a complaint is dismissed upon the opening of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, not only the complaint, but also the opening, must receive a liberal interpretation. McCarton v. City of New York, 149 App. Div. 516, 133 N. Y. Supp. 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">After the court had dismissed the complaint, counsel for plaintiff was not required to ask leave to go to the jury, because the rights of his client were fully preserved by resting on the exception to the ruling. The only importance to be attached to the request is that in the opinion of counsel, if the complaint did not state a cause of action for negligence, then it might be considered as stating one for a nuisance; in other words, the client having failed upon one theory, it was sought to preserve his rights by trying to adopt another one.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The judgment appealed from, therefore, is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
