All the plaintiff\u2019s assignors worked Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of the week in question. All of them were members of affiliated unions called the \u201cTheatrical Council.\u201d Plaintiff testified that on Thursday there was a strike by one or two of the unions with which their unions were affiliated. The evidence shows that an audience of 2,000 spectators had gathered on Thursday night, but, owing to the strike of the affiliated unions, there could be no performance. Plaintiff\u2019s assignors did not report for work on Friday and Saturday. One of them testified, as an excuse therefor, that he read an article in an unnamed newspaper to the effect that the employers had locked out all members of the union as long as they retained their union membership. The appellant denied any such advertisement or announcement, and no newspaper containing such advertisement, or any copy thereof,. was produced. The defense also claimed there was a general strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">An employ\u00e9 by the week, who, without sickness or other adequate excuse, fails to report for work or tender his services for several days, but, on the contrary, abandons his job during that period, is not entitled to any part of the week\u2019s wages.
