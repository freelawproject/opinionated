It adopted and used the word \u201cSimplex\u201d as a trade-name and device in the form shown in the record; the distinguishing feature being that it is in script and that a flourish is carried from the top of the initial \u201cS\u201d above and along the full length of the word, the end of the flourish producing the crossbar of the final letter \u201cx.\u201d This device it uses in and about its business, and attaches to the radiator of motor cars manufactured by it. It claims no exclusive right to the word \u201cSirm plex,\u201d conceding that it is in general use. It does claim such right to the form thereof used by it, but it has not registered the said device as a trade-mark. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The defendants are copartners doing business in the city of New York and elsewhere under the trade-name and style of David Kahnweiler\u2019s Sons, in the manufacture of fire extinguishers. They attach the word \u201cSimplex,\u201d' written in approximately the same style as used by plaintiff, to their fire extinguishers. The plaintiff neither manufactures nor sells fire extinguishers. The defendants neither manufacture nor sell automobiles. Although the plaintiff concedes that the defendants are entitled to use the word \u201cSimplex,\u201d and it has not registered the particular device adopted by it, and it is obvious that plaintiff and defendants are engaged in entirely different lines' of business, manufacturing and selling products as dissimilar as can .well be imagined, the Special Term has restrained the defendants from the continued use of the device adopted by them upon the ground of unfair trade competition. To invoke the equitable remedy of injunction against unfair competition, plaintiff must first establish that .there is competition. The granting of such.remedy is based upon interference with plaintiff\u2019s customers, the diversion of its trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\u201cA party may have a property in\u2014that is, an exclusive right to use\u2014a \u2018name, symbol, figure, letter, form, or device\u2019 to distinguish goods manufactured and sold by him from those manufactured and sold by Others, or to indicate when or by whom, or at what manufactory, the article to which it is affixed is manufactured. This property right the courts will protect by injunction, and for its invasion the law gives compensation in damages. It is an infraction of that right, to print or manufacture, or put on the market for sale, and sell for use upon articles of merchandise of the same kind as those upon which it is used by, tlie.proprietor, any device of symbol which by its resemblance to the' established trade-mark * * * and use of that which is not the manufacture of the proprietor, believing it to be his.\u201d Colman v. Crump, 70 N. Y. 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\u201cThe manufacturer of particular goods is entitled to the reputation they have acquired, and the public is entitled to the means of distinguishing between those and other goods; and protection is .accorded against unfair dealing, whether there be a technical trade-mark or not. The essence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>wrong consists in the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor for those of another.\u201d Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Co., 179 U. S. 665, 21 Sup. Ct. 270, 45 L. Ed. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">[ 1 ] But the right to the exclusive use of a trade-mark is limited to a use on the particular class of goods upon which it has been actually used, and other persons may use even the identical mark or name in connection with a different class of goods. Goods are in the same class, within this rule, whenever the use of a given trade-mark, or name or symbol, would enable an unscrupulous dealer to palm off on unsuspecting customers spurious goods as being the genuine goods of the proprietor of the trade-mark. Church &amp; Dwight v. Russ (C. C.) 99 Fed. <em>276.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cActual or probable deception on the part of customers by reason of defendant\u2019s practices must appear. Of course there must be actual competition before there can be any unfair competition.\u201d 38 Cyc. 759.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Respondent itself says in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\u201cThis is not a technical trade-mark case; this is a case of unfair trade competition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">It requires a stretch of the imagination beyond the breaking point to conceive of a purchaser intending to buy one of plaintiff\u2019s motor cars being so deceived by defendants\u2019 use of this device as to buy one of its fire extinguishers instead. It is almost a trade classic for a clerk in a dry goods or druggist\u2019s shop, when out of a particular article asked for, to tender \u201csomething equally as good\u201d; but even the most expert seller of Yankee notions would scarcely venture to substitute a fire extinguisher for an automobile; There is no evidence to sustain the finding of fraud or deception of the public or diversion of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, upon the law and the facts, and the complaint dismissed for lack of equity, with costs to the appellant in this court and at the Special Term. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
