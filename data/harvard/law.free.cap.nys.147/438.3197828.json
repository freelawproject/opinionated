The evidence further shows that, prior to May 1st, the plaintiff entered into a lease of said premises with another lessee, to take effect May 1st, but that actual possession under said lease was not given to said lessee until May 10th.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">It is contended by the defendant appellant that the provision of the ninth clause of the lease did not constitute an actual renewal leasing of the premises, but merely provided the terms on which such a renewal might be made. It is clear, however, from the language of the ninth clause, that it did constitute a mutual agreement between landlord and tenant to renew the lease on the expiration of each year, unless notice should be given by either landlord or tenant, on or before January 1st of each pending year, of intention not to renew. It is also contended by the defendant appellant that the making of the lease with another lessee in April was, first, a waiver of notice of nonrenewal; second, a surrender and acceptance; and, third, that in any event it operated under the eighth clause of the lease to terminate the lease, and that whatever sum might become due thereafter would only be.for excess rent under the eighth clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>lease, which would not become due until the end of the month of May, and, as this action was commenced on May 2, 1913, it was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> I am of the opinion that neither of these contentions on the part of the appellant are sound. Had the new^ lessee gone into possession on May 1st, it doubtless would have operated as a termination of the lease to defendant on that date, and would have relieved it of the obligation to pay rent on May 1st; but, as neither the landlord nor the new lessee went into possession until May 10th, whatever obligation toward the new lessee the plaintiff may have assumed could not affect either defendant\u2019s right of possession or its obligation to pay on the 1st day of May the rent for the ensuing month. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In view of plaintiff\u2019s specific notice to defendant that it would not accept a surrender of the premises on April 30th, it is equally fallacious to claim that the making of a lease with another lessee prior to May 1st operated either as a surrender and acceptance or as a waiver of the time of giving notice, viz., before January 1, 1913. It was but a prudent effort, in the interest of defendant as well as of plaintiff, in view of defendant\u2019s announced determination to abandon the premises, for the landlord to use all reasonable diligence by the early letting of the premises, pursuant to the provision of the eighth clause of the lease, to minimize the amount of excess which defendant would be obliged to pay after abandonment of the premises. Defendant\u2019s obligation to pay rent accrued on the 1st day of May. It at that time had full right of possession; its offer of surrender had been rejected, and the placing of another tenant in possession on May 10th did not relieve it of its obligation to pay rent, but merely represented the basis of a counterclaim for such sum as was collected by plaintiff for the rent of said premises \u2022 from May 10th to May'31st, amounting to $90.40, which, sum, though not counterclaimed, has been allowed by plaintiff and deducted from the amount of the judgment in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The various exceptions taken to the admission or exclusion of evidence involve these same questions of law, and furnish no sufficient ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
