We see no reason why an end should not be put to this controversy. The agreement was that the attorney should receive 33% per cent, upon a settlement and 50 per cent, upon a judgment. The case was settled for $870.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">The order appealed from should therefore be modified by providing that the defendant\u2019s motion to discontinue be granted upon the payment to plaintiff\u2019s attorney Sigmund Rotter of $290, one-third of the amount of settlement, $10 costs of the motion below, $10 costs on this appeal, and the respondent\u2019s disbursements, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
