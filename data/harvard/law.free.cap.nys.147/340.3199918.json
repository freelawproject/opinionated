Defendant also testified to a conversation between himself and both members of the firm of Levine &amp; Ludwig, in which Ludwig, defendant\u2019s brother, told his partner, the plaintiff, that defendant had paid the check in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">Plaintiff testified that he knew nothing, about the loan or the check until about two years after its date, when, in' settling the firm\u2019s affairs and making an assignment to plaintiff of his interest in the firm\u2019s business, defendant\u2019s brother handed the check to him as part of the assets-; that he then deposited the check in his bank, and it was returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>unpaid. Plaintiff also testified that he knew of no other transactions whereby defendant became indebted to plaintiff\u2019s assignors.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">The defendant\u2019s testimony as to the payments was clear and explicit, and he produced the third party\u2019s check for $75, with indorsement thereon, showing that it had been deposited to the account of plaintiff\u2019s assignors and collected by them. Defendant also produced the stub of his check book used at the time, purporting to show a payment, some time after the making of the check in suit, of $100 by check to plaintiff\u2019s assignors. Defendant\u2019s brother is now in an insane asylum and cannot be called as a witness. Under the circumstances of the case, I am of the opinion that the judgment is clearly against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
