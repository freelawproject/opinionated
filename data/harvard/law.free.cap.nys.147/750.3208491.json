J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHEr\">Two men in defendant\u2019s employ were engaged in erecting forms for concrete construction. One of them was hurt through the carelessness of the other. The question is whether the defendant employer is liable to the injured man for such carelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahx7\">The careless man, who was acting as foreman, directed the plaintiff, who was a carpenter, to stand upon the top of a \u201ckey\u201d made of 12-inch boards nailed together in the form of a trough, some 8 or 10 feet long, which was standing upright leaning against the concrete forms, and assured him that he would hold the \u201ckey\u201d safely; but, through a lack of attention and care, he failed to do so, it fell, and the plaintiff- was precipitated to the ground and injured. The man through whose carelessness the accident resulted had been intrusted by the employer with authority to direct the injured man in doing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">Under the provisions of section 200 of the Labor Law, .as amended in 1910, an employer is made liable for personal injuries caused to an employ\u00e9 who is himself in the exercise of due care and diligence at the time, by reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer, intrusted with any superintendence, or by reason of the negligence of any person intrusted with authority to direct, control, or command any employ\u00e9 in the performance of the duty of such employ\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">The defendant contends that this provision covers negligent superintendence only. We think the liability of the defendant is not thus limited. We are of the opinion that under the amendment of 1910 the defendant is liable for the negligence of the foreman in failing to hold the \u201ckey\u201d firmly and securely. This view is supported by the decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>in Famborille v. A. G. &amp; P. Co., 155 App. Div. 833, 140 N. Y. Supp. 529, decided in the Third Department, and Svendsen v. Williams, 157 App. Div. 474, 142 N. Y. Supp. 606, decided in the Second Department ; and the learned counsel for appellant seems to so concede. The question has been very elaborately discussed in those decisions, and we deem it unnecessary to add anything to what is there said. It is sufficient to say that we agree with the reasoning of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\">We think the case was correctly submitted to the jury, and that the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except ROBSON, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
