It is not an unreasonable restraint of trade, because it did not appear that these parties controlled the supply, that the arranged price was excessive, or that any monopoly was thereby created. Neither was the agreement illegal, or against public policy, because the subject-matter was fixtures to be used by schools and public buildings, since it is not shown that there were not other competitors, or that the board of education or the city of New York had any cause to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> As to the terms and basis'for mutual payments between the contracting parties, the written agreement is clear and unambiguous, and the amounts and balance between the respective payments were set forth in the first cause of action. This left no proper basis for the erroneous computation alleged as the second cause of action. If the evidence showed an account stated, it was for the $683.90, for which sum plaintiff testified a bill had been rendered to the defendant about the middle of February, which statement had been retained without objection. This proof was inconsistent with any later \u201caccount stated\u201d by rendering a further bill for $841.40. The verdict, being based on the second cause of action, therefore, is unsupported by the pleadings or by the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">The judgment and order should therefore be reversed, and a new' trial granted, costs to abide the event, unless within 20 days the plaintiff stipulate that the verdict be reduced to $683.90, with interest on that sum from February 14, 1908, in which event the judgment, as so modified, and order, are affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
