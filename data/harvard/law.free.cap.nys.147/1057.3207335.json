Code Civil Procedure, \u00a7 3383; Matter of Low, 208 N. Y. 25, 101 N. E. 706; Matter of City of Buffalo, 189 N. Y. 163, 169, 81 N. E. 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-22\">The allegation of the petitioner, which is not controverted, is that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>contract for the operation of the road has been made, and the memorandum attached to the maps and plans meets with the requirements of section 39 of the Rapid Transit Act, and consequently there is no force to the objection that the petition does not show that a contract for the construction of the railroad had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> While section 6 of said act requires the Public Service Commission to prepare detailed plans and specifications for the construction of a rapid transit railroad in accordance with the general plan of construction, it is not necessary to allege the completed preparation of such plans, for the reason that the acquisition of title is not made contingent upon completed preparation. It appeared on the hearing that such plans were in process of preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The appellant contends that it was incumbent upon the petitioner to establish, upon the hearing, by a preponderance of evidence, that the land proposed to be acquired was absolutely necessary for public use, and that until it had so established such necessity commissioners could not legally be appointed. In this contention the appellant is in error. The use for which the property is to be acquired is the construction and operation of a rapid transit subway, which the Court of Appeals in Sun Publishing Ass\u2019n v. Mayor, 152 N. Y. 257, 46 N. E. 499, 37 L. R..A. 788, held to be a public use. The case comes within the rule that where the use to which the land is to be put is public, the Legislature or the instrumentality which it employs (in the case under consideration the Public Service Commission) is the sole judge of the necessity (In the Matter of William A. Fowler, 53 N. Y. 60, 62; Matter of Deansville Cemetery Ass\u2019n, 66 N. Y. 569, 23 Am. Rep. 86; People ex rel. Ithaca v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 11 App. Div. 280, 284, 42 N. Y. Supp. 1011, affirmed 159 N. Y. 545, 54 N. E. 1093; Matter of City of New York, 116 App. Div. 801, 102 N. Y. Supp. 116); consequently the question of whether the fee, or an easement in the property, should be taken is a legislative, and not a judicial question. And, the commissioners having determined that it is necessary to acquire the property in fee simple, we cannot review their determination. People v. Fisher, 116 App. Div. 677, 686, 101 N. Y. Supp. 1047, affirmed 190 N. Y. 468, 479, 83 N. E. 482. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">_ The order must be aErmed, with $10 costs-and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">JENKS, P.
