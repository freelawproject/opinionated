In support of this ruling the court cites as authority the opinion in Kalman v. Cox, 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Misc. Rep. 589, 92 N. Y. Supp. 816, where, in construing the meaning of the words \u201cor other grievances,\u201d the learned court held that <em>a </em>requirement for the construction of a fire escape did not come within the purview of such a clause, for the reason that the absence of a fire escape did not constitute a nuisance. It will be noted, however, that in the case at bar the language of the lease is different from that .in the lease in the case cited, and that the lease contains the additional language, \u201cor connected with said premises or the business of said tenant during said term;\u201d also, that the additional water-closet was necessary for use in connection with the business of the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">While there can be no doubt of the soundness of the general proposition that, \u201cwhen two or more words of analogous meaning are coupled together, they are understood to be .used in their cognate sense, express the sam\u00e9 relation, and give color and expression to each other\u201d. (Wakefield v. Fargo, 90 N. Y. 213, 218), it does not .follow that the term \u201cor other grievances,\u201d in the clause of the lease herein is limited in its application to the remedying of such conditions as would constitute nuisances. On the contrary, the word \u201cnuisances\u201d and the phrase \u201cor other grievances\u201d both relate to the same general purpose, viz., \u201cthe correction, prevention, and abatement of conditions in, upon, or connected with said premises, or the business of said tenant during said term, which are in violation of statutes, ordinances, rules, orders, regulations, and requirements of the federal, state, and city governments, and of any and all their officials, departments, and bureaus, applicable to said premises,\u201d or connected with said premises or the business of said tenant during said term, whether such violations of law constitute the maintenance of a nuisance or a misdemeanor. If it was contemplated by the parties that the clause \u201cor other grievances\u201d should relate only to nuisances, the adding of those words would be mere surplusage. Clearly they were intended to have some force and meaning in addition to what was covered by the use of the word \u201cnuisances,\u201d viz., such grievances other than nuisances as -are prohibited by law, as distinguished from grievances relating to conditions not prohibited by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Section 62, subd. 5, of the Labor Law (Consol. Laws, c. 31), gives the commissioner of labor power to enforce any municipal bylaw, ordinance, or regulation relating to factories which are not in conflict with the statute. Section 1275, subd. 3, of the Penal Law (Consol. Laws, c. 40), makes the violation of any such rule or regulation of the industrial board a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The duty of complying with such requirement is by provision of the statute placed upon the owner or a lessee of an entire building, with a further provision that the obligation resting upon such owner or lessee of an entire building shall remain, notwithstanding any provision in any lease to the contrary. It was, however, entirely competent, and was clearly, the intention of the parties to the lease herein, as between themselves, to enter into an agreement that the tenant should become obligated to the landlord to assume all expense of doing such things as the law imposed upon the landlord incident to the use of the rented premises for factory purposes as contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the lease. We are therefore of the opinion that the improvement installed by the landlord herein was such an improvement as, under the terms' of the lease, it became the duty of the tenant to make, and, in the event of his failure .to do so, he was obligated to reimburse the landlord for the expense incurred by him in complying with such requirement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and judgment directed, in favor of plaintiff for $142, with costs of appeal and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
