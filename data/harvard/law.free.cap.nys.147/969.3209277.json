Her testimony was in many respects contradictory, evasive, and incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\">Defendant testified absolutely that he never made any promise of marriage and never had sexual intercourse with plaintiff, and by his own testimony, corroborated by other credible evidence, convincingly proved that on the night of July 3, 1908, he was absent for the entire night from his parents\u2019 home, and on July 5, 1908, left New York City in the daytime for Ulster county, where he remained for a period of more than two weeks, thus entirely discrediting plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the sexual intercourse between herself and defendant at or about those dates. It also appears by uncontradicted evidence that, at the time plaintiff alleges defendant entered into the contract of marriage with her, his betrothal to another young woman had been formally announced, accompanied by.a social function at the home of defendant's parents, where plaintiff was employed, under circumstances which render plaintiff\u2019s denial that she had knowledge of such betrothal entirely incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">During the course of the trial the foreman of the jury displayed so much hostility toward defendant, and so frequently interrupted defendant\u2019s counsel with offensive remarks, that the court was obliged to remove him from the jury box, and the case was continued with 11 jurors with the acquiescence of defendant\u2019s counsel, though his formal consent, was not made matter of record. In the light of this occurrence, and of all the circumstances of the case, and especially in view of the evasive, contradictory, and incredible character of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, we are of the opinion that the verdict reached by the jury was the result of passion and prejudice, and, being entirely against the weight of evidence, should not be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"Aon\">There also appears to be a lack of proof as to defendant\u2019s refusal to perform the alleged contract of marriage; but, in the light of all the evidence in the case, we are not of the opinion that this deserves consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">It is-further urged by the defendant appellant that, plaintiff being under the age of consent, and there being no allegation or proof of the consent of her parents, she was incapable of entering into a binding contract of marriage with defendant, which could be enforced against her, and that the contract was void for lack of mutuality; also that, in the absence of allegation or proof that the consent of the parents had been obtained, a contract by defendant to marry an infant under age would be illegal, inasmuch as the performance of the contract on defendant\u2019s part would involve the commission of a felony. Penal Daw (Consol. Daws, c. 40) \u00a7 <em>70. </em>It is unnecessary to pass upon these points, in view of the fact that on the record presented the verdict is clearly against the overwhelming weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
