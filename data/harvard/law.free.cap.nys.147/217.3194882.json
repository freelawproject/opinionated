It appears that as early as Christmas, 1911, the complainant and defendant were engaged to be married, and that at some time they had sexual intercourse resulting in the complainant\u2019s pregnancy. The indictment charges that on or about July 9th the defendant seduced her \u201cby means of a promise of marriage.\u201d The complainant fixes the offense on the 9th day of July, 1911, at about 8 p. m., at her house, and denies intercourse at any other time. The difficulty is that the complainant is not only uncorroborated as to the time and place when the act was done, but the testimony of the witnesses Loeffler, Lemmo, and Mrs. Moser show that the complainant on that evening was in their company on a trolley ride. The complainant\u2019s mother testified to a conversation with the defendant, but did not make definite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the date of the occurrence to which her conversation with defendant refers, and the testimony of the other witnesses is not more helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\">This condition of the evidence requires a new trial, and this court expects that in the interests of justice it will be had promptly. While there was no exception, the court\u2019s charge at folio 364 seems to take from the jury a fact that it was its province to determine.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
