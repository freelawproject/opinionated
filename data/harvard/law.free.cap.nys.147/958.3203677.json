The sole question of law is whether the remainders constituted in the will of Peter D. Eyclesheimer are vested or contingent. The provision up for construction heads as\" follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-14\">\u201cI, Peter D. Eyclesheimer of Winter Haven Polk county and state of Florida, a farmer being of a sound mind, make this my last will. I give devise and bequeath my estate and property, real and personal that is or may be now or shall hereafter come to be mine before or after my death to my beloved wife Anna T. Eyclesheimer for her own use and benefit as long as she shall live after which time it shall be equally divided, share and share alike be- ' tween our two children Clarence M. Eyclesheimer and Mrs. C. F. Greenwood\u2014 n\u00e9e\u2014Hattie Eyclesheimer or their heirs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-15\">The testator was and always had been a farmer, of no legal education or experience, and personally drew the will without legal advice or experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-16\">We think that the remainders are vested. The expression \u201cor their heirs\u201d is to be construed with reference to the death of the testator. Moore v. Lyons, 25 Wend. 119; Connelly v. O\u2019Brien, 166 N. Y. 406, 60 N. E. 20; Hersee v.

Gwynne, 201 N. Y. 150, 94 N. E. 632; Miller v. Gilbert, 144 N. Y. 68, 38 N. E. 979. The defendant should be required to perform. Ebling v. Dreyer, 149 N. Y. 460, 44 N. E. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-17\">The judgment should be in favor of the plaintiff, without costs, in . accord with the terms of the submission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
