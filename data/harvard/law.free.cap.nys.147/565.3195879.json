After six months from this date the policy will be in force for the full amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">The policy was dated the 28th of October, 1912, and the deceased died in January, 1913. Under this policy, therefore, but one-half of the amount insured was payable. We agree with the Appellate Term in the construction of section 58 of the Insurance Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">The determination and judgment are therefore modified, by reducing the judgment accordingly, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
