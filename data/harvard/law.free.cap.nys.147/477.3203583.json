When this motion was originally submitted, the appellants made not the slightest attempt to comply with the.same. By direction of the court, the clerk called the attention of counsel to the rule and gave him .an opportunity to submit additional affidavits. In response thereto he has submitted an affidavit in which he states that in his opinion \u201cerror was -committed by the learned trial justice in the exclusion of evidence offered by defendant, and in' the charge to the jury.\u201d The affidavit contains no facts from which the court can determine what questions, either of law or fact, are involved, or whether the appeal is a meritorious one. Failure to comply with the rule after counsel\u2019s attention has been specially called to the same warrants but one conclusion, which is that the appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The motion to dismiss is therefore granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
