The learned court at Special Term held that the averments of subdivision 4 of the complaint (liberally construed with a view to substantial justice, as directed by section 519 of the Code) were \u201cequivalent to an allegation of a breach of the contract by defendant\u2019s testator to pay commissions,\u201d and that such averments, taken in connection with the allegation of subdivision 8 of the complaint that defendant rejected the claim filed by plaintiff, are \u201cequivalent to an allegation of nonpayment, both by defendants and their testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> The rule controlling the disposition of the question presented - is stated in Dickinson v. Tysen, 125 App. Div. 735, 740, 110 N. Y. Supp. 269, 273, which was an action to recover broker\u2019s commissions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-11\">\u201cThe Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 481, provides that a complaint must contain a plain and concise statement of the facts constituting the cause of action. Under this provision, whatever facts are essential to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to recover upon the trial must be set out in the complaint. Upon a contract for the payment of money, nonpayment is a fact which constitutes the breach of the contract and is the essence of the cause of action,, and being such, within the provision of the Code, that fact must be alleged in the complaint. It is suggested that, inasmuch as payment is always an affirmative defense which must be pleaded in order to be available, it necessarily follows that nonpayment need not be alleged. This does not follow.. The reason why nonpayment must be pleaded is clearly set forth in the opinion in Lent v. New York &amp; Massachusetts R. Co., 130 N. Y. 504, 29 N. E.. 988.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">The defendant\u2019s demurrer was sustained, although the inference of nonpayment was stronger upon the facts alleged than upon those alleged in the complaint in the case at bar. In the Lent Case referred to, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>complaint alleged an award to the plaintiff for real estate taken by the defendant railroad company by condemnation proceedings, and an order confirming the report of the commissioners and directing the payment of such award, an appeal therefrom and affirmance, followed by a prayer for judgment for the amount of the award. To this complaint the defendant demurred upon the ground, among others, that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court sustained the demurrer upon this ground, holding that no presumption of payment could be indulged in; that there was no allegation in the complaint that the defendant had failed or omitted to pay the award, and no allegation of indebtedness, without which no cause of action was stated. This case was cited and adopted in Posner v. Rosenberg, No. 2., 149 App. Div. 272, 277, 133 N. Y. Supp. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Subdivision 4 of the complaint alleges that the defendant refused to make the exchange of property which plaintiff had arranged, or \u201ccomply with the terms of the memoranda aforesaid, although requested so to do by the plaintiff, and although the owners of said premises * * * were ready, able, and willing to make said exchange.\u201d The memoranda referred to states the terms of a proposed and authorized exchange of property, \u201cwith the further understanding that the commission to you on my property will be at the rate of one and a half (1 %$) per cent, on the purchase or sale price.\u201d There is nothing in the memoranda providing for the payment of commission, so that the alleged failure to comply \u201cwith the terms of the memoranda aforesaid\u201d is not an allegation of, or equivalent to an allegation of, nonpayment of the commission the plaintiff seeks to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The other allegation upon which the learned Special Term rested his conclusion that nonpayment was sufficiently alleged is contained in the eighth subdivision of the complaint, and is that the plaintiff served \u201ca notice of the within described claim\u201d upon the executrix, and that she unreasonably rejected the same. There is no claim alleged or described in the complaint to which the reference \u201cwithin described claim\u201d applies, and the allegation is not the equivalent of an averment of nonpayment. Plaintiff\u2019s claim, although rejected, may have been paid, after such rejection. There is nowhere in the complaint an allegation that defendant or her testator was or is indebted to plaintiff, or that the alleged earned commission of $1,500 had not been fully paid, without which, under the authorities cited, no cause of action is stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and judgment directed for the defendant on the pleadings, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
