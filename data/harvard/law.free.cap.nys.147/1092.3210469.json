Either the relator, or the witnesses testifying against him, committed perjury in giving their testimony upon the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The rule which in my judgment applies to the disposition of this writ, is stated in People ex rel. Hogan v. French, 119 N. Y. 493, 23 N. E. 1058, and is that where there is any evidence of the offense charged, or the facts admit any inference of guilt, the courts should follow the conclusion of the commissioner, in view of his peculiar responsibilities and his greater opportunity of arriving accurately at the truth. The evidence in the case at bar is sufficient to sustain a finding for or against the relator as the evidence for or against him is believed and determined to be the truth.of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-11\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> While the punishment inflicted seems to be very harsh and unnecessarily severe, in view of the fact that the person whom the relat- or is charged with not having arrested went voluntarily to the police station, where he was arrested, tried, convicted, and punished, as I understand the law the extent of punishment rested entirely in the discretion of the commissioner, and this court has no jurisdiction to interfere therewith. People ex rel. McAleer v. French, 119 N. Y. 502, 507, 23 N. E. 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-12\">Because of the severity of the punishment inflicted and the character of the witnesses testifying for the prosecution, I have made a careful study of the record to see if a conclusion that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence could not be sustained. If nothing appeared challenging the veracity of the relator, o.r warranting the commissioner or his trial deputy in discrediting his testimony, I should feel inclined to recommend a reversal and reinstatement upon this ground, but it is the undisputed fact, admitted by him when testifying upon the hearing (while he had sworn that on Sunday morning, May 21, 1911, preceding the arrest, he went to Horay\u2019s house, presumably for the purpose of arresting him, and was informed by Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>Horay that her husband had gone to the station house, where he testified he followed and arrested him), that he did not in his testimony at the General Sessions, or in his statement made to a deputy police commissioner investigating the matter, make any mention of his having made such a visit, in addition to which he told the deputy, who was endeavoring to learn the facts, that he knew nothing of the case; that another officer (O\u2019Brien) had it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">I recommend that the determination of the commissioner be confirmed and the writ quashed, without costs in this court to either party as against the other. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
