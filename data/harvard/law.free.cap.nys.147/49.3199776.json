It is familiar law that the first complaint was superseded by the amended complaint. The right to the injunctive relief asked for in this case must appear by the complaint, and cannot be established by affidavits. Goldman v. Corn, 111 App. Div. 674, 97 N. Y. Supp. 926; Loewenstein v. Loewenstein, 114 App. Div. 65, 99 N. Y. Supp. 730; Sanders v. Ader, 26 App. Div. 176, 49 N. Y. Supp. 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The elimination of the original complaint by demurrer was in effect a final decision that the plaintiff, so far as that pleading is concerned, was not entitled to the preliminary injunction. Williams v. Montgomery, 148 N. Y. 521-524, 43 N; E. 57; Joyce on Injunctions, \u00a7 330, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Therefore the motion to dismiss the appeal must be granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
