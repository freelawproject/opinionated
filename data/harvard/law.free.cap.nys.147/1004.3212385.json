Ninety-Nine Plaintiffs v. Vanderbilt, 4 Duer, 632; Post v. Scheider, 13 N. Y. Supp. 396;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Matter of Malcom, 129 App. Div. 226, 113 N. Y. Supp. 666. Not only is the address necessary for personal service of court orders, but plaintiff\u2019s residence may require\u2019 him to give security for costs (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3268), fixes the county of trial (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 984, 985), and, in certain actions against a foreign corporation, may be determinative of the court\u2019s jurisdiction (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1780).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-18\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The professional privilege of the attorney cannot avail against giving the address of his client. Matter of Trainor, 146 App. Div. 117, 119, 130 N. Y. Supp. 682. The plaintiff relies on Drake v. New York Iron Mine, 75 Hun, 539, 27 N. Y. Supp. 489 (1894). An examination of the original record reveals that the ulterior purpose, which defendant did not deny, was to remove the cause into the federal court. Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s attorney in that case did offer to furnish his client\u2019s address. Again defendant had not, as here, a judicial order, which he had been unable to serve on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Good faith towards an insurer requires the insured, when asked, to give his residence. The standard form of policy of this state pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>vides for full discovery. Thereby the assured is to submit to examination on oath, and to produce his books and papers. Hence, in a suit on the policy, such a request for the assured\u2019s address is quite in keeping with the contract obligations. No ulterior or sinister motive is thereby indicated. Defendant seeks what it is entitled to as a litigant, and what it contracted for in its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"ASh\"> Reported in iull in the New York Supplement; reported as a memorandum decision without opinion in 69 Hun, 619.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
