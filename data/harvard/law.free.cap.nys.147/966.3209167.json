But the only testimony which indicates the nature of the assault made upon him is that the defendant struck Sheridan in the ear. Concededly, there was no weapon in the defendant\u2019s hand at the time. There is an absence of any proof that the complainant was wounded in any way; or that blood was caused to flow;' or that the skin was broken; or that any injury whatever was caused to him thereby; or that severe pain was inflicted; or even that the blow itself was a severe one. The defendant has been convicted of assault in the second degree under subdivision 3, \u00a7 242, of the Penal Law, which renders liable for assault in the second degree one who \u201cwillfully and wrongfully wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon another, either with or without a weapon.\u201d While the defendant was proven guilty of an assault, the testimony fails to disclose the presence of the necessary element of wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm. It was therefore an assault in the third degree only, and the defendant\u2019s conviction of the higher grade of crime cannot be sustained. Against the conclusion thus reached, the district attorney has found himself unable to present any argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The judgment of conviction will therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
