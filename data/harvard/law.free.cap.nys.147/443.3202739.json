On the 1st day of December, 1913, an action was commenced by the plaintiff in the Municipal Court to recover the contract value of the goods delivered up to and inclusive of August 26, 1913, as shown upon the account rendered December 2, 1913, totaling $797.75, upon which was credited the $100 paid September 10th, and $275 paid October 16th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>leaving a total demand for judgment of $422.75. In that action judgment was taken against the defendants by default and inquest on December 22, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The present action is brought to recover the balance of the aforesaid account not included in the former action. The defendants-claimed at the trial that the facts showed an open and running account between them and the plaintiff, all of which was due at the time the formier action was brought, and relied upon the familiar rule of law that judgment in an action for recovery of a part of such an account, brought when the whole account is due, is a bar to a subsequent action f'or the balance of the account. The plaintiff does not question the rule of law relied upon by the defendants, but claims that the goods-for which recovery is sought were delivered under separate and distinct contracts, and the items thereof were not part of an open and running account, so as to form an indivisible cause of action. Secor v. Sturgis, 16 N. Y. 548; Zimmerman v. Erhard, 83 N. Y. 74, 38 Am. Rep. 396. The learned trial justice granted judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">I am of the opinion that this was error. The entire case depended upon whether or not the facts disclosed an open and running account. It appears that the plaintiff\u2019s salesman called upon the defendants before the account was started and arranged to sell goods to them upon stated terms, and thereafter as the defendants needed merchandise they ordered same day by day without further express contract. On August 15th a large order was placed with the plaintiff, of which a part was delivered at various times prior to August 30th, and was-included in the former action, and a part was delivered subsequently, and forms a portion of the present demand. Payments made on account from time to time did not correspond in amount with any particular items of merchandise sold, and were credited generally against the entire bill. These facts clearly showed an open and running account between the parties, which could not be split up and sued upon in instalments. The former action was therefore a bar to -this action. Lennon Co. v. N. Y. Mail Co., 81 Misc. Rep. 251, 142 N. Y. Supp. 483, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint, dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
