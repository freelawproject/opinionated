In September, 1911, an accident, concededly covered by the terms of the policy, occurred in plaintiff\u2019s plant. Because of this accident William Robinson, Joseph Maloy, and Charles Davis, who were at the time employ\u00e9s of the plaintiff, were seriously injured. By plaintiff\u2019s direction they were at once taken to Dr. Lee\u2019s hospital for surgical treatment and attention. At plaintiff\u2019s request Drs. Lee and Baker, two qualified and experienced surgeons, were at once summoned to give the requisite surgical aid and attendance. An examination disclosed that Robinson\u2019s skull was badly fractured, and that- he'had been otherwise seriously injured. It was apparent that Robinson\u2019s life depended on an immediate operation for the injury to his skull, which was at once successfully performed by Dr. Lee. Robinson\u2019s other injuries, as well as those of his fellow sufferers, required prompt surgical care and attention, which was given by Dr. Baker. Thereafter Robinson began an action against plaintiff for his injuries. The defendant in this action thereupon assumed the defense of that action and employed counsel for that purpose. The defense was unsuccessful, and a verdict for $2,500 damages was recovered. Judgment for the damages and costs was duly entered. The defendant in\" this action thereafter by the attorneys so employed by it caused an appeal from that judgment to be taken, which is still pending and undetermined, but failed to give any bond or undertaking to stay,-, pending the appeal, execution upon the judgment. A few days after the appeal was taken, execution on the judgment was. duly issued; and, a levy .'thereunder upon plaintiff\u2019s property having been made, plaintiff to prevent the sale of its property was forced to and did pay the amount of that judgment, together with the poundage and sheriff\u2019s fees and other necessary expenses under said execution. Separate actions were also brought against this plaintiff by the two surgeons, Drs. Lee and Baker, to recover for their services rendered at plaintiff\u2019s request to the injured employ\u00e9s. Notice of these actions, as required by the policy of insurance, was given by the plaintiff .to- the defendant in this action; but it failed and neglected to assume the defense of the actions, and judgment in each of them was recovered against this plaintiff. Executions were duly issued thereon, and plaintiff was compelled to and did pay the amount thereof. In this action plaintiff has recovered against this defendant the amount it has paid to satisfy the three executions above referred to. It further appears that no part of the services for which the two physicians recovered their several judgments was included in the recovery obtained by Robinson in his action against this plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The defendant urges upon this appe\u00e1l that plaintiff\u2019s judgment .is erroneous, for two principal reasons, viz.: First. That so far as recovery is sought by reason of the payment on the execution on the Robinson judgment the action, is premature. Second. That the services, for, which, recoveries were had in the actions brought by the two surgeons, were not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiff provided that .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>\u201cIn consideration of the warranties herein and of thirty-three 00/100 dollars ($33.00) premium the Pacific Coast Casualty Company of San Francisco, California, hereinafter called the company, hereby insures E. M. Upton Cold Storage Company, of the county of---state of New York, hereinafter called the assured, against loss and expense arising from claims upon the assured for damages on account of bodily injuries accidently (sic) suffered or alleged to have been suffered during the period of this policy by any person by reason of the operations of the elevator described herein or by reason of the existence of the elevator wells, hoistways, or equipment thereof. This insurance is subject to the following conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Then follows a statement of the provisions thus designated as conditions under separate headings and in separate paragraphs, which are designated by the letters A to J, inclusive. These conditions, so far as material to the present inquiry, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">\u201cReporting Claims. If a claim is made, on account of an accident the assured shall give like notice thereof; and the company, at its own expense will settle or contest the same. Reporting Suits. If a suit is brought on account of an accident the assured shall forward immediately to the company or to its duly authorized agent, every process or paper served upon him. The company at its own expense will settle or defend said suit whether groundless or not; the moneys expended in said defense shall not be included in the limits of the liability fixed under this policy. The assured shall not assume any liability, nor interfere with any negotiation for settlement or any legal proceeding, nor incur any expense nor settle any claim except at his own cost, without the written consent of the company. Co-operation of Assured. C. The assured shall render to the Company at all times all co-operation and assistance in his power. * * * Right of Recovery. I. No action shall lie against the company for any loss or expense under this policy unless it shall be brought for loss or expense actually sustained and paid in satisfaction of a final judgment within ninety days from the date of said judgment and after trial of the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">This policy in terms provides that defendant will insure plaintiff against \u201closs and expense arising from claims upon\u201d it for damages suffered or alleged to have been suffered by reason of the operation \u00f3r existence of the elevators and hoistways described in the policy. It, however, could not be required to pay to plaintiff such \u201closs or expense\u201d except upon the latter\u2019s compliance with the conditions set out in the policy as fairly interpreted. As provided by condition \u201cI,\u201d above quoted, no action by plaintiff against defendant for the recovery under the policy of any loss or expense shall lie, \u201cunless it shall be brought for loss or expense actually sustained and paid in satisfaction of a final judgment,\u201d etc. Therefore appellant insists that, as an appeal in the Robinson action is still pending and undetermined, the amount of plaintiff\u2019s \u201closs and expense\u201d by reason of the action on his claim has not within the policy provisions been determined by final judgment. From which it would follow that the cause of action so far as that claim is concerned had not yet matured. But this provision of the policy in its present application should be read in connection with its other provisions and in view of the facts disclosed as to what the parties actually did in the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s defense to that action. Defendant, as was its right under the policy, assumed the entire management and control of plaintiff\u2019s defense to that action. Having'done this, plaintiff was, as the policy further provides, precluded from in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>terfering \"with any negotiation for settlement or any legal proceeding \u25a0* * * without the written consent of\u201d this defendant. \u201cFrom that moment,\u201d to use the language of Werner, J., in Brassil v. Maryland Casualty Company, 210 N. Y. 235, 104 N. E. 622, \u201cthe plaintiff was no longer a free agent. By the express provisions of his contract he was denied the right to settle on his own account or to assume charge of the litigation.\u201d But, having exercised its right to conduct plaintiff\u2019s defense to the action, defendant\u2019s correlative duty was that it should be so conducted that whatever loss or expense, to which plaintiff might be subjected in the action within the limited amount of the policy, should be made good to it. Owing to the fact that defendant neglected, when it took the appeal from the judgment in that action, to furnish the security required to stay execution thereon, plaintiff was left exposed by defendant\u2019s omission in conducting its appeal to the hazard of \u201closs and expense\u201d to it, if execution were issued on the judgment. The loss and expense became an actuality when plaintiff was compelled to pay the judgment after the issue of the execution and levy thereunder. When the levy under the execution was dischargd by plaintiff, the judgment then was final within the meaning of the policy, because it had finally resulted in loss and expense to the plaintiff which its- policy covered. Defendant agreed in terms, as stated in the policy, that on receiving notice of claim on account of an accident covered by the policy it would at its own expense settle or contest the same. It would seem to follow necessarily that this agreement is broken, if plaintiff was compelled to pay the judgment recovered on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Plaintiff is also entitled to recover the amounts it was compelled to pay in satisfaction of the executions issued on the judgments recovered by the surgeons. Plaintiff was required by the terms of the \u25a0policy to render to the defendant company at all times all co-operation and assistance in its power. Discarding from our consideration all promptings of humanity, which may reasonably have been within the contemplation of the parties in-making the agreement, it would seem that the language of the policy above referred to expressed the intention of the parties that plaintiff agreed, in the event of an accident covered by the policy, to render such immediate assistance to the persons \u25a0injured thereby as might reasonably be required to minimize the resultant damages, which defendant might ultimately be liable to pay. A considerable part of the surgeons\u2019 claims was for surgical attention given to Robinson. The necessity for such services was immediate -and imperative, if his life was to be saved. In such case the plaintiff was fairly required by its agreement to secure the proper surgical treatment. Having done this, th\u00e9 expense it had\u2019 thus incurred is fairly within the loss and expense covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">It is claimed by appellant, however, that- the policy expressly prohibited plaintiff from assuming any liability or incurring any expense except at its own cost without defendant\u2019s written consent. This prohibition appears in the paragraph of the policy entitled \u201cReporting Suits,\u201d and is manifestly a part of, and by its context limited to the procedure, rights, and powers of the parties after suit had' been .brought. It does not, therefore, operate to restrict the plaintiff\u2019s dbli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>gation to render to defendant \u201cat all times all co-operation and assistance in its power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In each of the actions brought by the surgeons, plaintiff, pursuant to the terms of the policy, as soon as the summons and complaint therein were served, duly notified the defendant of the claim and forwarded to it such summons and complaint, and in each instance demanded that defendant defend the same or settle the claim; but in each case it refused to appear and defend, or to settle the claim. These claims, or some part thereof at least, were, as we have sought to show, expenses arising from claims upon plaintiff for damages on account of bodily injuries accidentally suffered within the intent and meaning of the policy. Suits having been brought thereon and defendant duly apprised of the fact, as the policy required, it was then obliged either to settle or defend the suits, as the policy expresses it, \u201cwhether groundless or not.\u201d It neither settled nor defended the suits, and plaintiff was forced to pay the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">It follows that plaintiff was entitled to recover the amounts it was compelled to pay to satisfy them.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
