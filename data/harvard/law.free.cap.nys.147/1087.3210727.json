This son was pursuing his studies as a law student, and lived with his father as a member of his family. The automobile was a pleasure vehicle kept by defendant for the use of himself and his family. His son was privileged to use it for his individual purposes, whenever he so desired. It was customary, also, for the son to act as chauffeur of the car when it was used by defendant or other members of the family. On the occasion of the accident, the son had taken the car out for a pleasure drive, accompanied by several of his friends. Neither defendant nor any other member of his family, except his son, was in the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">It is evident from these facts that when the accident happened the -car was neither expressly nor constructively in the use or service of the defendant, and that in driving the car the son was in no way acting as the defendant\u2019s agent. Under these, circumstances, we hold that defendant is not liable for his son\u2019s negligent operation of the car. The principle involved has been applied in so many cases that the citation of but a few will suffice. Tanzer v. Read, 160 App. Div. 584, 145 N. Y. Supp. 708; Friedbaum v. Brady, 143 App. Div. 220, 128 N. Y. Supp. 121; Cunningham v. Castle, 127 App. Div. 580, 111 N. Y. Supp. 1057; Maher v. Benedict, 123 App. Div. 579, 108 N. Y. Supp. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
