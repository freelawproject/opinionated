The plaintiff took possession of the premises on December 28, 1912, notifying defendant that it did so for the purpose of placing them in complete repair. At the time of the fire the lease had four months and five days to run-. The plaintiff finally tendered the premises to defendant as being in complete repair on - February 28, 1913. The defendant rejected the tender, on the ground that the premises had not been put in complete repair* and on the trial contended that in retaining the building for two months and five days for the making of repairs the plaintiff had failed to comply with its covenant to make such repair \u201cas speedily as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">On the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence the lease annexed to defendant\u2019s. answer and rested. Defendant moved to dismiss, on the ground that plaintiff had failed to show the condition precedent to the recovery of rent, that the premises had been restored and put in complete repair. This motion was denied, and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Defendant also excepted to that portion of the charge to the jury where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">\u201cIn your deliberations, the first thing you must do, when you reach the jury room, is to determine whether the defendant or its subagents were guilty of negligence or carelessness or improper conduct in connection with the fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Under the lease, the burden of. establishing such negligence wa\u2019s upon the. landlord, and, in the absence of proof of negligence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>part of the defendant, its agents or servants, the court erred in submitting this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">\u201cNegligence, being a wrong, will not be presumed, but must be proved by the party charging it.\u201d Lamb v. Camden &amp; Amboy R. R. &amp; T. Co., 46 N. Y. 271, 7 Am. Rep. 327; Burke v. Erie R. R. Co., 134 App. Div. 413, 119 N. Y. Supp. 309; Platt v. Richmond, etc., R. Co., 108 N. Y. 362, 15 N. E. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The learned court also erred.in refusing to charge the several requests presented by defendant\u2019s counsel on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant was also entitled to have the following specific requests charged as presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cTwelfth. That the burden is cast by law upon the plaintiff to prove by a reasonable preponderance of evidence that the premises were put in complete repair, and were in complete repair on the 1st day of March, 1913 (the date when they were tendered to defendant), and if the jury find that the premises had not been put in complete repair by March 1, 1913, the verdict must be for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201cThirteenth. That the burden is cast by law upon the plaintiff to prove that the repairs, if completed, were made as speedily as possible; that it appears by the uncontradicted testimony of the witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff that the fire occurred on December 26, 1912, and that the work of repairing was not commenced until January 10, 1913, some 15 days thereafter; and that if in the judgment of the jury 15 days was an unreasonable delay, the plaintiff failed to perform the provisions of the lease, -and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">See Bacon v. Albany Perf. Wrap\u2019g Paper Co., 22 Misc. Rep. 592, 49 N. Y. Supp. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The refusal to charge each of these requests constituted prejudicial error. The evidence establishes clearly that plaintiff did not, as required by the provisions of the lease, put the building either in complete repair or even in substantially the same condition as b\u00e9fore the fire, and that after the suspension of the rent by reason of the fire putting the building in untenantable condition, no obligation to pay rent has been established under the provisions of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs, and the corm plaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
