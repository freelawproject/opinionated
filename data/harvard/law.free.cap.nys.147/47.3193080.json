See Corn v. Heymsfeld, 75 Misc. Rep. 478, 133 N. Y. Supp. 447. We have frequently had occasion to point out that the jurisdiction of this court to review the judgment and orders of the Municipal Court is wholly statutory, and, where the order appealed from is not one of those enu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>merated in section 257 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580), the appeal must be dismissed. It is quite clear that the order now under consideration is not one of the orders enumerated in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"ADo3\">It is urged that Corn v. Heymsfeld, supra, is authority for the view that an appeal does lie from an order made under section 723 of the Code. In that case, however, the appeal was taken from the judgment and order, and an appeal from a judgment brings up for review an inremediate order which is' specified in the notice of appeal, and necessarily affects the judgment. Section 310 of the Municipal Court Act. The decision in that case provides for the affirmance of the judgment, though the only point considered was the validity of the order which necessarily affected the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">It follows that the appeal should be dismissed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
