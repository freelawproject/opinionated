The purchase money was payable in installments at the rate of $8 per month. The sale took place in December, 1912. In May, 1913, defendant moved to Philadelphia, and plaintiffs, finding the piano in the possession of a stranger, with only $38 of the purchase price paid, took it into their custody. Plaintiffs claim to hold the piano as trustee for the defendant. The security clause in the mortgage authorized the mortgagees, in the event of any default, or of the property coming into the possession of any third person, to take and carry away the chattel, sell and dispose of it at public or private sale, with' or without notice, and render any overplus to the mortgagor, who covenanted to pay any deficiency. On July 17, 1913, plaintiffs notified defendant that the piano which he deserted had been placed in storage for his account under the security clause of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The trial justice dismissed the complaint, holding that the chattel mortgage did not authorize plaintiffs to take the piano, store it for defendant\u2019s account, and then sue him for the entire unpaid balance of the purchase price; that defendant\u2019s failure to answer plaintiffs\u2019 letter, notifying him what they were going to do, was not an assent to a modification of the chattel mortgage; and that defendant\u2019s only liability was for the deficiency, if any, on a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The action, not being upon a contract of conditional sale where title is only to vest upon full payment, but being one to recover installments due, is maintainable.
