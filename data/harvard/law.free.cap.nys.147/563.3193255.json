J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATa\">The respondent was charged by the Association of the Bar with having received various small sums of money in settlement of claims placed in his hands and having appropriated the money to his own uses. In one case he gave to his client a check for the amount due, which check was returned by the bank upon which it was drawn on the ground that the drawer\u2019s account was not good for the amount. In other cases it appeared that the respondent had failed for a considerable time to account to his clients for money which he had received for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">The official referee has reported that these accounts had been made good by the attorney before this proceeding was commenced, and that the misconduct which was proved was caused by the youth and inexperience of the respondent. The evidence seems to justify a finding that the money belonging to his clients was appropriated to his own uses, and, while he subsequently made it good, that is really no excuse for the appropriation of his clients\u2019 money by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">The respondent should be censured for this breach of trust. The money was not his, but belonged to his clients, and it was a breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>trust for the respondent to use it. It was his duty to hold it as a strictly trust fund as his clients\u2019 money, and for that the court must hold him guilty of professional misconduct for which he is censured. But, in view of the finding of the official referee, the court will impose no further discipline. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
