In such an action it is necessary that plaintiff should allege performance on its part. This it might do either by alleging in detail what .it had done under the contract, or by adopting the more convenient method, authorized by section 533, Code of Civil Procedure, of alleging that it had \u201cduly\u201d performed all the conditions of the contract on its part. In the present case the plaintiff has adopted neither method of pleading performance, but has alleged that it did \u201cactually\u201d perform and carry out\"all of the terms, covenants, and conditions in said agreement contained on its part. This is not equivalent to an allegation that it \u201cduly\u201d performed. Feuerstein v. German Union Fire Ins. Co., 141 App. Div. 456, 126 N. Y. Supp. 201; Rosenthal v. Rubin, 148 App. Div. 44, 132 N. Y. Supp. 1053. The complaint, therefore, contains no sufficient allegation of the performance on plaintiff\u2019s part, and consequently fails to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend its complaint within 20 days upon payment of such costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
