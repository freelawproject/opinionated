The judgment was for plaintiff, and, from the judgment and an order denying a motion fi&gt; set aside the verdict and for a new trial, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">Such an action cannot be maintained. A receiver in supplementary proceedings takes title to the personal property of the judgment debtor as of the time of filing the order appointing him. Section 2468 of the Code of Civil Procedure. By virtue of plaintiff\u2019s appointment, he obtained no greater or other title tha\u00f1 the judgment debtor then had. But the chattel mortgage was valid as against the mortgagor and void only as to creditors. It follows that no title to the chattels passed to the receiver from the judgment debtor, who was the mortgagor, for as against him the mortgage was good. As the defendant took the chattels under a mortgage valid as to the mortgagor, the mortgagor could not maintain an action for conversion, nor could a receiver derive a right to maintain such action from a judgment debtor who did not possess it.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">A fraudulent chattel mortgage is void as against creditors of the mortgagor (section 35, Personal Property Law), and a receiver in supplementary proceedings, in addition to the property of the judgment debtor, takes such rights as the creditor at whose suit he was appointed has. As to such creditor, chattels fraudulently conveyed still remain the property of the judgment debtor; but a judgment creditor has no title to the property of the judgment debtor. He has a right only to the satisfaction of his judgment from such property, which he may secure by execution. If therefore the mortgage is void as to the creditor, his only remedy is in his execution, or he may appeal to a court of equity to clear away the obstruction of fraudulent conveyances. A judgment creditor cannot sue for conversion of the property of a judgment debtor, neither can he confer that right on a receiver in supplementary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>As the receiver does not obtain the right to maintain such action from either the judgment creditor or judgment debtor, no more is it conferred on him by chapter 314 of the Laws of 1858, now section 19 of the Personal Property Law. The word \u201creceiver\u201d in that law does not include a receiver in supplementary proceedings. Under the doctrine noscitur a sociis, the \u201creceivers\u201d mentioned in that act are those who represent not only the judgment debtor, but all creditors sharing equally; but a receiver in supplementary proceedings represents only the judgment debtor and the creditor at whose suit he is appointed. He does not represent other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Tire conclusion is that a receiver in supplementary proceedings cannot maintain an action for the conversion of chattels conveyed by the judgment debtor to the defendant with intent to defraud his creditors. Stephens v. Meriden Britannia Co., 160 N. Y. 178, 54 N. E. 781, 73 Am. St. Rep. 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the complaint dismissed on the merits, with appropriate costs in the court below and costs of the appeal to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
