The Special Term dismissed the plaintiff and the defendant on its counterclaim. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">\u25a0We think that the judgment should be affirmed as to the plaintiff, and should he reversed as to the defendant. The opinion of the learned Special Term shows that the disposition of the defendant was made upon the ground that it \u201ctook over the job,\u201d but \u201cfinished the work more expensively than called for by the specifications.\u201d We think that the evidence did not justify this conclusion. The defendant gave proof sufficient to establish a prima facie case on the counterclaim, and such case was not affected by any proof adduced by the plaintiff. There is no presumption that the contract price was sufficient to meet the cost of completion by the defendant. Brainard v. County of Kings, 155 N. Y. 538, 50 N. E. 263. And the proper inquiry is: What was the amount actually expended in the necessary completion of the contract? Martin v. Flahive, 112 App. Div. 347, 98 N. Y. Supp. 577; Zimmermann v. Jourgensen, 14 N. Y. Supp. 548.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The court probably checked the defendant in the full development of its case on the counterclaim by a ruling in its favor which was not excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs, as to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and reversed as to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and a new trial granted upon that issue; costs to abide the final award of costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"ApdC\"> Reported in full in the New York Supplement; reported as a memorandum decision without opinion in 60 Hun, 578.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
