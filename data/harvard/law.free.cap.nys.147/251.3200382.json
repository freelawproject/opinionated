The plaintiff has recovered a judgment, from which the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">This is the second judgment which the plaintiff has recovered and the second appeal to this court. The facts are stated with sufficient fullness in the opinion rendered on the former appeal. 145 App. Div. 294, 129 N. Y. Supp. 1070. In that opinion we intimated very plainly that plaintiff had failed, as we considered, to prove the cause of action which it had alleged. We also found error in the admission of evidence, which in any event would have necessitated a reversal of the judgment. Those errors were avoided on the second trial, but the evidence as to the facts is substantially unchanged, except that the evidence of one Steigerwald, who was present at the interview at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>it is said that the'false representations were made, and who did not testify at the former trial, was produced at this. It certainly adds no strength to the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\">Unlike many actions for false representations, there is no question in this case as to the representations that were actually made, for they were reduced to writing, and that writing was introduced in evidence. Notwithstanding the industry and intense earnestness of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, he has failed to point out one single item contained in the written statement which was false at the time it was made. Among the statements was one to the effect that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">\u201cThe New York Car &amp; Truck Company, at the close of its first fiscal year July 31, 1907, showed about $30,000 surplus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">That statement was true, because the books of the company did show a surplus of very nearly the amount stated. It is true that it after-wards developed that the assets of the company had been overvalued, but it does not appear that any one of the appellants knew that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Finding it impossible to sustain the charge that any one of the appellants made any false statement, the respondent falls back upon the argument that they were guilty of a suppression of the truth, because they did not tell plaintiff\u2019s representative other facts than those which were imparted to him. The difficulty with this contention is that it does not appear that there were any other facts, known to appellants, which contradicted the written statement, or which would have been of any consequence, if mentioned. Upon the evidence as it stood at the close of the case the appellants were entitled to a dismissal of the complaint, for which they duly moved.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The case has now been twice tried, and every person present when the alleged deceit was practiced has been examined. Upon neither trial has the plaintiff produced evidence to justify a submission of the case to the jury. It is not suggested that plaintiff is in possession of or can present any other evidence than it has already produced. Under these circumstances it is our duty, not only to reverse the judgment and order appealed from, but to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">It is ordered accordingly, with costs to the appellants in all courts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
