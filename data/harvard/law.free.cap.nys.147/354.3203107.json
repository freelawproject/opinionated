It seems to me that this dismissal of the complaint, was clearly erroneous. The complaint alleges a deposit as \u201csecurity,\u201d and the defendant has no right to withhold the sum deposited, after the lease has been terminated, unless he proves damages to the amount of the security. The plaintiff obviously cannot prove, even if he had alleged, that he complied with the covenants and conditions of the lease, because concededly the plaintiff has not paid the rent. If we hold that the plaintiff is required to allege and prove compliance with the terms of the lease, the effect of such a decision would be to prevent the plaintiff from recovering if he has breached the lease in any respect, thus in effect making a deposit given only as security liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">SEABURY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b393-4\">BIJUR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE2\">I dissent. The mere fact that the plaintiff, by depositing with the defendant security for the performance of certain acts by the plaintiff, has put himself in such position that he cannot recover his deposit without proving performance of the acts secured, is no reason why he should be relieved from either pleading or proving such performance. If he has not performed, and the damage is capable of liquidation, an appropriate allegation will enable him to recover the balance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
