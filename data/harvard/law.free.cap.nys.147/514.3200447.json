J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkK\">The defendants demurred on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and gained the interlocutory judgment from which the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"A7b\">The plaintiff complains that he is lessee of a theater building in a village, that the defendants are tenants of an adjoining building, that for the past several months the defendants frequently and almost daily, while in their apartments, or on the street in front of the same, and during the evening and afternoon performances at plaintiff\u2019s theater,, have indulged in loud and profane swearing and vile and obscene talk-; that such profane swearing and obscene language could at times be clearly heard in plaintiff\u2019s theater by plaintiff, his family and employ\u00e9s and patrons of his theater; that such conduct on the part' of said defendants causes an injury to plaintiff\u2019s business in the conduct of his said theater, and that it materially impairs plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment of his premises as aforesaid. Wherefore he asks a perpetual injunction against the defendants from using any profane or obscene language or profane swearing while in or about their premises aforesaid, loud enough for plaintiff or any member of his family or employ\u00e9 or patron of his theater to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> I think that the complaint is good within the general rule stated in Cranford v. Tyrrell, 128 N. Y. 341, 28 N. E. 514, cited and approved in Re Debs, Petitioner, 158 U. S. 593, 15 Sup. Ct. 900, 39 L. Ed. 1092. The frequent use of loud, profane, vile, and obscene language that can be heard in plaintiff\u2019s building may be said to render it \u201cunfit for comfortable or respectable occupation, and unfit for the purposes it was intended for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The learned counsel for the respondent points out that the complaint fails to allege either injury of a continuous character or threats to continue. But the fact that the offending is not perpetual cannot avail the defendants, if that offending be an unmistakable nuisance. High on Injunctions, \u00a7 772, citing Ross v. Butler, 19 N. J. Eq. 294-302, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>97 Am. Dec. 654; Wood on Nuisances, \u00a7 780; Pomeroy\u2019s Equitable Remedies, \u00a7 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> As to the threats to continue, the appellant loses sight of the distinction between future acts which may or may not be a nuisance, according to the fashion of the doing thereof, and future acts of which the very doing constitutes nuisance. As to the latter, an equity court may decree its\" injunction, if it is satisfied by the evidence that there is a reasonable probability of their doing. See Miley v. A\u2019Hearn (Ky.) 18 S. W. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">9The interlocutory judgment is reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled, 'with leave to the defendants to plead over on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
