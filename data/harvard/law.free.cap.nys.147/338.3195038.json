The plaintiff made the first payment of $50, and, claiming that the defendant had failed to perform on. its part, brought this suit to recover that sum, and has recovered a judgment for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">We think that the plaintiff failed to show nonperformance of the terms of the contract. It will be observed that the agreement does not obligate the defendant to start its cars from any particular place, or at any -specified times. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to a breach of the contract consists solely of one witness, who testifies that on October 2, 3, 4, and 5, 1912, he attempted to take a trip upon one of the defendant\u2019s cars at Forty-Second street and Seventh avenue, and at certain times on said .dates, when he presented himself as a passenger, was informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>by the starter that no trip would be made. There is nothing to show that other cars at other times on said dates did not pass the plaintiff\u2019s place of business and deliver the lecture therefrom as provided for in the contract. This witness did not even know whether or not the cars starting from Forty-Second street and Seventh avenue were designed to pass plaintiff\u2019s building, and his whole testimony is confined to the statement that defendant\u2019s cars did not leave Forty-Second street and Seventh avenue at the times when he attempted to board them. On the other hand, the defendant submitted testimony to the effect that on the days in question the defendant ran cars from two to five trips each day passing plaintiff\u2019s building, and that the persons having the cars in charge were instructed to deliver the-agreed lecture. The defendant\u2019s motipn, made at the close of the case, to dismiss the complaint for failure to prove a breach of the contract, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs, but without prejudice to a new action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
