While the complaint does not aver that the defendant \u201cnow\u201d operates a road in Queens county, the words \u201cat all times herein mentioned\u201d are sufficient within the rule that facts once shown are presumed to continue. When the jurisdiction of the county court arises from the residence of the defendant, such a defendant may be served with process in any county of the state. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 347. As the county court\u2019s jurisdiction here arose from the defendant\u2019s residence, and not from the place of service of the summons, service in New York county gave jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">The judgment of the county court of Queens county reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.
