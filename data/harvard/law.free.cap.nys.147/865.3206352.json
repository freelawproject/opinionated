J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6s\">This action is brought by a feed, merchant to recover damages for a breach of warranty in the sale of a car load of oats. The alleged contract was oral.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The rule whether an affirmation may be held as an express warranty is stated admirably in Benjamin on Sales (7th Ed.) p. 612, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-7\">\u201cAnd in determining whether it was so intended, a decisive test is whether the vendor assumes to assert a <em>fact </em>of which the buyer is ignorant, or merely states an opinion or judgment upon a matter of which the vendor has no special knowledge, and on which the buyer may be expected also to have an opinion, and to exercise his judgment. In the former case there is a warranty, in the latter not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, there was proof that the plaintiff requested defendant\u2019s selling agent to furnish \u201cNorthern grown seed oats,\u201d saying that he desired something nice and would pay a premium over and above the price for seed oats, and that the agent answered that they, had them; that he would see to it that the plaintiff would receive a nice car load, and that the plaintiff further said that he wished to obtain the oats for seed, ..to sell them to his farmers and customers; that the plaintiff complained of certain defects in a consignment of oats in the year before, and reiterated that he must have something nice, for his \u201cfarmers were cranks on seed oats, and must have some.\u201d Evidence was also adduced that on the next day the agent came to the plaintiff to give confirmation that the oats were tested seed oats, and that a paper received from the agent\u2019s principals in confirmation contained the words \u201cone car of tested seed oats.\u201d Two witnesses, called as experts, testified that the words \u201cseed oats\u201d meant in the trade \u201cany selected natural oats,\u201d \u201cnothing taken from nor added to,\u201d natural oats just as grown, and that \u201ca sulphured oat\u201d (plaintiff\u2019s contention was that the oats sent to him were \u201csulphured\u201d) would not be regarded in the trade as a \u201cseed oat.\u201d I think that there was prima facie proof of an express warranty, and hence that the plaintiff should not have been nonsuited. Van Wyck v. Allen, 6 Daly, 376, affirmed 69 N. Y. 61, 25 Am. Rep. 136; White v. Miller, 71 N. Y. 118, 27 Am. Rep. 13; Prentice v. Fargo, 53 App. Div. 608, 65 N. Y. Supp. 1114; affirmed 173 N. Y. 593, 65 N. E. 1121; Landreth v. Wyckoff, 67 App. Div. 146, 73 N. Y. Supp. 388; Wolcott v. Mount, 38 N. J. Law, 496, 20 Am. Rep. 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial is granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b904-10\">CARR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am5\">(concurring). On the former trial of this action, the question of an implied warranty was submitted to the jury, and that of an express warranty was withdrawn from them by the trial court. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>was held on appeal that the proofs did not justify the finding of an implied warranty, and the judgment was reversed. 158 App. Div. 461, 143 N. Y.. Supp. 587. On that trial the only evidence as to the trade meaning of the words \u201cseed oats\u201d was given by the defense, and remained uncontradicted. We were of opinion that under the proofs so given, the oats delivered by the defendant answered to the description of \u201cseed oats.\u201d On the new trial, however, the plaintiff has given some evidence that \u201csulphured oats\u201d would not correspond to the trade description Of \u201cseed oats.\u201d This fact- distinguishes the present appeal from that before us formerly. \u00cd will not contend with my Brother JENICS whether this circumstance results in a breach of an express warranty, for in any event it tends to show a breach of at least an implied warranty of correspondence between the thing bought by description \u00e1nd the thing delivered (see cases cited in former opinion). I concur for reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">BURR, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
