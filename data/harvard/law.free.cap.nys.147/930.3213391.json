Code of Civil Procedure, c. 17, tit. 6; Hughes v. Jones, 116 N. Y. 67, 22 N. E. 446, 5 L. R. A. 637, 15 Am. St. Rep. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">Section 2333 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-14\">\u201cThe commissioners are entitled to such compensation for their services,, as the court directs. The jurors are entitled to the same compensation, as jurors upon the trial of an issue in an action in the same court. The petitioner must pay the compensation of the commissioners, sheriff and jurors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">There is a General Rule of Practice, No. 71, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-16\">\u201cOn the' execution of a commission of lunacy, etc., the- commissioners, for every day they are necessarily employed in hearing the testimony and taking the inquisition, shall be entitled to an allowance to be fixed by the court, not exceeding ten dollars for each day to each of such commissioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">This rule is binding upon all the courts of this state except the court for the trial of impeachments and the Court of Appeals. Judiciary Law, \u00a7 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-18\">Giving the evidence upon which the order was made its full effect, and construing that provision of the rule \u201cevery day * * * necessarily employed in * * * taking the inquisition\u201d as including, as a subject for compensation, any service essential to the judicial determination called an inquisition (Hughes v. Jones, ut supra), the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>missioners were necessarily employed 17 days in hearing the testimony and taking the inquisition. The court was without power to make an allowance exceeding $10 for each day to each commissioner. The order should be modified by reducing the allowance to $170 for each commissioner, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In affirming this order we do not wish to be understood as approving the practice of issuing a commission in these proceedings while a trial term of the court, where the proceedings can be conducted expeditiously and inexpensively, is in session.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
