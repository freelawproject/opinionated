This instrument was signed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">\u201cSamuel Aronson, Treas. [Seal.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">\u201cHenry Leibovitz, Pres. [Seal.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">Plaintiff brought his action against the two signers, individually, and the Manhattan Cooperage Company. The three defendants answered. Defendant Aronson by his\" answer denied the allegation that he resided within the county. Proof was given as to the sales, upon which commissions were computed. The testimony having shown Aronson to be a nonresident of the county,'the court dismissed the complaint as to him, and also as against the Manhattan Cooperage Company, but submitted to the jury the liability of Leibowitz alone, against whom a verdict was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">Defendants urged below, and insist on this appeal, that, since all the defendants were not residents of Kings county, the county court never had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> County courts are of limited jurisdiction. Their powers have been restricted by the prior Constitutions of 1846 and 1867. Lincoln\u2019s Constitutional Hist. N. Y. I, p. 255; II, 142, 153, 157; III, 360, 373. By the present Constitution, they have \u201coriginal jurisdiction in actions for the recovery of money only, where the defendants reside in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>county, and in which the complaint demands judgment for a sum not exceeding two thousand dollars,\u201d but that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cThe Legislature may hereafter enlarge or restrict the jurisdiction of the county courts, provided however, that their jurisdiction shall not be so extended as to authorize an action therein for the recovery of money only, in which the sum demanded exceeds two thousand dollars, <em>or in which any person </em>not a resident of the county is a defendant.\u201d Article 6, \u00a7 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Section 340, subd. 3, Code of Civil Procedure, provides that the county court\u2019s jurisdiction extends\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cto an action for any other cause, where the defendant is, or, if there are two or more defendants, where all of them are, at the time of the commencement of the action, residents of the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">If more than one defendant, all are to be residents of the county, at the beginning of the action. Burckle v. Eckhart, 3 N. Y. 133; Frees v. Ford, 6 N. Y. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Respondent contends that, although the county court had no jurisdiction over the nonresident defendants, it did have over the resident defendants. However, the Constitution does not say that, if a separate judgment may be rendered against several defendants, a county court may give judgment against those who reside within the county. On the contrary, it expressly provides that all the defendants must be residents of the county in which the action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Thus Vann, J., so interpreted the Code provisions which\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">\u201cmake the jurisdiction of county courts depend upon the residence of the defendant, or the defendants, <em>when there </em>are more than one.\u201d Maisch v. City of New York, 193 N. Y. 460, 463, 86 N. E. 458, 459.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The county judge below followed Weidman v. Sibley, 16 App. Div. 616, 44 N. Y. Supp. 1057 (Fourth Department), decided by a divided court in 1897, soon after the new Constitution took effect. Being an action of tort, the plaintiff having a several liability could drop out the partners who had left the state.' Here the liability is joint, as the words \u201cfor ourselves\u201d do not make it joint <em>and </em>several, as would the words \u201cfor each of us.\u201d The Eeibowitz liability was so joined with that of Aronson that to drop out Aronson, cutting off the remedy by contribution, was essentially different from striking out some of the tort-feasors, between whom there was not, as in the case at bar, any right of contribution. See, also, Worthington v. London Guar. &amp; Acc. Co., 47 App. Div. 611, 62 N. Y. Supp. 591; Dakin v. Elmore, 68 Misc. Rep. 423, 125 N. Y. Supp. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">Considering the history of the county courts in this state, with the limits placed on them in three successive Constitutions, it is manifest that all-the defendants proceeded against must be residents of the county, as a condition of any jurisdiction by the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">I therefore advise that, as this action was not properly begun, the court did not acquire jurisdiction; that the judgment and order of the county court be reversed, and final judgment rendered dismissing the complaint. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
