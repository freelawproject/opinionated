The crime therefore was not proven, for it was essential in order to establish it that the people should show, not only the making of the representations, but their falsity. The objection was timely made by the defendants\u2019 counsel, but was overruled and ignored by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">It may be that the defendants were guilty, as the district attorney insists; but to justify their conviction it was essential that some proof should be given of each essential element going to constitute the crime for which they were tried. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The judgment of conviction must, therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
