Y., a ticket from that station to White Plains, N. Y., and at about 12:15 o\u2019clock in the afternoon boarded a train for his destination. When the train reached Dyke-man\u2019s, where it stopped, one of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s, a telegraph operator in the switch tower near that station, entered the car\" in which plaintiff was seated, told him that he was wanted at the depot, and led him from the car to the station building, where he was \"detained by the telegraph operator and defendant\u2019s ticket agent at that station for a period of about three-quarters of an hour, when a constable, sent from Towners with a warrant sworn out by the defendant\u2019s ticket agent at that station,5 arrested him.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">When the plaintiff rested his case, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon \"the ground, among others, that the plaintiff had not made out a cause of action and had not shown any detention by the defendant or any of its employ\u00e9s or agents whose authority to so act had been established. The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted. The defendant then rested, and renewed its motion to dismiss, which was again denied and an exception taken. The court then charged the jury that they must find \u201cthat the men who detained the plaintiff were working for and in the employ of the defendant and doing the work authorized by the defendant when they detained him, before the company is liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> At the conclusion of the charge, the defendant requested the following, among other, instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">\u201cThat, in the absence of other testimony than that of the mere employment as a towerman by the defendant of a man who is said to have detained the plaintiff, the jury cannot assume that the said person had authority to act as he did in behalf of the defendant so as to bind the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">To this request the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-8\">\u201cI leave to the jury the question whether this man who did detain the plaintiff was doing it at the request of the defendant or not, upon all the testimony in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the refusal to charge as requested.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-10\">\u201cThat the man who is said to have detained the plaintiff had no right or authority to act for the defendant in matters outside of the scope of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">To which request the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-12\">, \u201cThat is correct. I leave that to the jury to say. whether he was acting under the direction of the company in doing what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-13\">\u201cThe jury has no right to assume that the man who is said to have de-, tained the plaintiff had any duties or employment for the defendant other than those duties and employments which have been testified to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">To which the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-15\">\u201cThat is correct, except as the testimony warrants the assumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">To the refusal to give this instruction the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">The following appears to have taken place at the conclusion of the requests to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-18\">' \u201cThe court of its own volition asks if the towerman is in court, and, if so, to have him called as a witness. Defendant\u2019s counsel excepts to the ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>or order o\u00ed the court to have the towerman called. The court o\u00ed its own volition, after hearing the reguests to charge made by counsel for the defendant, asks the towerman to be called as a witness. The defendant objects to-the calling of the towerman at the present stage of the case, because the case has already been closed, and respectfully excepts to the ruling of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The towerman, Scalpino, was thereupon sworn, and, being examined by the court, testified: That the ticket agent at Towners telegraphed him to \u201cget the man on the train, that he had taken $20 from him.\u201d That he accordingly took the\" plaintiff from the train when it reached Dykeman\u2019s, took him into the railroad station, and \u201cheld him in the office until the detective came along to take charge of -him with a warrant.\u201d On his cross-examination he testified that, at the time of this occurrence, he was a telegraph operator at the tower; that his sole duties were to switch trains from one track to another, and maintain the signals; that his superior officer was a Mr. Van Tassell, superintendent of the company, and that he took instructions from him, and from no one else; that he had no duties pertaining to passengers on trains, and that he was not instructed by Van Tassell, or any superior officer of his, to arrest the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The defendant thereupon moved to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint upon the additional ground \u201cthat it affirmatively appears that the man who caused the detention and arrest of the plaintiff acted without authority of the defendant and beyond the scope of his work and employment, and not in a manner to bind the defendant.\u201d The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">When the plaintiff rested, there was not a particle of evidence establishing, or even warranting, the conclusion that either Scalpino or the ticket agents at Towners or Dykeman\u2019s had any authority, express or implied, to arrest the plaintiff; there was no proof that the defendant had any interest in the matter, or even owned the money alleged to have been stolen at Towners; the proof was therefore insufficient to charge the defendant with responsibility for the arrest of the plaintiff, and it was error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. Allen v. London &amp; S. W. R. Co.. L. R. 6 Q. B. 65; Daniel v. Atlantic C. L. R. Co., 136 N. C. 517, 48 S. E. 816, 67 L. R. A. 455, 1 Ann. Cas. 718; Mayfield v. St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co., 97 Ark. 24, 133 S. W. 168, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 525; Ollet v. Railway Co., 201 Pa. 361, 50 Atl. 1011; Lezinsky v. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co., 88 Fed. 437. 31 C. C. A. 573; Mulligan v. N. Y. &amp; R. B. R. Co., 129 N. Y. 506, 29 N. E. 952, 14 L. R. A. 791, 26 Am. St. Rep. 539; Penny v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 34 App. Div. 10, 53 N. Y. Supp. 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The testimony of Scalpino established that what he did was outside of any authority vested in him by the defendant, and wholly outside of the scope of his employment. If the case presented any doubt as to the defendant\u2019s right to have the complaint dismissed when the original motion was made, the doubt was removed by the testimony of Scalpino, and the exception to the denial of the renewed motion to dismiss presents reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">The plaintiff calls our attention to Lynch v. Met. Elevated Railroad Co., 90 N. Y. 77, 43 Am. Rep. 141, as an authority which he seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>to think sustains his contention, but that was a case where a person had purchased a ticket and entered one of defendant\u2019s elevated trains to ride from Forty-Second street to its Rector street station, but lost his ticket before reaching his destination, and was detained pursuant to a direction of the- defendant that no person be permitted to leave \u2022 station platforms without producing a ticket, while in the case at bar this defendant had made no rule, and it is not shown that it had any knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-3\">In addition, I think the trial court erred in his rulings upon the defendant\u2019s requests to charge. There was no evidence justifying the qualification or modification of the requests as made, and the.defendant was entitled to have them charged in the language in which they were framed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
