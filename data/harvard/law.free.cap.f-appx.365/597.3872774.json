He argues that the district court abused its discretion when, despite his exemplary post-sentencing conduct, it denied his motion solely on the basis that the amended guidelines sentence range overlapped with his original 151-month sentence. We reject the Government\u2019s assertion that Powell waived the right to bring the instant appeal under the terms of his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-23\">A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a full resentencing. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009). Consequently, the bifurcated reasonableness review standard afforded sentencing decisions is inapplicable in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context. <em>Id. </em>at 672. Rather, we review the district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Powell\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence included a request that the district court base its decision on the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the district court\u2019s ruling indicates that it considered the amended guidelines range but deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>mined that no reduction in sentence was warranted. Where, as here, the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 674; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
