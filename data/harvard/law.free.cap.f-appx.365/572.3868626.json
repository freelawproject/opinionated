We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Ellis argues that the reduction in his sentence from 240 months of imprisonment to 210 months of imprisonment was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. He contends that, in view of his good prison record and his supportive family, he was entitled to a greater reduction in his sentence of imprisonment, and he asserts that the district court did not give sufficient weight to the sentencing factors that favor a greater reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Ellis\u2019s contentions are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Evans, 587 </em>F.3d 667, 673-74 (5th Cir.2009). As we explained in <em>Evans, </em>the district court is under no obligation to reduce a sentence at all and, thus, is under no obligation to reduce it even further within the recalculated range. <em>Id. </em>To the extent that Ellis is asserting that the district court did not sufficiently explain its reasons in support of the reduced sentence, <em>Evans </em>also forecloses such an argument. The court held in <em>Evans </em>that a district court is \u201cnot required to state findings of facts and conclusions of law\u201d when granting or denying a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 674 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
