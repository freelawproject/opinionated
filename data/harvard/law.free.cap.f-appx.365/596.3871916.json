The Government moves for summary affirmance, arguing that Thomas was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and not under the crack guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-25\">Because Thomas\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>from his career offender status, the district court was correct in concluding that Thomas was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thomas may not use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a challenge to the appropriateness of the district court\u2019s application of a career offender enhancement in its calculation of his original sentences. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
