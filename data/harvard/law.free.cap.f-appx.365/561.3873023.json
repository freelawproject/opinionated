Haywood argues that the district court erred and abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on the fact that his original sentence, imposed as a variance pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), fell below both his original and amended advisory guidelines ranges. Haywood\u2019s original sentence constituted a 21% departure from his advisory sentencing guidelines range. He asserts that the district court should have granted him an equivalent reduction from his amended sentencing guidelines range, as authorized by United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Haywood has not shown that the district court misapprehended its authority to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B). <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). Nor has Haywood shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion. He was not entitled to a reduction of sentence as a matter of right. The district court gave due consideration to Haywood\u2019s motion as a whole and implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, public safety concerns, and his post-sentencing behavior in determining it would not grant relief. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Finally, Haywood has not shown that the district court erred because its order denying relief did not include reasons for the decision. No explanation was required. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
