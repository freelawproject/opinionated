Romero argues that application of United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 effectively double-counts his criminal history. He contends that his illegal reentry offense was not a crime of violence and was \u201cat bottom, an international trespass.\u201d Romero argues that the guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including his good motive for reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\">This court reviews the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Romero\u2019s 46-month sentence, within the guidelines range calculated based on the illegal-reentry Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is presumed reasonable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Romero\u2019s argument that his advisory guidelines range was greater than necessary to meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a) because of double-counting has been rejected by this court. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We have also rejected the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-30\">The district court considered Romero\u2019s request for a downward variance, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u201cpurposes of the statute,\u201d implicitly referring to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Romero\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s de-</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>velopment as problematic, the nonviolent nature of his offense, and his motive for reentering the United States are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 46-month within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
