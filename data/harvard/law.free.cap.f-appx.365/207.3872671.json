She appeals her conviction under the conspiracy count. Fanning argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict her on that count because the government failed to establish, with only a Lanett Housing Authority (\u201cLHA\u201d) agent\u2019s testimony, that she had collaborated and actually carried out the conspiracy with her son, Kelly Fanning (\u201cKelly\u201d). Fanning asserts that her own testimony refuted the LHA agent\u2019s testimony. Alternatively, Fanning submits that the fact that she and Kelly were merely present at the LHA agent\u2019s office was insufficient to prove their involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir.2007). In determining whether sufficient evidence supports the conviction, we \u201cmust view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and decide whether a reasonable fact finder could have reached a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>931 F.2d 761, 762 (11th Cir.1991). Furthermore, a \u201cjury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the \u201cevidence need not be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except guilt, and the jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>896 F.2d 513, 517 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted). Credibility questions are answered by the jury, and we will assume that the jury answered them in a manner that supports its verdict. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006). Further, when a defendant testifies at trial, the jury is free to disbelieve the defendant and to consider her statements as substantive evidence of guilt. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1272 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">To prove a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) \u201cthe existence of an agreement to achieve an unlawful objective\u201d; (2) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe commission of an overt act in furtherance of it.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>582 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). Direct evidence is not required to prove participation in a conspiracy since the crime of conspiracy is \u201cpredominantly mental in composition\u201d and \u201cit is frequently necessary to resort to circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1270 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Therefore, \u201ca common purpose and plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1557 (11th Cir.1994) (quotations omitted). Even though presence is a material and probative factor, mere association with co-con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>spirators or presence at the scene of crime is insufficient to prove participation in a conspiracy. <em>Hernandez, </em>896 F.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The district court did not err in denying Fanning\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal because sufficient evidence supports her conspiracy conviction. We will not disturb the jury\u2019s decision to credit the LHA agent\u2019s testimony over Fanning\u2019s. Additionally, because Fanning does not contest the sufficiency of evidence regarding her convictions on Counts 2 to 11, she has abandoned any argument as to those claims. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that an issue is abandoned if the defendant fails to proffer argument on its merits on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-16\">. Fanning\u2019s motion for substitution of brief is denied because it was submitted after Appel-lee's brief was submitted. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 31 \u2014 1(b) (\"A motion to file a replacement brief generally will be denied if an opposing party has already filed an appellee\u2019s principal brief....\")</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
