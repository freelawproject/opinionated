Rubio contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s cross-reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, the aggravated assault guideline. He also contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred in adjusting his offense level for \u201cmore than minimal planning,\u201d the district court did not consider a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 before imposing a non-guideline variance, and the district court failed to provide an adequate explanation for the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-23\">Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), this court first determines whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard ... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In exercising this bifurcated process, the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Jeffries, </em>587 F.3d 690, 692 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-24\">A review of the record indicates that the application of the cross-reference to the aggravated assault guideline and the adjustment for \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>470 F.3d 1091, 1094 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1341 (5th Cir.1996). Additionally, Rubio\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider \u00a7 4A1.8, which applies only to departures based on unrepresentative criminal history and not non-guideline variances, is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Mejiar-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir. 2007). Moreover, a review of the record does not support Rubio\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider his mental health history when imposing his 108-month sentence. The district court\u2019s reasons were adequate, <em>see United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 658 (5th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 904, 173 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009), and Rubio has failed to establish that the district court\u2019s reasons constitute procedural error. <em>See United States v. Mondragorir-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Further, the district court\u2019s upward variance from the guideline maximum of 71 months to a sentence of 108 months was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (2008); <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530-32 (5th Cir. 2008). Rubio has not shown that the degree of his variance was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b619-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
