First, Rengifo<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> argues that the district court erred in overruling his request pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) for a downward adjustment based on his minor role in the offense. Second, Rengifo argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court incorrectly calculated the Guidelines offense level due to its denial of a minor role reduction and because the court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rengifo requests a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range. After careful review, we discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">I. Minor role reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">A district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for a minor role adjustment under the Guidelines is a finding of fact that we review only for clear error. <em>United, States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc). \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, ... it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945 (emphasis omitted). The proponent of the downward adjustment bears the burden at all times of establishing his minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 946. It is not necessary for the court to make specific findings of fact, so long as its \u201cdecision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any disputed factual issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant may receive an adjustment for his mitigating role in the offense if he \u201cplays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). A two-level, minor role reduction under \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">Under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the district court conducts a two-part analysis of a defendant\u2019s conduct to determine whether the defendant warrants a minor role reduction. 175 F.3d at 940-45. First, the court \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. The first prong of <em>De Var-\u00f3n </em>is often dispositive of the issue. <em>See id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">In considering the second prong, the district court may compare \u201cthe defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. To apply the adjustment under this prong, the district court must find that \u201cthe defendant was less culpable than most other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944 (emphasis omitted). Even if a defendant\u2019s role is \u201cless than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct,\u201d he might not be entitled to an adjustment because, in some cases, there are no minor or minimal participants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">In this case, Rengifo has failed to satisfy either prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis. In relation to the first prong, because he was only held accountable for the 1770 kilograms of cocaine found aboard the boat, the relevant conduct considered in his sentencing was identical to his actual conduct. In relation to the second prong, Rengifo has never contended nor established that his conduct was any less culpable that the other participants in his relevant conduct \u2014 the other men in the boat. Therefore, Rengifo has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in its decision to deny him a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">II. Procedural unreasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">We review a final sentence for reasonableness according to the factors found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). Review for reasonableness is deferential and is analyzed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">When reviewing a sentence, we must first determine that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id., </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court need not state on the record that it explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Normally, if we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we will \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. In this case, however, because Rengifo pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>ents only a claim of procedural unreasonableness, substantive reasonableness need not be considered. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (deeming an issue abandoned when the defendant failed to offer argument as to the issue on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Rengifo has not demonstrated that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. Because the district court did not clearly err in declining to grant Rengifo a minor role reduction, Rengifo\u2019s Guidelines range was properly calculated. Furthermore, the record indicates that the district court properly considered the section 3553(a) factors. The court heard and acknowledged Rengifo\u2019s arguments offered in mitigation. The court acknowledged that the Guidelines are advisory. The court then imposed a sentence that, based on consideration of the section 3553(a) factors, was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Upon consideration of the foregoing and our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court committed no error in sentencing Rengifo and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">.
