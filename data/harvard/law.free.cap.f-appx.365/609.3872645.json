The district court determined that Carter could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claims did not satisfy the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Carter\u2019s brief is entirely devoted to the merits of his claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"At7\">Carter has not argued, much less shown, that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Carter has waived the issue by failing to brief it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Carter\u2019s \u201cmotion requesting a bond hearing be set,\u201d \u201cmotion for emergency hearing for writ of habeas corpus,\u201d and motion to remand incorporated therein are DENIED. <em>See Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b633-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
