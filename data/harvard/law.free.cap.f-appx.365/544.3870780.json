That or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>der dismissed her appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. Chen argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by the record. Because Chen filed her application for relief in December 2005, this case is governed by the standards of the REAL ID Act for evaluating witness credibility in asylum and withholding of removal cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Chen applied for relief under the Convention Against Torture, she has waived that claim by failing to brief the issue before this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We defer \u201cto an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In making his adverse credibility finding, the IJ noted, among other things, that: (1) Chen\u2019s husband moved to the United States in 2001, despite her claim that they wanted to have more children at that time; (2) the forced insertion and continued use of an intrauterine device (IUD) constituted a major element in Chen\u2019s asylum, claim, but she had not yet removed the IUD at the time of her asylum hearing; (3) her claim that the 2005 flood in China prevented her from submitting additional corroborating evidence did not explain why she did not submit affidavits from her family members and friends; and (4) there were many inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s testimony at the asylum hearing and the information contained in the Form 1-213 that was completed by a border patrol agent shortly after Chen\u2019s arrival in the United States. Our review of the record and Chen\u2019s arguments shows that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding warrants deference.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we are not convinced that all cited inconsistencies were in fact inconsistent, we need not be, as the IJ\u2019s determination rested on an abundance of evidence that precludes us from saying \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Because Chen\u2019s testimony was the primary evidence offered in support of her asylum claim, and the IJ found that testimony less than completely credible, she has not shown that her evidence was \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because her asylum claim does not warrant relief, her claim for withholding of removal also fails.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Chen\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
