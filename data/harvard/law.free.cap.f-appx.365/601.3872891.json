McCoy moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) or, alternatively, to compel a Schultea<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reply. Thompson argued that dismissal prior to discovery was improper because his medical records would document McCoy\u2019s awareness of the severity of Thompson\u2019s asthmatic condition; his administrative records would show that McCoy had refused to treat Thompson on other occasions when other medical personnel deemed Thompson\u2019s condition emergent; and discrepancies between Thompson\u2019s medical records and McCoy\u2019s admissions during the administrative remedy process would show that McCoy failed to document his examination of Thompson according to prison policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notwithstanding Thompson\u2019s arguments, the district court determined that McCoy was entitled to qualified immunity and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">We have held that \u201cevidence showing that a substantial risk of [asthma] attacks was longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expressly noted by prison officials in the past, and the circumstances suggest that the <em>defendant-official being sued had been exposed to information concerning the risk and thus \u2018must have known\u2019 about it \u2019 \u201d </em>could be sufficient to support a finding of a constitutional violation. <em>Olabisiomotosho v. City of Houston, </em>185 F.3d 521, 528 (1999) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">In light of Thompson\u2019s contention in the district court that his medical and administrative records would establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>severity of his asthmatic condition is well documented; that McCoy was aware that he suffers from acute asthma; that McCoy has previously refused to treat Thompson for asthma attacks that other emergency medical technicians concluded warranted hospitalization; that three other Angola inmates have died from untreated asthma attacks; and that there are discrepancies between Thompson\u2019s medical records and McCoy\u2019s admissions in the administrative proceedings which suggest that McCoy may have deliberately withheld treatment from Thompson, we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint on grounds of qualified immunity without allowing Thompson an opportunity to establish his allegations through discovery. <em>See Schultea, </em>47 F.3d at 1434; <em>see also, Easter v. Powell, </em>467 F.3d 459, 464-65 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
