The district court denied the motion on the ground that Russell\u2019s original sentence of 51 months was within the reduced guidelines range of 41 to 51 months in prison. Russell avers that this reason is legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">In her \u00a7 3582(c) motion, Russell averred that, in fashioning a reduced sentence, the sentencing judge was obligated to take into account the prior sentence imposed and was to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court implicitly had before it those factors Russell now contends it failed to consider, and this court can assume that it considered those factors prior to denying Russell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s failure to provide further explanation for denying Russell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672, 674 (holding that a district court need not provide any reasons at all for denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-23\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
