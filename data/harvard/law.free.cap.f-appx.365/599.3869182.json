We review the decision whether to grant or deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">Bosley argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying a reduction based on the minor offenses in his prison disciplinary record and without considering his later positive accomplishments. Post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurs after imposition of the original sentence may be considered by the district court in determining whether a reduction should be granted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). Even in light of Bosley\u2019s later accomplishments, Bosley\u2019s disciplinary record suggests an inability or unwillingness to comply with prison rules and regulations. Therefore, Bosley has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying relief on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-23\">Bosley argues that the district court erred by denying his motion without giving him an opportunity to be heard. A defendant need not be present when a \u201cproceeding involves the correction or reduction of sentence under Rule 35 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4). He also argues that the district court failed to indicate that it considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and \u00a7 1B1.10. Although a district court is required to consider these factors, it is not required to provide reasons for its denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion or to explain its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674. The record reflects that the district court considered Bosley\u2019s subsequent pleadings and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-24\">Bosley also argues that the district court erred by considering his criminal history and his possession of a firearm, both of which he asserts were already considered in the calculation of his original sentence. Bosley has not shown that the district court abused its discretion as \u00a7 3553(a)(1) requires the district court to consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of offense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the history and characteristics of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Finally, citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679 (5th Cir.2007), Bosley argues that the district court erred by considering his unadjudicated arrests. The district court mentioned the arrests in passing, but it twice stated that Bosley\u2019s prison disciplinary record alone was sufficient to justify the denial of relief and it also considered several other clearly permissible factors. As there is no indication that the mere mention of Bosley\u2019s unadjudicated prior arrests had any bearing on the district court\u2019s decision to deny relief, Bosley has not shown that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b623-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
