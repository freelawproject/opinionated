On appeal, Rivera argues that his sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>unreasonable because he was a \u201cmiddle man in a run-of-the-mill drug conspiracy.\u201d He argues that the mandatory minimum sentence, as applied to this case, violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, due process, and the Sixth Amendment. In short, he argues that the mandatory minimum is unconstitutional in this case because it forced the district court to impose a sentence greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, he contends that the district court should have discretion to sentence below the mandatory minimum. Rivera acknowledges that our binding precedent prohibits the district court from imposing a sentence below the mandatory minimum in this case, but requests that we revisit the issue <em>en banc </em>and acknowledges that he is attempting to preserve the issue for review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>we review a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>a district court must consider the correctly calculated sentencing range under the Guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Garey, </em>546 F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2432, 174 L.Ed.2d 229 (2009). Nonetheless, <em>\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>instruction to district courts to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning a reasonable sentence cannot be read to authorize using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1362 (11th Cir.2008). Section 841(b)(1)(A) states that an individual convicted under the statute, who has also been convicted of a prior felony drug offense, \u201cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no error. At the outset, we note that at the sentencing hearing, Rivera conceded that the district court lacked the discretion to sentence below the mandatory minimum. Because Rivera raises the instant arguments for the first time on appeal, we will review for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Rivera cannot point to any authority supporting his arguments. In fact, our prior cases reject Rivera\u2019s arguments; therefore, he cannot demonstrate plain error. <em>See Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1362 (holding that district courts remain bound to statutory mandatory minimum after <em>Booker)-, United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1178-79 (11th Cir.1988) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to \u00a7 841(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Because Rivera was properly sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and the district court correctly determined that it lacked the discretion to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum, Rivera has failed to demonstrate that his sentence constituted plain error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
