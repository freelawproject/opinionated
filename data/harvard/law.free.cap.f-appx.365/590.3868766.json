Phillips was originally sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment following his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride and cocaine base. However, pursuant to a Rule 35 motion, Phillips\u2019s sentence was reduced by 40 percent, resulting in an amended sentence of 158 months of imprisonment. Citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B), Phillips contends that the district court should have reduced his 158-month sentence by 40 percent to 126 months of imprisonment. Phillips further argues that the district court did not reference the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or provide any explanation for the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, and the reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Phillips has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in deciding not to reduce his sentence further or with respect to its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or reasons. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
