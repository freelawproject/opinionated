The district court reduced Brown\u2019s sentence to 235 months, the top of the revised sentencing guidelines range, and noted that Brown remained subject to a 60-month consecutive sentence for a firearms offense. Brown argues on appeal that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors indicate that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant a greater reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence for abuse of discretion and review de novo its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">A sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a full sentencing proceeding; therefore, the reasonableness standard derived from <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237. \u201cThe court, which was under no obligation to reduce [Brownj\u2019s sentence at all, was under no obligation to reduce it even further within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74. Brown\u2019s challenge to his reduced sentence, which is within the recalculated sentencing guidelines range, is foreclosed by <em>Evans. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3m_\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
