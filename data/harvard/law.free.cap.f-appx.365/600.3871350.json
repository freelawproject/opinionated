After initially denying Cochran\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court granted a motion for reconsideration and reduced Cochran\u2019s sentence from 168 months to 156 months. As a threshold matter, we reject the Government\u2019s contention that Cochran\u2019s appeal waiver bars his appeal of the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ruling. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009). We thus turn to the merits of Cochran\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 294-96. However, we do not employ the bifurcated procedural and substantive reasonableness review process derived from <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See id. </em>Cochran contends that because his original sentence was at the bottom of the guidelines range of 168 to 210 months, the district court should have granted a comparable reduction to the bottom of the amended range of 140 to 175 months. Cochran argues that the court abused its discretion in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, pointing to the rationale underlying the Guidelines amendment; efforts to eliminate the crack/powder sentencing disparity; and his postsentencing conduct, which includes obtaining a GED, participating in various programs, and his lack of disciplinary infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The record reflects that the district court considered appropriate factors, including Cochran\u2019s criminal history and his postsentencing conduct, and concluded that a 12-month reduction was warranted. The district court was not obligated to reduce Cochran\u2019s sentence at all; thus, the court was not required to grant a further reduction within the amended guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). We discern no abuse of discretion. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
