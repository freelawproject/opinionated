Casas argues that the district court\u2019s upward variance was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. As Casas did not object on these bases in the district court, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-25\">The sentencing transcript refutes Ca-sas\u2019s allegation that the district court committed procedural error by failing to adequately articulate the reasons for the upward variance. Additionally, the record indicates that the district court gave adequate consideration to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment authorized upon revocation of supervised release. Casas has therefore not shown plain error with regard to either the procedural or substantive reasonableness of her sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
