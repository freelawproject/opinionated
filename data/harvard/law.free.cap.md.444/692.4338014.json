State, </em>427 Md. 383, 48 A.3d 242 (2012), and denied a motion to reconsider our decision in August of the same year. We granted certiorari to consider the State\u2019s request that we overrule what we decided in <em>Unger </em>little more than three years ago. We decline to overrule <em>Unger </em>and return to what once was the law. To hold otherwise would depart from the principles of stare decisis, generate uncertainty, and, ultimately, undermine trust and confidence in the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In order to appreciate the legal issues and arguments of the parties, it is useful at the outset to understand what this Court held in <em>Unger. Unger </em>followed a series of cases, <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980), <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 437 A.2d 654 (1981), and <em>State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 958 A.2d 295 (2008), all of which involved the \u201cadvisory only\u201d jury instruction prompted by Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Article 23 reads: \u201cIn the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d This Court promulgated Maryland Rule 756b to implement Article 23.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Rule required judges, \u201cin every case in which instructions are given to the jury, [to] instruct the jury that they are the judges of the law and that the court\u2019s instructions are advisory only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In 1980, this Court considered whether Article 23, as interpreted by prior decisions, ran afoul of the guarantees afforded State criminal defendants by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court in <em>Stevenson </em>construed Article 23 to mean that only those instructions concerning \u201cdisputes as to the substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u2018law of the crime\u2019 \u201d are advisory; all other instructions to the jury are binding. 289 Md. at 180, 423 A.2d <em>558. </em>The next year, in <em>Montgomery, </em>the Court reinforced its <em>Stevenson </em>interpretation of Article 23, emphasizing that advisory only instructions are \u201climited to those instances when the jury is the final arbiter of the law of the crime.\u201d 292 Md. at 89, 437 A.2d 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Almost 28 years later, we decided <em>Adams, </em>a postconviction case. We concluded in <em>Adams, </em>essentially consistent with <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>that, under Article 23, the jury\u2019s role as judge of the law in a criminal case is limited to disputes relating to the substantive law of the crime and \u201call other legal issues are for the judge alone to decide.\u201d 406 Md. at 256-59, 958 A.2d 295. Notable for present purposes, we held in <em>Adams </em>that the <em>Stevenson </em>interpretation of Article 23, as reinforced by <em>Montgomery, </em>\u201cdid not announce new law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 958 A.2d 295. We further held in <em>Adams </em>that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the advisory only instruction constituted a waiver of Adams\u2019s right to challenge the instruction in the subsequent postconviction action. <em>Id. </em>at 266, 958 A.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We re-examined our holdings in <em>Adams </em>three and a half years later in <em>Unger. </em>It was clear to the Court that <em>\u201cStevenson </em>and <em>Adams </em>were wrongly decided.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 417, 48 A.3d 242. The Court in <em>Unger </em>overruled \u201c[t]hose portions of the Court\u2019s <em>Stevenson, Montgomery, </em>and <em>Adams </em>opinions, holding that the interpretation of Article 23 in <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>was not a new State constitutional standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also overruled the waiver holdings in those cases, <em>id., </em>determining that the \u201cfailure to object to advisory only jury instructions in criminal trials prior to <em>Stevenson </em>will not constitute a waiver,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 391, 48 A.3d 242. We made those holdings fully retroactive. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 48 A.3d 242. The <em>Unger </em>decision effectively opened the door to postconviction relief for persons tried during the era of the advisory only jury instruction \u2014 an opportunity that had been foreclosed by <em>Stevenson, Montgomery, </em>and <em>Adams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">This case arises from the 1976 trial of Respondent, Peter Sutro Waine. Waine was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County on two charges of first degree murder and a related larceny. At the close of all the evidence, pursuant to Rule 756b, the judge began his instructions to the jury with the following reference to Article 23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">Under the Constitution and laws of the State, the jury in a criminal case is the judge of both the law and the facts and anything that I say to you about the law is advisory only. It is intended to help you, but you are at liberty to reject the Court\u2019s advice on the law and to arrive at your own independent conclusion on it, if you desire to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The judge concluded his instructions with a reiteration of his opening instruction: \u2018You are not partisans. You are judges, judges of the facts and the law. Your sole interest is to ascertain the truth from the evidence in the case.\u201d Waine\u2019s counsel did not object to those instructions. After deliberating for less than three hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. The judge imposed consecutive life sentences on the two murder convictions and an additional 14 years, consecutive to the second life sentence, on the larceny conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Waine noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in 1977, affirmed the judgment. <em>Waine v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 222, 247, 377 A.2d 509 (1977). Waine, representing himself, made initial efforts to seek certiorari review and postconviction relief but, in the end, did not file the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">In 1997, Waine, assisted by counsel, sought postconviction relief for the first time. Waine claimed ineffective assistance of counsel at both the trial and appellate levels, and asserted, among 19 other claims, that the trial judge erred when he gave the advisory only jury instructions. The postconviction court, in denying relief, rejected Waine\u2019s claim that the erroneous jury instructions contravened fundamental constitutional rights and ruled that this claim was waived by trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the jury instructions during trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Court of Special Appeals denied Waine\u2019s application for leave to appeal the denial of postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In September 2007, counsel for Waine filed a motion to reopen the petition for postconviction relief, relying in part on <em>Jenkins v. Hutchinson, </em>221 F.3d 679 (4th Cir.2000). Jenkins had sought federal habeas corpus relief from his 1975 Maryland conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 681. He argued that the advisory only jury instruction given at trial violated his right to due process by allowing the jury to disregard the State\u2019s burden to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed with Jenkins.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Jenkins </em>court recognized the legal question as \u201cwhether the jury was effectively given any reasonable doubt instruction at all; for if the jury understood the advisory nature of the instructions as permitting it to ignore the reasonable doubt instruction, then the jury could fashion any standard of proof that it liked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that, after <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), it was no longer an \u201copen question\u201d that \u201cthe jury must be instructed that the Government is required to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>221 F.3d at 684. The <em>Jenkins </em>court held, by application of <em>Winship, </em>that Maryland\u2019s advisory only jury instruction violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Waine\u2019s motion to reopen his postconviction proceeding lay dormant until 2012, when the circuit court, citing our recently filed opinion in <em>Unger, </em>granted the motion. The court found, based on <em>Unger, </em>that \u201cit would be in the interest of justice to allow a reopening of the Petitioner\u2019s postconviction application in this court ... on only one issue \u2014 the alleged erroneous jury instruction advising the jury that they were the judges of the law and the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Following a hearing, the postconviction court issued a memorandum opinion granting Waine postconviction relief. The court rejected the State\u2019s claim of waiver as having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>\u201cforeclosed by <em>Unger.\u201d </em>The court also rejected the State\u2019s contention that Waine was not prejudiced by the advisory only instruction because of other instructions to the jury. The court concluded that the advisory only instruction went \u201cto the very core of due process of law\u201d and, based on the full retroactivity conferred by <em>Unger, </em>ordered that Waine was entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The Court of Special Appeals denied the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal in an unreported opinion addressing the merits of the postconviction court\u2019s grant of relief under <em>Unger. </em>We granted the State\u2019s certiorari petition to answer three questions, which we have reworded:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">1. Should <em>Unger </em>be overruled?</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">2. Assuming <em>Unger </em>is not overruled, did the circuit court exercise proper discretion in reopening Waine\u2019s postconviction proceeding, and more generally, does a circuit court retain discretion to deny reopening a postconviction proceeding to address a challenge to an advisory jury instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">3. Assuming <em>Unger </em>is not overruled, what is the proper standard by which a court should evaluate advisory only jury instructions?</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The State urges us to overrule <em>Unger, </em>arguing that, in deciding <em>Unger, </em>we departed from stare decisis in an unprecedented and improper manner. The State protests that the decision has left circuit courts across Maryland \u201cin turmoil\u201d and has resulted in \u201cchaotic\u201d litigation. The State asks us to calm these unsettled waters by resurrecting <em>Adams. </em>Waine and <em>amici </em>in support of him and persons similarly situated urge us not to disturb <em>Unger </em>as the case declares the current state of the law and should remain intact, as faithful adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\"><em>\u201cStare decisis </em>means \u2018to stand by the thing decided,\u2019 and is \u2018the preferred course because it promotes the even<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>handed, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Livesay v. Balt. Cnty., 384 Md. </em>1, 14, 862 A.2d 33 (2004) (quoting <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991)); <em>accord State v. Stachowski, </em>440 Md. 504, 520,103 A.3d 618 (2014). In <em>Stachowski, </em>we reiterated: \u201cThe crux of the doctrine of stare decisis is that courts should reaffirm, follow, and apply ordinarily the published decisional holdings of our appellate courts even though, if afforded a blank slate, the court might decide the matter differently.\u201d 440 Md. at 520, 103 A.3d 618 (citing <em>Coleman v. Soccer Ass\u2019n of Columbia, </em>432 Md. 679, 689, 69 A.3d 1149 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">We have recognized two exceptions for departing from stare decisis. \u201cWe may decline to follow the doctrine when persuaded the prior decision is clearly wrong, or when the precedent has been rendered archaic and inapplicable to modern society through the passage of time and evolving events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also Unger, </em>427 Md. at 417, 48 A.3d 242 (\u201c[UJnder the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>a court\u2019s previous decisions should not be lightly set aside, nevertheless the rule of stare decisis is not an absolute.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The State insists that <em>Unger </em>deviated from the doctrine of stare decisis and that a return to <em>Adams, </em>decided three and a half years earlier, is required. To the contrary, it is <em>Unger, </em>not <em>Adams, </em>to which the dictates of stare decisis must now apply. Unless we are persuaded that <em>Unger </em>is either \u201cclearly wrong and contrary to established principles\u201d or \u201csuperseded by significant changes in the law,\u201d we must leave the decision standing. <em>DRD Pool Serv., Inc. v. Freed, </em>416 Md. 46, 64, 5 A.3d 45 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The State has not persuaded us that either of these exceptions applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The State makes no argument that <em>Unger </em>is archaic, superseded by a significant change in the law, or rendered inapplicable to modern society by the passage of time. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>concentrates solely on arguing that the decision was clearly wrong and contrary to established principles. The State argues that the <em>Unger </em>Court wrongly held that <em>Stevenson </em>set forth a new interpretation of Article 23. The State picks its way carefully around the analysis in both <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Unger </em>to paint a picture of clear error, but neglects to include the full bore of the Court\u2019s analysis for determining that a new constitutional rule had been laid in <em>Stevenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The <em>Unger </em>Court, in reaching the legal conclusions that it did, applied the very principles of, and exceptions to, the doctrine of stare decisis that the State relies upon in seeking a return to the holdings of the <em>Stevenson, Montgomery, </em>and <em>Adams </em>cases. In <em>Unger, </em>this Court analyzed the law existing at the time of <em>Stevenson, </em>including Maryland Rule 756b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requiring courts to give the advisory only jury instruction. <em>See Unger, </em>427 Md. at 411-16, 48 A.3d 242. We have reviewed independently the <em>Unger </em>Court\u2019s extensive analysis and need not repeat it here. It is enough to say that the Court was not wrong, much less clearly wrong, in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>established a new State constitutional standard that could not be considered waived, requiring the overruling of <em>Adams </em>and the portions of <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>that held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The State is in the unfortunate position of decrying the \u201cping-pong\u201d between the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Adams </em>and <em>Unger, </em>decided three and a half years apart, and seeking just one more \u201cping\u201d by urging that <em>Unger </em>be overruled and <em>Adams </em>resurrected. We must decline. Where the Court has previously recognized a new State constitutional standard as fundamental to due process, deference to that precedent ensures the constancy upon which due process endures.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We turn next to the State\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred by granting Waine\u2019s motion to reopen his petition for postconviction relief to entertain his <em>Unger </em>claim. The State argues that the court\u2019s rationale for granting the petition demonstrates the court\u2019s failure to recognize that it had the discretion to deny reopening. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The circuit court\u2019s written statement of reasons for reopening the postconviction proceeding to hear the <em>Unger </em>claim demonstrates that the court both recognized that the decision to reopen is discretionary and properly exercised that discretion. It is evident that the court had carefully reviewed the record and relevant case law, including <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005), and <em>Unger, </em>understood that <em>Unger </em>has retrospective application to specific advisory only instructions; appreciated that the claim of error reached \u201cto the very core of due process of law\u201d; and concluded that reopening the proceeding to consider that claim for relief would be in the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The State also argues 'that, should we decline to overrule <em>Unger, </em>as we have done, we should consider whether judges retain discretion to deny motions to reopen postconviction proceedings after <em>Unger. </em>We recognized in <em>Gray </em>that a change in the law intended to apply retroactively meets the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201cinterests of justice\u201d standard for reopening a petition for postconviction relief. 388 Md. at 382-83, 879 A.2d 1064. This is both independent of and consistent with Section 7-106(c)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an allegation of error may not be considered to have been finally litigated or waived under this title if a court whose decisions are binding on the lower courts of the State holds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">(i) the Constitution of the United States or the Maryland Constitution imposes on State criminal proceedings a procedural or substantive standard not previously recognized; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">(ii) the standard is intended to be applied retrospectively and would thereby affect the validity of the petitioner\u2019s conviction or sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Md.Code Ann., Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-106(c)(2) (2001, Repl.Vol. 2008). Given the nature of this claim and others like it, the legal landscape that prevailed at the time of Waine\u2019s trial, and the case law that developed in the decades between <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Unger </em>suggesting the likelihood that an unobjected to jury instruction would be considered waived, it can hardly be said that reopening a postconviction proceeding to consider an <em>Unger </em>claim would be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Finally, the State asks us to consider what test a court must apply in considering a challenge to an advisory only jury instruction. Rather than adopting the standard set forth in <em>Unger, </em>the State urges that advisory only instructions be considered on a case by case basis to determine whether there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jurors understood the court\u2019s Article 23 instruction as allowing them to convict a defendant on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The State\u2019s reliance on the \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d test is misplaced, as this was the test adopted by the Supreme Court for review of jury instructions that are ambiguous. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>(1991) (\u201c[I]n reviewing an ambiguous instruction such as the one at issue here, we inquire \u2018whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way\u2019 that violates the Constitution.\u201d (quoting <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990))); <em>see also Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 6, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Ambiguity is not the issue in Article 23 advisory only jury instructions; rather, such instructions are clear, but erroneous, as they give the jury permission to disregard any or all of the court\u2019s instructions, including those bedrock due process instructions on the presumption of innocence and the State\u2019s burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Unger, </em>427 Md. at 389, 409, 48 A.3d 242. This is illustrated by <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">But the essential connection to a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d factual finding cannot be made where the instructional error consists of a misdescription of the burden of proof, which vitiates <em>all </em>the jury\u2019s findings. A reviewing court can only engage in pure speculation \u2014 its view of what a reasonable jury would have done. And when it does that, the wrong entity judge[s] the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">Another mode of analysis leads to the same conclusion that harmless-error analysis does not apply: In <em>Fulminante, </em>we distinguished between, on the one hand, structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by harmless-error standards, and, on the other hand, trial errors which occur during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented. Denial of the right to a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is certainly an error of the former sort, the jury guarantee being a basic protectio[n] whose precise effects are unmeasurable, but without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function. The right to trial by jury reflects, we have said, a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.

At its core, this case presents the paradox that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>supports overruling a case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For more than three decades, <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564, was the law of Maryland. The bench and bar relied on <em>Stevenson, </em>and justifiably so; this Court reaffirmed <em>Stevenson </em>one year after issuing it, <em>see Montgomery, </em>292 Md. at 87-88, 437 A.2d at 656, and then once again twenty-eight years after issuing it, <em>see Adams, </em>406 Md. at 259, 958 A.2d at 307. But then, a mere four years after <em>Adams, </em>in <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 417, 48 A.3d at 261, without valid reason, this Court overruled <em>Adams </em>and decades\u2019 worth of other case law in which we consistently recognized that Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and its predecessors mean that, in a criminal case, the jury is the judge of the law of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In overruling this raft of case law in <em>Unger, </em>this Court struck a blow to <em>stare decisis, </em>rocked lawyers\u2019 and courts\u2019 confidence that this Court would not lightly abandon its precedent, and gave members of the public reason to believe that this Court\u2019s decision-making is based on the views of the individual judges who decide a case, regardless of existing case law. Today, this Court has the opportunity to right these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>wrongs, restore <em>stare decisis </em>to its proper place, and make clear that, because this Court nonchalantly demolished decades\u2019 worth of case law in <em>Unger, </em>that case represents an aberration that thwarts the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>Unfortunately, the Majority fails to take advantage of this opportunity, and instead reaffirms <em>Unger </em>with barely any analysis, original thought, or consideration of historical context. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 700-02, 122 A.3d at 298-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Foremost, <em>Unger </em>is disconcerting in light of the circumstance that this Court simply turned parts of the dissent in <em>Adams, </em>406 Md. at 312-40, 958 A.2d at 339-56 (Eldridge, J., dissenting) into the majority opinion in <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 411, 48 A.3d at 258. As the Honorable Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. pointed out in <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 430 n. 7, 418, 48 A.3d at 270 n. 7, 262 (Harrell, J., dissenting), \u201cmore is required, before deviating from stare decisis, than simply re-potting those dissenting views as a Majority opinion here\u201d; \u201c[t]he only thing that appears to have changed in the few intervening years between <em>Adams </em>and <em>[Unger] </em>is the composition of [this] Court.\u201d As Judge Harrell later demonstrated, a dissenting judge must realize that, as of this Court\u2019s issuance of the majority opinion from which the judge dissents, the judge\u2019s views\u2019 <em>opposite </em>\u2014 i.e., the majority opinion \u2014 becomes the law of Maryland. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Pub.

State, </em>192 Md. 94, 101, 63 A.2d 599, 601 (1949). The English common law principle \u201cwas condemned by some of the Colonial statesmen, notably John Adams, who believed that the juries should be entitled to disregard the arbitrary and unjust rulings of the [trial] judges holding office by authority of the\u201d King of England. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 63 A.2d at 601; <em>see also id. </em>at 101, 63 A.2d at 601-02 (\u201cIn some of the ... Colonies[,] it was fully understood that the [trial] judges held office not for the purpose of deciding causes, for the jury decided all questions of both law and fact, but merely to preserve order and see that the parties were treated fairly before the jury. This procedure received patriotic justification as increasingly oppressive measures were taken by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>royal officials; however, the fact that many of the [trial] judges had not studied law was probably an additional explanation for the procedure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The Constitution of Maryland of 1776 did not expressly indicate whether the jury was the judge of the law in a criminal case. <em>See id. </em>at 104, 63 A.2d at 603. As a result, \u201copposing views as to the powers of [the] jury in a criminal case[ ] prevailed in different parts of\u2019 Maryland. <em>Franklin v. State, </em>12 Md. 236, 245 (1858) (LeGrand, C.J., concurring). To secure uniformity of decision, the Constitution of Maryland of 1851 included Article X, Section 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which stated: \u201cIn the trial of all criminal cases, the jury shall be the judges of law as well as fact.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(LeGrand, C.J., concurring) (\u201c[T]o guard in the future against ... conflict, the provision was inserted in the constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">This Court consistently recognized that Article X, Section 5 and its successors mean that, in a criminal case, the jury is the judge of the \u201claw of the crime;\u201d in other words, the jury applies the law of the crime (e.g., the law against murder) to the facts, and cannot make any other legal determination (e.g., that a statute is unconstitutional). For example, in <em>Franklin, id. </em>at 249, the very first case in which this Court mentioned Article X, Section 5, this Court stated that Article X, Section 5 did not enable the jury in a criminal case to conclude that a statute is unconstitutional. As to that issue, a majority of this Court adopted the concurring opinion of Chief Justice John Carroll LeGrand, <em>id. </em>at 249, who stated that, under Article X, Section 5, \u201cin a criminal case[,] the jury [is] not bound to abide by the interpretation of the [trial] court of the meaning of a law, but [is] free to construe and apply it according to [the jurors\u2019] own judgments\u201d; in other words, instead of having \u201cthe right to decide on the constitutionality of an act defining murder, arson[,] or any other crime, [the jurors] had the right to affix their own meaning on the particular law, and to determine for themselves, whether the facts proven brought the [defendant] within that meaning[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 246 (LeGrand, C.J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>In several cases after <em>Franklin, </em>this Court reaffirmed the principle that Article X, Section 5 and its successors: (1) mean that, in a criminal case, the jury is the judge of the law of the <em>crime; </em>and (2) do not enable the jury to make any other legal determination (e.g., whether a piece of evidence is admissible). <em>See Wheeler v.

There is, however, no such inconsistency; Article X, Section 5\u2019s purpose was actually to codify the English common law principle. As noted above, the English common law principle was in effect in 1776. <em>See id. </em>at 101, 63 A.2d at 601. In that year, Maryland received the English common law, <em>see </em>Md. Decl. of Rts. Art. 3 (1776) (\u201c[T]he inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England[.]\u201d), and the Constitution of Maryland of 1776 was otherwise silent regarding whether the jury was judge of the law in a criminal case, <em>see Slansky, </em>192 Md. at 104, 63 A.2d at 603. Thus, despite the \u201copposing views as to the powers of [the] jury in a criminal case\u201d between 1776 and 1851, <em>Franklin, </em>12 Md. at 245 (LeGrand, C.J., concurring), Maryland received in 1776 the English common law principle that, in a criminal case, the trial court decided the law, and the jury applied the law to the facts. Indeed, as this Court expressly recognized, Article X, Section 5 of the Constitution of Maryland of 1851 did not supersede the English common law principle; to the contrary, Article X, Section 5 codified it. <em>See id. </em>at 249 (This Court stated that Article X, Section 5 \u201cis merely declaratory, and has not altered the pre-existing law regulating the powers of the [trial] court and [the] jury in criminal cases.\u201d (Emphasis added)); <em>see also In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>re Glenn, </em>54 Md. 572, 600 (1880) (Article X, Section 5 is \u201conly declaratory of the pre-existing common law upon the subject.\u201d (Citing <em>Franklin, </em>12 Md. at 249) (emphasis added)). Thus, Article X, Section 5\u2019s purpose was to secure uniformity of decision in favor of the English common law principle, not against it. <em>See Franklin, </em>12 Md. at 245 (LeGrand, C.J., concurring) (\u201c[T]o guard in the future against ... conflict, the provision was inserted in the constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Given that Article X, Section 5\u2019s purpose was to codify the English common law principle, one may wonder why Article X, Section 5\u2019s drafters chose the words \u201cthe jury shall be the judges of law[.]\u201d The reason is simple: Article X, Section 5\u2019s drafters wanted to make clear that, in a criminal case in which a jury trial occurred, the jury, and only the jury, applied the law of the crime to the facts; in other words, the trial court could not apply the law of the crime to the facts by ordering a directed verdict (whether guilty or not guilty), and an appellate court could not could not apply the law of the crime to the facts by reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Newton v. State, </em>147 Md. 71, 87, 127 A. 123, 130 (1924) (Citing Article X, Section 5\u2019s identical successor, this Court noted that a trial court cannot order \u201ca directed verdict in [a] criminal ease[]\u201d; this Court disapproved of <em>Horning v.

Thus, in <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564, this Court was correct in noting that, under more than a century\u2019s worth of precedent, in a criminal case, the jury\u2019s \u201cauthority is limited to deciding \u2018the law of the crime,\u2019 <em>Wheeler[], </em>42 Md.

And this Court has consistently interpreted [Article 23 and its predecessors] as restraining the jury\u2019s law[-]deciding power to this limited, albeit important, area.\u201d <em>See also Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 177-78, 423 A.2d at 563-64 (This Court quoted <em>Franklin, </em>12 Md. at 245-46 (LeGrand, C.J., concurring) for the principle that \u201cthe jury was not granted, by Article 23 [and its predecessors], the power to decide all matters that may be correctly included under the generic label \u2018law.\u2019 \u201d). One year after <em>Stevenson, </em>in <em>Montgomery, </em>292 Md. at 87-88, 437 A.2d at 656, in accordance with <em>Stevenson </em>and earlier precedent, this Court correctly reaffirmed that, in a criminal case, the jury\u2019s \u201cauthority is limited to deciding the law of the crime, or the definition of the crime, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>legal effect of the evidence before the jury.\u201d (Quoting <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564) (citations, parentheses, and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Twenty-seven years after <em>Montgomery, </em>in <em>Adams, </em>406 Md. at 256, 958 A.2d at 305, writing for this Court, Judge Harrell correctly and cogently explained that <em>\u201cStevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>by their express terms, did not announce new law.\u201d <em>See also Adams, </em>406 Md. at 257, 958 A.2d at 305 (\u201c[T]he <em>Stevenson </em>court is clear that it did not make new law, but rather it merely clarified what has always been the law in Maryland.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Appropriately taking <em>stare decisis </em>into account, Judge Harrell declared: \u201cWe shall not here disturb the holdings of <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Stevenson.\u201d Adams, </em>406 Md. at 259, 958 A.2d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In <em>Adams, </em>the dissent disputed that this Court consistently recognized that Article 23 and its predecessors mean that, in a criminal case, the jury is the judge of the law of the crime. Specifically, the dissent accused this Court of \u201cre-draft[ing]\u201d Article 23 in both <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Adams. Adams, </em>406 Md. at 301, 958 A.2d at 332 (Eldridge, J., dissenting). The dissent attempted to support its accusation with multiple unpersuasive contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The dissent asserted that none of this Court\u2019s precedent \u201csupports] the proposition that the jury\u2019s right to decide the law in criminal cases is limited to the \u2018law of the crime\u2019 and the \u2018legal effect of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adams, </em>406 Md. at 313-14, 958 A.2d at 340 (Eldridge, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted). The dissent attempted to reconcile its assertion with <em>Wheeler, </em>42 Md. at 570 (\u201c[A]ny instruction given by the [trial cjourt, as to the law of the <em>crime, </em>is but advisory, and in no manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>binding upon the jury, except in regard to questions as to what shall be considered as evidence.\u201d (Some emphasis in original)) and <em>Beard, </em>71 Md. at 280, 17 A. at 1045 (\u201cThe [trial court] ... cannot, by any instruction given in a criminal case, bind the jury as to the definition of the crime, or as to the legal effect of the evidence before them.\u201d (Emphasis added)) by myopically fixating on the circumstance that this Court did not use the word \u201climited\u201d or a similar term. <em>See Adams, </em>406 Md. at 312 n. 7, 314, 958 A.2d at 339 n. 7, 340 (Eldridge, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Respectfully, the dissent\u2019s observation was beside the point. In <em>Wheeler, </em>42 Md. at 570, <em>Beard, </em>71 Md. at 280, 17 A. at 1045, and voluminous other cases, this Court did not need to use the word \u201climited\u201d or a similar term in interpreting Article 23 and its predecessors; by definition, if Article 23 and its predecessors mean one thing, then Article 23 and its predecessors do not mean anything else. By way of comparison, generally, where a statute expressly defines a term as \u201cX, Y, or Z,\u201d that statutory definition excludes any meaning other than \u201cX, Y, or Z.\u201d <em>See Potomac Abatement, Inc. v. Sanchez, </em>424 Md. 701, 712, 37 A.3d 972, 978 (2012) (Under the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(\u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d), \u201cstatutory lists are often interpreted as exclusive, so that a court will draw the negative inference that no other items may be added.\u201d (Citation omitted)). Thus, if Article 23 and its predecessors mean that the jury is the judge of the law of the crime, then Article 23 and its predecessors do not mean that the jury is able to make any other legal determination. It follows that this Court did not \u201cannounce new law\u201d in <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564, by accurately noting that, under more than a century\u2019s worth of precedent, in a criminal case, the jury\u2019s \u201cauthority is limited to deciding \u2018the law of the crime,\u2019 <em>Wheeler[ </em>], 42 Md. [at] 570[ ], or \u2018the definition of the crime,\u2019 as well as \u2018the legal effect of the evidence before (the jury).\u2019 <em>Beard[ </em>], 71 Md. [at] 280, 17 A. [at] 1045[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The dissent interpreted snippets of <em>dicta </em>in an attempt to support the proposition that there were only two \u201cexceptions\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>to Article 23 and its predecessors: the admissibility of a piece of evidence, and the constitutionality of a statute. <em>See Adams, </em>406 Md. at 312 n. 7, 314, 315-17, 958 A.2d at 339 n. 7, 340, 341-42 (Eldridge, J., dissenting). For - example, the dissent misplaced its reliance on the word \u201cexcept\u201d in <em>Wheeler, </em>42 Md. at 570 (\u201c[A]ny instruction given by the [trial e]ourt, as to the law of the <em>crime, </em>is but advisory, and in no manner binding upon the jury, except in regard to questions as to what shall be considered as evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original)) and the word \u201conly\u201d in <em>Beard, </em>71 Md. at 280, 17 A. at 1045 (A trial court \u201ccan only bind ... the jury as to what evidence shall be considered by\u201d the jury.). <em>See Adams, </em>406 Md. at 312 n. 7, 958 A.2d at 339 n. 7 (Eldridge, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The dissent\u2019s strained interpretation of these isolated words is undermined not only by the bevy of cases in which this Court consistently recognized that Article 23 and its predecessors mean that, in a criminal case, the jury is the judge of the law of the crime, <em>see, e.g., Bloomer, </em>48 Md. at 540 (\u201c[I]t was the duty of the [trial c]ourt to leave it to the jury to say[ ] whether the evidence was sufficient in law and in fact to prove the [crime] charged.\u201d), but also by the circumstance that the admissibility of a piece of evidence and the constitutionality of a statute are far from the only \u201cexceptions\u201d to Article 23 and its predecessors; for example, this Court has long held that Article 23 and its predecessors do not enable the jury to determine: (1) when a statute became effective, <em>see Slymer v. State, </em>62 Md. 237, 241 (1884); (2) whether the General Assembly has repealed a statute, <em>see Nolan v. State, </em>157 Md. 332, 340, 146 A. 268, 271 (1929); or (3) whether the trial court has jurisdiction, <em>see Kelly v. State, </em>151 Md. 87, 98-99, 133 A. 899, 903 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The dissent asserted that \u201c[t]his Court has never explained what legal issues precisely fall within the phrases \u2018law of the crime\u2019 and \u2018legal effect of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adams, </em>406 Md. at 314 n. 8, 958 A.2d at 340 n. 8 (Eldridge, J., dissenting). The dissent was mistaken. In <em>Franklin, </em>12 Md. at 249, a majority of this Court adopted part of the concurring opinion of Chief Justice LeGrand, who equated \u201cthe law of the crime\u201d with \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>act defining murder, arson[,] or any other crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 246 (LeGrand, C.J., concurring). In <em>Vogel, </em>163 Md. at 274, 162 A. at 707-08, this Court defined \u201clegal effect of the evidence\u201d as \u201cthe effect, in law, of admitted evidence upon the issue of guilt or innoeence[.]\u201d (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The dissent listed multiple cases in which this Court stated that, if a trial court instructs the jury, the trial court must label the jury instructions as \u201cadvisory.\u201d <em>See Adams, </em>406 Md. at 318-25, 958 A.2d at 342-47 (Eldridge, J., dissenting). For example, the dissent noted that, in <em>Klein v. State, </em>151 Md. 484, 493, 489, 135 A. 591, 595, 593 (1926), this Court affirmed a conviction where a trial court instructed a jury about the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but told the jury that the jury instructions were \u201cadvisory\u201d; this Court stated: \u201c[T]he [trial] court cannot give [the jury] binding instructions in [criminal] cases.\u201d <em>See Adams, </em>406 Md. at 320-21, 958 A.2d at 344 (Eldridge, J., dissenting). The dissent failed to mention that this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Klein, </em>151 Md. at 489, 135 A. at 594, was <em>dicta; </em>the issue of the jury instructions\u2019 propriety was \u201cnot ... properly before\u201d this Court because the defendant \u201cfail[ed] ... to point out the specific instructions to which he objected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 490, 135 A. at 594. Indeed, in no case, including <em>Klein, </em>has this Court ever held that a trial court did not err in giving \u201cadvisory\u201d jury instructions that implicate federal constitutional rights (such as the presumption of innocence).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Thus, the dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Klein </em>and similar cases was misplaced.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Tellingly, the dissent did not even mention, much less address, <em>stare decisis, see Adams, </em>406 Md. at 299-340, 958 A.2d at 331-56 (Eldridge, J., dissenting); instead, the dissent acted as though it were writing on a blank slate, when in fact <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>had already been carved into the law of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">A mere four years after <em>Adams, </em>in <em>Unger, </em>this Court pummeled <em>stare decisis </em>by overruling <em>Adams </em>and decades\u2019 worth of other case law and reasoning that <em>\u201cStevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>... set forth a new interpretation of Article 23[.]\u201d <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 411, 48 A.3d at 258. In <em>Unger, </em>instead of meaningfully attempting to meet the high burden of establishing that <em>Adams </em>was clearly wrong and contrary to established principles, this Court simply adopted parts of the dissent in <em>Adams, see Unger, </em>427 Md. at 411, 48 A.3d at 258, and essentially copied-and-pasted several passages from the dissent in <em>Adams </em>into <em>Unger, compare Adams, </em>406 Md. at 312-36, 958 A.2d at 339-53 (Eldridge, J., dissenting) with <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 411-16, 48 A.3d at 258-61. Tellingly, in <em>Unger, </em>without any careful analysis, this Court stated that <em>Stevenson, Montgomery, </em>and <em>Adams </em>were merely \u201cerroneous,\u201d not \u201cclearly wrong and contrary to established princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>pies.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 417, 48 A.3d at 261, 262. Thus, the Majority is simply wrong in stating that \u201c[t]he <em>Unger </em>Court, in reaching the legal conclusions that it did, applied the very principles of, and exceptions to, the doctrine of stare decisis, [on which] the State relies ... in seeking a return to ... <em>Stevenson, Montgomery, </em>and <em>Adams[.]\u201d </em>Maj. Op. at 701, 122 A.3d at 299. Indeed, as Judge Harrell perceptively noted, this Court in <em>Unger, </em>much like the dissent in <em>Adams, </em>acted as though it were addressing \u201can open question requiring an answer, which, based on our holding in <em>Adams, </em>it clearly is not.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>427 Md. at 429, 48 A.3d at 269 (Harrell, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The dissent in <em>Adams </em>was clearly wrong and contrary to established principles in disputing that this Court consistently recognized that Article 23 and its predecessors mean that, in a criminal case, the jury is the judge of the law of the crime. And, in <em>Unger, </em>this Court was even more clearly wrong in overruling <em>Adams. </em>The only correct result is to overrule <em>Unger </em>and restore <em>Adams, Montgomery, </em>and <em>Stevenson </em>to their rightful place as good law consistent with more than a century\u2019s worth of this Court\u2019s precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Regrettably, this Court\u2019s precedent was not the only thing that <em>Unger </em>disturbed eons after it was thought to be settled. <em>Unger </em>opened the floodgates for individuals to exhume decades-old convictions for murder, rape, and other serious crimes. As a result, victims and their family members have been forced to relive traumatic experiences long after they thought that they had finally achieved closure. Additionally, dozens of individuals have been released in <em>Unger\u2019s </em>wake.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Despite <em>Unger\u2019s </em>consequences, the Majority refrains from overruling it, ostensibly based on good intentions and the honest belief that the Majority\u2019s decision bolsters <em>stare decisis.
