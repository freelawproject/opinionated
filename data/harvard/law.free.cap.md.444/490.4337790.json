The Relevant Land Use Regime in Prince George\u2019s County: A Mind-Numbing Primer</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Most judges and lawyers, and many public officials and members of the general public, are uninitiated (and perhaps even uninterested, unless their oxen are being gored) in the mysteries of land use regulation. With apologies particularly to the uninterested, the following introduction to the relevant zoning, planning, and land use regime in play virtually throughout all of Prince George\u2019s County (and the Regional District of which it is a part) is useful, if not essential, in order to grasp the context of the facts of this case and our decision to follow. Because the dispute is primarily about the source and terms of the locality\u2019s authority to regulate land use, we will explore first the well-spring of that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The modern authority to regulate land use in Maryland may be traced to the colonial Maryland Charter of 1632. The Charter granted to the Lord Proprietor \u201cfree, full, and absolute power ... to ordain, make, enact, and ... publish any laws <em>whatsoever.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Maryland Charter of 1632 (modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>for modern spelling). Much of this authority was wrested from the Proprietor by the legislative assembly prior to the colony achieving independence from Great Britain. <em>See generally </em>Albert J. Martinez, Jr., <em>The Palatinate Clause of the Maryland Charter, 1632-1776: From Independent Jurisdiction to Independence, </em>50 Am. J. Legal Hist. 305 (2008-2010). The State of Maryland retains this broad authority to regulate land use (and to delegate powers to the political subdivisions), subject only to the Federal and State constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">A. Delegation of Land Use Powers to Local Governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Maryland, like its sister states, delegates to local political subdivisions significant authority to regulate land use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1 Edward H.

Zoning and Planning Distinguished</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Although related concepts, it is well established in Maryland that zoning and planning are separate functions. <em>Appleton Reg\u2019l Cnty. Alliance v. Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Cecil Cnty., </em>404 Md. 92, 102, 945 A.2d 648, 653 (2008); <em>Mueller v.

Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 389, 408 A.2d 1017 (1979)). Maryland courts have parsed previously the distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Zoning is the more finite term. <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 528-29, 814 A.2d at 476-77. Generally, \u201cthe term \u2018zoning\u2019 is \u2018used to describe the process of setting aside disconnected tracts of land varying in shape and dimensions, and dedicating them to particular uses designed in some degree to serve the interests of the whole territory affected by the plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland Overpak Corp. v. Mayor And City Council Of Baltimore, </em>395 Md. 16, 48, 909 A.2d 235, 254 (2006) (quoting <em>Stephans, </em>286 Md. at 388-89, 408 A.2d at 1019). The \u201cterritorial division of land within a jurisdiction\u201d is \u201c[t]he very essence of zoning____\u201d <em>Mueller, </em>177 Md.App. at 67-68, 934 A.2d at 988 (citing <em>Heath v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>187 Md. 296, 305, 49 A.2d 799 (1946)). Parcels must be put to use in compliance with their zoning, excepting legal non-conforming uses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Planning is the broader term. <em>Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Cecil Cnty. v. Gaster, </em>285 Md. 233, 246, 401 A.2d 666, 672 (1979); <em>Mueller, 111 </em>Md.App. at 69, 934 A.2d at 989; <em>see also Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 529, 814 A.2d at 477-78 (stating that zoning is the more finite term). Planning concerns \u201cthe development of a community, not only with respect to the uses of lands and buildings, but also with respect to streets, parks, civic beauty, industrial and commercial undertakings, residential developments and such other matters affecting the public convenience....\u201d <em>Gaster, </em>285 Md. at 246, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>401 A.2d at 672 (quoting 1 E.C. Yokley, <em>Zoning Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 1-2 (4th ed. 1978)). Unsurprisingly, the making of \u201cplans\u201d falls clearly under the ambit of \u201cplanning.\u201d <em>See Rylyns </em>Enterprises, 372 Md. at 529, 814 A.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Included in the zoning or planning powers is also the authority to enforce zoning and planning actions and decisions. For example, Maryland courts recognize the requirement and issuance of building and occupancy permits as part of the zoning power, <em>Joy v. Anne Arundel Cnty., </em>52 Md.App. 653, 657-58, 451 A.2d 1237, 1240 (1982), and subdivision controls as an element of the exercise of the planning power, <em>Richmarr Holly Hills, Inc. v. Am. PCS, L.P., </em>117 Md.App. 607, 645-46, 701 A.2d 879, 898 (1997). Just as the power to zone implies more than establishing classifications and placing them on an official map, so too does the planning power encompass more than merely producing plans and acting on subdivision applications. Because \u201cplanning and zoning complement each other and serve certain common objectives,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore Cnty. v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 689, 929 A.2d 899, 915 (2007); <em>accord Richmarr, </em>117 Md.App. at 650, 701 A.2d at 900 (quoting 4 R. Anderson, <em>American Law of Zoning </em>\u00a7 23.20 (2nd ed. 1977)), some implementation and enforcement procedures may have both planning and zoning aims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>C. Zoning in General</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Maryland\u2019s first local zoning enabling statute was enacted by the General Assembly in 1927 authorizing zoning in Baltimore City and other municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>1927 Md. Laws ch. 705. In reliance on this delegation, Baltimore City enacted its first comprehensive zoning ordinance on 30 March 1931.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Jack Lewis, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>164 Md. 146, 148, 164 A. 220, 221 (1933). Since then, counties (both charter and otherwise) have been delegated also zoning powers. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (2012), Land Use Article \u00a7\u00a7 4-102, 22-104 (\u201cLU\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\n<em>1. Original and Comprehensive Zoning Versus Piecemeal Zoning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Local zoning authorities implement their delegated zoning authority through \u201cestablishment of original zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>through adoption of a [an original] zoning map, comprehensive rezoning of substantial areas of the jurisdiction through a legislative-type process initiated by the local government, and piecemeal rezoning of individual properties (by application of the owner or contract purchaser) through a quasi-judicial process.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel Cnty. v. Bell, </em>442 Md. 539, 553, 113 A.3d 639, 647 (2015) (citing <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 532, 814 A.2d at 479). Original zoning and, by definition, comprehensive rezoning involve large geographic areas and emanate largely from policy considerations, including future public needs, potential for orderly growth, and the public health, safety, and general welfare to be advanced.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Bell, </em>442 Md. at 553-54, 113 A.3d at 647-48 (citing <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 713, 376 A.2d 483, 498 (1977)). Piecemeal rezonings, in contrast, concern an individual property (or a relatively finite assemblage of properties) that is rezoned through a deliberative fact-finding process, including \u201cat least one evidentiary hearing (generally), factual and opinion testimony, documentary evidence, cross-examination of the witnesses, and objections to the weighing of evidence.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>442 Md. at 555, 113 A.3d at 649 (citing <em>Anderson House, LLC v. Mayor of Rockville, </em>402 Md. 689, 708 n. 17, 939 A.2d 116, 127 n. 17 (2008)). The piecemeal rezoning \u201cprocess results in a particularized set of written findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the zoning proposal for the parcel or assemblage in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>processes conclude with a legislative act creating or altering the official zoning map for the jurisdiction. <em>Anderson House, </em>402 Md. at 707 n. 17, 939 A.2d at 127 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The scope of review by Maryland courts of the legislative decisions embodied in original zonings and comprehensive rezonings is quite narrow.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These actions \u201c \u2018are limited only by the general boundaries of appropriate procedural and due process considerations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell, </em>442 Md. at 554, 113 A.3d at 648 (quoting <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 533, 814 A.2d at 480.) Courts look to whether the local zoning authority: (1) followed the appropriate procedure designated by the zoning enabling statute and its own ordinances; (2) comported with the requirements of due process; (3) aimed to achieve a valid public purpose; and, (4) did not otherwise exceed the police powers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>at 533, 814 A.2d at 480 (quoting <em>White v. Spring, </em>109 Md.App. 692, 696-97, 675 A.2d 1023, 1025 (1996)). Properly enacted original zoning and comprehensive rezoning are presumed to be correct and may only be changed by the local zoning authority through later comprehensive zoning or an application for piecemeal rezoning. <em>Bell, </em>442 Md. at 554, 554 n. 6, 113 A.3d at 648, 648 n. 6 (quoting <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 535-36, 814 A.2d at 481).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Courts are somewhat less deferential in their review of quasi-judicial piecemeal rezoning.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Like other quasi-judicial decisions, piecemeal rezoning is reviewed most frequently under the substantial evidence test. <em>Cremins v.

The number of classifications that are available to be applied within a district has increased exponentially since the early schemes, but Euclidian zoning remains a basic framework for implementation of land use controls at the local level. 1 <em>Rathkopfs The Law of Zoning and Planning </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1:4, 1:5; <em>see also, e.g., </em>Prince George\u2019s County Code \u00a7 27-109 (\u201cPGCC\u201d) (listing the categories of zones that have been created in Prince George\u2019s County).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Euclidian zoning aimed to provide stability and predictability in land use planning and zoning. <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 534, 814 A.2d at 481.

The Land Use Article of the Maryland Code requires certain elements to be contained in comprehensive plans. LU \u00a7\u00a7 1-106, 3-102.

These plans are prepared by the Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission (which is composed of separate planning boards for each county; the two boards sit together on bi-county issues and separately on matters that pertain purely to its respective county) and must be approved by the local legislature of the respective county. <em>See </em>LU \u00a7\u00a7 14-101(b), 14-101(f), 21-202, 21-208(a).

Explaining the reasons for creating comprehensive design zones, PGCC \u00a7 27-476 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">(1) It is within the ultimate objectives of the District Council\u2019s authority (under Article 28 of the Annotated Code of Maryland) to use recent planning and zoning innovations;</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">(2) The demands for housing, commercial and industrial activities, and related public facilities and services are undergoing substantial and rapid changes, requiring improved methods of land use control; and</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">(3) There is a need to encourage the optional and imaginative utilization of land contemplated by Comprehensive Design Zones in order to:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">(A) Improve the total environment;</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">(B) Lessen the public costs associated with land development and use;</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>(C) Fulfill the purposes of each individual Comprehensive Design Zone; and</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">(D) Fulfill the recommendations and purposes of the General Plan, Master Plans, or Sector Plans in selected areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Each type of comprehensive design zone has also its own goals, but all are aimed generally at encouraging good development. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-478(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">To take advantage of the flexibility provided by the comprehensive design zones, a developer must seek first to change the present zoning of a parcel by submitting an application for zoning map amendment and accompanying Basic Plan.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-187, 27-195(a)(1). The application and Basic Plan must demonstrate that the entire proposed development will conform to the relevant criteria for the proposed zone. PGCC \u00a7 27-195(b). The Planning Board provides the District Council with an analysis and recommendation regarding the application. PGCC \u00a7 27-192; <em>see also </em>LU \u00a7 22-208. If the District Council approves the zoning map amendment, it may specify particular permitted land use types and planning and development guidelines that must be followed by the applicant and subsequent owners in the subsequent approval processes. PGCC \u00a7 27-195(a)(1). The District Council may impose also conditions on the property along with the new zoning classification. PGCC \u00a7 27 \u2014 195(c); <em>see also </em>LU \u00a7 22-214(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">If the District Council approves the application and Basic Plan, thereby rezoning the property, the applicant must submit next a Comprehensive Design Plan (\u201cCDP\u201d) and a Specific Design Plan (\u201cSDP\u201d).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> PGCC \u00a7 27-487(a). The CDP is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>second step in the evolutionary detailing of what the applicant proposes to develop on the property. The applicant must provide, among other things, preliminary drawings, details, and designs of the actual proposed development. PGCC \u00a7 27 \u2014 518(b).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The third step, the SDP,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> includes additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and greater development detail. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-527(b).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Development and use of the property must comply with the approved SDP, which binds future owners as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>applicant, unless a revision is sought and approved. PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-529, 27-530.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The Planning Board, after its technical planning staff reviews an applicant\u2019s submissions and makes a recommendation, holds a public evidentiary hearing. Thereafter, it approves or denies a CDP or SDP (with or without conditions). PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-522, 27-528. To receive approval, the plans must meet certain requirements set out in PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-521 and 27-528.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">PGCC \u00a7 27-521 details several findings that the Planning Board must make in order to approve a CDP. The first is that the CDP is in conformance with the approved Basic Plan, and certain zoning requirements. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-521(a)(1), 27-223(b)(3)(B), 27-195.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The CDP must demonstrate more, however, than showing simply that the proposed development would comply with the property\u2019s zoning. Among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>things, the CDP must demonstrate: (1) that it \u201cwould result in a development with a <em>better environment </em>than could be achieved under other regulations[,]\u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-521(a)(2) (emphasis added); (2) \u201cthe preservation and/or restoration of the regulated environmental features in a natural state to the <em>fullest extent possible[,]\u201d </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-521(a)(11) (emphasis added); and, (3) that \u201c[ajpproval is <em>warranted </em>by the way in which the Comprehensive Design Plan includes design elements, facilities, and amenities, and satisfies the needs of the residents, employees, or guests of the project[,]\u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-521(a)(3) (emphasis added). Although the County Code indicates the appropriate considerations, the Planning Board (and its technical planning staff) must exercise expertise and judgment to determine whether to approve a CDP, wielding necessarily significant discretion in that endeavor. The considerations governing the decision are the essence of planning.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The Planning Board\u2019s discretion to deny an SDP is cabined. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-528(c) (\u201cThe Planning Board may only deny the Specific Design Plan if it does not meet the requirements of Section 27-528(a) and (b), above.\u201d). The Planning Board must approve an SDP unless the submission fails to: (1) conform to the CDP, the Landscape Manual, or the applicable design guidelines and regulations; (2) demonstrate that the development will be served adequately by existing or programmed public facilities within a reasonable time; (3) demonstrate that surface water will be handled adequately; (4) conform with an approved Type 2 Tree Conservation Plan; and, (5) demonstrate that regulated environmental features <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>are preserved and/or restored to the full extent possible.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> PGCC \u00a7 27-528(a). Nonetheless, the Planning Board must still exercise significant agency expertise and judgment in making these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The decision of the Planning Board as regards a CDP or an SDP is subject to review by the District Council. PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-523(a), 27-528.01. Any person of record before the Planning Board may appeal the decision to the District Council (which did not occur in the present case), or the District Council may elect on its initiative to review (\u201ccall up\u201d) the decision (which is what happened here). <em>Cf. </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-523(a). The District Council may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the Planning Board, or remand the case to the Planning Board for further consideration. PGCC \u00a7 27-523(a). In the present case, we are asked to consider what is the proper role of the District Council in reviewing decisions of the Planning Board and the standard(s) by which the District Council may review the Planning Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Now we shall bring down to earth somewhat this opinion. The property at the heart of this dispute (the \u201cEdwards Property\u201d) is a triangular 4.14 acre parcel in Adelphi, Prince George\u2019s County. The parcel is bounded by Adelphi Road, Edwards Way, and Riggs Road. Zimmer Development Company (\u201cZimmer\u201d), a national real estate developer based in Wilmington, North Carolina, wishes to construct on the Edwards Property a small retail center with a CVS store as the primary tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The Edwards Property was zoned originally R-R (Rural Residential), a Euclidian single-family, detached residential zone, which would not allow development of a retail center on the Property. In 2004, after Edwards Commercial Properties\u2019 <footnotemark>49</footnotemark> submission of an application for a zoning map amendment of the parcel to L-A-C (Local Activity Zone),<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> a floating zone, together with a Basic Plan depicting how it would develop the property generally, the County Council for Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as the District Council, adopted Zoning Ordinance 10-2004 granting the requested rezoning to the L-A-C zone, subject to several conditions. Zoning Ordinance 10-2004 required as conditions the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">1. The Basic Plan shall be revised to show the following rights-of-way along the frontages of the subject property:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>MD 212 \u2014 40 feet from center line (toward the ultimate right-of-way of 80 feet); Adelphi <em>Road </em>\u2014 50 <em>feet </em>from center line (toward the ultimate right of way of 100 feet); Edwards Way \u2014 35 feet from center line (in accordance with Zoning Ordinance requirements adjacent to commercial zone).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">2. The Applicant will provide a double left-turn lane along southbound/westbound MD 212 at the approach of Adelphi Road. Timing of this improvement will be determined at the preliminary plan of subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">3. Prior to the approval of the Specific Design Plan for the subject property, the applicant shall submit an acceptable traffic signal warrant study to the County Department of Public Works and Transportation (DPW &amp; T) for the intersection of Adelphi Road and Edwards Way. The Applicant shall use a new 12-hour count and shall analyze signal warrants under total future traffic as well as existing traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">4. During the review of Preliminary Plan of Subdivision, the Applicant shall provide more detailed operational analyses at the intersections of MD 212/Edwards Way and MD212/site entrance. The scope of these analyses will be determined after approval of the proposed Basic Plan and in consideration of the permitted access to the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">5. Total commercial development of the subject 4.14 acre site shall be limited to a maximum of 40,000 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">6. During the Comprehensive Design Plan and subdivision review, the Applicant shall address the addition of public streets to accomplish access from Adelphi Road or obtain a variance from Section 24-121 of the Subdivision Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">7. Development of the subject property shall have a woodland conservation threshold of 20 percent. If off-site mitigation is proposed, the first priority for mitigation sites shall be within the Anacostia Watershed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">8. During the Comprehensive Design Plan and Specific Design Plan review, the Applicant shall address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>A. Architectural design shall be distinctive in order to create an image of quality and permanence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">B. A build-to line shall be considered in order to create an inviting streetseape.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">C. The streetseape shall create a pedestrian-friendly environment with consideration of the following elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">(1) Street furniture including pedestrian lighting</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">(2) Trash receptacles</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">(3) Bike racks</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">(4) Pedestrian crosswalks should be a contrasting paving materials</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">(5) Need for bus stop[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">D. Massive surface parking facilities adjacent to either Riggs or Adelphi Road shall be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">E. An architectural focal point and/or sculpture located within a green area shall be provided at the intersection of Adelphi and Riggs Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">F. No loading and/or dumpster areas shall be visible from adjacent roadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">G. The design plans shall address the entire property, so that the final development of the individual lots creates a visually cohesive development, compatible in regard to architectural treatment and site layout.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">9. Additional conditions of approval:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">A. The leadership of the Buck Lodge Citizen\u2019s Association, White Oak Manor Civic Association, and Hampton\u2019s Association will each nominate two representatives and one alternate to participate with the developer of the subject property in regular meetings, scheduled by the developer, during each of the phases of development (including but not limited to the Preliminary Plan of Subdivision, Comprehensive Design Plan, and Specific Design Plan) of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">B. At the time of Preliminary Plan Application, the developer of the subject property shall include the intersection of Metzerott Road and Riggs Road in its traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>study, to demonstrate the adequacy of transportation facilities in the surrounding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">C. Any required widening and improvements to the public rights-of-way for Riggs Road, Adelphi Road, and Edwards Way shall include five-foot sidewalks, in accordance with applicable State and County Standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">D.

Such improvements will be determined at the time of Preliminary Plan Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">F. The developer of the subject property shall work with the various transit authorities and agencies to maintain the locations of the existing bus stops along Riggs Road and Adelphi Road. The developer shall construct a bus pull-off area to allow the loading and unloading of passengers out of the travel lanes of the roadways, within the public rights-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">G. The developer of the subject property shall work with the Prince George\u2019s Department of the Environment, to utilize low impact stormwater management techniques to the degree practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">H. The developer of the subject property shall take all reasonable actions to alleviate and reduce the possibility of crime occurring on or adjacent to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">j.[<footnotemark>51</footnotemark>] qpiie developer shall keep clean all areas of the subject property, during and after development.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>K. The developer shall incorporate trees, shrubs, open areas, flowers, walkways, and lighting into the site plan. The property shall be cleared of poorly lit or secluded areas, and adequate safety lighting shall be installed to improve visibility into the site and deter illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">10. The developer shall make its best efforts to include a restaurant as an ancillary tenant on the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Time passed. On 14 March 2011, Zimmer filed concurrently with the Commission a proposed Comprehensive Design Plan-1001 (\u201cCDP-1001\u201d) and Specific Design Plan-1001 (\u201cSDP-1001\u201d) for the development of the Edwards Property. On 28 July 2011, the Planning Board held a public hearing on the applications. The technical staff of the Planning Board, having reviewed the submissions, recommended their approval with conditions. CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 were found by the Planning Board to comply with the approved Basic Plan and the planning standards applicable to CDPs and SDPs for the L-A-C zone and, consequently, were approved subject to conditions substantially similar to those recommended by the technical staff.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>No party to the Planning Board proceedings appealed. The District Council elected, however, to review the Planning Board\u2019s approval of the CDP and SDP, pursuant to PGCC \u00a7 27-523(a) and \u00a7 27-528.01(b). On 7 November 2011, the District Council held a public hearing and entertained oral arguments.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Seven days later, the District Council remanded CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 to the Planning Board to consider three specific areas of concern: (1) whether the lack of a community center and the destruction of the natural tree canopy could be mitigated through amenities benefiting the surrounding community; (2) whether the deforestation mitigation plans were adequate; and, (3) whether access for the nearby residents of Edwards Way could be improved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>compensate for the increase in traffic resulting from the proposed development.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">On 9 February 2012, and after its technical staff pondered the District Council\u2019s three areas of apparent concern, the Planning Board held a hearing to consider the specific issues identified in the District Council\u2019s remand. Four weeks after that hearing, the Planning Board issued amended resolutions, delineating additional findings and again approving CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, subject to substantially the same conditions.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Planning Board addressed each of the issues for which the District Council remanded the application. With respect to the lack of a community center, the Planning Board noted that the Edwards Property was of insufficient size for the construction of a community center. The Planning Board noted that, in the L-A-C zone, a \u201ccommunity center\u201d is not justified unless the tract comprises twenty adjoining acres, and a \u201cvillage center\u201d requires ten adjoining acres.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The Planning Board did require additionally Zimmer to provide a sculpture to the previously planned mini-park on the site and to include in its landscape plan flowering plants that were drought-resistant. With respect to the environmental concerns, the Planning Board explained how it arrived at its determination that none of the trees on the rather small lot could be retained and why the proposed mitigation for their loss was adequate. Finally, the Planning Board described its re-analysis of the traffic impacts on Edwards Way vis-a-vis the proposed development and the neighborhood, concluding that \u201c[t]he installation of a [traffic] signal at Adelphi Road and Edwards Way will greatly reduce delay for traffic using Edwards Way, and should reduce any queuing that currently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>occurs\u201d and that \u201c[n]o changes to the previously approved transportation-related conditions associated with the plan approval [were] warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">No party took an appeal, but the District Council elected again to review the Board\u2019s revised decisions regarding CDP-1001 and SDP-1001. On 21 May 2012, the District Council entertained oral arguments. A member of the Planning Board staff presented an overview of the proposed development and addressed the issues for which the District Council remanded the case to the Planning Board. The Planning Board staff member recommended approval of the CDP and SDP. The District Council had no questions for the staff member.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The attorney representing Zimmer was allowed thirty minutes to address the Council. On behalf of Zimmer, he concurred succinctly<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> with the Planning Board\u2019s assessment and stated that the conditions imposed by the Planning Board addressed the considerations remanded to the Planning Board. Although the attorney reserved the lion\u2019s share of his allowed time for questions from the District Council, none were forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The opposition (although none had appealed to the District Council) were given thirty minutes to speak. Two persons took the podium. A member of the Adelphi community and also of an ad hoc civic group \u201cPeople United for Fairness\u201d spoke. He argued that CDP-1001 should be denied because: (1) the property could be better used as a community meeting place (or potentially as a park); (2) the clearing of the woodlands would be damaging ecologically; (3) the runoff from the property and the general effect on the water table would damage nearby properties; (4) the development would endanger pedestrians; and, (5) response times for emergency vehicles would be compromised as a result of increased traffic. He questioned also the level of community involvement in the planning of the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The President of the Board of the Racquet Club Condominium, a property directly across Edwards Way from the proposed development, spoke in opposition as well. Her concern was primarily that the truck traffic accessing the finished development and the placement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Adelphi Road and Edwards Way would disrupt existing traffic patterns. According to her remarks, driveways serving approximately 530 housing units with ingress and egress on Edwards Way, which road suffered already from congestion, would be affected adversely. She complained also that there was no outreach by Zimmer or its affiliates to the Racquet Club Condominium community in the planning of the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In rebuttal, Zimmer\u2019s attorney highlighted the ways in which the community had been involved (or invited to be involved) in the planning process, including his direct contact with the President of the Board of the Racquet Club Condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The People\u2019s Zoning Counsel<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> spoke last. He stated that the case had \u201cbeen reviewed exhaustedly by the community\u201d and concurred with the Planning Board actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>At the close of the hearing, the Council member, in whose district the subject property lay, remarked: \u201cI think that this zone on this property, L-A-C, one of the main features of an L-A-C zone is supposed to be some tangible community benefit. And other than really a welcome sign, there isn\u2019t anything significant, you know, for this community.\u201d That Council member moved then for an Order of Denial, which motion was seconded. There being little discussion, the District Council Chair called for a vote. The vote was 9-0 to deny the CDP and SDP and to have its staff prepare an order of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The staff of the District Council generated the Order of Denial, with an attached memorandum explaining its conception of reasons for the proposed denial. The memorandum marshalled fourteen reasons. According to the memorandum, CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, as approved by the Planning Board, failed to meet several conditions of the 2004 zoning map amendment,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> fell below the minimum floor area ratio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>(FAR) for retail commercial development in a parcel zoned LA-C,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and did not justify adequately the failure to include a community center in its development.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The District Council, on 21 June 2012, adopted as its own the Order of Denial and attached memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">On 3 July 2012, Zimmer sought judicial review by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of the District Council\u2019s denial of SDP-1001 and CDP-1001. In a written opinion, the Circuit Court held, among other things, that: (1) the District Council had appellate jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction, to review the determinations of the Planning Board and, hence, was limited to determining whether the Planning Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal; (2) the District Council\u2019s review, under the circumstances, was limited further to the specific issues for which it remanded the case to the Planning Board; and, (3) the District Council substituted improperly its judgment for the judgment of the Planning Board, as there was substantial evidence supporting the Planning Board\u2019s determination on each of the remanded issues.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The Circuit Court reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the decision of the District Council and remanded the case to the District Council, with directions to approve CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, as approved by the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The District Council appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals (\u201cCSA\u201d). The intermediate appellate court affirmed. <em>Cnty. Council of Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Zimmer Dev. Co., </em>217 Md.App. 310, 331, 92 A.3d 601, 614 (2014). That court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) the District Council was authorized to exercise only appellate jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Planning Board regarding SDP-1001 and CDP-1001, and, hence, was restricted to determining whether the Planning Board decision was arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal; (2) PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) allowed for District Council review on the second call-up only of the remand issues; and, (3) the District Council\u2019s argument that each of its fourteen reasons for denying the applications was supported by substantial evidence was inapposite because only the remand issues were appropriate to consider and the District Council was authorized to reverse only arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal decisions by the Planning Board. <em>Zimmer Dev., </em>217 Md.App. at 318-31, 92 A.3d at 606-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The District Council sought our review of the case. We granted a writ of certiorari, <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Zimmer Dev. Corp., </em>440 Md. 114, 99 A.3d 778 (2014), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">1) Did the CSA err in its statutory construction of the \u201cRegional District Act\u201d (\u201cRDA\u201d) by holding that the District Council is vested with appellate rather than original jurisdiction over Planning Board preliminary determinations with respect to regional and legislative zoning matters?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>2) Did the CSA err by applying <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Curtis Regency, </em>121 Md.App. 123, [126, 708 A.2d 1058, 1059 (1998) ], even though it involved a preliminary planning matter rather than a legislative, regional zoning matter which conflicts with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Dutcher, Prince George\u2019s County v. Dutcher, </em>[365 Md. 399, 425, 780 A.2d 1137, 1152 (2001) ]?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">3) Whether the County Council\u2019s 1996 enactment of the County Code (\u201cPGCC\u201d) \u00a7 27 \u2014 132(f), providing that the District Council \u201cshall exercise original jurisdiction\u201d in its \u201creview [of] a decision made by ... the Planning Board,\u201d is consistent with the provisions of the RDA?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">4) Whether the CSA\u2019s holding improperly transfers the legislative, regional zoning authority expressly provided to the District Council by the RDA to the Planning Board, a subordinate agency?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">5) Whether the CSA\u2019s holding violates the separation of powers doctrine because the judiciary has divested the legislative body of its legislative authority over regional zoning, including the applications related to zoning map amendments sought here, specifically designated by State law?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">6) Whether the CSA nullified the District Council\u2019s statutory right to \u201cremand\u201d a case to the Planning Board for further information, and the District Council\u2019s obligation to issue a \u201cfinal\u201d decision prior to judicial review, by holding that the District Council is limited after remand to only those issues that were remanded?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">7) Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the CSA correctly held that the District Council's standard of review of the Planning Board\u2019s actions is the \u201carbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or illegal\u201d standard, then whether the CSA erred by reinstating the Planning Board\u2019s recommendations as to Zimmer\u2019s applications, instead of remanding for the District Council to apply the correct standard of review?</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>III. Judicial Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The questions posed in the District Council\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari may be condensed into three: (1) did the District Council have broad, original jurisdiction when considering the Planning Board\u2019s approvals of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, or did it have only a more limited, appellate-like jurisdiction; (2) was the District Council\u2019s ultimate consideration of the Planning Board\u2019s approvals limited to the issues remanded to the Planning Board; and, (3) assuming the District Council reviewed the Planning Board\u2019s decision using an improper standard, should the case have been remanded to the District Council to apply the correct standard?</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Each of these are legal questions, which we decide without deference to the judgments of the intermediate appellate court or Circuit Court. <em>Talbot Cnty. v. Miles Point Prop., LLC, </em>415 Md. 372, 384, 2 A.3d 344, 351 (2010). \u201cAccordingly, we \u2018look through the circuit court\u2019s and intermediate appellate court\u2019s decisions, although applying the same standards of review, and evaluate the decision of the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elms v. Renewal by Andersen, </em>439 Md. 381, 391, 96 A.3d 175, 181 (2014) (quoting <em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 681, 929 A.2d at 910). We consider often the expertise of an administrative agency tasked with implementing statutes when determining whether its decision was premised on an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 683, 929 A.2d at 911 (quoting <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 173, 783 A.2d 169, 178 (2001)). When a case before us presents solely conclusions of law respecting jurisdiction, however, we do not afford deference to the legal conclusions of the agency. <em>Miles Point Prop., </em>415 Md. at 384, 2 A.3d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">IV. The CDP and SDP Approval Process in the RDA</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">As noted previously, Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s authority to regulate land use within the Regional District is delegated by the RDA. <em>E.g., Ray\u2019s Used Cars, </em>398 Md. at 646, 922 A.2d at 503; <em>Brandywine Enterprises, </em>350 Md. at 342, 711 A.2d at 1347; <em>see also supra </em>note 30. The respective roles of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>District Council and Planning Board in the CDP and SDP approval process depend on the provisions of the RDA regarding that process, both express and reasonably implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The requirement that a CDP and a SDP must be approved before physical development may begin in comprehensive design zones is a process by which planning goals may be implemented. The RDA provides expressly for some methods to accomplish this task, but provides also a method by which additional functions not mentioned in the RDA may implement planning responsibilities. We look first to the methods provided for expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">A. Zoning Map Amendments</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The District Council asserts that CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 partake of the nature of zoning map amendments because they purport to carry out the approved Basic Plan. With respect to acting on zoning map amendments, the Planning Board provides only recommendations to the District Council. <em>See </em>LU \u00a7\u00a7 22-208, 20-202(b).<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The conclusion of the District Council\u2019s syllogism is, therefore, that the Planning Board\u2019s approval of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 was merely a recommendation. The argument continues that, because the Planning Board\u2019s approval was a recommendation, and such a recommendation in the instance of a zoning process has no inherent legal weight, the District Council had original authority to decide differently the action to be taken regarding CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, without any deference owed or presumptive correctness accorded the Planning Board\u2019s determination. The form of the District Council\u2019s logic tracks, to a point \u2014 Planning Board decisions in Prince George\u2019s County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>regarding zoning map amendments are mere recommendations to the District Council \u2014 but falters with its first major premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 were not zoning map amendments, nor do they partake of the character of such. The act of rezoning the Edwards Property was completed in 2004 when the District Council approved the L-A-C zone and the Basic Plan for the proposed development by virtue of Zoning Ordinance 10-2004.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> This ordinance was the legislative act establishing the rezoning. After the legislative act, the property was zoned L-A-C, subject to the conditions enumerated in Zoning Ordinance 10-2004.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The subsequent CDP and SDP steps required were to ensure that the development proposed for the Edwards Property addressed the planning implementation goals required for the specific comprehensive design zone involved. The CDP and SDP steps are designed as an increasingly more rigorous path to flesh-out the details and specifics of the proposed development. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-518, 27-521, 27-527, 27-528.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Neither party here supplies an alternative theory explaining the source of authority within the RDA for the establishment of the requirements of the CDP and SDP processes. In an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>abundance of caution, we will consider other possible options in aid of our task to discover Legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">B. Are They Processes to Raise Zoning Questions?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">One possibility is that CDPs and SDPs operate as a process to raise zoning questions. LU \u00a7 20-503(a) states that \u201c[b]y zoning law, a district council may provide for: (1) the issuance of use and occupancy permits; and (2) a process to raise a zoning question before the preparation of all structural specifications of a building or structure that may be required for a complete building permit.\u201d Although CDPs and SDPs are not \u201cuse and occupancy\u201d permits, which are treated separately in the PGCC, <em>see </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-253, \u201ca process to raise a zoning question\u201d is broad and could encompass conceivably actions like CDP and SDP approval.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">LU \u00a7 20-503 does not describe expressly the authority of the District Council to review <em>de novo </em>Planning Board actions on CDPs and SDPs as part of a scheme to raise and resolve zoning questions. With regard to building permits, the statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 By zoning law, a district council may provide for:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">(1) the issuance of use and occupancy permits; and</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">(2) a process [<footnotemark>66</footnotemark>] to raise a zoning question before the preparation of all structural specifications of a building or structure that may be required for a complete building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>(b) <em>Montgomery County. </em>\u2014 In Montgomery County, all building permit applications shall be referred to the Commission for review and recommendation as to zoning requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">(c) <em>Prince George\u2019s County. </em>\u2014 In Prince George\u2019s County, the County Council, by local law, may provide for the referral of some or all building permit applications to the Commission for review and recommendation as to zoning requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">LU \u00a7 20-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Despite excluding the Planning Board from making final determinations as to the issuance of building permits, the RDA does not specify which agency has original jurisdiction over building permits or other elements of a process to raise zoning questions. LU \u00a7 20-513 grants to the District Council broad authority to impose and implement building codes, in part through permitting. The District Council is not limited expressly in its delegation or retention of the original jurisdiction to make these decisions.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> <em>See </em>LU \u00a7 20-513(g) (\u201cA building code adopted under this section shall be enforced by the officers designated in the county charter or county code.\u201d).<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Although categorizing CDPs and SDPs as a process contemplated by LU \u00a7 20-503 would provide a simple resolution to the present case, that is not a good fit with the permits and certificates contemplated by the section. The deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>agency wields narrower discretion regarding the issuance of building permits and use and occupancy permits. \u201c[T]he issuance of building permits in respect to applications that fully comply with applicable ordinances and regulations of a particular subdivision is a ministerial act.\u201d <em>Evans v. Burruss, </em>401 Md. 586, 605, 933 A.2d 872, 883 (2007). Use and occupancy permits are concerned primarily with discrete standards as well. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-257 (stating that the issuance of a use and occupancy permit certifies that the building, structure, and use meet the requirements of Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s zoning ordinances); <em>Cowles v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>123 Md.App. 426, 439, 718 A.2d 678, 685 (1998) (describing the considerations of the Board of Appeals of Montgomery County regarding a use and occupancy permit). The review of a CDP and SDP, on the other hand, requires planning expertise and the exercise of a broad range of discretion. <em>See supra </em>at Part I.F. In addition, applications for (and issuance of) building permits and use &amp; occupancy certificates would follow approval of a CDP and SDP in the development process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">More to the heart of the matter, zoning compliance is not at the heart of the CDP and SDP approval process. Although compliance with zoning is one element the agency making the decision must find to approve a CDP or SDP, it must decide also many more quintessential planning matters. <em>See supra </em>at Part I.F. The focus of the CDP and SDP process is the development of a community, including the civic beauty, local infrastructure, and environmental concerns. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-521, 27-528. The purpose of the process is to \u201cresult in a development with a better environment than could be achieved under other regulations!,]\u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-521(a)(2), not a development that complies only with zoning and other land use regulation. Thus, LU \u00a7 20-503(a) may be eliminated as a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d for the resolution of the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">C. Is There an Apt Analogy to be Made to the Detailed Site Plan Process?</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In many ways, CDPs and SDPs are similar in the Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>George\u2019s County land development processes to Detailed Site Plans.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Detailed Site Plans are required for \u201ccertain types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>land development [that] are best regulated by a combination of development standards and a discretionary review----\u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-281. Where required, Detailed Site Plans generally must be approved before a final plat of subdivision<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> or grading, building, or use of occupancy permits may be approved or issued. PGCC \u00a7 27-270 (specifying order of approvals); <em>see also </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-281.01 (stating generally the circumstances under which a Detailed Site Plan must be approved before permits are issued). The general purposes of Detailed Site Plans are:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">(A) To provide for development in accordance with the principles for the orderly, planned, efficient and economical development contained in the General Plan, Master Plan, or other approved plan;</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">(B) To help fulfill the purposes of the zone in which the land is located;</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">(C) To provide for development in accordance with the site design guidelines established in this Division; and</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">(D) To provide approval procedures that are easy to understand and consistent for all types of Detailed Site Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">PGCC \u00a7 27 \u2014 281(b)(2). These are planning considerations, like those underlying the process for the approval of CDPs and SDPs. The required content of a Detailed Site Plan is most similar to that of an SDP. <em>Compare </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-282 (indicating the content required in a Detailed Site Plan),<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> <em>with </em>PGCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u00a7 27-527 (quoted <em>supra </em>note 44) (indicating the content required in an SDP). In a generic sense, CDPs and SDPs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>glorified site plans.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The approval process regarding Detailed Design Plans under LU \u00a7 25-210<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> is similar to the process the District Council argues applies here to CDPs and SDPs. The District Council is authorized expressly to \u201creview a final decision of the county planning board to approve or disapprove a detailed site plan.\u201d LU \u00a7 25-210(a). Parties of record before the District Council may appeal to the District Council a decision of the Planning Board, or the District Council may review the decisions on its initiative. LU \u00a7 25-210(a). The District Council\u2019s determination after review is \u201ca final decision.\u201d LU \u00a7 25-210(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">LU \u00a7 25-210 does not prescribe, however, the standard of review by which the District Council considers decisions of the Planning Board (nor did Art. 28, \u00a7 8-129) regarding Detailed Site Plans. The District Council\u2019s review results in a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d according to LU \u00a7 25-210(d), but LU \u00a7 25-210(a) labels also the decision of the Planning Board as \u201ca final decision.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Despite their similarities, key differences exist between the CDP and SDP process and the Detailed Site Plan process. A Detailed Site Plan is required to demonstrate that its design \u201crepresents a reasonable alternative for satisfying the site design guidelines, without requiring unreasonable costs and without detracting substantially from the utility of the proposed development for its intended use.\u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-285(a)(1). It is a method of moderating design guidelines so as to allow for greater variety of development, while still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>achieving the goals of the guidelines. The CDP and SDP process, in contrast, is a broader implementation of planning considerations, aimed at producing \u201ca better environment than could be achieved under other regulations.... \u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-521(a)(2). In the final analysis, CDPs and SDPs are not Detailed Site Plans by another name.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The PGCC\u2019s treatment is determinative because the CDP and SDP process and the Detailed Site Plan process were in existence when the Legislature enacted Senate Bill 901 of 2011, which was codified as Art. 28, \u00a7 8-129 and re-codified in LU \u00a7 25-210.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The intent of the Legislature was to regulate Detailed Site Plans as that term was used in Prince George\u2019s County in 2011. If the Legislature intended CDPs and SDPs to be regulated similarly and under the same statute, we must assume that it would have done so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">D. Enforcement of Conditional Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">As noted earlier, the RDA has authorized since 1968 Prince George\u2019s County to engage in conditional rezoning. <em>See </em>Art. 28, \u00a7 8 \u2014 104(e)(1) (re-codified as LU \u00a7 22-214).<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The RDA provides also for the District Council to \u201cadopt local laws necessary to provide adequate notice, public hearings, and enforcement procedures for the implementation [of such authority.]\u201d LU \u00a7 22-214. Although the RDA provides expressly for the District Council to adopt the local laws to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>implement conditional zoning, it is silent regarding the District Council\u2019s authority to review the actions of an agency to which is delegated execution of the enforcement procedures the Council creates. <em>See </em>LU \u00a7 22-214.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Conditional zoning, when used to impose requirements related to design, layout, siting, appearance, and landscaping (as opposed to the <em>uses </em>of the land) is related closely to planning.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>at Part I.C.4. The majority of the conditions applied to the approval of the L-A-C zone and the Basic Plan for the Edwards Property involved planning considerations. Eleven of the conditions on the property were related to traffic impact alleviation, accommodation of mass transit, and the procurement of such. Eight concerned design, architecture, or landscaping. Others required certain streetscape infrastructure, efforts at crime reduction, woodland conservation, storm-water management, and the inclusion of civic groups in the design process. Only two conditions involved solely the commercial land uses to be developed on the property, which limited commercial development to 40,000 square feet and required the developer to make its \u201cbest efforts\u201d to include a restaurant as an ancillary tenant on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The CDP and SDP processes may be used as a tool to realize the planning goals of conditional zoning and to guide the design of the proposed development, especially when the conditions refer to matters that must be addressed coincidentally through the legislative requirements of the CDP and SDP processes. It appears that CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 were used as such with regard to the Edwards Property. Most of the justifications offered by the District Council for denying CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 involved perceived failures to address adequately conditions imposed on the Edwards Property during the rezoning. <em>See supra </em>note 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Were it used only to consider and implement the conditions imposed on the piecemeal rezoning, perhaps the CDP and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>SDP review and approval processes could be seen as extensions of the District Council\u2019s \u201cenforcement procedures for the implementation of\u2019 its conditional zoning, as provided for by LU \u00a7 22-214(e). Guiding development to comply with conditional zoning requirements could be termed \u201cenforcement,\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> and the CDP and SDP approval processes could be termed a \u201cprocedure.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Under the PGCC, however, the CDP and SDP processes do much more than implement conditional zoning. It implements planning considerations to achieve a better development than would otherwise be achievable. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-521(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The CDP and SDP processes would be necessary even if the District Council, upon approving a piecemeal rezoning, attached no conditions on a rezoning. The developer would need still to satisfy the legislative findings set out in PGCC \u00a7 27-521 for the CDP and PGCC \u00a7 27-528 for the SDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 provide useful illustration of how the CDP and SDP processes extend more proportionately to matters outside the potential reach of conditional zoning. The District Council justified its denial of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, in part, on the failure to consider adequately a community center. None of the conditions or express requirements of the PGCC require a community center in every development of L-A-C zoned property, but the District Council recognized correctly that the CDP and SDP processes involve more than implementing static zoning requirements and the conditions imposed on the property\u2019s rezoning, or achieving uniformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>throughout the district. It implements the planning purposes of the comprehensive design zone at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">E. Assignment of Other Functions</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">LU \u00a7 20-207 provides a method by which functions that are not assigned otherwise in the RDA may be implemented in the Regional District and by which local governmental body. According to the statute, \u201cfunctions not specifically allocated in this subtitle shall be assigned to the Commission or to one or both of the county planning boards, as needed.\u201d LU \u00a7 20-207(a). Because no provision of the RDA deals expressly with CDPs or SDPs, and the similar or related land use actions that are detailed expressly by the RDA do not perform identical or sufficiently similar functions as the CDP and SDP approval processes, LU \u00a7 20-207 is a source of authority in the RDA by which a role in the CDP and SDP approval processes may be seen as delegated to the Planning Board.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">LU \u00a7 20-207 imposes two requirements on the allocation of \u201cadditional functions.\u201d First, the assignments must be approved by the District Council and by the MNCPPC. LU \u00a7 22-207(b)(l). The District Council has provided its approval, as demonstrated by PGCC \u00a7\u00a7 27-522 and 27-528, which authorize initial consideration by the Planning Board.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>MNCPPC appears to have accepted the assignment, as the Planning Board considers, in practice, CDPs and SDPs.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Assignment to the Planning Board of additional functions must also \u201ccarry out the policy that local or intracounty planning functions should be performed by the county planning boards.\u201d LU \u00a7 20-207(b)(2). Performance by the Planning Board of a plan implementation process carries out undoubtedly that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">V. Original Authority to Approve or Deny CDPs and SDPs</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">As we described <em>supra </em>at Part I.E, the RDA grants to the Planning Board and to the District Council certain powers. LU \u00a7 20 \u2014 202(b)(i) provides that the county planning boards have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over \u201clocal functions,\u201d but does not detail each of the local functions within each jurisdiction.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>85</footnotemark> These functions may include any local matter related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>to planning, zoning, subdivision, or assignment of street names and house numbers. <em>See </em>LU \u00a7 20-202(a).<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The functions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>delegated to the county planning boards pursuant to LU \u00a7 20-207 are among the unlisted local functions over which the planning boards have exclusive jurisdiction. The Legislature did not itemize expressly or exhaustively each such intended function, for apparent good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The RDA makes particular provision for the local functions that the Legislature did not intend to be within the planning boards\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction. LU \u00a7 20-503(c) authorizes the District Council to refer for advice only some or all building permits to the Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission for review and recommendation as to zoning compliance. LU \u00a7 22-208 requires referral to the county planning boards of applications for zoning map amendments for a \u201crecommendation.\u201d Although unclear on its face as to the standard of review, LU \u00a7 25-210 authorizes, in Prince George\u2019s County, the District Council to \u201creview\u201d the \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Planning Board, and issue a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">CDP and SDP approvals were not among the local functions that the Legislature excepted from the planning boards\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction. Because no alternative provision was made, the RDA indicates to us that, like other unspecified local planning functions, the Planning Board is invested with exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>sive original jurisdiction over the determination of CDPs and SDPs,<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> subject to appellate review by the District Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">For the authority of the Planning Board to be \u201cexclusive\u201d or \u201coriginal\u201d with respect to the CDP and SDP approval processes, the Planning Board must be the <em>de novo </em>decision-maker regarding the merits of a CDP or an SDP. The District Council, if allowed to decide <em>de novo </em>whether a CDP or an SDP should be approved, violates the division of authority established by the RDA. A provision of the county ordinance, such as PGCC \u00a7 27 \u2014 132(f), that purports to give the District Council (or any other body) the authority to decide, <em>de novo, </em>a local function related to planning, zoning, subdivision, <em>or </em>the assignment of street names and house numbers, is invalid. The District Council may not arrogate to itself original jurisdiction where the RDA places that responsibility elsewhere. Only the General Assembly, through amendment of the RDA, may accomplish that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The PGCC purports to direct the District Council to engage in this prohibited <em>de novo </em>review. PGCC \u00a7 27-528(d), which governs the review by the District Council of Planning Board decisions regarding a CDP, requires the District Council to \u201cmake the same findings which are required to be made by the Planning Board\u201d before approving the CDP. PGCC \u00a7 27-528.01 governs the District Council\u2019s review of SDP decisions, requiring the same procedures that are required in reviewing a CDP, including presumably that the District Council must make the same findings that were required to be made by the Planning Board. PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f) eliminates any doubt as to whether the District Council\u2019s range of discretion was desired to be substantively the same as that of the Planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Board, when considering the same issues. According to PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f), \u201c[i]n deciding an appeal to the District Council, or Council election to review a decision, the Council shall exercise original jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">To the extent that the provisions of the PGCC purport to give the District Council the ability to consider <em>de novo </em>the merits of Planning Board decisions regarding CDPs and SDPs, such provisions are invalid. Because, according to PGCC \u00a7 27-106, the provisions are severable, they are still enforceable to the extent that they do not conflict with the original jurisdiction of the Planning Board under the RDA.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">VI. Standard by which the District Council may Review Planning Board Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">The parties agree that the District Council has authority to exercise some level of review of the Planning Board\u2019s decisions regarding approval of CDPs and SDPs.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>That authority would derive implicitly from the legislative powers granted to the District Council in the RDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Pursuant to the RDA, the district councils are authorized sometimes to establish procedures by which decisions are made, even though the review of content of the decision is outside their purview.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The MNCPPC, along with the constituent planning boards, are responsible for developing plans, but, under the RDA, the district councils establish the procedures through which the plans are developed, adopted, and applied. <em>See </em>LU \u00a7 21-201 (a) (\u201cThis subtitle is intended to vest control over planning procedures in the district councils of Montgomery County and Prince George\u2019s County, to the extent that control is not inconsistent with this division.\u201d). Although delegation to the Planning Board of enforcement procedures to implement the District Council\u2019s conditional zoning authority would fall also under LU \u00a7 20-207, and hence be exclusively within the original jurisdiction of the Planning Board, the RDA provides specifically for the District Council to establish procedures in that regard. LU \u00a7 22-214(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">It does not violate the RDA for the District Council to establish procedures and processes by which the Planning Board approves or denies CDPs and SDPs. Establishing procedures to guide the consideration of administrative action is a legislative function, which the RDA grants to the district councils in most instances. Further, the ability to create and modify procedures may be inherent in the assignment of additional functions to the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Through its ability to establish procedure, the District Council may carve-out for itself a role in the CDP and SDP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>approval process by requiring that, upon appeal to the District Council or upon its election to hear a matter, the case be considered by the District Council before a decision may become final. If the District Council agrees with the Planning Board or remands for further consideration the CDP or SDP, it does not interfere with the original jurisdiction afforded to the Planning Board. The effect of those actions, although not inconsequential necessarily, is only procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">When the District Council reverses the Planning Board\u2019s determination regarding the approval of a CDP or SDP, however, the District Council risks interfering with the jurisdiction committed to the Planning Board. A Planning Board decision is vulnerable if it is not authorized by law, is not supported by substantial evidence of record, or is arbitrary or capricious. When the standard of administrative appellate review used by the District Council mimics the standard of review that would be employed by the courts for the review of the same agency action, it is not interfering with the jurisdiction of the Planning Board. Employing a less deferential standard of review, however, would impinge on the original jurisdiction granted to the Planning Board by the RDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Judicial review of administrative agency action based on factual findings, and the application of law to those factual findings, is \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore Cnty., </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994). The reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. <em>United Parcel Serv., </em>336 Md. at 576-77, 650 A.2d at 230. Rather, the court must affirm the agency decision if there is sufficient evidence such that \u201ca reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Consumer Prot. Div. v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 160, 874 A.2d 919, 939 (2005) (quoting <em>Christopher v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Dept. of Health, </em>381 Md. 188, 199, 849 A.2d 46, 52 (2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Agency decisions receive an even more deferential review regarding matters that are committed to the agency\u2019s discretion and expertise. In such situations, courts may only reverse an agency decision if it is \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Maryland State Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 529-30, 846 A.2d 341, 349 (2004). \u201cLogically, the courts owe a higher level of deference to functions specifically committed to the agency\u2019s discretion than they do to an agency\u2019s legal conclusions or factual findings.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. at 529, 846 A.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The District Council, by applying properly these same standards to its review of Planning Board actions on CDPs and SDPs, would not encroach on the Planning Board\u2019s original and exclusive jurisdiction afforded by the RDA.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Courts\u2019 limited review of the decisions of administrative agencies is grounded largely on Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Maryland, which mandates the separation of powers.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> As a result, courts are \u201cwithout authority to interfere with any (proper) exercise of the legislative prerogative or with the lawful exercise of administrative authority or discretion.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 225, 334 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>514, 524 (1975). Courts may not engage in an \u201cindependent original estimate of or decision on the evidence.\u201d <em>Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel, </em>274 Md. at 225, 334 A.2d at 523. Applied properly, reviewing the decision of an administrative agency under the standards described <em>supra, </em>a court does not encroach upon the powers of the Legislature as implemented by an administrative agency. <em>Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel, </em>274 Md. at 225, 334 A.2d at 523-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Although separation of powers principles do not apply to the relationship between the District Council and the Planning Board, the same format seems appropriate to explain the treatment explained in this opinion. The courts and the Legislature derive their authority largely from the Constitution of Maryland, which divides the powers granted thereunder among them and the Executive Branch. The District Council and Planning Board derive their land use authority within the Regional District from the RDA, which divides the powers granted thereunder between them and other local agencies. As the courts are prohibited by the Declaration of Rights from usurping the legislative prerogative implemented through administrative agencies, the District Council is prohibited by the RDA from usurping the exclusive and original authority of the Planning Board. The Courts are not able to reach a different conclusion on the evidence when reviewing the decisions of an administrative agency. The District Council may not do so with regard to Planning Board decisions on CDPs and SDPs. If the standards of review applied by courts reviewing administrative agencies do not interfere with the substance of the Legislature\u2019s authority implemented by such administrative agencies, the District Council applying properly the same standards would not interfere with the substance of the Planning Board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The difference between the District Council\u2019s review of the Planning Board decisions here and the courts\u2019 review of administrative agency decisions is that the courts are granted explicitly the judicial power. Md. Const. Art. IV. The District Council is not given explicitly authority by the RDA to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>decisions generally within the original jurisdiction of the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">VII. The District Council\u2019s Authority to Consider in its Review Issues other than Those Remanded</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The District Council argues that, during its ultimate review of and action in this case, it was not limited to considering only the issues remanded on 7 November 2011 to the Planning Board. According to the District Council, nothing in the RDA or the County Code limits the District Council to considering on election a Planning Board decision on remand only the remand issues. Further, the District Council claims that such a limitation would: (1) make the ability to remand nugatory; and, (2) requiring the District Council to make a final determination regarding any non-remand issues before it gathered all the information would be an absurd result. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A. Plain Language of PGCC \u00a7 27-523</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The District Council is correct that the RDA does not limit explicitly the review of the District Council to issues the Council may remand to the Planning Board. As explained <em>supra </em>at Part VI, the RDA provides generally for the District Council to establish procedures, which would include remanding a CDP and SDP to the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">In our view, the PGCC limits the District Council\u2019s review to the remand issues. PGCC \u00a7 27-523 governs review of CDPs and SDPs before the District Council.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> The ordinance states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">The District Council shall schedule a public hearing on the appeal or review. Testimony at the hearing shall be limited to the facts and information contained within the record made at the hearing before the Planning Board. In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>tion, the Council may take judicial notice of any evidence contained in the record of any earlier phase of the approval process relating to all or a portion of the same property, including the approval of a preliminary plat of subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUx\">PGCC \u00a7 27 \u2014 523(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cthe hearing before the Planning Board\u201d indicated by PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) included only the hearing on remand, at which the Planning Board\u2019s consideration was limited by the District Council to the issues remanded to the Board. <em>Zimmer Dev., </em>217 Md.App. at 330, 92 A.3d at 613. According to the appellate panel, the District Council\u2019s scope of review was constrained to the facts and information presented at the Planning Board\u2019s hearing immediately prior to the District Council\u2019s final review. <em>Id. </em>We agree with this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The plain language of the second sentence of PGCC \u00a7 27-523(e) informs the conclusion. The word \u201cbefore\u201d may be used generally as a preposition, conjunction, or adverb, but in any context it indicates either that something occurred \u201cin front of\u2019 or \u201cduring the period of time preceding\u201d some other event or action. The only reasonable understanding of \u201cbefore\u201d in PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) is as a preposition. The use of \u201cbefore\u201d indicates that the \u201chearing\u201d to which the provision refers is the hearing that was \u201cin front of\u2019 the Planning Board. This hearing is referred to using the definite article (i.e., \u201cthe\u201d), indicating that this \u201chearing\u201d is a particular one, and is identifiable. Where a remand occurs, there is necessarily more than one hearing, the initial one and one on remand. For the \u201chearing\u201d in question to be identifiable, it must be the ultimate or final Planning Board hearing and action which the District Council elected to review. If the District Council remanded previously the case to the Planning Board, \u201cthe facts and information contained within the record made at the hearing,\u201d to which the \u201ctestimony\u201d at the District Council hearing is limited, would be related only to the remand issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The third sentence of PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) indicates that, although the \u201ctestimony\u201d at the District Council hearing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>limited to addressing the evidence of the hearing immediately preceding, additional evidence may be considered. The District Council may take \u201cjudicial notice\u201d of \u201cany evidence\u201d of record from \u201cany earlier phase of the approval process\u201d relating to the same property. PGCC \u00a7 27-523. This provision does not provide, however, the District Council v?ith the authority to reconsider evidence from the pre-remand hearing before the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The Planning Board\u2019s decision to approve or deny an SDP or CDP prior to a remand by the District Council is not an \u201cearlier phase of the approval process\u201d for purposes of PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c). The definition of \u201cphase\u201d most apposite to the ordinance is \u201ca distinguishable part in a course, development, or cycle.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> <em>See Phase, </em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1993). The ordinance provides \u201cthe approval of a preliminary plat of subdivision\u201d as an example of the \u201cearlier phases\u201d from which the District Council may take judicial notice of record evidence. The other \u201cearlier phase[s]\u201d would be the prior distinct steps for the approval of a development on the property, such as the record created during the zoning map amendment process. The Planning Board hearing occurring before a District Council remand for further consideration would be within the same \u201cphase,\u201d and therefore, not accessible for consideration by the District Council after remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">As we held <em>supra </em>at Part VI, the District Council\u2019s reversal of a Planning Board decision may be sustained by the courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>if at all, only when the Planning Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence or is arbitrary, capricious, or illegal. The District Council\u2019s ability to \u201cdeny\u201d CDP and SDP applications, such as it is, does not stem from its inherent authority to review <em>de novo </em>Planning Board decisions on the merits, but rather is cobbled together from the District Council\u2019s authority under the RDA to establish procedures and a corresponding appellate standard of review of courts. The District Council has the inherent authority to require that a CDP or SDP approval or disapproval come before the District Council for the Council to perform a limited appellate review. It has authority to remand CDP and SDP applications to the Planning Board for additional consideration. It has no inherent authority, however, to decide <em>de novo </em>CDP or SDP applications on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The ability to remand and shape the contours of reconsideration by the Planning Board is precisely the kind of authority that the RDA contemplated for the District Council. The RDA contemplates that the district councils will exercise legislative powers and administrative authority where granted. Establishing processes and directing the consideration of administrative agencies are legislative tasks. By remanding the approval or disapproval of a CDP or an SDP to the Planning Board, the District Council alerts the Planning Board to considerations that it may have overlooked or evaluated incompletely or incorrectly earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Even were we to conclude that the District Council has implicit inherent authority under the RDA to decide <em>de novo </em>the legal sufficiency of Planning Board decisions regarding SDPs and CDPs, it has limited itself through the plain language of PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c). The ordinance requires the District Council, upon deciding to remand a case to the Planning Board, to remand any concerns for which the District Council might later deny the application. This prevents the District Council from withholding from remand potential issues which could have been addressed satisfactorily on remand. It would border on arbitrariness and capriciousness for the District Council, if it believed in its initial review that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the Planning Board may have been in error on multiple scores, to remand some, but not all, of the potential problematic issues, only later to reverse the decision of the Planning Board for an \u201cerror\u201d that was not remanded for consideration.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) prevents that sort of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">B. Judicial Review of the District Council\u2019s Consideration of Non-Remand Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The District Council asks us to determine whether the Court of Special Appeals \u201cnullified the District Council\u2019s statutory right to \u2018remand\u2019 a case to the Planning Board for further information, and the District Council\u2019s obligation to issue a \u2018final\u2019 decision prior to judicial review, by holding that the District Council is limited after remand to only those issues that were remanded.\u201d <em>Zimmer Dev., </em>440 Md. 114, 99 A.3d 778. The question is limited to an interpretation of PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c). We have rendered an interpretation of that County Code provision earlier. Enough said.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">VIII. The Circuit Court\u2019s Reversal of the District Council\u2019s Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The District Council argues that the Circuit Court erred by reversing the District Council\u2019s decision to deny CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 and ordering reinstatement of the Planning Boards decision(s). By the same token, the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Special Appeals erred in affirming that action. According to the District Council, when an administrative agency applies the incorrect standard of review, the appropriate remedy is to remand the matter to the agency so that it may apply the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">That is the general rule. When an administrative function remains to be exercised at the end of the day, we hold generally that a court must remand the case to the administrative agency. <em>See, e.g., Maryland Bd. of Pub. Works v. K. Hovnanian\u2019s Four Seasons at Kent Island, LLC, </em>425 Md. 482, 522, 42 A.3d 40, 63 (2012) (\u201cThe error committed by the Board was one of law \u2014 applying the wrong standard in formulating its decision. The appropriate remedy in such a situation is to vacate the decision and remand for further proceedings designed to correct the error.\u201d); <em>Bereano v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Md. 716, 756, 944 A.2d 538, 561 (2008) (\u201cAs it is not properly our role to determine whether the agency\u2019s decision, absent this unavailable justification, otherwise would have been the same, reversal shall be the result and a remand for further proceedings before the Commission.\u201d). The court need not remand, however, if the remand would be futile. <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Bassler, </em>289 Md. 501, 510, 425 A.2d 1003, 1008 (1981); <em>see also Green v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, </em>430 Md. 119, 143, 59 A.3d 1001, 1015 (2013) (ordering the case be remanded to the Tax Court, but directing the Tax Court\u2019s decision on remand); <em>Anne Arundel Cnty. v. Halle Dev., Inc., </em>408 Md. 539, 557, 971 A.2d 214, 225 (2009) (\u201cThe County\u2019s appeal to <em>Frankel [v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Maryland Sys., </em>361 Md. 298, 301, 761 A.2d 324, 325 (2000) ] and general administrative law principles in arguing for a remand presumes, erroneously, that there is an administrative procedure and function that remains to be performed in this case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In the present case, both of the reviewing courts before us found that the Planning Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. The District Council does not dispute that conclusion. For the reasons stated <em>supra, </em>because the District Council had no original jurisdiction to reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Planning Board\u2019s approval of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, and such a reversal may only be affirmed by the courts if the Planning Board\u2019s decision was illegal, lacked substantial evidence, or was arbitrary or capricious, the District Council was required, applying the correct standard of review articulated by each court reviewing this case, to approve the decision of the Planning Board on this record. Therefore, there remains no administrative function to be performed. Remanding the case to the District Council would be futile because there was only one action the District Council could take.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">IX. Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">A. CDP and SDP Processes Going Forward</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Our opinion, though voluminous, requires only a modest change in thinking by the District Council in the CDP and SDP processes in comprehensive design zones in Prince George\u2019s County. The submission and consideration of a CDP and SDP by the Planning Board is unchanged. The required contents of CDP and SDP submissions remains the same. To approve a CDP or SDP, the Planning Board must make the findings required for approval codified in PGCC \u00a7 27-521 (for a CDP) and in PGCC \u00a7 27-528 (for an SDP). The District Council, through conditional zoning, may guide the consideration of the Planning Board in these regards and require consideration of matters and resultant findings necessary to protect surrounding properties or enhance coordinated, harmonious, and systematic development. LU \u00a7 22-214.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Our opinion recasts how the District Council must treat the authority of the Planning Board. The Planning Board has original jurisdiction to decide whether to approve or deny CDPs and SDPs. Pursuant to the division of the authority \u2022within the RDA, local matters that are related to planning, zoning, subdivision, or assignment of street names and house numbers are, unless otherwise specified, among the additional local functions over which the county planning boards have original jurisdiction. <em>See </em>LU \u00a7 20-202(a). Among the additional local functions over which the county planning boards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>have original jurisdiction are those delegated to them pursuant to LU \u00a7 20-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Once the Planning Board makes a decision regarding a CDP and SDP, such decision may be appealed to or called up by the District Council for appellate review.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The District Council may remand the case for further consideration by the Planning Board, may affirm the Planning Board\u2019s decision, or may reverse the Planning Board\u2019s decision. If the District Council remands the Planning Board\u2019s approval or denial of the CDP or SDP and reviews it again subsequently, it may only reverse the Planning Board\u2019s decision on remand as to the issues that were remanded to the Planning Board for consideration or reconsideration. PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The District Council may reverse an approval by the Planning Board only if the decision was one the Planning Board was not legally authorized to make, is not supported by substantial evidence of record, is arbitrary or capricious, or otherwise illegal. By reviewing the Planning Board\u2019s decision using the same standards that a court uses when reviewing an administrative agency action, the District Council will not interfere with the Planning Board\u2019s original jurisdiction over the CDP and SDP decision-making processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>B. Our Holdings</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Although some amplification as to reasoning was thought desirable by us, we, the Court of Special Appeals, and the Circuit Court arrive at the same judgment in this case. We hold that: (1) the District Council possessed only appellate jurisdiction to review the Planning Board\u2019s decisions regarding CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, and was authorized to reverse the decision of the Planning Board only if the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence, was arbitrary, capricious, or illegal otherwise; (2) the District Council was not authorized, after electing to review on its own initiative the Planning Board\u2019s decisions regarding CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 for a second time, to consider issues other than those remanded to the Planning Board on 7 November 2011; and (3) the Circuit Court\u2019s order reversing the decision of the District Council denying CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 and ordering the District Council to affirm the decision of the Planning Board was appropriate. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">.

To rezone a property to a floating zone, the zoning authority must find, among other things, that the rezoning will be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 539 n. 15, 814 A.2d at 484 n. 15 (citing <em>Richmarr Holly Hills, Inc. v.

We do not suggest that conditional zoning is not zoning. The conditions are imposed through piecemeal rezoning and, to the extent that they pertain to the uses of land, are implementation of the zoning power. When a zoning authority imposes conditions on a rezoning that are related to planning, it is implementing the planning power through a zoning technique and procedure, thereby exercising both zoning and planning powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\">.

The Maryland-Washington Regional District Act (\"RDA\u201d) may be traced to 1927. Chapter 448 of the Laws of Maryland of 1927 established the Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission and the Maryland-Washington Metropolitan District (\"Metropolitan District\u201d). The Commission was comprised of six commissioners appointed by the Governor. 1927 Md. Laws ch. 448, at \u00a7 6. Within the Metropolitan District, encompassing roughly the area between the District of Columbia and what is now the Capital Beltway, zoning and planning authority was divided between the Commission and the county commissioners of Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties. <em>Prince </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>George\u2019s Cnty. v.

Laws ch. 448, at \u00a7 1 (describing the boundaries of the Metropolitan District). The counties were authorized to zone, provided that the regulations and zoning maps mirrored the Commission's plan for the Metropolitan District or the Commission approved any deviation from such plan. 1927 Md. Laws ch. 448, at \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In Chapter 714 of Laws of Maryland of 1939, the General Assembly created the Maryland-Washington Regional District (\"Regional District\u201d), which was also under the jurisdiction of the Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission. 1939 Md.

Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>269 Md. at 206, 306 A.2d at 226. The 1959 act expanded the Regional District, created a method by which additional land use functions might be assigned, created the county planning boards as distinct entities from the Commission, and designated the local legislative bodies of Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties as the primary zoning authorities. <em>See </em>1959 Md.

In supplementation of the RDA, the Express Powers Act, codified previously in the Maryland Code as Article 25A, but now found in Title 10 of the Local Government Article, confirms Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s zoning and planning authority as a charter county delineated in Division I of the Land Use Article. Maryland Code (2013), Local Government Article, \u00a7 10-324(a) (\u201cLG\u201d) states: \"[a charter] county may enact local laws relating to zoning and planning to protect and promote public safety, health, morals, and welfare....\u201d LG \u00a7 10-324(c) makes clear, however, that the section does not \u201cgrant to [a charter] county powers in any substantive area not otherwise granted to the county by other public general law or public local law....\u201d Further, LG \u00a7 10-206(b) prevents charter counties from exercising their powers when such powers are preempted or in conflict with a public general law.

In County Bill 76 of 1996, the District Council amended PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f)(1) purporting to give itself original jurisdiction over appeals from the Zoning Hearing Examiner and the Planning Board, according to the language of the ordinance. The District Council had assigned previously the initial consideration of CDPs and SDPs to the Planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Board. The purpose of CB-76-1996, however, was not to revoke its delegation of initial consideration to the Planning Board, but rather to \"clarify[] that all appeals to the District Council are an exercise of original jurisdiction.\u201d The District Council\u2019s intention was to set its jurisdiction vis-a-vis that of the Planning Board.

The prior codification, Art. 28, \u00a7 7-111(a), stated that \u201d[t]he local functions exclusively within the jurisdiction of the respective planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>boards include, <em>but are not limited to,\" </em>the same functions, (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"85\">\n<p id=\"b604-5\">. The language granting the planning boards\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction over local functions was enacted by Chapter 780 of the Laws of Maryland of 1959. The context of the Act indicates that the jurisdiction of the planning boards was to be exclusive of the jurisdiction of the district councils, as well as exclusive of the Commission as a bi-county body.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Chapter 780 altered significantly the relationship between the Commission and the district councils. Before Chapter 780, the Commission was the primary land use actor within the Regional District. <em>See </em>1943 Md. Laws ch. 992. The Commission created the plans, was authorized to acquire land and issue bonds, had final approval power over zoning, collaborated with its federal counterpart for the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and enacted and administered subdivision regulations. <em>See </em>1943 Md. Laws ch. 992. The district councils enacted the zoning ordinances in their respective counties (subject to approval of the Commission) and were empowered to issue building permits and other building regulations. 1943 Md. Laws ch. 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Chapter 780 expanded the authority to regulate land use within the Regional District and delegated locally that authority. In particular, the act created the planning boards as distinct entities and gave primary zoning authority to the district councils. Prior to the 1959 act, the district councils could only enact a zoning regulation or make a change to the official zoning map if such regulation or change was consistent with the Commission\u2019s plan or if the Commission approved the change. <em>See </em>1943 Md. Laws 992. According to \u00a7 78 of Chapter 780, the Commission provided merely a recommendation regarding a district council's changes to its zoning laws or zoning map. The planning boards were entirely new. Along with the creation of the planning boards, Chapter 780 enacted the language which is now codified in LU \u00a7 20-207, allowing for assignment to the planning boards of additional local functions that were not otherwise provided for by the RDA. 1959 Md. Laws ch. 780, at \u00a7 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The structure of the local delegation of land use authority effected by Chapter 780 is the same as is currently codified in the Land Use Article. Primary zoning authority was delegated to the District Council. Some express local functions were delegated to the planning boards, as was a method for assigning additional local functions as the desire arose. Because the functions delegated under the act were not (and additional assigned functions would not be presumably) zoning <em>qua </em>zoning, the Legislature's intention was likely that exclusive original jurisdiction over these functions would also rest with the planning boards and not the district councils. We are not aware of any surviving indication of legislative intent contrary to the general structure of Chapter 780.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"86\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">.

Some evidence of this may be inferred also from the handling of Senate Bill 564 in the 2015 legislative session. Senate Bill 564, as introduced originally, proposed to provide the District Council with original jurisdiction in its review of the decisions of the Planning Board. The language that would have granted the District Council original jurisdiction, however, was removed by amendment before passage. The Bill was signed by the Governor on 12 May 2015, without the language giving the District Council authority to review <em>de novo </em>the decisions of the Planning Board. 2015 Md. Laws ch. 365.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"88\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\">. The District Council does not claim that PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f) would supersede the RDA to the extent they conflict. Rather, according to the Bill Summary of Council Bill (\"CB\u201d) 76-1996, which enacted the section in question, this provision was to \"clarify what has always been assumed and has historically been the [District] Council's practice regarding jurisdiction of the [District] Council when hearing appeals.\u201d CB-76-1996, 1996 Leg. Sess. (Prince George\u2019s County Council 1996). We interpret the RDA otherwise. The custom of the District Council cannot trump the text and purpose of a statute. <em>See Dutcher, </em>365 Md. at 427, 780 A.2d at 1154 (citing <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 132-33, 48 A.2d 754, 763 (1946)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"89\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">.

Our decision in <em>County Council of Prince George's County v. Dutcher, supra, </em>injects some question as to the ability of the District Council to review decisions of the Planning Board where not authorized explicitly by the RDA. In <em>Dutcher, </em>we held that the RDA, by its silence on the matter, did not authorize an appeal to the District Council of a Planning Board decision regarding a non-cluster preliminary plan of subdivision. 365 Md. at 425, 780 A.2d at 1152. The RDA provided for only appeals to the Circuit Court of final actions. We decline to expand the scope of our review here, however, and will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>District Council is authorized to consider appeals from the Planning Board\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"91\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">. The district councils are given also authority to establish procedures where they have authority to make the underlying decision. For example, the district councils may determine the procedure for: (1) the issuance of building permits, LU \u00a7 20-503; (2) the consideration and execution of development rights and responsibilities agreements; (3) an agricultural easement plan, LU \u00a7 25-605; and, (4) the Planning Board recommendation on a zoning map amendment, LU \u00a7 22-208.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"92\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">. Absent one of the specified events triggering District Council review, a Planning Board decision would be the final action regarding the approval of a CDP and/or SDP and thereby become reviewable only by the Circuit Court. <em>See Montgomery Pres., Inc. v. Montgomery Cnty. Planning Bd. of Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>424 Md. 367, 377, 36 A.3d 419, 424 (2012) (\u201cWe have recognized that in some contexts, a Planning Board\u2019s decision can be regarded as final.\u201d).

Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights requires \u201d[t]hat the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"94\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\">. PGCC \u00a7 27-523 sets out the procedures applicable to District Council review of CDPs. PGCC \u00a7 27-528.01(c) states that, in regard to District Council review of SDPs, the District Council \"shall render a final decision in accordance with [PGCC \u00a7 ] 27-523 within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">. The other ways in which \"phase\u201d may be understood in particular contexts include: (1) \"a particular appearance or state in a regularly recurring cycle of changes\u201d; (2) \"an aspect or part (as of a problem) under consideration\u201d; (3) \"the point or stage in a period of uniform circular motion, harmonic motion, or the periodic changes of any magnitude varying according to a simple harmonic law to which the rotation, oscillation, or variation has advanced from its standard position or assumed instant of starting\u201d; (4) \"a homogeneous, physically distinct, and mechanically separable portion of matter present in a nonhomogeneous physicochemical system\u201d; and, (5) \u201can individual or subgroup distinguishably different in appearance or behavior from the norm of the group to which it belongs[.]\u201d <em>Phase, </em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"96\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. We do not suggest that in the present case the District Council remanded only certain of the potential problems to the Planning Board arbitrarily, capriciously, or with the intent to \"game\u201d the process. The District Council has maintained consistently that it believed that it had original jurisdiction to approve or deny CDP-1001 and SDP-1001. If such were the case, remanding only certain issues to the Planning Board would likely be appropriate, even if there existed in the record other issues supporting denial. The District Council was mistaken, however, regarding its legal authority to review <em>de novo </em>the decision of the Planning Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Of course, if the District Council, on initial consideration and applying the appellate standards of review, believes that the Planning Board\u2019s action lacks substantial evidence to support the fact-findings, or is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise illegal, it need not remand a case at all, but may deny the application and take its chances on subsequent judicial review, if sought by an aggrieved party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"97\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">. Senate Bill 564 of 2015 was enacted, in part, \u201c[for] the purpose of ... providing that, in Prince George's County, a person may make a request to the district council for the review of a certain decision of a zoning hearing examiner or the planning board only under certain circumstances.\u201d 2015 Md.

The Bill added Section 25-212 to the Land Use article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">In Prince George\u2019s County, a person may make a request to the district council for the review of a decision of the zoning hearing examiner or the planning board only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">(1) the person is an aggrieved person that appeared at the hearing before the zoning hearing examiner or planning board in person, by an attorney, or in writing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">(2) the review is expressly authorized under this division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">2015 Md.
