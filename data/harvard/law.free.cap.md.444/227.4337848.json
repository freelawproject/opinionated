Indeed, this case represents the fourth opportunity for us to consider an appropriate sanction for Melissa D. Gray (\u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cGray\u201d), who is currently indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gray, </em>421 Md. 92, 25 A.3d 219 (2011) <em>(\u201cGray I\u201d) </em>(entering reprimand by consent for violations of Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d or \u201cRule\u201d) 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(b)); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

These petitions arise out of Respondent\u2019s representation of four individuals in separate divorce matters: <em>Pazura v. Pazura; Lafalaise v. Pierre; Garner v. Garner; </em>and <em>Antonelli v. Antonelli. </em>On Petitioner\u2019s motion, these complaints were consolidated by this Court on September 9, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Petitioner charged Respondent with numerous MLRPC violations, specifically Rules 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.2 (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 1.5 (Fees),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1.16 (Declining or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Terminating Representation),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rule 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Rule 8.4 (Misconduct).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Respondent was also charged with violations of Maryland Rules 16-604 (Trust account \u2014 Required deposits),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 16-606.1 (Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>trust account record-keeping),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 16-609 (Prohibited transactions).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Lastly, Petitioner charged Respondent with violating Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\u201cBOP\u201d) of the Maryland Code (Misuse of trust money).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We referred the instant matters to Judge Susan Souder of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for an evidentiary hearing and to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Md. Rule 16-757. Respondent failed to respond to any of the above-mentioned petitions. Following Respondent\u2019s failure to respond, an Order of Default was entered by the hearing judge on September 22, 2014. After conducting a hearing, which Respondent failed to appear for, on November 3 and 5, 2015 Judge Souder issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which she found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated, collectively, MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16, 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), Maryland Rules 16-604,16-606.1, and 16-609, and BOP \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Concluding that Respondent had violated (1) MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(b), and 8.4(a) in the Pazura matter; (2) MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5,1.16, 8.1(b), and 8.4(a) in the Lafalaise matter; and (3) MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16, 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-606.1, and 16-609, and BOP \u00a7 10-306 in both the Garner and Antonelli matters, Judge Souder issued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\n<em>PAZURA V. PAZURA: FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">Respondent became a member of the Maryland Bar on June 14, 1988. On August 15, 2013, the Court of Appeals suspended Respondent from the practice of law in Maryland for a period of sixty days, effective September 15, 2013. On January 24, 2014, the Court of Appeals indefinitely suspended Respondent from the practice of law in Maryland, effective thirty days from the date of its opinion. Respondent therefore remains indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">Respondent represented Miranda Pazura in connection with her divorce case, <em>Pazura v. Pazura </em>in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. After Ms. Pazura retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Respondent in October 2008, Respondent advised her to withdraw $83,700 from a home equity line of credit. Respondent did not explain to Ms. Pazura what the potential ramifications of this act could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">After Ms. Pazura withdrew this money on Respondent\u2019s advice, the Circuit Court entered a temporary restraining order, preventing Ms. Pazura from using the funds. Respondent consented to an order requiring the funds to be held in her escrow account. As a consequence of this order, the $83,700 was not available to Ms. Pazura to pay for her living expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">Although Ms. Pazura promptly tendered a check for $83,700 to Respondent, Respondent did not deposit this check in her escrow account until several months later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">In addition, Respondent failed to file timely responses to discovery requests, resulting in the imposition of sanctions against Ms. Pazura. Respondent also failed to file discovery requests on behalf of Ms. Pazura until long after the discovery deadline in the case had elapsed. Respondent therefore failed to obtain information regarding Ms. Pazura\u2019s husband\u2019s financial status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">Respondent also failed to return Ms. Pazura\u2019s telephone calls seeking the status of her case. Respondent did not keep Ms. Pazura informed of the status of the case and did not provide Ms. Pazura with copies of pleadings, correspondence, and court orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">Respondent also failed to prepare for trial. She did not obtain expert witnesses, including a vocational rehabilitation expert or a forensic accountant, to testify at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">Finally, while Respondent received letters from the Office of Bar Counsel requesting that she respond to Ms. Pazura\u2019s complaint, Respondent failed to submit a substantive written response to these inquiries of Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">\n<em>PAZURA V. PAZURA: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>(\u201cMLRPC\u201d): 1.1 (\u201cCompetence\u201d), 1.3 (\u201cDiligence\u201d), 1.4 (\u201cCommunication\u201d), 1.15 (\u201cSafekeeping Property\u201d), 8.1(b) (\u201cBar Admission and Disciplinary Matters\u201d), and 8.4 (\u201cMisconduct\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">The court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated each of these Rules except MLRPC 1.15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">With respect to MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3, Respondent\u2019s failure to pursue Ms. Pazura\u2019s case demonstrated a lack of both competence and diligence. The same lack of thoroughness and preparedness that demonstrates Respondent\u2019s violation of MLRPC 1.1 also demonstrates her lack of the diligence required of her by MLRPC 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Respondent failed to communicate adequately with Ms. Pazura as is required by MLRPC 1.4. Respondent failed to return Ms. Pazura\u2019s telephone calls, did not keep Ms. Pazura informed of the status of her case, and did not provide Ms. Pazura with copies of pleadings, correspondence, or court orders. Accordingly, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4(a) and 1.4(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">Furthermore, by failing to respond to inquiries from Bar Counsel, Respondent violated MLRPC 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">Because Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(b), she also violated MLRPC 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">However, this court does not find that there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.15. While Respondent failed promptly to deposit the check she received from Ms. Pazura in her escrow account, this failure does not constitute a failure to keep client property separate from the lawyer\u2019s property. Petitioner presented no evidence that Respondent ever commingled any funds from Ms. Pazura\u2019s check with Respondent\u2019s own funds. Petitioner also presented no evidence that Respondent placed Ms. Pazura\u2019s funds in an account other than an escrow account. Rather, Petitioner\u2019s sole allegation with respect to a violation of this Rule is that Petitioner did not promptly deposit the check she received from Ms. Pazura. While promptly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>depositing such a check in an escrow account certainly constitutes good practice, nothing in MLRPC 1.15 <em>mandates </em>the prompt deposit of such funds. Therefore, the Court does not find that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.15 in the matter of <em>Pazura v. Pazura.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">\n<em>LAFALAISE V. PIERRE: FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Respondent represented Pensione Lafalaise in a divorce case in which Mr. Lafalaise had previously been represented by other counsel. A judgment of divorce had already been entered in the case, but issues regarding marital property had not yet been resolved by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">Respondent entered her appearance on behalf of Mr. Lafalaise on July 28, 2011. On April 25, 2012, the court listened \u2014 in open court \u2014 to the outlining of a consent agreement disposing of issues relating to marital property. This agreement required the parties to prepare appropriate Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (\u201cQDROs\u201d) to effectuate the division of the parties\u2019 retirement benefits. In addition, the agreement required Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s ex-wife to convey certain real property to Mr. Lafalaise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">On May 30, 2012, Respondent wrote to the court, requesting that a written order be entered to formalize the consent agreement placed on the record in the previous month. The court entered a written order on that same date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Following this date, Respondent failed to take any additional steps towards obtaining the real property which was to be conveyed to Mr. Lafalaise or towards insuring the execution of the required QDROs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">Furthermore, throughout the course of her representation of Mr. Lafalaise, Respondent failed adequately to communicate with her client. Respondent often failed to respond to Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s telephone messages and to other communications from her client seeking information on the status of her case. Respondent also ignored Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>requests to make an appointment so that he could meet with Respondent personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">Mr. Lafalaise paid Respondent approximately $15,000.00 for this representation, but Respondent failed to return any unearned portion of that fee. Respondent admitted that she did not provide Mr. Lafalaise with any legal services of value in exchange for the fee she received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">Following termination of the representation and in spite of numerous requests from Mr. Lafalaise, Respondent failed to return original documents to her client</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Finally, Respondent failed to respond to numerous inquiries and lawful requests for information made by the Office of Bar Counsel concerning Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>LAFALAISE V. PIERRE: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated the following Rules: 1.1 (\u201cCompetence\u201d), 1.3 (\u201cDiligence\u201d), 1.4 (\u201cCommunication\u201d), 1.5 (\u201cFees\u201d), 1.16 (\u201cDeclining or Terminating Representation\u201d), 8.1(b) (\u201cBar Admission and Disciplinary Matters\u201d), and 8.4 (\u201cMisconduct\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">The court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated each of these Rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">With respect to MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3, Respondent\u2019s failure to pursue Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s case demonstrated a lack of both competence and diligence. Respondent failed to prepare QDROs in Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s case, failed to assist her client in obtaining the real property due to him under the consent agreement, and generally provided no legal services of value. This demonstrates a lack of competence which violates MLRPC 1.1. The same lack of thoroughness and preparedness that demonstrates Respondent\u2019s violation of MLRPC 1.1 also demonstrates her lack of the diligence required of her by MLRPC 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">Respondent failed to communicate adequately with Mr. Lafalaise as is required by MLRPC 1.4. Respondent often failed to respond to Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s telephone messages and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>other communications from her client seeking information of the status of h[is] case. Respondent also ignored Mr. Lafalaise\u2019s requests to make an appointment so that he could meet with Respondent personally. Accordingly, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">The fee paid to Respondent by Mr. Lafalaise, while not unreasonable on its face, was unreasonable in fact, as Respondent failed to provide Mr. Lafalaise with any legal services of value. The charging of an unreasonable fee violates MLRPC 1.5(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">In addition, Respondent\u2019s failure to return the unearned portion of the fee she received and failure to return to Mr. Lafalaise the original documents \u2014 \u201cpapers and property to which the client is entitled\u201d \u2014 which he requested constitutes violations of MLRPC 1.16(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Furthermore, by failing to respond to inquiries from Bar Counsel, Respondent violated MLRPC 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">Finally, because Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5,1.16, and 8.1(b), she also violated MLRPC 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">\n<em>GARNER V. GARNER: FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">Zachariah Garner retained Respondent on March 1, 2013 for assistance in a divorce case pending in Howard County. Mr. Garner paid Respondent $6,000.00 for this representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">Respondent failed to submit to the Court an updated Financial Statement that Mr. Garner had completed in Respondent\u2019s presence. Respondent was also unprepared for a <em>pendente lite </em>hearing held June 4, 2013, despite the fact that Mr. Garner had already provided Respondent with his bills and other financial information. Because Respondent was unprepared for the hearing, the result of that hearing was unfavorable for Mr. Garner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>In addition, Respondent failed to send discovery responses to opposing counsel and failed to file any response to related discovery motions filed by opposing counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">Respondent also failed to keep Mr. Garner informed about his case and failed to respond to request for information made by her client. Following the <em>pendente lite </em>hearing, Mr. Garner asked Respondent several questions about Respondent\u2019s failure to submit to the court the updated Financial Statement that he had completed, about the nature of the results of the hearing, and about a potential appeal of the result. Respondent failed to provide a response to any of these questions. Respondent\u2019s only response to Mr. Garner\u2019s inquiries was to advise him to file for bankruptcy in order to resolve the financial concerns which the result of the hearing caused for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">Respondent also failed to respond to emails which Mr. Garner sent her, in spite of the fact that many of these emails were sent in response to emails sent by Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Further, Respondent failed to return Mr. Garner\u2019s phone calls and voicemail messages (including when the phone calls were in response to phone calls from Respondent) and failed to inform Mr. Garner about the discovery motions that had been filed by opposing counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">Ultimately, Respondent abandoned the representation. As a result, Mr. Garner was forced to retain a new attorney. In spite of the limited services which she had performed for Mr. Garner and in spite of her eventual abandonment of her client, Respondent failed to return any of the $6000.00 fee which Mr. Garner had paid to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Respondent failed to deposit any portion of the $6000.00 fee into an Attorney Trust Account (\u201cATA\u201d). Respondent did not have Mr. Garner\u2019s informed consent, obtained in writing, to an arrangement which would have allowed her to proceed in a fashion other than by depositing the sum in an ATA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Respondent failed to maintain appropriate trust account records as required by Md. Rule 16-606.1. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>failed to create and maintain records concerning disbursements made from her trust account and did not properly identify the payee of any disbursements, the person for whom any disbursements were made, or the purpose of any disbursements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">Finally, Respondent failed to respond to lawful requests for information made by the Office of Bar Counsel. On October 3, 2013, Assistant Bar Counsel James Botluk sent a letter to Respondent requesting a response to the complaint filed by Mr. Garner. Respondent failed to respond to this letter. Assistant Bar Counsel Botluk thereafter sent a second letter, dated October 30, 2013, via certified mail, with return receipt requested. Respondent also failed to respond to this second letter. Therefore, a third letter was sent on December 16, 2013. Respondent did not respond to this letter either. A fourth letter was then mailed, again via certified mail, return receipt requested on December 30, 2013. Respondent did not respond to this fourth letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">Eventually, on January 15, 2014, Assistant Bar Counsel James Gaither sent William M. Ramsey, an investigator with Petitioner, to hand-deliver a new letter to Respondent. Mr. Ramsey attempted several times to deliver this letter to Respondent at her office, but met with no success until February 20, 2014. On that date, Respondent informed Mr. Ramsey that she would be in contact with Assistant Bar Counsel Gaither, but Respondent has not yet made any contact with the Office of Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>GARNER V. GARNER: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated the following Rules: 1.1 (\u201cCompetence\u201d), 1.2 (\u201cScope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Lawyer and Client\u201d), 1.3 (\u201cDiligence\u201d), 1.4 (\u201cCommunication\u201d), 1.5 (\u201cFees\u201d), 1.15 (\u201cSafekeeping Property\u201d), 1.16 (\u201cDeclining or Terminating Representation\u201d), 8.1(b) (\u201cBar Admission and Disciplinary Matters\u201d), and 8.4 (\u201cMisconduct\u201d). In addition, Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated Md. Rules 16-604 (\u201cTrust Account \u2014 Required deposits\u201d), 16-606.1 (\u201cAttorney trust ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>count record-keeping\u201d), and 16-609 (\u201cProhibited transactions\u201d). Finally, Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated Md.Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. \u00a7 10-306 (\u201cMisuse of trust money\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">With respect to MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3, Respondent\u2019s failure to pursue Mr. Garner\u2019s case demonstrated a lack of both competence and diligence. Respondent failed to submit an updated Financial Statement to the court, was unprepared for a <em>pendente lite </em>hearing, failed to provide discovery to opposing counsel, and failed to respond to discovery motions filed by opposing counsel. In addition, Respondent eventually abandoned her representation of Mr. Garner entirely. These actions demonstrate a lack of competence in violation of MLRPC 1.1. The same lack of thoroughness and preparedness that demonstrates Respondent\u2019s violation of MLRPC 1.1 also demonstrates her lack of the diligence required by MLRPC 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">With Respect to MLRPC 1.2, Respondent\u2019s total failure to pursue Mr. Garner\u2019s case competently and diligently worked a frustration of Mr. Garner\u2019s intentions concerning the objective of the representation. This failure to pursue Mr. Garner\u2019s objectives violates MLRPC 1.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">Respondent also failed to communicate adequately with Mr. Garner as is required by MLRPC 1.4. Respondent failed to respond to Mr. Garner\u2019s inquiries following the <em>pendente lite </em>hearing, failed to reply to emails sent by Mr. Garner, and failed to return Mr. Garner\u2019s phone calls. Accordingly, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">The fee paid to Respondent by Mr. Garner, while not unreasonable on its face, was unreasonable in fact, as Respondent failed to provide Mr. Garner with adequate representation. The charging of an unreasonable fee violates MLRPC 1.5(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">Respondent\u2019s failure to deposit the $6000.00 fee she received from Mr. Garner in an ATA violates multiple provisions of the law. As Respondent did not have her client\u2019s informed consent, confirmed in writing, to an arrangement other than one which would require her to deposit unearned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>fees in an ATA, and as Respondent did not perform sufficient services to warrant the $6000.00 she had received, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.15(c). This conduct also violates Md. Rule 16-604 and 16-609(a) and is in violation of the prohibition contained in Md.Code Ann., Bus.

Petitioner excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law in three respects. Petitioner first excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner failed to present clear and convincing evidence of a violation of Rule 1.15(a) in the Pazura matter. Second, Petitioner excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s omission of any specific finding of a Rule 8.4(d) violation in all four matters. Lastly, Petitioner excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>omission of any specific finding of a Rule 8.4(b) and (c) violation in the Garner and Antonelli matters. Petitioner recommends that Respondent be disbarred, irrespective of our consideration of these exceptions. Respondent, in addition to failing to appear before this Court, has filed no exceptions or a sanction recommendation in these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Based on our <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we sustain Petitioner\u2019s exceptions as to Rules 8.4(b)-(d). We overrule Petitioner\u2019s exception as to Rule 1.15(a) in the Pazura matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">A. Pazura Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">MLRPC 1.1 requires a lawyer to provide competent representation to his or her clients. As defined in the Rule, \u201c[e]ompetent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1. We agree with the hearing judge that, on the facts of this case, \u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to pursue Ms. Pazura\u2019s case demonstrated a lack of both competence and diligence\u201d in violation of Rule 1.1. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 54, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006) (\u201cEvidence of a failure to apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of Rule 1.1.\u201d). Respondent, to the detriment of her client, failed to timely respond to opposing counsel\u2019s discovery requests, timely submit discovery requests on the behalf of Pazura, advise Pazura as to the consequences of withdrawing $83,700 from a home equity line of credit, and prepare for Pazura\u2019s trial by failing to obtain expert witnesses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">MLRPC 1.3 requires a lawyer to \u201cact with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d We agree with the hearing judge that Respondent\u2019s lack of preparedness for trial and lack of thoroughness during the course of the representation as described above violates Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">MLRPC 1.4 requires an attorney to \u201c(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent ... is required ...; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; [and] (3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information\u201d as well as \u201cexplain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions.\u201d We agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) and (b) by failing to return Pazura\u2019s telephone calls, failing to keep Pazura informed on the status of the divorce proceeding, and failing to send Pazura copies of court documents and correspondence in an effort to keep the client informed about the status of the case. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shapiro, </em>441 Md. 367, 385, 108 A.3d 394, 405 (2015) (\u201cAttorneys violate MLRPC 1.4 when they fail to communicate with their clients and keep them informed of the status of their legal matters.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Under MLRPC 8.1(b) a lawyer must timely respond to lawful requests for information, including letters from Bar Counsel. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Under Rule 8.4(d) it is professional misconduct to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justicef.]\u201d Based on our independent review of the record, we agree with Petitioner that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by failing to communicate with Pazura regarding the status of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>and act competently during her representation of Pazura. <em>See Shapiro, </em>441 Md. at 394, 108 A.3d at 410 (\u201cAttorneys violate MLRPC 8.4(d) when they fail to keep their clients advised of the status of the representation and represent diligently their clients\u2019 interests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Petitioner has also taken exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the evidence did not clearly and convincingly support a Rule 1.15(a) violation. Under Rule 1.15(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">A lawyer shall hold property of clients ... that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules, and records shall be created and maintained in accordance with the Rules in that Chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Based on the record, the hearing judge determined that there was no violation of Rule 1.15(a) because \u201cPetitioner presented no evidence that Respondent ever commingled any funds from Ms. Pazura\u2019s check with Respondent\u2019s own funds.... Rather, Petitioner\u2019s sole allegation with respect to a violation of this Rule is that Petitioner did not promptly deposit the check she received from Ms. Pazura.\u201d Although the record reveals that Respondent did, indeed, wait for a period of several months before depositing the personal check from Pazura, we are left to speculate as to what Respondent did with the check during this time period. Petitioner does not present any evidence that Respondent deposited the check into Respondent\u2019s own account or otherwise impermissibly commingled the funds. Despite Respondent\u2019s possession of the physical check, it appears that the funds remained in Pazura\u2019s control until Respondent actually made the deposit. Accordingly, we overrule Petitioner\u2019s exception to Rule 1.15(a) in the absence of any evidence that Respondent failed to maintain Pazura\u2019s funds, which appear to have remained in the client\u2019s control during the period in question, separate from Respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>own funds.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">B. Lafalaise Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3. The hearing judge found that \u201cRespondent failed to prepare QDROs ..., failed to assist her client in obtaining real property due to him under [a] consent agreement, and generally provided no legal services of value.\u201d As explained above, this lack of thoroughness, preparedness, and diligence in representing Lafalaise violates both Rules 1.1 and 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Similar to the Pazura Complaint, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4 by failing to adequately communicate with her client regarding the status of the case. <em>Shapiro, </em>441 Md. at 385, 108 A.3d at 405 (\u201cAttorneys violate MLRPC 1.4 when they fail to communicate with their clients and keep them informed of the status of their legal matters.\u201d). Indeed, the hearing judge explained that \u201cRespondent often failed to respond to [] Lafalaise\u2019s telephone messages and to other communications from her client seeking information on the status of [the] case. Respondent also ignored [ ] Lafalaise\u2019s requests to make an appointment so that he could meet with Respondent personally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Under MLRPC 1.5(a), \u201c[a] lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses.\u201d As previously explained by this Court, \u201c[w]hen an attorney charges a fee but does no work, the fee is <em>per se </em>unreasonable. It is irrelevant that the fee is \u2018initially reasonable\u2019 if the attorney fails to perform any of the services for which the attorney was paid.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gage-Cohen, </em>440 Md. 191, 198-99, 101 A.3d 1043, 1047 (2014) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). We agree that Respondent violated Rule 1.5(a) in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>of the hearing judge\u2019s findings that Respondent charged and collected a fee from Lafalaise of approximately $15,000, which Respondent has not returned, but failed to provide any legal services of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">MLRPC 1.16(d) requires, among other things, a lawyer to \u201csurrender[ ] papers and property to which the client is entitled and refundf ] any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred\u201d upon termination of the representation. We agree with the hearing judge that by failing to return both the unearned portion of the fee Respondent received and the original documents owed to Lafalaise, despite Lafalaise\u2019s numerous requests, Respondent violated Rule 1.16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">As explained above, MLRPC 8.1(b) is violated where an attorney knowingly fails to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries. <em>Fezell, </em>361 Md. at 249, 760 A.2d at 1116 (\u201cThis Court has a long history of holding that an attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to letters from disciplinary authorities requesting information.\u201d). Respondent violated Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters during the course of the investigation in regards to the Lafalaise complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We agree that as a result of Respondent\u2019s violations of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.16, Respondent violated Rule 8.4(a). <em>See Nelson, </em>425 Md. at 363, 40 A.3d at 1050 (\u201cRule 8.4(a) is violated when other Rules of Professional Conduct are breached.\u201d). Moreover, based on our independent review of the record, we agree with Petitioner that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by, among other things, failing to act diligently in her representation of Lafalaise, communicate adequately with Lafalaise regarding the status of the case, and failing to return the unearned portion of the fee paid by Lafalaise. <em>See Shapiro, </em>441 Md. at 394, 108 A.3d at 410 (\u201cAttorneys violate MLRPC 8.4(d) when they fail to keep their clients advised of the status of the representation and represent diligently their clients\u2019 interests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>C. Garner and Antonelli Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">As explained in greater detail above, Rules 1.1 and 1.3 are breached where an attorney fails to exercise competence and diligence during the course of the representation. With respect to the Garner complaint, Petitioner violated these Rules by failing to submit an updated Financial Statement to the court during Garner\u2019s divorce proceedings, prepare for a <em>pendente lite </em>hearing, provide any response to opposing counsel\u2019s discovery requests and discovery related motions, and by abandoning her client during the course of the representation. In regards to the Antonelli complaint, Respondent similarly abandoned her client during the course of the representation. This conduct clearly demonstrates a lack of thoroughness, preparedness, competence, and diligence in violation of Rules 1.1 and 1.3 in both client matters. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. 652, 660-61, 984 A.2d 865, 870 (2009) (noting that respondent\u2019s abandonment of his client violated, among other things Rules 1.1 and 1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Under MLRPC 1.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">[A] lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.

Indeed, the hearing judge found that Respondent failed to respond to Garner\u2019s questions following the <em>pendente lite </em>hearing concerning Respondent\u2019s failure to provide an updated Financial Statement to the court. Respondent also failed to respond to Garner\u2019s questions about the results of the hearing and whether Garner had any basis for an appeal or any other remedy of the result. Moreover, during the course of the representation, Respondent failed to respond to Garner\u2019s emails, telephone calls, and voice mails. Lastly, Respondent did not inform Garner about opposing counsel\u2019s discovery requests. Similarly, the hearing judge found that Respondent failed to \u201cadequately communicate with [ ] Antonelli throughout the representation[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 1.5 in both the Garner and Antonelli matters in light of the hearing judge\u2019s findings that Respondent failed to return fees obtained from each client despite the limited legal services provided and Respondent\u2019s eventual abandonment of both Garner and Antonelli. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

As we explained previously, \u201cRule 16-604 explicitly requires attorneys to keep all client funds in a trust account.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>425 Md. at 360, 40 A.3d at 1048. Accordingly, Respondent violated this rule when she failed to place the retainer checks obtained from Garner and Antonelli into a trust account. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Maryland Rule 16-606.1 requires, among other things, that records of the receipt and disbursement of client funds be created and maintained by the attorney. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

As noted by the hearing judge, \u201cRespondent failed to create and maintain records concerning disbursements made from her trust account and did not properly identify the payee of any disbursements, the person for whom any disbursements were made, or the purpose of any disbursements\u201d in both the Garner and Antonelli matters. Accordingly, we agree with the hearing judge that Maryland Rule 16-606.1 was violated in the Garner and Antonelli matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Under Maryland Rule 16-609(a) \u201c[a]n attorney or law firm may not borrow or pledge any funds required by the [Maryland Rules] to be deposited in an attorney trust account, ... or use any funds for any unauthorized purposes.\u201d Similarly, BOP \u00a7 10-306 provides that \u201c[a] lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d This Court previously explained that \u201c[b]ecause \u2018the statute and the Rule have the same requirement,\u2019 a violation of Rule 16-609 is a violation of BOP \u00a7 10-306.\u201d <em>Gage-Cohen, </em>440 Md. at 201, 101 A.3d at 1049 (citations omitted). We also pointed out that the \u201c[fjailure to deposit unearned fees into an attorney trust account is a violation of Rule 16-609, and therefore of BOP \u00a7 10-306 as well.\u201d <em>Gage-Cohen, </em>440 Md. at 201-02, 101 A.3d at 1049. In the instant case, the hearing judge found that Respondent failed to deposit unearned fees obtained from Garner and Antonelli into a separate attorney trust account. Moreover, as we explained above, Respondent did not obtain Garner\u2019s or Antonelli\u2019s informed, written consent to an alternate arrangement. The hearing judge\u2019s findings in this case extend beyond a mere finding of negligence and evince Respondent\u2019s willful derogation of her accounting responsibilities. Accordingly, the rule and the statute were violated in both matters. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We agree with the hearing judge that by failing to return the unearned portion of the fee Respondent received and owed to Garner and Antonelli following her abandonment of representation in both matters, Respondent violated Rule 1.16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Furthermore, we agree that by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s repeated inquiries in relation to the Garner and Antonelli complaints, Respondent violated Rule 8.1(b). Indeed, Respondent failed to respond to any of the four letters sent by Bar Counsel regarding Garner\u2019s complaint or either of the two letters sent concerning Antonelli\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Moreover, as we have stated above, as a result of Respondent\u2019s violations of multiple rules of professional conduct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>both the Garner and Antonelli matters, Respondent violated 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Petitioner excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s omission of any specific finding of an 8.4(b), (c), or (d) violation in the Garner and Antonelli matters. Based on our review of the record, we agree with Petitioner that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b)-(d). Under MLRPC 8.4(b) it is professional misconduct to \u201ccommit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects[.]\u201d \u201cIt is well established that a conviction is not required to find a violation of [Rule] 8.4(b). A court must find only clear and convincing evidence of conduct that would violate a criminal statute.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Agbaje, </em>438 Md. 695, 729, 93 A.3d 262, 282 (2014) (citations omitted). Respondent\u2019s violation of BOP \u00a7 10-306 supports a violation of Rule 8.4(b). <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Here Respondent accepted a $6000 fee from Garner and $6980 from Antonelli, failed to deposit the money into an attorney trust account, and failed to perform any legal services of value for Antonelli and provided only \u201climited services\u201d for Garner. Following her abandonment of Garner and Antonelli, Respondent failed to return any of the unearned fees obtained from either client. Therefore, we agree with Petitioner that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) by failing to act diligently in her representation of either individual, communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>cate adequately regarding the status of the case, return the unearned portion of the fees paid, and by abandoning both clients during the course of the representation. <em>See Shapiro, </em>441 Md. at 394, 108 A.3d at 410.

Notably, Respondent\u2019s willful mishandling of fees obtained from her clients calls into question her integrity. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 406, 773 A.2d 463, 480 (2001)). Respondent has not offered any mitigating factors to excuse her egregious conduct, which is unsurprising given that Respondent failed to participate in the disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Moreover, Respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel during the course of this investigation and to appear or otherwise participate in this matter demonstrate Respondent\u2019s apathy towards the attorney disciplinary process.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Lastly, as we have noted above, this represents the fourth time Respondent has appeared before this Court in a disciplinary proceeding. Respondent\u2019s disciplinary history includes a reprimand, <em>Gray I, </em>421 Md. 92, 25 A.3d 219 (2011), a sixty day suspension from the practice of law, <em>Gray II, </em>433 Md. 516, 72 A.3d 174 (2013), and her indefinite suspension from the practice of law, which she is currently serving. <em>Gray III, </em>436 Md. 513, 83 A.3d 786 (2014). <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
