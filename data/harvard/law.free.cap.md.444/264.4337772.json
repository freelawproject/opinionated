But the Legislature and Courts may impose reasonable limitations on that right. One such limitation is found in Maryland Rule 2-B25, which provides that a party\u2019s failure to demand a jury trial within 15 days after service of the last pleading directed to the issue constitutes a waiver by that party of a jury trial. An exception to this waiver rule applies when a party files an amended complaint, asserting a new substantive issue and demanding a jury trial. Under such a circumstance, the new claim may revive a previously waived jury trial. In this case, we must determine whether an amended complaint in which a party demanded a jury trial but added only one new count, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>was dismissed for failure to state a claim, revives a previously waived jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">This case arises from a dispute between a tenant, Peter A. Muntjan, and various actors associated with his landlord, Frank D. Scarfield.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Muntjan, an artist, leased from Scarfield a 8,000 square foot unit at 7101 Sollers Point Road (Building #8) for use as an art studio. After Scarfield filed a Complaint alleging that Muntjan had held over on his lease, the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore County, ordered that a Writ of Possession be issued and ordered the Sheriff of Baltimore County to execute the writ no sooner than 12:00 p.m. on December 19, 2007. At that time, a constable of Baltimore County executed the writ and evicted Muntjan from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Three years later, on December 20, 2010, Muntjan, representing himself, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, alleging one count for Trover and Conversion (\u201cCount I\u201d) and another for Invasion of Privacy (\u201cCount II\u201d), related to the 2007 ejectment and repossession. Scarfield filed a motion to dismiss Count II, which the Circuit Court granted on September 21, 2011, on statute of limitations grounds. On October 7, 2011, Scarfield filed his answer to Count I, without requesting a jury trial. Over four months later, on February 24, 2012, Muntjan filed a jury demand. Then, on April 16, 2012, he filed an Amended Complaint reasserting Counts I and II and adding a third for Abuse of Process (\u201cCount III\u201d). Included with his Amended Complaint was a jury demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Scarfield filed a motion to strike both Muntjan\u2019s Amended Complaint and his jury demand. The Circuit Court denied the motion to strike the Amended Complaint, but made no ruling as to the jury demand. Scarfield later filed a motion to dismiss Counts II and III for failure to state a claim and orally renewed his motion to strike the jury demand. Regarding the jury demand, Scarfield argued that an amended complaint is not a pleading under Maryland Rule 1-202. Thus, he asserted, because Maryland Rule 2-325 requires that a jury demand be filed within 15 days after service of the last pleading filed, Muntjaris jury demand filed with his Amended Complaint was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In ruling on the motion to strike the jury demand, the Circuit Court first observed that an amended complaint is a pleading. To permit a plaintiff to amend a complaint to demand a jury trial at any time would defeat the \u201corderly process\u201d laid out in Rule 2-325(a) and (b), it reasoned. Recognizing what it saw as one possible exception where an amendment is permitted to add completely new claims that would not result in prejudice were a jury demand to be entertained, the Circuit Court concluded that the only new count \u2014 Abuse of Process \u2014 \u201cis certainly related to the same ... events\u201d as Count I. The Circuit Court reasoned Muntjan could not revive the jury demand for the previous counts in this way because it would permit Muntjan to \u201cresurrect a demand that [he] had already waived by not making it with the original complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Muntjan appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, presenting eight questions for review. <em>Muntjan v. Scarfield, </em>No. 1065, Sept. Term, 2012, Slip Op. at 1-2 (Md.Ct.Spec.App., Aug. 5, 2012). The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, made two rulings relevant to this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>panel unanimously held that the Circuit Court correctly dismissed Count III, stating: \u201cBecause Mr. Muntjan\u2019s claim for abuse of process is based on initiation of the eviction process, as opposed to abuse of the process after process was issued, his amended complaint did not state a cause of action for abuse of process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Second, the divided panel held that the Circuit Court erred in denying Muntjan\u2019s jury demand. Restricting itself to the Circuit Court\u2019s reasoning in denying the jury demand, the Court of Special Appeals held first that \u201cfor a plaintiff to revive a once-waived right to a jury trial based on the filing of an amended complaint, the amended complaint must raise a new issue, <em>i.e., </em>a claim that is based on a set of facts different from those relied on in support of the original claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. Second, it held that \u201cthe amended complaint in this case raised a new issue [because] Muntjan\u2019s claim for Abuse of Process was based on a separate set of facts involving appellees\u2019 purpose in initiating the eviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Thus, with respect to some aspects of Count I, the Court of Special Appeals held that Muntjan was entitled to a remand for a jury trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Dissenting as to the jury demand, Judge Rodowsky (specially assigned) considered the Circuit Court \u201cright, ... but for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Muntjan v. Scarfield, </em>No. 1065, Sept. Term, 2012, Slip Op. at 3 (Md.Ct.Spec.App., Aug. 5, 2012) (Rodowsky, J., dissenting). Agreeing that Count III failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, Judge Rodowsky reasoned that Count III \u201cdid not present a claim at law triable of right and the gears of Rule 2-325 were not engaged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. His dissent also questioned the practical implications of entertaining Muntjan\u2019s jury demand, observing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that, under the Majority\u2019s holding, \u201cthe right to demand a jury trial that has been waived could be revived simply by a plaintiffs filing anything that purports to be a claim that was not asserted in an earlier pleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We granted Scarfield\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari, limiting our consideration to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">Does the filing of an amended complaint which presents a new claim and jury demand revive a previously waived right to a jury trial where the new claim is dismissed for a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Because we answer no, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Whether Muntjan was entitled to a jury trial pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-325 is a legal question, and so we review the lower court\u2019s decision without deference. <em>See Duckett v. Riley, </em>428 Md. 471, 477, 52 A.3d 84, 87 (2012) (\u201cThis is a purely legal inquiry; therefore, we construe Rule 2-325(a) without giving deference to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s interpretation.\u201d). \u201c[T]he principles applied to statutory interpretation are also used to interpret the Maryland Rules.\u201d <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004) (citation omitted). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">to ascertain the meaning of [a] rule of procedure we first look to the normal, plain meaning of the language. If that language is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the provision\u2019s terms to inform our analysis; however, the goal of our examination is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. To that end, we must consider the context in which the ... rule appears, including related statutes or rules, and relevant legislative history. Also, where the language of the ... rule is ambiguous, external evidence may be referred to for discerning the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the legislature, including the bill\u2019s title or function paragraphs, relevant case law, and secondary sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 604-05, 861 A.2d at 81 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">When interpreting the Maryland Rules, we are mindful that they \u201cshall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d Md. Rule l-201(a). Moreover, \u201cwe must bear in mind that they are \u2018precise rubrics,\u2019 established to promote the orderly and efficient administration of justice, and thus are to be strictly followed.\u201d <em>In re Kaela, </em>394 Md. 432, 471, 906 A.2d 915, 938 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">We recently discussed the legal bases for the right to a civil jury trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">Articles 5 and 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights enshrine the right to a civil jury trial. Article 23 provides specifically, the right of trial by Jury of all issues of fact in civil proceedings in the several Courts of Law in this State, where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $15,000, shall be inviolably preserved. Although inviolably preserved, the right to have a civil jury trial may be regulated reasonably: Indeed, it is generally acknowledged that the right to a trial by jury can, for all practical purposes, become meaningless to the individual and burdensome to the state unless the exercise of it is regulated to some extent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-10\"><em>Duckett, </em>428 Md. at 477-78, 52 A.3d at 88 (internal quotation marks, footnote, alterations, and citations omitted). Maryland Rule 2-325 regulates this constitutionally guaranteed jury right and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">(a) Demand. Any party may elect a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by filing a demand therefor in writing either as a separate paper or separately titled at the conclusion of a pleading and immediately preceding any required certificate of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(b) Waiver. The failure of a party to file the demand within 15 days after service of the last pleading filed by any party directed to the issue constitutes a waiver of trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcP\">Thus, failure to file a jury demand within 15 days of service of the last pleading constitutes a waiver of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Here, Muntjan failed to file a jury demand within 15 days of service of the last pleading after his initial Complaint. Muntjan included a jury demand in his Amended Complaint in which he added Count III. The Circuit Court dismissed, however \u2014 and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal of \u2014 Count III for failure to state a claim. The jury demand, then, was included in an amended complaint that added no additional counts other than the dismissed Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Scarfield argued in the Circuit Court that an amended complaint is not a pleading, relying on the list of pleadings provided in Maryland Rule 1-202. This Rule defines pleading as <em>\u201ca </em>complaint, a counterclaim, a cross-claim, a third-party complaint, an answer, an answer to a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint, a reply to an answer, or a charging document as used in Title 4.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Md. Rule 1-202. Thus, asserts Scarfield, the question is settled because there was no pleading to which the jury demand could attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">We do not read Rule 1-202 quite so narrowly. The Circuit Court reasoned that \u201c[a]n amended complaint is a pleading in the sense that it [is] an amendment of a pleading.\u201d This comports with Rule 2-341, which governs Amendment of Pleadings. That Rule indicates that what is commonly referred to as an amended complaint is not a distinct procedural vehicle but is more accurately conceived of as \u201can amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>to a pleading\u201d or \u201can amended pleading.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341(a) and (e). This explains why we have repeatedly characterized an amended complaint as a pleading. <em>See, e.g., Mathews v. Cassidy Turley Md., Inc., </em>435 Md. 584, 595-96 n. 9, 80 A.3d 269, 275 n. 9 (2013) (\u201cAfter some initial skirmishing by the parties about whether the filing of the First Amended Complaint should be permitted, the Circuit Court accepted the amended pleading at the December 2011 motions hearing.\u201d); <em>Hanna v. ARE Acquisitions, LLC, </em>400 Md. 650, 653, 929 A.2d 892, 893 (2007) (\u201cThe operative pleading is ARE\u2019s second amended eomplaint[.]\u201d); <em>Crawford v. Leahy, </em>326 Md. 160, 163, 604 A.2d 73, 75 (1992) (\u201cThe Crawfords also filed an \u2018Amended Complaint\u2019 that was identical to the originally filed complaint; both pleadings contained allegations of negligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Scarfield now adopts the reasoning presented by Judge Rodowsky in his dissenting opinion. Echoing that opinion, Scarfield contends that the dismissal of Count III for failure to state a claim rendered that count not an issue triable by right, and so Maryland Rule 2-325 was not \u201cengaged.\u201d He reasons that \u201c[a] claim that is \u2018triable of right by a jury* must state a cause of action that can survive a motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Muntjan, responding <em>pro se, </em>discusses a number of issues not before this Court and addresses the jury demand issue only briefly, relying on the intermediate appellate court\u2019s majority opinion to support his proposition that his Amended Complaint raised a new issue. Thus, he reasons, the jury demand filed with his Amended Complaint revived the waiver as to all live counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The Circuit Court concluded that a jury demand attached to Muntjan\u2019s Amended Complaint could only attach to Count III \u2014 the only new count added to the Amended Complaint. We do not reach this issue in light of our holding that Muntjan did not revive his earlier waived right to a jury trial. Because the Circuit Court dismissed \u2014 and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal of \u2014 Count III for failure to state a claim, the question before us is whether the new demand for a trial by jury, filed with the Amended Complaint containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>only a defective new count, is sufficient to revive a previously waived jury demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Neither the Rules nor our case law define what it means to be triable of right by a jury. Traditionally, this language refers to whether an action was triable by a jury at common law. <em>Luppino v. Gray, </em>336 Md. 194, 201, 647 A.2d 429, 432 (1994) (\u201cWe have held that the reference, in the precursor to Article 23, to jury trial, to which the citizens of Maryland are entitled, is to \u2018the historical trial by jury, as it existed when the Constitution of the State was first adopted/\u201d (citation omitted)); Paul V. Niemeyer, Linda M. Schuett &amp; Joyce E. Smithey, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>at 287 (4th ed. 2014) (\u201cCourts will look to the historical nature of claims or issues to determine whether they will be tried to the jury or to the court.\u201d). Notably, this inquiry often reduces to a distinction between actions at law \u2014 triable by a jury \u2014 and actions at equity \u2014 triable by a court. <em>Md. Dept. of Env\u2019t v. Underwood, </em>368 Md. 160, 183, 792 A.2d 1130, 1143-44 (2002); <em>Kann v. Kann, </em>344 Md. 689, 699, 690 A.2d 509, 514 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Thus, in their <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>Judge Paul Niemeyer, Linda Schuett, and Joyce Smithey say that \u201cif no demand for jury trial was made in connection with a complaint on which a plaintiff might have been entitled to a jury trial, a demand filed with an amended complaint whose only new count is equitable in nature will not be granted.\u201d <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>at 290-91. In <em>State Department of Economic and Community Development v. Attman/Glazer P.B. Company, </em>the state agency filed a complaint seeking declaratory judgment. 323 Md. 592, 602, 594 A.2d 138, 143 (1991). Neither party filed a jury demand within the time limit for the original complaint, but along with its answer to the State\u2019s amended complaint, Attman/Glazer (\u201cAG\u201d) filed a jury demand, which the trial court struck. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed this decision, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Although either party in the instant case might have been entitled to a jury trial on the legal issues generated in the State\u2019s original complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and AG\u2019s answer, both waived that right under Md. Rule 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>325(b). Thus, AG\u2019s entitlement to the jury trial it demanded depended upon whether the State\u2019s amended complaint raised an issue \u201ctriable of right by a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 607, 594 A.2d at 145 (internal citations omitted). Because \u201c[t]he sole issue raised by the State\u2019s amended complaint was whether it was entitled to specific performance,\u201d an action \u201cwhich invokes the equity jurisdiction of the court,\u201d we held that AG was not entitled to a jury trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">But in determining whether a jury demand filed with a later pleading may revive a previously waived demand, we have not limited ourselves to considering whether the new count raised was actionable at law or equity. At times, the determining factor is whether the new count was only duplicative of previous counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In <em>Luppino, </em>the plaintiffs sued initially for fraud, intentional concealment, and negligent misrepresentation. 336 Md. at 197, 647 A.2d at 430. The plaintiffs then amended the complaint, adding four new counts and filing a jury demand. <em>Id., </em>647 A.2d at 431. The circuit court dismissed three of the new counts, but denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended count for intentional omission. <em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 647 A.2d at 431. It also denied the defendants\u2019 motion to strike the jury trial demand. <em>Id. </em>at 198, 210, 647 A.2d at 431, 437. On appeal, we agreed with the intermediate appellate court that the jury demand should have been struck because the surviving count in the amended complaint was \u201cmerely the restatement of a claim for fraud already set forth in two other counts of the complaint; it did not add a new substantive issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 647 A.2d at 431. This reasoning demonstrates that even when an additional count is one historically triable by a jury, it is insufficient to revive a previously waived jury demand both when it is duplicative, and when it is dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Broadly speaking, \u201c[t]he filing of a demand for jury trial pursuant to [Rule 2-325] does not entitle a party to a jury trial in cases where the right does not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>at 290. Here, Muntjan\u2019s only new count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>raised in his Amended Complaint \u2014 Count III \u2014 was dismissed for failure to state a claim. Similar to the equitable counts in <em>Attman/Glazer </em>and the dismissed and duplicative counts in <em>Luppino, </em>Count III did not present a claim triable of right. \u201cA pleading that sets forth a claim for relief ... shall contain a clear statement of the facts necessary to constitute a cause of action.\u201d Md. Rule 2-305. A count that fails to state a claim is deficient and is no longer \u201ctriable of right by a jury.\u201d It cannot support a jury demand independently much less provide the springboard to allow other counts to piggyback on its jury demand. Thus, because the only new count raised in the Amended Complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim, as Judge Rodowsky stated in dissent, \u201cthe gears of Rule 2-325 were not engaged.\u201d <em>Muntjan, </em>at 3 (Rodowsky, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">To permit parties to revive a waived jury demand with a demand included with an amended complaint, even when no new counts state a claim upon which relief could be granted, would strip Maryland Rule 2-325 of any causal efficacy. As Judge Rodowsky rightly observed, \u201cthe right to demand a jury trial that has been waived could be revived simply by a plaintiffs filing anything that purports to be a claim that was not asserted in an earlier pleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Such a theory is an absurd reading of the Rule. <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985) (\u201c[Rjules of statutory construction require us to avoid construing a statute in a way which would lead to absurd results.\u201d). And we will not construe Rule 2-325 so as to render it nugatory. <em>Taylor v. Nations-Bank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654-55 (2001) (\u201c[Wjhenever possible, the statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In conclusion, we hold that because Muntjan\u2019s Amended Complaint, in which he timely demanded a jury trial, added only one new count, which was dismissed for failure to state a claim, that count is an insufficient basis to revive the waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>jury demand for the counts first alleged in his original Complaint. This reasoning comports with sound policy because a contrary meaning would render Maryland Rule 2-B25 meaningless. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand to that Court to resolve the discovery issues that are not before this Court and thereafter to remand the matter to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a bench trial as to Counts I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
