Hamilton, Jr. (\u201cRespondent\u201d) was admitted to the Bar of this Court on 11 December 2001. He maintained an office for the practice of law in Anne Arundel County at all times relevant to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) asked us to disbar Hamilton for violating certain of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d), Maryland Rule 16-604, and Maryland Code, Bus. Occ. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. Art., \u00a7 10-306. On 4 June 2013, Petitioner, acting through Bar Counsel, filed against Hamilton a Petition for Disciplinary of Remedial Action (\u201cPDRA\u201d), in response to its investigation of the complaints of two of Respondent\u2019s former clients, Bryan Manning and Richard DeVincent. On 19 March 2014, we designated the Honorable Paul F. Harris, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to hear this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">On 28 March 2014, Petitioner filed a second PDRA against Respondent for alleged violations of the MLRPC, Md. Rule 16-604, and Md.Code, Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. Art., \u00a7 10-306, based on its investigation of a complaint by Windy Grauer, another of Respondent\u2019s former clients.

Respondent requested a continuance because of his hospitalization. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>receiving an acceptable confirmatory fax from Dr. Kevin Ferentz, Judge Harris rescheduled the hearing for 4-5 August 2014. On 4 August 2014, Respondent requested another continuance. Respondent provided another letter from Dr. Ferentz, dated 24 July 2014. This letter did not explain, however, why Respondent would be unavailable for the August hearing dates. Judge Harris denied the continuance and heard the case. Respondent did not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Neither party filed exceptions to Judge Harris\u2019s written factual findings and legal conclusions. Respondent failed also to offer any recommendation contrary to Petitioner\u2019s written recommendation for disbarment or avail himself of the opportunity to appear and argue the proposed sanction before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Finding Judge Harris\u2019s findings not clearly erroneous and virtually all of his conclusions of law were supported by clear and convincing evidence, we disbarred Respondent in a per curiam order issued 18 May 2015. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton, </em>442 Md. 740, 114 A.3d 708 (2015) (mem.). In this opinion, we explain that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">A. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Judge Harris accepted fully as his own Petitioner\u2019s proposed \u201cFactual findings and Conclusions of Law\u201d. We parse here the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact according to each clienVcomplainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">1. <em>Complaint of Bryan Manning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Bryan Manning retained Respondent on 21 January 2010 to represent him in his divorce case. Respondent entered his appearance on Manning\u2019s behalf in the case in the Circuit Court for Howard County, and filed an answer to the spouse\u2019s complaint and a counter-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">Manning paid Respondent for the representation a \u201cflat\u201d fee of $10,000, in two installments of $5,000.00. Respondent failed to place Manning\u2019s payments into an attorney trust account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Despite Manning\u2019s requests for one, Respondent failed to provide a written retainer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">On 4 March 2010, Manning\u2019s wife\u2019s attorney served upon Hamilton requests for discovery from his client. Manning provided promptly to Respondent responses to these discovery requests. Although Respondent was in possession of the responses, Manning\u2019s wife was compelled to file a motion to compel production of the items requested, claiming no responses had been received by her. On 16 April 2010, the trial court granted the motion to compel discovery and ordered Manning to provide, within 15 days, complete answers to the interrogatories and a response to the request for the production of documents. At about the same time, Respondent requested $500.00 more from Manning, ostensibly to obtain an extension of time to avoid missing a deadline. Manning gave Respondent a check for $500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In early May, Respondent told Manning he needed Manning\u2019s responses to the interrogatories on 5 May 2010, so he could file them the next morning. Respondent demanded another $500.00 to submit the answers to interrogatories, which amount Manning paid in cash. Respondent failed to place either $500.00 payment into an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">As of July 2010, Respondent still had not submitted the answers to interrogatories or responded to the document production request. On 7 July 2010, the trial court granted Manning\u2019s wife\u2019s motion for sanctions. In the order granting sanctions, the court directed that, if Manning failed to provide full answers to the discovery requests by 8 September 2010, he would be prohibited from introducing contrary evidence at trial relative to the topics of the discovery requests. Despite the motion to compel and the sanctions imposed by the Court, Respondent never filed his client\u2019s discovery responses, which information was (or should have been) in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">At trial, the Circuit Court granted Manning\u2019s wife\u2019s request for a divorce. The Court made also a marital award to Manning\u2019s ex-wife and awarded her attorney\u2019s fees in excess of $4,000.00 for Manning\u2019s failure to answer discovery. Man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ning learned, at trial and for the first time, that he had been sanctioned for failure to provide discovery responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Following Manning\u2019s divorce, Respondent refused to assist Manning with issues relating to the division of marital property. Respondent failed to inform Manning about court hearings and deadlines in his case. Finally, Respondent would not produce a copy of Manning\u2019s file upon request, despite Manning offering to pay for the copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Respondent failed to answer Bar Counsel\u2019s letter request for information regarding his representation of Manning and the client\u2019s complaint. Respondent failed to produce any response to Manning\u2019s complaint at trial or at any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">2. <em>Complaint of Richard DeVincent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">DeVincent hired<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Respondent in January 2010 to reopen his child custody case in order to seek full custody of his children. Respondent charged DeVincent a \u201cflat\u201d fee of $7500.00, which DeVincent paid in installments. Respondent did not deposit any of the funds into an attorney trust account because Respondent did not have an attorney trust account during the time he represented DeVincent.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">In July 2010, DeVincent\u2019s wife served discovery requests on Hamilton. DeVincent provided his responses to Respondent approximately one week after service. Respondent confirmed that he received DeVincent\u2019s responses. The deadline for timely completion of discovery was 30 September 2010. Respondent failed to file the discovery responses provided to him by DeVincent. In November 2010, Respondent informed DeVincent they needed to meet to prepare answers to the discovery requests. In January 2011, Respondent told DeVincent he did not have the discovery responses DeVincent had provided in July 2010. DeVincent\u2019s fianc\u00e9e located copies of DeVincent\u2019s earlier responses and forwarded them to Respondent via email.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>On 8 February 2011, the court sanctioned DeVincent $250.00 for failure to respond to the discovery requests. The court required also that the answers be filed in 10 days or DeVincent\u2019s complaint would be stricken. On 10 February 2011, a family law master<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the Circuit Court advised Respondent that he risked losing the case for his client based on his failure to respond to discovery. Respondent filed the discovery responses on 18 February 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Respondent was often unresponsive to DeVincent\u2019s inquiries during the representation. Respondent failed, on numerous occasions, to return DeVincent\u2019s telephone calls or text messages requesting to meet to discuss the case. Respondent did not meet with DeVincent to discuss the case until just before a November 2010 court hearing. DeVincent requested also that Respondent subpoena certain fact witnesses for trial, which persons Respondent did not subpoena. Throughout his representation of DeVincent, Respondent failed to provide DeVincent with copies of court orders, pleadings, or correspondence relevant to the case so as to keep him informed of the status of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">On 2 March 2011, Respondent met with DeVincent and advised him to settle the case. DeVincent agreed because he believed Respondent was not prepared for trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">3. <em>Complaint of Windy Grauer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Windy Grauer retained Respondent in January 2010 to represent her in an ongoing child custody dispute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Grauer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>paid Respondent $5,000. Respondent failed to deposit any of the $5,000 into an attorney account.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">During the course of the representation, Grauer asked Respondent for copies of correspondence and other papers that had been filed in her case. Respondent did not provide them.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Respondent did little or no work on Grauer\u2019s behalf, despite her requests that Respondent proceed with her case. Respondent misrepresented to Grauer that he had filed pleadings and papers on her behalf in the Circuit Court for Cecil County when, in fact, he had not. Respondent failed inexplicably to appear for at least two hearings in Grauer\u2019s case, which caused either cancellations or postponements.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In the face of this, Grauer terminated Respondent\u2019s representation. Respondent failed to take reasonable steps to protect her interests after termination. Respondent did not provide initially his file on Grauer\u2019s case to her substitute attorney, despite repeated requests. When Respondent provided the file two months later, it was incomplete. Respondent failed to refund any of the $5,000 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">After Grauer filed her complaint with Bar Counsel, Respondent was sent four letters by Bar Counsel with directions to respond. Moreover, Respondent spoke to an Assistant Bar Counsel on the telephone regarding the requested response. Yet, he never responded to Bar Counsel regarding Grauer\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">B. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The hearing judge concluded collectively (by clear and convincing evidence) that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (c), 1.16(d), 8.1(b) and 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d), Md. Rule 16-604 and Maryland Code (2000, 2010 Repl.Vol.), BOP \u00a7 10-306. In regard to his representation of Manning, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>1.8, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.15(c), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), 8.4(a) and (d). In regard to his representation of DeVincent, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.15(c), 8.4(a) and (d). In regard to his representation of Grauer, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (c), 1.16(a) and (d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d), in addition to Md. Rule 16-604 and BOP \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">A. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harmon, </em>433 Md. 612, 623, 72 A.3d 555, 562 (2013) (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted). \u201cWe generally will accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Harmon, </em>433 Md. at 623, 72 A.3d at 562 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko, </em>408 Md. 404, 418, 969 A.2d 1010, 1019 (2009) (internal quotations omitted)). The hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law do not receive the same deference as his or her fact findings. \u201cWe review the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusion without deference, pursuant to Md. Rule 16-759(b)(1).\u201d <em>Harmon, </em>433 Md. at 623, 72 A.3d at 562 (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Penn, </em>431 Md. 320, 334, 65 A.3d 125, 133-34 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">B. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Factual Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. Further, when no exceptions to the hearing judge are filed, as was the case here, we may (and do here) treat the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as established for purposes of our independent review of the judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>C. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Legal Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with the hearing judge\u2019s collective conclusions that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (c), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d), Md. Rule 16-604, and BOP \u00a7 10-306. We are not convinced, however, that the evidence demonstrated adequately that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\n<em>1. MLRPC 1.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">MLRPC 1.1 requires that a lawyer \u201cprovide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d An attorney may violate MLRPC 1.1, although he or she has the adequate knowledge or skill to represent a client, if the attorney fails to apply the thoroughness and/or preparation necessary for proper representation. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 553, 16 A.3d 181, 192 (2011); <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Costanzo, </em>432 Md. 233, 253, 68 A.3d 808, 819 (2013) (\u201cA failure to make the proper and required filings in a client matter demonstrates a lack of the appropriate preparation and thoroughness necessary to provide competent representation.\u201d) (citation omitted) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 54, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006) (\u201cEvidence of a failure to apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of Rule 1.1.\u201d). Failure to subpoena witnesses that may help one\u2019s client is also indicative of incompetent representation and a violation of MLRPC 1.1. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 93, 753 A.2d 17, 37 (2000) (\u201cRespondent\u2019s failure, without sufficient explanation, to subpoena witnesses ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>which were specifically brought to respondent\u2019s attention by his client is a violation of [MLRPC] 1.1.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Failure to appear in court when expected to do so is a particularly egregious violation of MLRPC 1.1. \u201c[A]n attorney\u2019s failure to appear in court for a client\u2019s trial, absent an acceptable explanation, [is] incompetent representation and a violation of MLRPC 1.1.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 403, 784 A.2d 516, 531 (2001) (citing <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 74, 753 A.2d at 26). Competent representation \u201cnecessarily includes, at a minimum, the attorney\u2019s presence at any court proceedings for which he or she was retained.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>366 Md. at 403, 784 A.2d at 531 (citing <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 74, 753 A.2d at 26). The failure of an attorney to appear in court is a complete failure of representation and \u201cthe ultimate incompetency.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>366 Md. at 403, 784 A.2d at 531 (quoting <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 74, 753 A.2d at 25) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">a. <em>Respondent\u2019s representation of Manning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to discovery, although he was in possession of Manning\u2019s responses for more than four months and in spite of the trial judge\u2019s order that Respondent provide them, is far below the standard of competent representation this Court (and the public) expects of attorneys. The resulting civil sanctions against, and pecuniary damage to, Manning are the sole fault of Respondent. Respondent\u2019s lack of preparation, resulting in the Court ordering his client to pay \u201cover\u201d $4,000 of the other party\u2019s attorney fees, is another indication of Respondent\u2019s incompetent representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">b. <em>Respondent\u2019s representation of DeVincent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Respondent failed to file discovery responses despite having them in his possession for a period of approximately six months. Respondent\u2019s failure to file discovery responses resulted in sanctions against DeVincent. Respondent failed also to subpoena fact witnesses, whose names were supplied by DeVincent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>DeVincent was unable to present his case because of Respondent\u2019s lack of diligent action. DeVincent was so insecure in Respondent\u2019s preparation that he felt compelled to accept Hamilton\u2019s recommendation that he settle the case, rather than attempt to present evidence and argument for consideration by the trial court. Respondent\u2019s representation of DeVincent was far below the minimum level of competency required from attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">c. <em>Respondent\u2019s representation of Grauer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Respondent failed to file pleadings and papers on behalf of Grauer. He was unable to provide Grauer and her substitute attorney with the papers necessary for continuation of her representation. Respondent performed little to no services on behalf of Grauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Although Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 multiple times, the most egregious violation was his failure to appear in court on at least two occasions on behalf of Grauer, without acceptable explanation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\n<em>2.

In <em>Reinhardt, </em>the attorney under inquiry lost his client\u2019s file, and \u201c[took] no action on [his client\u2019s] behalf despite her numerous requests regarding status.\u201d <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 218, 892 A.2d at 538. We found those actions to constitute a violation of MLRPC 1.2(a). <em>See Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 218, 892 A.2d at 538; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Respondent failed to follow Grauer\u2019s instructions with regard to those papers she wanted filed. Respondent lost part of Grauer\u2019s client file, and failed generally to take action on her behalf, despite her requests and stated objectives of the representation. From these instances, Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>spondent violated MLRPC 1.2(a) multiple times during his representation of Grauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\n<em>3.

Culver, </em>381 Md. 241, 276, 849 A.2d 423, 444 (2004)). An attorney violates MLRPC 1.3 also by doing \u201cnothing whatsoever to advance the client\u2019s cause or endeavor.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bahgat, </em>411 Md. 568, 575, 984 A.2d 225, 229 (2009). A lack of preparation or thoroughness that would violate MLRPC 1.1 is evidence also of a violation of MLRPC 1.3. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 398, 946 A.2d 1009, 1015 (2008); <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 94, 753 A.2d at 37 (holding that respondent violated MLRPC 1.3 for the same reasons he violated MLRPC 1.1; the same rationale could be used for both violations).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">a. <em>Respondent\u2019s Representation of Manning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Respondent received Manning\u2019s responses to discovery before the court compelled responses and before the court ordered sanctions. Respondent had the ability to provide the court with Manning\u2019s responses to discovery and avoid sanctions, but failed to do so. Further, Respondent ignored the deadline imposed by the order compelling responses and the later deadline the court imposed before ordering sanctions. In the end, Respondent declined to file discovery despite having his client\u2019s responses for approximately six months. That sanctions were imposed on Manning indicates also that Respondent did not act with the reasonable promptness required by MLRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>b. <em>Respondent\u2019s Representation of DeVincent</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA\">Respondent\u2019s failure as well to submit timely discovery responses on behalf of DeVincent resulted in sanctions. Respondent\u2019s failure to subpoena the witnesses requested by DeVincent, which we concluded earlier violated MLRPC 1.1, is also an indication of Respondent\u2019s failure to act with the diligence expected of attorneys. Respondent was so unprepared to present DeVincent\u2019s case that DeVincent felt he had to settle the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">c. <em>Respondent\u2019s Representation of Grauer</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1\">Respondent performed virtually no work in Grauer\u2019s case. The same actions that we found to be a violation of MLRPC 1.1 constitute a violation of MLRPC 1.3. Respondent\u2019s lack of competent representation amounts to a lack of the diligence required by MLRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\n<em>L MLRPC 14(a) and (b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">MLRPC 1.4 requires attorneys to communicate with their clients and keep them informed reasonably of the status of their legal matters.

It is a violation of MLRPC 1.4 also when an attorney fails to communicate crucial information about the status of the case. <em>De La Paz, </em>418 Md. at 554, 16 A.3d at 193 (2011) (holding that an attorney violated MLRPC 1.4 when his client was unaware that his case had been dismissed until notified by the court). We have found that attorneys violate MLRPC 1.4 when they fail to comply promptly with a client\u2019s reasonable requests for information. These requests can be in reference to a status update or for documents and other materials pertaining to their case. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Manning only discovered at trial that he had been sanctioned for his attorney\u2019s neglect. This violates clearly MLRPC 1.4 as Respondent failed to communicate promptly important case information. Respondent ignored Manning\u2019s reasonable requests to inform him of trial dates and was unable to provide Manning with copies of his client file, despite Manning\u2019s requests and offer to pay for copies. As a result of the lack of communication, Respondent failed to keep his client informed reasonably about the status of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">b. <em>Respondent\u2019s Representation of DeVincent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Respondent failed to: (a) respond to DeVincent\u2019s telephone calls and text messages; (b) meet with DeVincent; or, (c) provide DeVincent with copies of requested papers. DeVin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>cent was unaware of Respondent\u2019s preparation (if any) of the case and, as a result, felt compelled to settle his case. Respondent did not take adequate steps to keep DeVincent informed reasonably so that he could make decisions regarding the course and direction of the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">c. <em>Respondent\u2019s Representation of Grauer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Respondent failed to respond to Grauer\u2019s requests for copies of certain papers and filings in her case. Respondent failed to inform Grauer of what was happening in her case, despite her requests, which failure hampered her ability to make informed decisions and choices. When Respondent did respond to Grauer, the content of his responses was not informative or accurate, e.g., telling her that he had submitted papers on her behalf when he had not. Respondent was unable or unwilling also to provide Grauer and her substitute counsel a complete copy of her case file after she terminated Hamilton. He provided an incomplete copy two months after her request, thereby limiting Grauer\u2019s ability to make informed decisions regarding her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>5. MLRPC 1.5(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">MLRPC 1.5(a) requires lawyers to charge only reasonable fees. The rule provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">(a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment of the lawyer;</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(5) the tune limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationships with the client;</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Even if a fee is reasonable on its face at the outset of representation, if the attorney fails thereafter to perform to any meaningful degree the legal services for which the fee was set initially, the fee becomes unreasonable with the benefit of hindsight. <em>See Guido, </em>391 Md. at 52-53, 891 A.2d at 1096-97 (\u201c[A]lthough [the] fee ... may not be unreasonable on its face, in the context of Guida\u2019s failure to perform the services to any meaningful degree ... the fee became unreasonable.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Respondent failed to produce or file documents and motions requested by Grauer, failed to subpoena witnesses, failed to prepare witnesses, and failed to make copies of motions and/or exhibits for Grauer\u2019s substitute attorney. In short, Respondent did little or nothing for which $5,000 would be a reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\n<em>\u0431. MLRPC 1.15(a) and (c); Md.

In <em>Wallace </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4J\">The record in the case at bar does not indicate that respondent had received any previous reprimands or sanctions from this Court; nevertheless the volume and severity of the complaints lead us to conclude that the appropriate sanction is disbarment. Respondent has engaged in a pattern of conduct that only the most severe sanction of disbarment will provide the protection to the public that this procedure is supposed to provide. Respondent\u2019s lack of diligence, his lack of preparation, his failure to communicate with his clients, his charging of unreasonable fees, his failure to account for and return monies, his misrepresentations and his failure to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests all lead to the most severe sanction of disbarment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\"><em>Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 293, 793 A.2d at 545.

Rule 16-607 prohibits the attorney from depositing non-trust funds into the account and from failing to withdraw earned fees from the account. Md. Rule 16-608 governs interest earned on attorney trust accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><em>. </em>Whether labeled a retainer fee or \"flat\u201d fee matters not in these cases because the exception noted in Md. Rule 16-604 <em>(see infra </em>note 23) is not implicated by the facts here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">. The timeline makes it clear that Respondent received funds from his clients before he began work on their cases, so, at the time Respondent received the funds, he had not performed any work to earn them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\">. It is irrelevant to our analysis of the MLRPC 1.15(a) charges whether Respondent earned the fees he charged Manning and DeVincent, <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v. Ugwuonye, </em>405 Md. 351, 371, 952 A.2d 226, 237-38 (2008) (holding that even if a fee was eventually earned such does not excuse an initial failure to deposit the fees into attorney trust account when they were received and unearned), as opposed to Grauer\u2019s case where the fee was never earned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">. Under Md. Rule 16-604, the only funds that do not have to be deposited into a trust account are those \u201creceived as fees owed the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client .... \u201d None of the funds discussed in the present case fall into the excepted category; therefore, all the payments needed to be paid into a trust account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\">. The language of MLRPC 1.15(c) permits advances against unearned fees to be treated as the property of either the lawyer or the client. The Rule\u2019s default position is that, unless the client gives informed consent, the money is to be treated as the property of the client. Comment to 1.15(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b226-13\">. The record does not indicate that Respondent informed his clients of the ability to hold money in an attorney trust account and there is no mention regarding consent as to where the money was held. Because the default provision under the Rule provides that trust money must be held in an attorney trust account, absent evidence of informed consent a violation occurred. <em>See supra </em>note 23, at 189, 118 A.3d at 973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b228-11\">. The MLRPC 8.4(c) charge is addressed before the 8.4(b) charge because our discussion of 8.4(b) references our analysis of 8.4(c). Specifically, the 8.4(b) requires Petitioner to meet a higher burden of proof and of persuasion than relying exclusively on \u201can inference for lack of opposing evidence\u201d, the latter of which is permitted under our 8.4(c) jurisprudence. The discussion of 8.4(b) becomes clearer also after we reach a conclusion whether Respondent violated 8.4(c) by misappropriating funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b229-10\">. Respondent produced no evidence to counter Bar Counsel\u2019s allegation that he misappropriated Grauer's funds. In the absence of any of the required recordkeeping, the hearing judge (and we) may infer that the funds were misappropriated. When no exceptions are filed, and the findings are not erroneous clearly, we are inclined to accept the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>judge\u2019s findings of fact. Respondent's failure to keep adequate records of the money he should have held in trust for Grauer permits an inference that Respondent misappropriated Grauer\u2019s funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">. BOP \u00a7 10-606(b) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">A person who willfully violates any provision of Subtitle 3, Part 1 of this title, except for the requirement that a lawyer deposit trust moneys in an attorney trust account for charitable purposes under \u00a7 10-303 of this title, is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b230-11\">. The plain language requires that an attorney not use trust money in a manner different from the reason it was entrusted to him. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>we decided already that Respondent misappropriated funds, <em>supra </em>at 194-95, 118 A.3d at 975-76, it follows that he used the trust money paid to him by Grauer in a manner different then the reason for which it was entrusted to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">. BOP \u00a7 10-307 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">A lawyer who willfully violates any provision of this Part 1 of this subtitle, except for the requirement that a lawyer deposit trust money in an attorney trust account for charitable purposes under \u00a7 10-303 of this subtitle, is subject to disciplinary proceedings as the Maryland Rules provide.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">. Although we find often that a pattern of MLRPC 8.4(a) and (d) violations results in disbarment, a single violation of 8.4(c) can be the occasion of disbarment. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 413, 983 A.2d 434, 466 (2009) (\u2018\u2018[W]hen an attorney engages in dishonest or fraudulent conduct as proscribed in M[L]RPC 8.4(c), we do not discuss 'degrees\u2019 of dishonesty, but generally order disbarment, absent compelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
