State, </em>404 Md. 591, 606, 948 A.2d 30, 39 (2008). Nevertheless, crime victims are vested with a number of \u201cspecific, but narrow\u201d constitutional and statutory rights in criminal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 948 A.2d at 39. For example, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 11-603 of the Criminal Procedure Article permits a court to enter a judgment of restitution ordering a defendant to compensate a victim for monetary loss. When a victim alleges that a court failed to consider or improperly denied a restitution request, \u00a7 ll-103(e) of the Criminal Procedure Article permits the victim to file a motion for reconsideration: \u201cA victim who alleges that the victim\u2019s right to restitution under \u00a7 11-603 of this title was not considered or was improperly denied may file a motion requesting relief within 30 days of the denial or alleged failure to consider.\u201d And \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article permits the victim to file an application for leave to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">Although not a party to a criminal or juvenile proceeding, a victim of a crime for which the defendant or child respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>dent is charged may file an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from an interlocutory order or appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from a final order that denies or fails to consider a right secured to the victim by ... \u00a7 11-608 of this title[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-204(b), an application for leave to appeal \u201cshall be filed -within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is sought.\u201d In this case, we consider whether the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to consider an appeal challenging a denial of restitution when the application for leave to appeal was filed more than 30 days after a final sentencing judgment, but less than 30 days after the denial of a motion for reconsideration challenging the sentencing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In May 2011, Petitioner, Shyquille Griffin, and Antonio Whitely arranged to purchase marijuana from Respondent, Andrew Lindsey. When the three met to consummate the transaction, Whitely was dissatisfied with the quantity of marijuana that Lindsey provided. Consequently, Griffin approached Lindsey, who was seated in his vehicle, and asked him \u201cfor what else he had in the car.\u201d Whitely then approached with a handgun brandished and pointed the weapon at Lindsey, demanding \u201ceverything that he had in the vehicle.\u201d As Lindsey drove off, Whitely shot him in the arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Griffin and Whitely were indicted in June 2011 on charges related to the shooting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 30, 2011, Griffin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>entered a plea agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with the State. The Agreement provided that if Griffin provided truthful testimony in the State\u2019s case against Whitely, the State would agree to a guilty plea for Count 4 of the indictment \u2014 Attempted Robbery \u2014 and a sentencing cap of 15 years, suspending all but 18 months. The Agreement did not mention restitution, and it contained a provision stating that it represented \u201cthe full and complete agreement of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">At a plea hearing conducted on December 16, 2011, the parties presented the Agreement to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The hearing judge accepted the terms of the Agreement, concluding that there was a sufficient factual basis for the guilty plea to Count 4. The hearing judge then postponed sentencing until January 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">After satisfying the terms of the Agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Griffin returned to court on January 13, 2012 for sentencing under the plea agreement. Acknowledging that \u201cthere [was] nothing in the plea agreement about restitution,\u201d the State nevertheless advised the court that Lindsey was seeking $9,700 in restitution. Relying on <em>Lafontant v. State, </em>197 Md.App. 217, 13 A.3d 56 (2011), the State argued that a victim has an absolute right to request restitution regardless of whether it appeared in a plea agreement. The hearing court disagreed, concluding that it could not order restitution because it would violate the Agreement by adding to the penalty. Consistent with the Agreement, the Circuit Court sentenced Griffin to 15 years of incarceration, suspending all but 18 months, and three years of supervised probation. It did not order restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Invoking \u00a7 ll-103(e) of the Criminal Procedure Article and arguing that the hearing court improperly denied his request for restitution, Lindsey filed a timely \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Restitution and Request for Hearing\u201d (\u201cCP \u00a7 11\u2014 103(e) Motion\u201d) on February 13, 2012. The Circuit Court denied the CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) Motion on March 7, 2012, reiterating that ordering restitution would violate the Agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>which did not include restitution, and reasoning, for the first time, that ordering restitution would violate \u201cthe Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Lindsey filed an \u201cApplication for Leave to Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals\u201d (\u201cApplication\u201d) on April 5, 2012, which was granted. The intermediate appellate court reversed the Circuit Court, holding that although the Application was untimely with respect to the Circuit Court\u2019s January 13, 2012 sentencing judgment, the Application was timely with respect to the Circuit Court\u2019s March 7, 2012 order denying Lindsey\u2019s CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) Motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals further held that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it denied the CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) Motion because it had discretion to order restitution as a condition of Griffin\u2019s probation without violating the Agreement, Maryland Rule 4-345,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or Griffin\u2019s double jeopardy rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Griffin filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted to consider the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">1. Do crime victims lack statutory authority to appeal from the denial of a motion for reconsideration under Maryland Code (2008, 2011 Supp.), Criminal Procedure Article \u00a7 ll-103(e), thus depriving the Court of Special Appeals of jurisdiction to review the [Cjircuit [Cjourt\u2019s denial of Mr. Lindsey\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his request for restitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">2. Did the circuit court properly deny Mr. Lindsey\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his request for restitution from Mr. Griffin, when the court had already accepted Mr. Griffin\u2019s guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement that prohibited restitution, Mr. Griffin had already per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>formed his part of the plea agreement, and the [C]ircuit [C]ourt had already sentenced Mr. Griffin?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7m\">Because we answer yes to the first question, we need not address the second and shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The Circuit Court ruled that Lindsey was not entitled to restitution as a matter of law. We review questions of law without deference. <em>See Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002) (\u201c[Wjhere the order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The Circuit Court denied Lindsey\u2019s restitution request on two separate occasions: first on January 13, 2012 when it sentenced Griffin without ordering restitution and then again on March 7, 2012 when it denied Lindsey\u2019s CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) Motion. Pursuant to Maryland Rules 8-202(a) and 8-204(b), notices of appeal and applications for leave to appeal, respectively, \u201cshall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal\u201d is taken or sought. The 30-day requirement for notices of appeal \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>jurisdictional; if [it] is not met, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction and the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Houghton v. Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Kent Cnty., </em>305 Md. 407, 413, 504 A.2d 1145, 1148 (1986), <em>superseded by Rule on other grounds as stated in Hiob v. Progressive Am. Ins. Co., </em>440 Md. 466, 103 A.3d 596 (2014). \u201cWhen an application for leave to appeal is granted, and it is determined that the application was not filed timely, this same principle applies, and the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Keys v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 19, 27, 5 A.3d 1113, 1118 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Lindsey filed his Application on April 5, 2012 \u2014 more than 30 days after the sentencing judgment, but less than 30 days after the Order denying the CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) Motion. Although Lindsey satisfied Rule 8-204(b)\u2019s 30-day deadline with respect to his CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(e) Motion, we must address whether, when Lindsey filed his Application, victims had a right to file an application for leave to appeal the denial of CP \u00a7 11-103(e) motions. If victims did not have this right, Lindsey\u2019s Application was untimely and, therefore, the Court of Special Appeals did not have jurisdiction to consider his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Any right of a victim to file an application for leave to appeal, \u201cmust originate from the General Assembly, not from this Court.\u201d <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 230, 879 A.2d 695, 704 (2005), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Hoile v. State, </em>404 Md. at 605, 948 A.2d at 39. When Lindsey filed his Application, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2011 Supp.), \u00a7 11-103(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d) provided victims the right to file applications for leave to appeal when a court denied or failed to consider a right secured by 12 specific statutes, including the restitution provision. Noticeably absent from these 12 statutes, however, was CP \u00a7 11-103(e) \u2014 the \u201creconsideration provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Griffin and Lindsey offer competing interpretations of CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b). Griffin argues that because the reconsideration provision did not appear in CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b), Lindsey did not have a right to file an application for leave to appeal the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of his CP \u00a7 11-103(e) Motion. Lindsey counters that although the reconsideration provision was absent from CP \u00a7 11-103(b), a CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(e) motion is, at its heart, nothing more than a mechanism for asking a court to review its earlier determination under CP \u00a7 11-603 \u2014 the \u201crestitution provision.\u201d In other words, the restitution provision is embodied in a CP \u00a7 11-103(e) motion. Thus, Lindsey contends, because the restitution provision appears in CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b), he had a right to file an application for leave to appeal the denial of his CP \u00a7 11-103(e) Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">When interpreting CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b), we bear in mind that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 571, 911 A.2d 427, 431 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In ascertaining the General Assembly\u2019s intent, we apply our oft-repeated canons of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">[W]e begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction____We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we conf\u00edne strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\"><em>Williams v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>440 Md. 573, 580-81, 103 A.3d 658, 663 (2014) (alterations in original). Specifically, when construing statutes granting the right to appeal, we must do so narrowly. <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 98, 939 A.2d 689, 706 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Beginning with the plain meaning of the language of the statute, the reconsideration provision is clearly absent from CP \u00a7 ll-103(b). This is significant because \u201c[t]he prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ciples of applying a plain meaning approach [to statutory construction] include consideration of the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another).\u201d <em>Hudson v. Hous. Auth. of Balt. City, </em>402 Md. 18, 30, 935 A.2d 395, 402 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This doctrine is a \u201cfundamental principle of construction, long recognized in Maryland.\u201d Id. Although we have stated that this doctrine should be \u201cused with caution,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> its application is appropriate in this case because the General Assembly must \u201cexpressly grant\u201d the right of appeal. <em>Howard Cnty. v. JJM, Inc., </em>301 Md. 256, 261, 482 A.2d 908, 910 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Consistent with this doctrine, we have held that when a certain element is not expressly stated in the language of a statute or Maryland Rule, the statute or Rule is unambiguous and does not include that element. For instance, in <em>Rush v. State, supra, </em>we considered whether Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(c)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) permitted a defendant to file a cross-appeal when the State appealed the grant of a motion to suppress. Because the plain language of CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(3) only addressed the State\u2019s right to appeal an order granting suppression,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we held that the statute was unambiguous and the defendant did not have a right to file a cross-appeal. <em>Rush, </em>403 Md. at 101-02, 939 A.2d at 708-09 (\u201cSection 12-302(c)(3) does not confer appellate jurisdiction to hear a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. Rather, the statute clearly limits the right to appeal ... to the State[.]\u201d). In support of our decision, we explained that \u201c[w]here the defendant has been given a specific right to appeal in addition to the right to appeal from final judgments, the Legislature has been specific in protecting that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 939 A.2d at 708. We then contrasted the language of CJP \u00a7 12-401, which explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he defendant may appeal even from a final judgment entered in the District Court though imposition or execution of sentence has been suspended,\u201d with the language of CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(3), which \u201csp[oke] only of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101-02, 939 A.2d at 708-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In <em>State v. Manck, </em>another case dealing with appellate rights under Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl. Vol., 2004 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 12-302(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, we concluded that the State did not have a right to appeal the trial court\u2019s decision to strike the State\u2019s \u201cNotice of Intention to Seek the Penalty of Death.\u201d 385 Md. 581, 598, 870 A.2d 196, 206 (2005). Because \u00a7 12-302(c) did not explicitly identify this type of trial court decision as one from which the State may appeal, we concluded the State \u201c[cjlearly\u201d did not have a right to appeal. <em>Id. </em>We explained that expanding the statute\u2019s appellate rights beyond those explicitly identified in Section 12-302(c) \u201cwould violate the separation of powers doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598 n. 13, 870 A.2d at 206 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Lindsey argues that we should consider a CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) motion to be synonymous with an original request for restitution under CP \u00a7 11-603. But Lindsey cites no case in which we have held that a motion for reconsideration is the same as, or should be treated the same as, the action that caused the judgment subject to reconsideration. Our independent research, likewise, reveals no such case. Thus, Lindsey cannot overcome the exclusion of the reconsideration provision in CP \u00a7 ll-103(b) by relying on the inclusion of the restitution provision in CP \u00a7 11-103(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Not only does Lindsey\u2019s argument defy the unambiguous language of CP \u00a7 ll-103(b), but also it contradicts our reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ing in <em>Chmurny v. State, </em>392 Md. 159, 896 A.2d 354 (2006), in which we concluded that the defendant\u2019s appeal was untimely because he failed to file it within 30 days of a final judgment. Shortly after the jury returned several guilty verdicts, the defendant committed suicide. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 896 A.2d at 355. Consequently, defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss the case, but the trial court denied it. <em>Id. </em>at 162-63, 896 A.2d at 355. Nearly four years later, defense counsel filed a new motion to dismiss that was also denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 896 A.2d at 356. Defense counsel appealed, but we dismissed the appeal because the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s first motion to dismiss was a final judgment and defense counsel failed to appeal within 30 days. We reasoned that \u201cone cannot allow the time for noting an appeal from [a final, appealable] judgment to lapse and escape the jurisdictional bar by filing another, identical motion or a <em>motion to reconsider </em>the earlier ruling months or years later and then appealing the denial of that second motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 896 A.2d at 358 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>We have long held that a sentencing judgment is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the January 13, 2012 sentencing at which the Circuit Court denied Lindsey\u2019s first request for restitution was an appealable final judgment. Applying our reasoning from <em>Chmurny, </em>Lindsey had 30 days to file an appeal from this final judgment. He could not \u201callow the time for noting an appeal from that judgment to lapse and escape the jurisdictional bar by filing a motion to reconsider the earlier ruling ... and then appealing the denial of that second motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lindsey filed his Application on April 5, 2012 \u2014 less than 30 days after his motion for reconsideration was denied, but almost three months after Griffin\u2019s sentencing. Like the defendant in <em>Chmurny, </em>Lindsey allowed the time for noting an appeal to lapse, and he cannot cure this jurisdictional defect by appealing the denial of a subsequent motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Finally, Lindsey\u2019s argument further fails because accepting it would undermine our rule that we must narrowly construe statutes granting the right to appeal. <em>Rush, </em>403 Md. at 98, 939 A.2d at 706. Holding that a victim could appeal not only from the denial of or failure to consider a right secured by the 12 statutes enumerated in CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b), but also from a motion to reconsider the denial of or failure to consider these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>rights, would considerably increase victims\u2019 appellate rights. Such a construction is anything but narrow and must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In conclusion, we hold that Lindsey\u2019s appeal was untimely because CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b) did not permit a crime victim to file an application for leave to appeal the denial of a CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(e) motion. We construe grants of appellate authority narrowly, and the language of CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b) is unambiguous \u2014 it does not include the right to appeal from a denial of a CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) motion. Griffin\u2019s January 13, 2012 sentencing was a final judgment, and Lindsey cannot rely on his appeal from the denial of his subsequent motion for reconsideration to escape his failure to timely file his Application after the sentencing. Accordingly, because Lindsey\u2019s appeal was untimely, the Court of Special Appeals did not have jurisdiction to consider it, and we reverse its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The situation is similar to that of a defendant who may simultaneously note an appeal and move for reconsideration of the defendant's sentence by a three-judge panel in the trial court. <em>See Gardner v.

Here the timing of the motion for reconsideration afforded the trial judge the opportunity to correct his mistake prior to any appellate intervention. Under the majority\u2019s approach today, because Respondent filed a timely motion for reconsideration but failed to simultaneously apply for leave to appeal the court\u2019s initial denial of restitution, Respondent extinguished his right to appeal the trial judge\u2019s error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That proposition of law, which lies contrary to the language and purpose of the statute, the interests of judicial economy, and the broad language of the Maryland constitution, I must reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">As the majority has outlined in greater detail, on January 13, 2012, the state informed the trial court during sentencing that Lindsey sought restitution. This motion was denied by the court on the grounds that restitution would violate the terms of Griffin\u2019s plea agreement. The trial court proceeded to sentence Griffin to 15 years of incarceration, with all but 18 months suspended, along with three years of supervised probation. As the majority notes, following the trial court\u2019s denial of Lindsey\u2019s request for restitution, Respondent filed a timely motion for reconsideration pursuant to CP \u00a7 11\u2014 103(e)(2) on February 13, 2012, attaching his medical bills to the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing on the matter, conducted on March 7, 2012, the trial court, once again, denied Lindsey\u2019s request, asserting that ordering restitution would violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>terms of the plea agreement and would violate the Maryland Constitution. Less than 30 days later, on April 5, Respondent filed an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which was granted by that court. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, concluding that it had abused its discretion when it denied Respondent\u2019s CP \u00a7 ll-103(e) Motion. On review before this Court, the majority holds, despite broad language in the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions, that the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Under CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b), as it existed at the time, \u201ca victim of a violent crime ... may file an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from an interlocutory or final order that denies or fails to consider a right secured to the victim by ... \u00a7 11-603 of this title[.]\u201d The \u201cright secured\u201d by CP \u00a7 11-603 is the right to restitution. The statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">(a) A court may enter a judgment of restitution that orders a defendant ... to make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the commission of a crime or delinquent act, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">(2) as a direct result of the crime ... the victim suffered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1I\">(i) actual medical ... expenses or losses[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">(b) A victim is presumed to have a right to restitution under subsection (a) of this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">(1) the victim or the State requests restitution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">(2) the court is presented with competent evidence of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">any item listed in subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">CP \u00a7 11-603 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Although the majority is correct that CP \u00a7 ll-103(e)(2)\u2014 the vehicle by which Respondent timely challenged the trial court\u2019s January 13, 2012 denial of the request for restitution\u2014 is not specifically listed in \u00a7 11 \u2014 103(b), the right secured by \u00a7 ll-103(e)(2) is the very same right to restitution. The General Assembly connected these two provisions in CP \u00a7 11-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>103(e)(2)\u00ae itself, which provided in whole: \u201c[a] victim who alleges that the victim\u2019s right to restitution under \u00a7 11-603 of this title was not considered or was improperly denied may file a motion requesting relief within 30 days of the denial or alleged failure to consider.\u201d In case this was not clear enough, the legislature, in the same 2011 amendment that added \u00a7 ll-103(e)(2), also included \u00a7 11-103(e)(1), which provides in whole: \u201c[i]n any court proceeding involving a crime against a victim, <em>the court shall ensure that the victim is in fact afforded the rights provided to victims by law.\u201d </em>Chapter 362, 2011 Laws of Maryland (also referred to herein as \u201cH.B. 801\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In sum, the denial of the motion for reconsideration was a final order that denied \u201ca right secured to the victim\u201d by CP \u00a7 11-603, and Respondent, the \u201cvictim of a violent crime,\u201d was therefore entitled to \u201cfile an application for leave to appeal.\u201d I respectfully disagree that the plain meaning of the statute is that Respondent\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not capable of being appealed under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The holding of the majority leads to an odd statutory scheme, out of step with the General Assembly\u2019s trend in granting victims rights, <em>see Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 230 879 A.2d 695, 704 (2005) (Wilner, J., concurring), <em>superseded by statute as recognized in Hoile v. State, </em>404 Md. 591, 605, 948 A.2d 30, 39 (2008). In the majority\u2019s view, when Respondent\u2019s initial motion for restitution on January 13, 2012 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>was denied, he should have recognized that the denial was a final order denying a right secured to him as a crime victim. In addition, the majority suggests, he should have appreciated that the denial of a motion to reconsider restitution would not be considered a final order and therefore would not be appeal-able. In my view, Respondent\u2019s reliance on CP \u00a7 11\u2014 103(e)(2), therefore was, indeed, a trap: by not realizing that the denial of the motion for reconsideration would not qualify as a final order denying his right to restitution, Respondent forfeited his right to appellate review. Failing to simultaneously file a motion for reconsideration and apply for leave to appeal extinguished Respondent\u2019s right to appeal an erroneous decision, despite state constitutional provisions and statutes that suggest that the General Assembly is committed at the very least to not erecting such barriers between crime victims and their rights. Article 47 is worded quite broadly, guaranteeing crime victims the right to \u201cbe treated by agents of the State with dignity, respect, and sensitivity during all phases of the criminal justice process.\u201d Md. Decl. of Rights Art. XLVII. The majority\u2019s holding suggests that the legislature intended to accomplish the opposite in adopting CP \u00a7 11-103(e)(2). While I agree that statutes granting the right to appeal must be construed narrowly, <em>see Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 98, 939 A.2d 689, 706 (2008), we are not bound to interpret the statute so narrowly that rights granted by the Maryland Constitution and the General Assembly are rendered toothless.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">A major concern of the majority appears to be that future victims, and possibly defendants as well, could \u201callow the time for noting an appeal from [a final, appealable] judgment to lapse and escape the jurisdictional bar by filing another, identical motion or a <em>motion to reconsider </em>the earlier ruling months or years later and then appealing the denial of that second motion.\u201d Maj. Op. at 290, 119 A.3d at 760 (quoting <em>Chmurny v. State, </em>392 Md. 159, 166, 896 A.2d 354, 358 (2006)). This concern, in part, appears to arise from the situation in <em>Chmumy </em>which the majority discusses at length. The extraordinary circumstances of <em>Chmurny, </em>involving the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>dant\u2019s suicide between the verdict and sentencing, and the lawyer taking it upon himself to attempt to sneak in an appeal by filing an identical motion four years after the trial court denied a motion for reconsideration, make the case less than controlling and diminish its effect on the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">There is no suggestion in the record that Respondent was attempting to skirt the thirty day filing requirement under CP \u00a7 ll-103(b). Indeed, Respondent submitted a timely motion to reconsider the trial court\u2019s decision at sentencing \u2014 a decision that should not be punished. The majority\u2019s concern, whatever its worth might be in another case, is without merit in the instant matter because, under CP \u00a7 11-103(e)(2)\u00ae, Respondent had only thirty days to \u201cfile a motion requesting relief.\u201d Affirming the Court of Special Appeals would not lead to any of the consequences contemplated by <em>Chmurny. </em>Because the victim produced competent evidence of his medical expenses, the trial judge in the instant case was bound by law, absent extraordinary circumstances not present in this case, to order restitution and lacked the discretion to do otherwise. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 ll-603(b) (\u201cA victim is presumed to have a right to restitution under subsection (a) of this section if ... the victim or the State requests restitution; and ... the court is presented with competent evidence of any item listed in subsection (a) of this section.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Furthermore, affirming the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals would be consistent with appeals from denials of motions for reconsideration in other legal contexts. <em>See, e.g., Wilson-X v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>403 Md. 667, 674-75, 944 A.2d 509, 514 (2008) (\u201c[T]he ruling on a motion for reconsideration is ordinarily discretionary, and [ ] the standard of review in such a circumstance is whether the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.\u201d); <em>Grimberg v. Marth, </em>338 Md. 546, 553, 659 A.2d 1287, 1290 (1995) (finding that an appeal, filed more than thirty days after judgment but fewer than thirty days after denial of motion for reconsideration, would lie and that the scope of review would be \u201climited to whether the trial judge abused his discretion in declining to reconsider the judgment\u201d); <em>First Federated Commodity Trust Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>Comm\u2019r of Sec., </em>272 Md. 329, 332-33, 322 A.2d 539, 542 (1974) (appeal from order dismissing motion to vacate held timely, but scope of review limited to abuse of discretion); <em>S. &amp; G. Realty Co., Inc. v. Woodmoor Realty Corp., </em>255 Md. 684, 689, 259 A.2d 281, 283-84 (1969) (involving an appeal filed more than thirty days after the entry of judgment but within thirty days of decision on a motion to set aside or modify decree treated as an appeal solely from a decision on a motion, and abuse of discretion standard applied); <em>State v. Bundy, </em>52 Md.App. 456, 460-61, 450 A.2d 495, 497 (1982) (finding jurisdiction over State\u2019s appeal from denial of motion for reconsideration and reviewing the denial under an abuse of discretion standard). Although, \u201c[a]s a general rule, \u2018a motion to modify or reduce a sentence is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court and is not appealable[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>125 Md.App. 428, 442, 725 A.2d 635, 642 (1999) (citation omitted), the reasons for disallowing an appeal from this sort of motion \u2014 when such appeals <em>are </em>disallowed \u2014 simply are not present in this case. These reasons are the same as those articulated in <em>Chmumy: </em>foreclosing a party\u2019s ability to sneak in an appeal after letting the time to appeal expire. <em>See Thomason v. Bucher, </em>266 Md. 1, 4-6, 291 A.2d 437, 439 (1972) (citing similar reasons for affirming dismissal of appeal as untimely) and cases cited therein. As noted above, under CP \u00a7 11-103(e), victims have only thirty days to file a motion for reconsideration after a court\u2019s denial of restitution. Finally, this Court has held that \u201ctrial judges do not have discretion to apply inappropriate legal standards, even when making decisions that are regarded as discretionary in nature.\u201d <em>Wilson-X, </em>403 Md. at 675, 944 A.2d at 514. Thus, consistent with our case law and the language of CP \u00a7 11-103(b), the denial of the motion for reconsideration was appealable and was subject to review for abuse of discretion, including the abuse that \u201coccurs when the judge ... [\u2018]acts beyond the letter or reason of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson-X, </em>403 Md. at 677, 944 A.2d at 515 (citation omitted). It is important to note that this approach would not, as the majority suggests, \u201cconsiderably increase victims\u2019 appellate rights.\u201d Rather, it serves to protect an interest already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>granted to them by statute, namely, the ability to receive restitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Judge McDONALD has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\">.

While the majority may be correct that a victim is not precluded from simultaneously moving for reconsideration and applying for leave to appeal, it is not clear that victims \u2014 who are not parties to the underlying criminal case \u2014 are or ought to be <em>required </em>to do so in order to preserve their appellate rights. Moreover, it took nearly a month for the trial court to rule on the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">.
