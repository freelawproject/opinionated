A Superior Court judge allowed the bank\u2019s motion without evidentiary hearing or comment. The debtors argue that the allowance of the motion is in direct contravention of G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 17, which prohibits an original execution from being issued more than one year after final judgment has been entered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the allowance of the motion and remand for further proceedings in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 17, limits the issuance of original executions to the one-year period after entitlement thereto, subject to the exhaustion or lapse of rights to appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 17 has been a part of our statutes in several versions since 1692. St. 1692-3, c. 24, \u00a7 3. The critical time limitation language of \u00a7 17 has not varied in its essential command since that time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That language is clear and unambiguous, <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977), and the use of the words \u201cshall not\u201d in limiting the time of issuance of an original execution imports an absolute prohibition to public officers. See <em>Washington Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>188 Mass. 103, 105-106 (1905) (the clerk \u201ccould not,\u201d without consent of the debtor, issue an execution outside the time limits of the predecessor statutes of \u00a7 17); <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609-610 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">While the bank asserts there is a dearth of case law on this issue, we conclude there are sufficient cases that speak clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>and uniformly on the time limitation. After the entry of a judgment, \u201cthe law awards the execution. . . . There is no judicial discretion to be exercised on the subject; the party may demand it of right, within the limitations as to time prescribed by the statute.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. Santosuosso, 308 Mass. 202, 206 (1941), quoting from <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Wardwell, </em>10 Mass. 356, 357 (1813). While those cases principally involved issues of how soon after judgment a party is entitled to take out an execution, the <em>Briggs </em>court indicated, <em>id. </em>at 358, that \u201cafter the expiration of the year\u201d the issuance of an original execution would not be lawful. In <em>Pease </em>v. Morris, 138 Mass. 72, 74 (1884), the court, in referring to Pub. Sts. 1882, c. 171, \u00a7 16, a predecessor of c. 235, \u00a7 17, stated that an \u201coriginal execution . . . must issue within [one year of a judgment].\u201d Compare <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>7 Mass. 62 (1810) (without citation to a statute, the court refused to stay execution \u201cbecause the year would expire, within which execution must issue\u201d); <em>Washington Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 105-106 (citing the 1783, 1836, 1860, and 1882 predecessors of c. 235, \u00a7 17, the court stated, \u201cfor more than a century it has been provided that no original execution shall be issued within twenty-four hours after judgment, nor after one year has expired[,]\u201d from the time a party is entitled to it). We have found no case, nor has one been cited to us, that suggests there are any exceptions to the strict ministerial observance of the one-year limitation during which an original execution may be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 19, states in relevant part as follows: \u201cIf a judgment remains unsatisfied after the expiration of the time for taking out execution thereon, the creditor may obtain a new execution by motion to the court in which such unsatisfied judgment was rendered, or he may at any time after the judg- . ment, subject to section twenty of chapter two hundred and sixty, bring a civil action thereon.\u201d Although the bank correctly recognizes that this section provides, under the second clause, that a party may bring a civil action on the judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it has not argued that it is entitled to pursue the issuance of a \u201cnew\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>execution under the first clause. Nevertheless, we consider whether the judge\u2019s allowance of the bank\u2019s motion may have been proper under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">We first observe that both \u00a7 17 and \u00a7 19 speak of the issuance of a \u201cnew\u201d execution. We therefore \u201cfollow the canon of statutory construction that where words are used in one part of a statute in a definite sense, they should be given the same meaning in another part of the statute,\u201d <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 617 (1982), and we do not regard any of the words of the statutes as surplusage. <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 423 (1946). We also construe each clause or phrase with reference to every other clause or phrase so that \u201call parts shall be construed as consistent with each other so as to form a harmonious enactment.\u201d <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commission, </em>324 Mass. 309, 312-313 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Section 17 provides that a court may order a new execution for the amount remaining due where \u201cany <em>execution,\u201d </em>original or successive, is returned unsatisfied for \u201cany reason,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and without \u201cfurther judgment or determination.\u201d <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>264 Mass. 592, 595 (1928). Cf. <em>Honer </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 295-296 (1999).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">A new execution under \u00a7 19 may be obtained where a <em>judgment </em>\u201cremains unsatisfied after the expiration of the time for taking out execution,\u201d but may be acquired only by motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Historically, the statutes preceding \u00a7 19 made the issuance of a new execution subject to first obtaining a writ of scire facias.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Scire facias was \u201c[a] judicial writ directing a debtor to appear and show cause why a dormant judgment against him should not be revived.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1346 (6th ed. 1990). After that writ was abolished, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 81(b), 365 Mass. 841 (1974), and \u00a7 19 rewritten to conform with the new Rules of Civil Procedure, a new execution could be obtained by motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 19, because an execution is being sought without any of the information which would be available to a court from the return of a previous execution as under \u00a7 17, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>the statute requires the level of process and judicial scrutiny commensurate with our motion practice. Thereby, the court\u2019s consideration of the motion and the adverse party\u2019s responses will conform to the procedure formerly followed under a writ of scire facias. A debtor therefore is provided with an opportunity to raise a claim of partial or total satisfaction of the judgment. If a new execution could not be obtained without the prior issuance of an original or a successive execution, the first clause of \u00a7 19 would be superfluous to \u00a7 17. In that case, a creditor who did not obtain an original execution within the time permitted by \u00a7 17, would not be able to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>an otherwise valid judgment without commencing a new civil action on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Our interpretation that new executions are available under both \u00a7 17 and \u00a7 19, but under different circumstances and procedures, not only is faithful to the process inherent in the antecedents of \u00a7 19, but gives meaning to all of its provisions as well as those of \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 17, a new execution may be issued ministerially and upon return of an unsatisfied execution, while under \u00a7 19, a new execution may be issued only on motion and by order of a judge where a judgment is unsatisfied and no original execution has been issued. This interpretation also serves the interest of judicial economy because it permits the creditor to pursue satisfaction of the judgment without having to file an additional civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">We conclude, in the circumstances of this c\u00e1se, that it was error for the judge summarily to allow the bank\u2019s motion, but because of the view we have taken of c. 235, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 19, we remand to permit the judge to consider the bank\u2019s motion, and any response of the debtors,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to conduct a hearing if requested, to determine whether a new execution should be issued under the first clause of \u00a7 19 for any amount of the judgment not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-17\">Following the entry of a judgment by default in the Superior Court on February 24, 1992, an amended judgment was entered on April 6, 1992, in the amount of $318,448.89, including interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 17, states in relevant part as follows: \u201cAn original execution shall not issue after the expiration of one year after the party is first entitled to take it out; and an alias or other successive execution shall not issue after the expiration of five years from the return day of that which preceded it. Subject to section twenty of chapter two hundred and sixty, alias or successive executions shall be of full force and effect for five years from the date thereof unless satisfied in whole or discharged by law. All executions shall be returned to the court issuing them within ten days after their satisfaction or discharge. If any execution is returned for any reason to the court issuing the same unsatisfied in whole or in part, the court may, subject to the provisions of this section, order the issue of a new execution for the amount then remaining due.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 16, provides that \u201c[n]o execution shall issue upon a judgment until the exhaustion of all possible appellate review thereof, and the receipt by the clerk of the trial court of the appropriate rescript or order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Statutes 1692-3, c. 24, \u00a7 3, states as follows: \u201cThat after one year expired next after giving [\u00a1judgment in any [cjourt of [rjecord within this [pjrovince, no [ejxecution for such [\u00a1judgment shall be issued out until a [wjrit of <em>[s]cire facias </em>hath been granted out of the same [cjourt, and served upon the adverse party . . . .\u201d See discussion of scire facias, <em>infra </em>at 760.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b784-5\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 20, states as follows: \u201cA judgment or decree of a court of record of the United States or of any state thereof shall be presumed to be paid and satisfied at the expiration of twenty years after it was rendered.\u201d A party\u2019s rights under the judgment ordinarily are not affected by its failure to obtain an execution. See <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>114 Mass. 76 (1873); <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>194 Mass. 244, 246 (1907); <em>Leventhal </em>v. <em>American Discount </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number><em>Corp., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1981). See generally Shapiro, Perlin, &amp; Connors, Massachusetts Collection Law \u00a7\u00a7 8:2, 9:9 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"pAK0B\">This language is taken from the last sentence of the first paragraph of \u00a7 17, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>and was added by St. 1925, c. 217, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Generally, executions under \u00a7 17 are issued not by express judicial order but by ministerial action of the court\u2019s officers. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Santosuosso, </em>308 Mass. at 205-206. Even when a court orders a new execution to issue where an execution is returned unsatisfied to any extent, as permitted by the last sentence of the first paragraph of \u00a7 17, the court\u2019s action is ministerial. Because an execution returned to the court will contain information from an officer authorized to deal with the execution on which a court may rely, \u00a7 17 does not require a motion procedure and judicial scrutiny before a new execution is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">A return is \u201c[t]he act of a sheriff, constable, marshall, or other ministerial officer, in delivering back to the court a writ, notice, process or other paper, which he was required to serve or execute, with a brief account of his doings under the mandate, the time and mode of service or execution, or his failure to accomplish it, as the case may be.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1318 (6th ed. 1990). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 4(f), 365 Mass. 733 (1974); Shapiro, Perlin, &amp; Connors, Massachusetts Collection Law \u00a7\u00a7 9:29, 9:67 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Section 19 has evolved separately from \u00a7 17, beginning in St. 1692-3, c. 24, \u00a7 2, which states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\u201cThat where judgment has passed in any . . . [cjourt. . . and [ejxecution has not been taken out and levied for [sjatisfying of the same, the [pjarty for whom any [jjudgement was so given . . . shall have a [wjrit of <em>[s]cire facias </em>from the [cjlerk of the [ijnferiour [cjourt of [pjleas within the same [cjounty in which such [[judgment was obtained, unto the adverse [pjarty to appear before [thej said [cjourt, to shew [cjause (if any there be) why [ejxecution should not issue forth. And in case of [n]on-appearance, or that sufficient cause be not shewn to the [cjourt, the former [\u00a1judgment shall be affirmed, and execution granted accordingly . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">In the statutes preceding the present \u00a7 19, the designation of an execution as \u201cnew\u201d first appears in Revised Statutes c. 97, \u00a7 8 (1836), which states as follows: \u201cIf a judgment remains unsatisfied, after the expiration of the time for taking out execution thereon, the creditor may have a scire facias to obtain a new execution . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Section 19 was conformed to the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 222, and St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7 118. The latter statute inserted the present wording. Rule 69 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 836 (1974), provides a \u201c[pjrocess to enforce a judgment for the payment of money,\u201d and states that the \u201cprocedure on execution . . . shall be in accordance with applicable statutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\u201cThere also are provisions to obtain \u201cnew\u201d executions, by motion, in c. 235, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 21, where an unsatisfied judgment remains after an adverse party has recovered for an erroneous levy under a prior execution. The requirement for motions in these sections is consistent with our interpretation of \u00a7 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The debtors responded to the bank\u2019s motion, stating that there had been a foreclosure on the property securing the promissory note underlying the judgment in this case, that the property had been sold, and that the debtors have not been provided with an accounting of the proceeds. They claimed they therefore could not determine whether the judgment had been satisfied. Because the debtors apparently have not received an evaluation of their response to the bank\u2019s motion, they should be afforded judicial scrutiny of their claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
