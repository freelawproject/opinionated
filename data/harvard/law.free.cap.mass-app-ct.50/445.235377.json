We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><em>Background. </em>The Commonwealth presented evidence that the defendant unlawfully sold Percocet pills from his office in Brockton to an undercover State trooper on October 18, 1994, October 20, 1994, and November 10, 1994. The trooper had been introduced to the defendant by a former patient, Dennis LaCorte, who identified the trooper as his sister-in-law. LaCorte was present at the first sale; the trooper was alone with the defendant during the other sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The defendant testified in pertinent part as follows: In August, 1993, LaCorte, a patient, described himself as a longtime criminal and threatened to \u201churt\u201d the defendant and his family if he did not supply LaCorte with prescriptions for pills. At that time, LaCorte also threatened that a friend of his would \u201ctake care\u201d of the defendant and his family if he \u201csnitched.\u201d In December, 1993, LaCorte directed the defendant to supply him with pills rather than prescriptions. When the defendant refused, LaCorte said, \u201cI know where your daughter lives. I know where she goes to school. I know how she gets there.\u201d LaCorte then placed his hands on his own throat and gestured, and then waved a gun in front of the defendant\u2019s nose. The defendant\u2019s daughter was then fifteen years old. In January, 1994, a friend of LaCorte told the defendant, \u201cYou better do as [LaCorte] says if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d In March, 1994, LaCorte, without invitation, appeared at the defendant\u2019s home in Warwick, Rhode Island, said only, \u201cHi, Doc. Nice house you have here,\u201d and departed. On another occasion, LaCorte pointed out a large dog in his car and said to the defendant, \u201cDoc, you don\u2019t know what this dog can do to a child.\u201d In July, 1994, LaCorte told the defendant that if he did not supply him with pills, \u201cI will see your daughter.\u201d The defendant\u2019s daughter moved to California in August, 1994. The defendant unlawfully supplied LaCorte with prescriptions and pills throughout the period from August, 1993, until October 18, 1994, the day when LaCorte introduced the undercover trooper to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>Duress instruction. </em>The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201cTo have duress, three things must be present. First, the defendant must have received a present and immediate threat which caused him to have a well-founded fear of imminent death or serious bodily injury if he did not do the criminal act. That must be imminent and must be present throughout the commission of the crime. Second, the defendant must have had no reasonable opportunity to escape. And third, the defendant, or any other person of reasonable firmness, must have had no other choice and been unable to do otherwise in the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Relying on the definition of duress in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189 (1981), the defendant argues that there is no \u201cimminence\u201d requirement under our law. In <em>Robinson, </em>the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201c[I]n respect to serious crimes . . . \u2018duress\u2019 is usually taken to require a present, immediate, and impending threat of such a nature as to induce a well-founded fear of death or of serious bodily injury if the criminal act is not done; the actor must have been so positioned as to have had no reasonable chance of escape. He must have been put in a condition of mind where neither he nor a person of reasonable firmness could have acted otherwise in the circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 199-200. This definition has been recognized in recent decisions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>430 Mass. 252, 255-256 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 44 n.2, <em>S.C., </em>426 Mass. 48 (1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The defendant asserts that the judge erred by limiting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>jury\u2019s evaluation of his duress defense to a \u201cfear of <em>imminent </em>death or serious bodily injury\u201d (emphasis supplied) rather than using the instruction requested by him, which in pertinent part tracked the <em>Robinson </em>definition. He argues that the imminence requirement in that instruction and in the following sentence are contrary to \u201cthe state of the law in Massachusetts\u201d and to \u201cthe purpose behind the defense of duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">While there is considerable support among commentators<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in the Model Penal Code<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for defining duress without reference to temporal limits, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. at 199, and the decisions accepting its definition, have unmistakenly included a proximity element by requiring \u201ca present, immediate, and impending threat.\u201d It is significant that the instruction requested by the defendant included this phrase and that he did not object at trial, or in argument to us, to the judge\u2019s reference to a \u201cpresent and immediate threat.\u201d Because the words or gestures constituting a \u201cthreat\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> can be communicated only in the present, we conclude, as matter of logic, that the words \u201cpresent, immediate, and impending\u201d must be viewed as referring to the threatened harm. This is especially so with \u201cimpending,\u201d a word which, by definition,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> looks to the future and has little adjectival force when combined with a word connoting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>existing communication. We conclude that the judge\u2019s use of \u201cimminent\u201d to modify the feared harm (\u201cdeath or serious bodily injury\u201d) is consistent with the tone and general meaning of \u201cpresent, immediate, and impending\u201d as used in the <em>Robinson </em>definition. Defined as \u201cnear at hand,\u201d or \u201cmenacingly near,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1130 (1993), \u201cimminent\u201d also succinctly conflates the meaning of \u201cpresent, immediate, and impending,\u201d and, as used by the judge, permits jurors to apply it in the context of the totality of the evidence credited by them and without absolute time limits. The instruction at issue also is consistent with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melzer, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 174 (1982). There, the defendant claimed he suffered duress due, in part, to threats to harm his mother, who lived out of State. We noted that \u201c[s]he was plainly subject to no <em>immediate </em>risk\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Id. </em>at 184.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is significant that Justice Kaplan followed his definition of duress in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>with a citation to <em>Rhode Island Recreation Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>177 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir. 1949), in which the court stated that \u201ca veiled threat of future unspecified harm, as the threat \u2018to take care of\u2019, and \u2018not to forget\u2019 is not the equivalent of an immediate threat of death or severe bodily injury.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Further support for an imminency requirement derives from that aspect of the <em>Robinson </em>definition stating the defendant \u201cmust have been so positioned as to have had no reasonable chance of escape.\u201d 382 Mass. at 199. It may be inferred from this requirement that if the Commonwealth proves that the threatened harm is not so menacingly near as to render unreasonable any escape or avoidance, duress is not established.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Model Penal Code definition of duress, see note 5, <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>does not include an imminency requirement and also does not expressly require a defendant to avail himself of a reasonable opportunity to escape. By linking the imminency of harm and the possibility of escape, we advance, as matter of policy, the proposition that a threatened person, given the opportunity, must utilize available law enforcement resources to avoid committing a serious crime, provided those resources reasonably may be relied upon in the circumstances to protect him and any other threatened person. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mareno, </em>102 F.3d 994, 997 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 826 (1997). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brugmann, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 379-380 (1982) (in discussing the defense of \u201cnecessity,\u201d we stated, \u201cWhere there is an effective alternative available which does not involve a violation of the law, the defendant will not be justified in committing a crime. The defendant must make himself aware of existing alternatives and pursue those which are lawful, or show them to be futile in the circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Arguing that \u201c[tjhe issue is whether the threat deprived [him] of his free will,\u201d the defendant essentially claims that an imminency requirement ignores the reality that one\u2019s will may be overborne by a threat to do harm in the indefinite future. While the duress defense theoretically may be premised on relieving a person from criminal responsibility if he acts under compulsion rather than free will, the doctrine as generally defined by statute and case law has developed standards which are not limited to the subjective state of mind of the defendant. In <em>Robinson, </em>the court noted that \u201c[a] definition of duress in terms of a person of \u2018reasonable firmness\u2019 moves the concept away from a pure inquiry into voluntariness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. at 204 n.18. The same may be said of the requirement of \u201ca well-founded fear of death or of serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. See Newman &amp; Weitzer, Duress, Free Will and the Criminal Law, 30 S. Cal. L. Rev. 313, 315 (1957). Given the acceptance of the <em>Robinson </em>definition, any movement toward an absolute free will requirement properly awaits legislative action. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>430 Mass. at 256 n.2. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>sum, we conclude the judge did not err by including an imminency requirement in her instructions on duress.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The defendant also argues that the judge erred by not giving his requested instruction that duress could be established by proof of a threat of harm to a member of the defendant\u2019s family. Although thei \u201cthreat to another person\u201d formulation arguably places considerable strain on the <em>Robinson </em>definition of duress,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the combination of free will analysis, the great weight of author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ity,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and Justice Cutter\u2019s cautious prediction in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melzer, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 182,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> lead us to conclude that such language should be included in the definition of duress. It was not error, however, for the judge not to do so here because there was not sufficient evidence to establish an imminent or impending threat to the defendant\u2019s daughter or any other member of his family. According to the defendant\u2019s testimony, the last threat made to him was in July, 1994. Although the defendant testified to last seeing LaCorte on October 18, 1994, and speaking to him by telephone in the early part of November, 1994, no evidence indicated that any threats were communicated to him at or near the times of the illegal sales of October 18, October 20, and November 10, 1994. No reasonable juror could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s daughter, who was then in California, or any member of his family, was in danger of imminent harm at the time the charged crimes were committed. \u201cA judge need not charge on an hypothesis not supported by evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (1983), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Even if we assume the judge erred by not including a \u201cthreatened harm to another person\u201d in the duress instruction, the error was not preserved for appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We, therefore, apply a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). Given the focus of the trial, and arguments of counsel, on the credibility of the defendant and his witnesses and whether the defendant availed himself of the opportunity to obtain help, we are not persuaded that the result of the trial might have been different if the instruction in question had been given to the jury. Accordingly, we conclude there is no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13, 23 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Marital disqualification. </em>The defendant claims the judge erred in prohibiting him from testifying, during his direct examination, to the content of a private conversation with his wife concerning the LaCorte threats and in not allowing his wife to testify \u201cabout statements [the defendant] made to her.\u201d In both instances, the judge based her ruling on the marital disqualification statute. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20 (\u201cneither husband nor wife shall testify as to private conversations with the other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s rulings violated his right, under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to present witnesses and his right to a fair trial under that Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. It is recognized that such rights, while not absolute, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaikie, </em>375 Mass. 601, 608 (1978), may override State-created evidentiary rules. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maillet, </em>400 Mass. 572, 578 n.8 (1987). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sugrue, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 177 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">To determine whether the disqualification should yield to the invoked constitutional rights we look to whether the evidence at issue \u201cif admitted might have had a significant impact on the result of the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCreary, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 697 (1981). Stated otherwise, we look to whether the excluded evidence was sufficiently \u201crelevant, material, and not cumulative,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degrenier, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 215 (1996), to outweigh the policies behind the evidentiary bar. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sugrue, supra </em>at 176-177.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The defendant\u2019s apparent purpose<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in attempting to introduce conversations between him and his wife was to rebut the suggestion of recent fabrication \u2014 when arrested, he had not indicated he acted under duress \u2014 by demonstrating that he had discussed LaCorte\u2019s coercive behavior before committing the crimes. In the course of the trial, three witnesses, the defendant\u2019s daughter, his brother, and a patient, had testified that the defendant had told them of the threats before he was arrested. Consequently, the spousal conversations in issue would have been cumulative and would not have contributed materially to the defendant\u2019s case, especially because \u201csuch evidence is likely to be unreliable or untrustworthy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sugrue, supra </em>at 177.

In addressing an issue we did not otherwise \u201cconsider,\u201d we stated that at any retrial defense counsel would be \u201cwell-advised not to request a duress instruction which includes the language that \u2018a threat of future harm is not enough\u2019 as this formulation has been the subject of criticism.\u201d With the benefit of the record in that case, we know that this court was alluding to an instruction requested in the underlying trial that in pertinent part tracked the 1988 edition of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court. There, the sentence, \u201c[a] threat of future harm is not enough,\u201d was followed by \u201cthe threat must be imminent and must be present throughout the commission of the crime.\u201d It is significant that our court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, supra, </em>did not caution against the use of the imminency language in the latter sentence. Accordingly, the inclusion of an imminency requirement in the duress instruction in the 1997 edition of the Model Instructions, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>was not in derogation of our advice. Rather, the relevant change and comments in the 1997 Model Instructions merely reflected an acknowledgment of the following criticism contained in a commentary cited by us in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, supra </em>at 45: \u201cSince threats are promises of future harm and such harms, if occurring at the time of the act which is being forced, would be an impossibility having no meaning in terms of the \u2018duressed\u2019s\u2019 choice, such distinctions also lack meaning.\u201d Newman &amp; Weitzer, Duress, Free Will and the Criminal Law, 30 S.

App. 1986) (where duress statute did not state against whom the threat of harm exists, court determined that the common law rule is that the threat of harm must be against the defendant).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">See 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.3, at 621 (1986) (\u201c[t]he overwhelming majority of [duress] provisions extend to threats of harm to third parties\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Justice Cutter stated, \u201cWe think that the Massachusetts courts are likely to follow the principles concerning duress (by creating serious risks to persons other than the actor) set out in the Model Penal Code.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melzer, supra </em>at 182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Although the defendant incorporated harm to an actor\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d in his requested instruction, his only objection at the charge conference to the judge\u2019s indication that she was going to charge \u201cvirtually word for word\u201d from the 1997 Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court was to her proposed use of the word \u201cimminent.\u201d Similarly, the only relevant objection lodged by the defendant after the judge completed her charge was \u201cto instructing on imminent death or serious bodily injury.\u201d The charge essentially was not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s request and, in any event, it hardly can be said that \u201cthe point [relating to threatened harm to another person] was brought to the judge\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Biancardi, </em>421 Mass. 251, 254 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>422 Mass. 373, 376-377 (1996). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 786 n.25 (1997). Mere incorporation of a specific instruction in a set of requested instructions filed with the court, unaccompanied by any attempt at a charge conference to bring the specific request to the judge\u2019s attention or to object, then or after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>delivery to the jury, to its not being included in the judge\u2019s instructions, does not satisfy the requirements of Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979). That is especially true in the circumstance where, as here, the judge does not expressly reject the specific requested instruction but only indicates that she will give a certain model instruction which is not facially inconsistent with the specific requested instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Although the defendant made no offer of proof, we assume the conversations were offered \u201conly to rebut the claim of recent fabrication,\u201d because their hearsay aspect generally prevented their use as substantive evidence of duress. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Martinez, 425 Mass. 382, 396 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We reject the claim that the prosecution \u201copened the door\u201d for the introduction of the spousal conversations by having the defendant confirm, on cross-examination, that his wife was one of the \u201conly people in the world\u201d he spoke to concerning LaCorte. That inquiry followed questioning directed at why the defendant had not contacted the police. In any event, the defendant, during direct examination, had testified that he had a conversation \u201cabout these events\u201d with his wife and that she had overheard his \u201ctalking to [himself] about Mr. LaCorte and the pills.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
