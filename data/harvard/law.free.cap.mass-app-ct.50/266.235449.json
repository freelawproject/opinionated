An indictment for conspiracy to suborn perjury was filed without a change of plea. He was sentenced to four months of house arrest and two years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">The underlying dispute began in Groton in April, 1995, when a \u201cvery large\u201d dog owned by Edward D. Canto, Jr., a close friend and fellow police officer of the defendant, bit a puppy belonging to Canto\u2019s neighbors Maryann and Thomas Rooney. There followed \u201crepeated incidents\u201d in which Canto\u2019s dog \u201ccame after\u201d Maryann Rooney or her dogs. Without belaboring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the details of the dog dispute, by August, 1995, the Rooneys had applied to the board of selectmen of Groton for relief from Canto\u2019s unleashed dog. At about the same time, the Rooneys began to receive undue attention from the Groton police. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that Canto had offered at least three of his fellow officers (Richard Priest, Jr., Sharon Higgins, and Richard Bird) that he would work a shift for them if they would watch, stop, cite, intimidate, or harass the Rooneys. In fact, Groton police cruisers stopped in view of the Rooneys\u2019 house several times a week for periods up to one-half hour, and followed Maryann Rooney as she drove to work or walked her dog. Once an officer got out of his cruiser, followed her into her hairdresser\u2019s salon, sat down in the next chair, and requested a haircut. The Rooneys also received an anonymous, threatening letter which used obscene language, and they were subject to verbal threats from various officers. A complaint to the police chief about these incidents led to an internal investigation during which most officers did not disclose what they knew about the campaign against the Rooneys. A grand jury investigation followed. Higgins, Priest, and the defendant all testified before the grand jury in November, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The perjury charges at issue here, three counts of a single indictment, concern the defendant\u2019s false testimony in his second appearance before the grand jury in April, 1996, after Higgins and Priest had changed their testimony and disclosed Canto\u2019s offers and their own conduct. Specifically, the indictment charged that the defendant committed perjury when he testified under oath (1) that he did not ask or encourage anyone to testify falsely before the grand jury, (2) that Canto did not ask the defendant to \u201cwatch out for a motor vehicle operated by Mary Ann [sic] Rooney or Tom Rooney while performing his duties as a police officer,\u201d and (3) that Higgins did not tell him she had followed Maryann Rooney while performing her official duties. The subornation count of the same indictment concerned the defendant\u2019s conduct in encouraging Priest to lie before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his motion to sever the indictments; that the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden of providing compelling evidence of pequry; and that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for required finding. We affirm, discussing each of the defendant\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>1. <em>Denial of motion to sever. </em>\u201cA decision on \u2018whether joinder is appropriate is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 593 (1997), cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 303 (1991). There was no abuse of discretion here. The offenses at issue arose out of a course of criminal conduct, are connected together, and constitute parts of a single scheme or plan. Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(a)(1), 378 Mass. 859 (1979). Nor was the defendant prejudiced by the joinder. The four counts on which the defendant was convicted involved the same investigation and the same cover-up of police activity against the Rooneys and would have been admissible at each of the trials even if the charges had been severed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>424 Mass. 207, 210 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">2. <em>Proof of perjury. </em>The defendant claims that the Commonwealth failed to meet its special burden of introducing corroborating evidence \u201cof a direct or clear and compelling character\u201d to support his pequry convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>401 Mass. 318, 324 (1987), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 558 (1985). We disagree. We begin with the direct testimony supporting each of the indictments. Priest testified that the defendant advised him not to say anything before the grand jury in order to protect Canto. Priest also testified that he heard the defendant say Canto had made him the same offer to work a shift in exchange for annoying the Rooneys as had been made to others. Higgins testified that she told the defendant she had followed the Rooneys\u2019 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The evidence corroborating the direct evidence was compelling. Priest\u2019s testimony that the defendant encouraged him to stick to the false information they had already given in the internal investigation was supported by the defendant\u2019s activities the day before the November, 1995, grand jury testimony. The defendant testified that, upon receiving the grand jury subpoena, he made arrangements to meet with the union\u2019s general counsel. He and Canto drove to Worcester together for that meeting. As they drove back from the meeting to the defendant\u2019s car dealership, they used the defendant\u2019s cellular phone to call Priest and Higgins. Higgins testified that she spoke to both Canto and the defendant from their car phone as they drove to Worcester.. She testified that the defendant said \u201c[i]t doesn\u2019t look good for [Canto]\u201d and then put Canto on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>phone. Canto said, clearly in the defendant\u2019s hearing since they were in the car together, \u201cyou gotta . . . help me, you gotta tell them that I didn\u2019t do anything, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d (Canto had previously told Higgins to forget anything he had said to her.) Telephone records confirmed the telephone calls. Priest also testified to having talked to both men by cell phone, and the defendant admitted to having had a conversation with Priest at Riverside Motors about what to say before the grand jury. The defendant also admitted to having referred to the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Maryann Rooney\u2019s testimony about the scope of the police harassment was consistent with Priest\u2019s testimony that Canto made the same offer to the defendant he had made to other members of the department. The offer was well known in the department. Indeed, on at least one occasion, Canto made the offer in the hearing of three officers, all of whom testified. Evidence that the defendant was not only the union president but a close friend of Canto, and testified in support of Canto\u2019s dog at the hearing before the board of selectmen, supported Priest\u2019s testimony on the second count of the indictment. There is ample support for the judge\u2019s implicit determination that the defendant\u2019s testimony claiming Canto did not include him in the oft-repeated offer was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Higgins\u2019s testimony as to what she told the defendant is supported by evidence corroborating other aspects of her testimony, as set out above. The testimony of Priest and Bird that Canto made the offer in the presence of the three of them also supports her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">This evidence was sufficient \u201cclearly to turn the scale.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>401 Mass. at 325, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>2 Cush. 212, 223-224 (1848) (evidence including fact that a larceny took place, that Silva knew about the larceny, told a witness about it, and knew a civilian could identify him was \u201cample strong corroborating evidence\u201d). \u201c[Cjonvictions for peijury may be based on evidence other than direct testimony,\u201d so long as it is clear and compelling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 323. Circumstantial evidence may be clear and compelling. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>393 Mass. 204, 219 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 692-693 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 932, 935 (1991). An inference may also be compelling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>313, 317-318 (1997). The evidence in this case was sufficient to satisfy the quantitative rule as modified in accordance with the analysis in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 556-557. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>401 Mass. at 323-324.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The policy behind the rule requiring evidence of \u201ca highly rehable order,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 323, quoting from <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>204 Conn. 472, 480 (1987), is \u201cto prevent a conviction of pequry when there is no evidence other than the word of one witness against that of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 555, quoting from Perkins, Criminal Law 465 (2d ed. 1969). The quantum of proof in this case is consistent with that policy. There is much more than \u201cthe word of one witness against that of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Nor is there any merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence of pequry and subornation of pequry because Priest and Higgins were promised immunity. The defendant cites G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 201, in support of this argument. However, that statute does not apply to the facts of this case because, although the witnesses in question may have been promised that they would not be prosecuted, neither one received the formal immunity under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E, that \u00a7 201 addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Given the foregoing analysis, it is clear that there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for required finding. The judgments, therefore, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
