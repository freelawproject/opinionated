L. c. 152, \u00a7 65, must reimburse the insurer, Aetna Life and Casualty Insurance Company, for workers\u2019 compensation benefits the insurer paid to Joseph Diliberto (employee) pursuant to a lump sum agreement. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48. The answer to this question depends upon whether the employee\u2019s injury was a \u201csubsequent personal injury\u201d sustained \u201cin the course of and arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>his employment\u201d under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 71, or the result of ordinary wear and tear on an already injured back. The administrative judge, whose findings of fact and determinations of credibility we must credit, see <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243 n.7 (1993); Koziol, Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act \u00a7 7.20, at 171 (2000 ed. supplementing Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation [2d ed. 1987]), determined that the employee had sustained a reimbursable injury. The reviewing board, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(8), reversed on the ground that the administrative judge had misconstrued <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590 (1982), and therefore his findings were \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C. The insurer appealed to a single justice of this court, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2); <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 240 n.4, who in turn reported the case to a full panel. <em>Ibid. </em>We affirm the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>The administrative judge found the following facts. The employee was bom in 1927 and has a tenth grade education. He worked for his employer, New England Electric, for thirty-two years. For many years, he performed heavy physical work as a laborer, cable man, and rigger. In 1960, he injured his back while trying to lift a boulder away from a gas leak. He reinjured his back in 1967, while lifting some heavy cable. He continued to do heavy work as a rigger until 1976. In 1977 he began doing clerical work. Between 1977 and 1981, he had no back problems because the job allowed him to stand, move around, and sit as he pleased. From 1982 to 1985, the employee worked with a computer, doing billing work. He was able to perform this job despite long periods of sitting because he was allowed to have a five or ten minute break every hour to stand up and to walk around.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On January 7, 1985, the employee felt a sharp pain in his lower back while moving files at work. He was out of work and received compensation until April 23, 1985, when he returned to his clerical work with the added restriction that he not do any filing or bending. As thus further restricted, the employee was able to continue his sedentary job without undue pain until the winter of 1986. At that time, his work load increased in the face of reduced staffing and he experienced increasing pain in his back. The employee requested a chair with arm support but did not receive one. After reporting an \u201caggravated disc condition\u201d to his supervisor on April 4, 1986, the employee worked part-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>time for the first week of April. He last worked on April 7, 1986. At the time of his testimony before the administrative judge in July, 1994, he had not returned to work and was suffering daily back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The insurer and the employer settled the employee\u2019s claim for compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, by a lump sum agreement. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48. The agreement was approved in March, 1994. In view of the insurer\u2019s claim that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (trust fund) should reimburse the insurer for its lump sum payment, and the fact that the trust fund was not included in the lump sum negotiations, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, the administrative judge allowed the trust fund to litigate the issue of whether there was a subsequent injury. The reviewing board affirmed this decision and, on this appeal, the insurer does not raise the issue of the trust fund\u2019s participation in the case. Other procedural complexities associated with this case are not relevant to the issue before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The administrative judge \u201cadopt[ed] the expert medical opinion of [the employee\u2019s treating doctor] . . . that the work ... the Employee was doing for this year-long period caused his back pain to worsen to such a degree that he was no longer able to work . . . [and] that this work from April of 1985 to April of 1986 was an aggravation of the Employee\u2019s underlying degenerative disc disease.\u201d The judge also \u201cadopt[ed] the expert vocational opinion of [a vocational rehabilitation consultant who appeared for the insurer] . . . that the job . . . the Employee described . . . doing during the winter of 1986 was a unique job in the occupation of a billing clerk in that he was sitting ninety-five percent of the time in a chair with no arms and suffering from a pre-existing back condition.\u201d The administrative judge credited the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that \u201ca typical sedentary job in the open labor market would require a person to be in a sitting position forty percent of the work day.\u201d On cross-examination, the vocational expert testified that because the employee was working in a public service utility business, he did not have the freedom to walk around that, for example, a receptionist in a law firm would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>Governing legal principles. </em>The section of the workers\u2019 compensation law at issue here is G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37. It requires an insurer to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to a previously impaired employee who suffers a subsequent injury \u201cin the course of and arising out of his employment,\u201d if the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201cresults in a disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of such impairment and subsequent personal injury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In order to encourage employers to hire or continue to employ impaired workers who may be at greater risk of injury, see <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 126, 133 (1997); <em>Louis\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 136, 141-142 (1997), \u00a7 37 provides that insurers who make payments under this section \u201cshall be reimbursed [for a certain proportion of the payments made] by the state treasurer from the [workers\u2019 compensation] trust fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u201cThe determination whether an injury \u2018arose out of\u2019 and \u2018in the course of\u2019 employment is a question of fact to be decided by the [administrative judge] .... \u2018Arising out of\u2019 refers to the causal origin, . . . while \u2018in the course of\u2019 refers mainly to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury in relation to the employment.\u201d <em>Larocque\u2019s Case, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 658-659 (1991), citing <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 592, and <em>Corraro\u2019s Case, </em>380 Mass. 357, 359-361 (1980). An \u201c[i]njury \u2018arises out of\u2019 employment if it is attributable to the \u2018nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment; in other words, [to] employment looked at in any of its aspects.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 592, quoting from <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940). However, the question whether an injury arises out of and in the course of employment \u201cinvolves more than the factual problem of causation. In some cases work may be a contributing cause of injury, but only to the extent that a great many activities pursued in its place would have contributed.\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594. \u201cTo be compensable, the harm must arise from a specific incident or series of incidents at work, or from an identifiable condition that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594-595. \u201c[J]ob duties involving common movements done frequently by many humans both in and out of work will not be sufficient to establish an entitlement.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>414 Mass. 360, 366 (1993). (\u201cPersonal injury\u201d in determining eligibility for accidental disability retirement is \u201cinterpreted similarly\u201d to the same term in the workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Id. </em>at 361 n.l.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u201cThe line between . . . injury [for which reimbursement is required] and mere \u2018wear and tear\u2019 is a delicate one.\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594. See <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113, 115-116 (1951). See also <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass. 684, 688 (1985) (distinguishing cases involving gradual wear and tear). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u201c[T]he distinction is necessary to preserve the basic character of the [workers\u2019 compensation] act.\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594. \u201cThe \u2018purpose [of the act] is to treat the cost of personal injuries incidental to . . . employment as a part of the cost of business.\u2019 <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 494-495 (1916). \u2018It is not a scheme for health insurance.\u2019 <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 61 (1917).\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The authority of the reviewing board to reverse a decision of an administrative judge is limited to decisions that are \u201cbeyond the scope of [the judge\u2019s] authority, arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 31. Our review of the board\u2019s action is also limited. See <em>Scheffer's Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 (1994). With these principles in mind, we review the findings of the administrative judge and the conclusions of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Findings below. </em>The administrative judge correctly interpreted <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case </em>as \u201cstanding] for the proposition that, if [the administrative judge] find[s] that no specific event or events caused the Employee\u2019s disability but rather that it was a condition of his employment, [he] must find that this particular work condition is unique and not common and necessary to a large number of occupations. Otherwise, the Employee\u2019s disability would be the result of ordinary \u2018wear and tear.\u2019 \u201d The administrative judge then went on to find, based on the opinion of the vocational expert, that \u201cthe work condition of the Employee who is significantly handicapped, sitting in one position for extended periods of time against the advice of his doctor, doing the work of a decreasing staff, in an ergonomically inappropriate chair, and for over the period of a year, to be a unique work condition . . . go[ing] beyond the concept of the mere wear and tear that can occur in many occupations over an extended period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Having set out the proper test and then focused on findings designed to show that the employee\u2019s job was unique, we think the administrative judge implicitly found that there was neither a specific incident nor a series of incidents that caused the employee\u2019s injury. See <em>Zerofksi\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594-595. The parties appear to agree. Even the insurer focuses its appellate argument on the uniqueness of the employee\u2019s job rather than the existence of a specific incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">However, as the reviewing board correctly determined, this analysis is legally flawed. The board determined that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201c[w]hen the judge took into consideration the employee\u2019s \u2018already serious back condition,\u2019 he impermissibly wove the employee\u2019s pre-existing medical condition into the calculation of the \u2018uniqueness\u2019 of the conditions of employment. What the employee brings to the workplace activity, alleged as a compensable condition of employment, is irrelevant to the analysis of that work condition under <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case. </em>The doctrine of accepting the employee \u2018as is,\u2019 <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487 (1916), has no import in the assessment of the <em>nature </em>of the work activity that allegedly caused the injury. So too, the adopted medical opinion that the prolonged sitting aggravated the employee\u2019s back condition is wholly beside the point. ... It is the work activity <em>qua </em>\u2018identifiable condition that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations\u2019 that is the sole focus of the analysis as to the occurrence of a work injury, not its effect on the employee.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">There is no support in the case law for taking the employee\u2019s condition into account in determining whether the \u201cunusualness requirement,\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 638 n.3 (1985), has been met. See, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>414 Mass. at 361, where the court held that an elementary school teacher, who was bom with a club right foot which had been treated and who wore a brace on her left leg as a result of a bout with poliomyelitis when she was a child, did not suffer a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as a result of \u201ccontinual periods of walking and standing and frequent bending over\u201d in her duties monitoring recess. \u201cIt is not enough for [an employee] to show that his or her daily duties are unique to the job because all jobs have their own special characteristics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365. \u201c[J]ob duties involving common movements done frequently by many humans both in and out of work [are] not. . . sufficient to establish [a reimbursable injury].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. As the vocational expert acknowledged in cross-examination, there are many jobs in the work force that require extended amounts of sitting. She gave the following examples: receptionist, secretary, judge, bus driver, cab driver, truck driver, lawyer, and stenographer (in that order).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The reviewing board also rejected the administrative judge\u2019s finding, made without benefit of expert testimony, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>absence of a chair with arms caused the employee\u2019s injury. There was no error in the reviewing board\u2019s conclusion that expert testimony was necessary to support such a finding. See <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 749 (1958); <em>Casey\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 572, 574 <em>(1965).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u201cIn the circumstances of this case, and mindful of our obligation to \u2018accord deference to an administrative interpretation of a statute,\u2019 ... we affirm the decision of the reviewing board.\u201d <em>Mugford\u2019s Case, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 930 (1998). Compare <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 247 (\u201cboard\u2019s reversal of the judge\u2019s award was consistent with its authority under [former] G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, and [employee] has presented no valid reason for disturbing the board\u2019s exercise of expertise and discretion under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Given our holding in this case, we need not reach the issue of whether the insurer is entitled to interest pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, on reimbursements pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37. The decision of the reviewing board denying the insurer\u2019s claim for reimbursement under \u00a7 37 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
