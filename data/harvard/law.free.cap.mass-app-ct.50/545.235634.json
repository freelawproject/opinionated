L. c. 90, \u00a7 17 (a civil infraction), and possession of a class D controlled substance (marijuana), in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. On December 16, 1998, the defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence, claiming that \u201cthe evidence seized, to wit: marijuana, as a result of the unlawful search and seizure was obtained in violation of her [Federal and State constitutional] rights . . . .\u201d After a hearing on her motion on January 7, 1999, the court allowed the motion and filed written findings. The Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal. On February 16, 1999, the Supreme Judicial Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>interlocutory appeal and transferred the case to the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We take the facts from the judge\u2019s findings, which are sparse, and from testimony of the police officer, to \u201cfill out the narrative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>423 Mass. 517, 526 n.10 (1996). On September 24, 1998, Mark Rogers, a Massachusetts State Trooper, was patrolling north on Route 7 in Stockbridge at approximately 12:00 noon. As he approached the intersection of Ice Glen Road and Route 7, Rogers noticed a minivan in the southbound lane about to make a left turn onto Ice Glen Road. Rogers, about to drive past the minivan, saw a red Toyota \u201cpass the minivan on the right hand side in the breakdown lane.\u201d The Toyota was traveling at approximately fifty miles per hour in a thirty-five mile per hour zone. Believing this speed to be unreasonable, Rogers made a U-tum and followed the Toyota until it stopped just before the Great Barrington-Stockbridge line on Route 7.</p>\n<p id=\"A2X\">The driver, the defendant, was the sole occupant of the vehicle. The driver handed her license and registration to Rogers as he approached her window. Rogers looked through the window of the car and saw what he knew to be a \u201cbong,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the right rear passenger floor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He observed that the bong (the chamber of which was made of clear plastic) had been used: there was extensive residue in the chamber. Rogers believed, the judge found, \u201cthat the residue had to be marijuana because bongs are used primarily for smoking marijuana.\u201d The judge characterized this belief as \u201cmerely a hunch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">The judge made no findings as to the subsequent events, but they appear to be undisputed, there being no challenge to Rogers\u2019s credibility. Having seen the bong with residue in the chamber, and believing the residue to be derived from marijuana, Rogers asked the defendant to get out of her vehicle, and he conducted a frisk of her outer clothing to search for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>weapons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finding no weapons, Rogers asked the defendant whether she owned the bong, and she replied that it did belong to her. The trooper then told the defendant to sit on the guardrail, a short distance from the front of her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The trooper seized the bong from inside the defendant\u2019s vehicle, smelled the interior of the bong, and determined that the smell was \u201cconsistent with what I recognize as burnt marijuana.\u201d Rogers then searched the entire vehicle for contraband. He recovered a silver box containing approximately twenty-five to thirty seeds, which he recognized to be marijuana plant seeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The judge allowed the motion to suppress. He reasoned that Rogers\u2019s training and experience may have influenced his hunch, but that that did \u201cnot take the place of \u2018articulable facts\u2019 which could have reasonably led Trooper Rogers to conclude that the residue was marijuana.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge concluded that \u201c[bjongs are bought, sold and possessed legally every day throughout the Commonwealth; and the mere possession of a bong does not rise to probable cause that any particular possessor of a bong is also in possession of marijuana.\u201d The judge entered an order suppressing the bong and the silver-colored metal box containing marijuana seeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant argues in her brief that the seizure of the bong and the ensuing search of her vehicle were illegal because of the absence of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">It was the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to show that the trooper, in seizing the bong and the marijuana seeds, acted on probable cause. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, </em>384 Mass. 736, 743-744 (1981). \u201cIn dealing with probable cause, ... as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday fife on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 895 (1990), quoting from <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>313 (1959). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skea, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 689 (1984) (\u201cProbable cause \u2018is a flexible, common-sense standard, [which] merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u201d that certain items may be contraband . . . ; it does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The defendant, now accepting the relevance of that portion of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, which defines \u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> argues that a bong is not illegal to possess \u201cabsent some indication that it has been or is intended to be used to ingest . . . drugs into the human body.\u201d She argues that there were no such indications when the trooper seized the defendant\u2019s bong. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 1, defines the terms used in c. 94C, including the phrase \u201cdrug paraphernalia.\u201d \u201cDrug paraphernalia\u201d is defined (as appearing in St. 1998, c. 50) as including \u201call equipment, products, devices and materials of any kind which are primarily intended or designed for use in . . . inhaling . . . a controlled substance . ... <em>It includes, but is not limited </em>to: . . . (12) <em>objects used, </em>primarily intended for use or designed for use in ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing [a controlled substance] into the human body, <em>such as </em>. . . (1) bongs . . . .\u201d (Emphases supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">With the enactment of St. 1998, c. 50, approved March 12, 1998, rewriting the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, and effective three months prior to the events in this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> bongs, for the first time, were included among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>items identified as objects used or designed for use in inhaling a controlled substance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">After the reference to \u201cbongs\u201d and other identified items, \u00a7 1 continues: \u201cIn determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia, a court or other authority should consider, in addition to all other logically relevant factors, the following: . . . .\u201d Then follows a fist of eleven factors to be considered \u201c[i]n determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia\u201d; included in the list as a factor is \u201c(c) the existence of any residue of controlled substances on the object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d in c. 94C, \u00a7 1, is not without its interpretive difficulties. It is not entirely clear, for example, whether the inclusion of \u201cbongs\u201d within the list of \u201cobjects used, primarily intended for use or designed for use in . . . inhaling [a controlled substance]\u201d is alone sufficient to constitute bongs as \u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d or whether, as the defendant argues, the Commonwealth must also, in order to show that the object constitutes \u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d establish that the object is \u201cprimarily intended or designed for use in . . . inhaling or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance,\u201d as set out in the first sentence of the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The facts of the case before us resolve this difficulty. Here, the trooper saw a bong with residue in the chamber, and he reasonably believed that the residue was probably derived from marijuana.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These facts must be considered in the context of additional provisions appearing in \u00a7 1. Section 1 defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cprimarily intended for use\u201d as \u201cthe likely use which may be ascribed to an item by a reasonable person\u201d and provides that, \u201c[f]or purposes of this definition, the phrase \u2018designed for use\u2019 shall mean the use a reasonable person would ascribe to an item based on the design and features of said item.\u201d Further, the definition of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d in \u00a7 1 provides that a court, in determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia, should consider \u201cthe existence of any residue of [a] controlled substance[] on the object. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The facts in the present case, in the context of the relevant statutory provisions, present a configuration that falls within prohibited territory: the sight, in plain view,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of a bong with residue in the chamber indicating prior use, and which the trooper reasonably believed, based on his training and experience, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>was marijuana residue. Rogers then had probable cause to connect the bong with criminal activity, i.e., knowing possession of a controlled substance. That connection to criminal activity was sufficient to justify Rogers\u2019s seizure of the bong. On the facts presented the seizure of the defendant\u2019s bong \u201cinvolves no invasion of privacy and <em>is presumptively reasonable, assuming that there is probable cause to associate the property with criminal activity </em>(emphasis original).\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skea, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 689 (1984), quoting from <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 741-742 (1983). See also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, </em>384 Mass. at 743 (\u201cOf course, for any warrantless seizure to meet Fourth Amendment standards there must be probable cause to believe that the item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>seized is connected with criminal activity\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wojcik, </em>358 Mass. 623, 628-631 (1971) (where articles seized were not contraband [\u201carticles which it is unlawful for one to have ih his possession\u201d], the seizure of articles not described in the warrant would have been legal only if police officers knew or had probable cause to believe the articles had been stolen and the defendant knew them to be stolen).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Once the trooper seized the bong, he smelled the residue and confirmed his belief that the residue was derived from marijuana. He then had probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201cfor the presence of other controlled substances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 688. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Agosto, </em>428 Mass. 31, 34 (1998) (\u201cWhen there is probable cause to search an automobile stopped on a highway, an immediate search is constitutionally permissible\u201d). There was no basis to suppress the marijuana seeds found in the defendant\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In sum, the sight of the bong with residue in the chamber \u2014 which Rogers reasonably believed was derived from marijuana \u2014 provided the trooper with probable cause to seize the bong. After the trooper smelled the residue and determined that it smelled like burnt marijuana, he had probable cause to search the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We express no opinion as to whether the mere sight of a bong is sufficient for the item to be seized.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Possession of a bong, and no more, is not a crime in Massachusetts. But see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 321: possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to sell, knowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know, that it will be used to introduce a controlled substance into the human body, is a crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, </em>396 Mass. 653 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The order allowing the motion to suppress is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">General Laws \u00a7 94C, \u00a7 1, provides in part (emphases supplied):</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u201cDrug paraphernalia\u201d, all equipment, products, devices and materials of any kind which are <em>primarily intended or designed for use </em>in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repackaging, storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance in violation of this chapter.
