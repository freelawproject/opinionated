Between 1987 and 1990, the developer sold the homes to the original appellants herein. In August, 1993, all of those appellants found in their mailboxes a property owner\u2019s worst nightmare: a letter from the appellees\u2019 lawyer asserting that the locus had belonged to the appellees and not to the developer, so that the lots and houses thereon were located on land not owned by the present occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">A number of those homeowners immediately launched an action against the appellees in the Land Court in two counts, to quiet title and for declaratory relief. They alleged, as to both counts, that the appellees had no title to any portion of the locus, because the plaintiff homeowners enjoyed title by virtue of adverse possession, in that their predecessors in title had entered upon the locus under color of title and had thereafter openly, notoriously, continuously, and adversely possessed it for over twenty years. The appellees responded with wholesale denial of these allegations and a counterclaim seeking to establish their own title, to enjoin the homeowners\u2019 continuing trespass, to compel them to remove their houses and improvements, and to recover damages for the appellees\u2019 prolonged disseisin. Simultaneously, the appellees filed their own action in the Land Court against the remaining homeowners on the locus who were not involved in the earlier action, seeking the same relief that they demanded in their original counterclaim. The remaining homeowner defendants countered with an adverse possession counterclaim of their own that was identical to the claim asserted by their neighbors in the first action. The two actions were consolidated on the appellees\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\"><em>The summary judgment proceedings. </em>Following depositions of several parties and title experts on both sides of the controversy and armed with an opinion of a title examiner-attorney, the consolidated homeowners moved for summary judgment in both actions. In their written and oral presentations to the judge, they refined their claim by asserting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>relevant deeds, affidavits, and deposition testimony established that their predecessors in title had actually occupied \u201ca substantial [but undefined] portion\u201d of the locus sufficiently adversely for over twenty years so as to give them title thereto; and that, by virtue of the doctrine of \u201cadverse possession under color of title,\u201d they were entitled to add to that actual adverse possession any remaining areas of the locus described in their deeds, so that their title \u201cextends to the entire subdivision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In making these arguments, the homeowners contended that the actual locations of the properties claimed by them and by the appellees and the precise area actually possessed adversely by their predecessors were irrelevant and did not need to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The appellees filed a cross motion for summary judgment in opposition to the homeowners\u2019 motion (though not as to the appellees\u2019 counterclaim in the initial action or their complaint). The appellees\u2019 contentions \u2014 derived from their examination of the various claims of title and deed descriptions contained therein \u2014 were that the homeowners\u2019 deed descriptions did not even include all of the land in the subdivision, so that the doctrine of color of title could not extend to such areas; and that, in any event, the homeowners\u2019 color of title claim arose only from a 1987 deed, so they could not satisfy the twenty-year statutory requirement for adverse possession. The appellees\u2019 arguments emphasized the impossibility, on the basis of the homeowners\u2019 deeds and purported expert opinion, of accurately ascertaining a description or the boundaries of the area to which they laid claim. Because the homeowners had failed to satisfy their burden of establishing good title to the entirety of their lots within the subdivision, the appellees demanded dismissal of the homeowners\u2019 complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The judge viewed the parties\u2019 summary judgment arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>as addressed to the homeowners\u2019 color of title \u201cclaim\u201d only, stating that the facts material to that claim were not in dispute \u2014 notwithstanding the parties\u2019 mutual acknowledgment that the actual location and boundaries of the disputed areas were uncertain and yet to be determined.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge concluded that the homeowners could not prevail on their claim of adverse possession under color of title because, while no actual boundaries had been established, all of the deeds in the homeowners\u2019 chains of title consistently referred to the appellees\u2019 lot, wherever it existed on the ground, as the northerly abutter and never incorporated it (whether correctly or erroneously) into that claim of title. In denying the homeowners\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their color of title \u201cclaim\u201d and granting partial summary judgment to the appellees on that \u201cclaim\u201d \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d the judge observed that all parties still had to establish the actual locations of and their title to their respective claimed properties at trial \u201cby registry records, surveying materials and evidence of [the fact and extent of] actual adverse possession\u201d by the homeowners\u2019 predecessors in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>The rule 54(b) certification. </em>Following the denial of their summary judgment motion, the homeowners filed a motion for entry of a separate judgment on their claim of adverse possession under color of title, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and for a stay of all proceedings in the consolidated cases pending resolution of their intended immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ate appeal of that issue. The judge allowed the rule 54(b) motion and entered a misnamed \u201cPartial Judgment for Homeowners\u201d on \u201cthe claim of adverse possession under color of title only\u201d in the homeowners\u2019 original action. She refused to stay the remainder of the case (i.e., the counterclaims in that original action and all of the competing claims in the appellees\u2019 action). In her accompanying findings, the judge recognized that there remained \u201ca number of complex issues for trial,\u201d including the actual locations on the ground of the lots claimed by the respective parties, the extent of adverse possession by the homeowners\u2019 predecessors in title, if any, and the resolution of the appellees\u2019 trespass claims and demand for injunctive relief compelling removal of the homeowners\u2019 houses and improvements. The judge stated that \u201c[s]ome, but not all of these issues, may become moot depending upon the Appeals Court\u2019s disposition\u201d of the color of title appeal that the homeowners sought to press by virtue of her 54(b) certification. The record does not reveal, however, what were the issues that might \u201cbecome moot\u201d by an Appeals Court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The judge additionally concluded that \u201ca stay is not appropriate, as many of the issues set forth [above] will require resolution regardless of the outcome of the Appeals Court\u2019s review of the [color of title] Order. Of necessity, preparation for the trial of the remaining title and survey issues [including further discovery] will take a great deal of time, effort and expense for all parties. In the meantime, the Homeowners are left with anxious uncertainty as to the title to their homes, and they are unable to sell or mortgage them. The entry of partial judgment on the Homeowners\u2019 color of title claim will permit the parties to prepare for the trial of the remaining issues in this case simultaneously with the review of the [color of title] Order, thereby expediting the ultimate resolution of this case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>closure for all parties as quickly as possible.\u201d Again, the judge did not specify which issues might be resolved and eliminated from discovery or trial by an Appeals Court ruling on the intended appeal. Nonetheless, the judge felt able to \u201cexpressly find that there is no just reason for delay,\u201d as rule 54(b) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The homeowners soon thereafter filed this appeal from the partial judgment entered by the judge, although (as previously noted at note 1, <em>supra), </em>by the time the matter was presented for argument before us, all of the homeowners but the Rices had dismissed their appeals with prejudice, indicating thereby less ongoing \u201canxious uncertainty\u201d about their titles and the marketability of their homes than the judge had hypothesized.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><em>Holding. </em>The parties have devoted their appellate arguments to lengthy recitations of various chains of title and deed descriptions and to whether or not the judge erred in applying the doctrine of \u201cadverse possession under color of title\u201d to the facts of this case as presented in the summary judgment papers. We do not reach the merits of the appeal, however, because we deem the rule 54(b) certification to have been both legally and factually inappropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\"><em>Discussion. A. Standards of review and policy considerations. </em>As its language reveals (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>a valid rule 54(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>certification requires the confluence of four factors: (1) the action must involve multiple claims or multiple parties; (2) there must be a final adjudication as to at least one, but fewer than all, of the claims or parties;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (3) there must be an express finding that there is no just reason for delaying the appeal until the remainder of the case is resolved; and (4) there must be an express direction of the entry of judgment. See Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 54.4, at 307 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Whether there are multiple claims in an action and whether those claims have been finally adjudicated are matters of law subject to plenary review by an appellate court. See <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>843 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir. 1988); <em>H &amp; W Indus. </em>v. <em>Formosa Plastics Corp., </em>860 F.2d 172, 175 (5th Cir. 1988); <em>Indiana Harbor Belt R.R.

The determination of the presence or absence of a just reason for delay, on the other hand, is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and is subject to reversal only for an abuse of that discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>J.B.L.

It is a \u201cgeneral rule of practice so early announced, so frequently reiterated and so constantly followed, and so manifestly in the interests of parties litigant and the general public\u201d that failure of litigants to observe it \u201ccan serve no purpose but to contribute to the loss of confidence in the courts as the avenue for adjudication of private dispute with reasonable dispatch.\u201d <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>372 Mass. 469, 470-471, 472 (1977), quoting from <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Boston Elev.

Consequently, certifications under rule 54(b) \u201cshould not be granted routinely or as a courtesy or accommodation to counsel.\u201d <em>Panichella </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R.R.

Therefore, the court\u2019s rule 54(b) discretion should be \u201cexercised sparingly,\u201d <em>Harriscom Svenska AB </em>v. <em>Harris Corp., </em>947 F.2d at 629; and, when the dismissed and the surviving claims are factually and legally overlapping or closely related, such a fragmentation of the case is to be avoided except in \u201cunusual and compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>843 F.2d at 45; <em>Kersey </em>v. <em>Dennison Mfg.

It is notorious that the caseload of this court has increased so dramatically, and the court is so overburdened with an ever-growing volume of appeals to be decided, that \u201c[t]he appellate administration of justice in the Commonwealth faces a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>crisis requiring immediate action.\u201d Appellate Administration of Justice \u2014 A Crisis in Massachusetts, Report of the Boston Bar Association Task Force Committee on Massachusetts Appeals Court Judicial Positions 4 (May 3, 2000). \u201cRule 54(b) liberally construed and applied has a tremendous potential to increase our caseload still more rapidly, because its natural tendency is to generate multiple appeals in the same case.\u201d <em>Minority Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>South Bend, </em>721 F.2d 197, 200 (7th Cir. 1983).

Conversely, when a party asserts only one legal right, even if seeking multiple remedies, there is only a single claim for relief for rule 54(b) purposes. See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins.

In a case where the issue adjudicated amounts to nothing more than a determination of one of several legal theories on which the same legal right is premised, the judge should not certify the ruling for immediate appeal. <em>Leopold </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>421 F.2d 838, 839 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Finally, there is only a single claim for relief, making a separate appeal under rule 54(b) inappropriate, in a case where the facts underlying the adjudicated portion of the case are largely the same as or substantially overlap those forming the basis for the unadjudicated issues. <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>843 F.2d at 45 (54[b] appeal not appropriate where there is \u201csubstantial . . . imbrication between the dismissed count[] and the surviving count ... [or t]he factual underpinnings of the adjudicated and nonadjudicated counts are . . . inextricably intertwined\u201d). Though claims may be distinct even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>if they have some factual overlap, <em>Minority Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>South Bend, </em>721 F.2d at 200, \u201cclaims are not separate for Rule 54(b) purposes if the facts they depend on are largely the same .... The burdens of multiple appeals are greatest in a case where the successive appeals bring up the same facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The ruling on appeal in this case addressed only that aspect of the homeowners\u2019 adverse possession claim which purported to rest on the doctrine of color of title. The color of title issue clearly does not constitute an entire \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of rule 54(b), but is rather merely an alternative theory of recovery not properly encompassed by the rule. The sole legal right the homeowners seek to vindicate, and the only real \u201cclaim\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> they assert in their complaint, is that of title to the tracts they respectively occupy in the locus; and the only result they seek is retention of their possessory right to the parcels on which their homes have been built. The two methods by which the homeowners seek to prove their good title, namely actual adverse possession and adverse possession by color of title, can be accurately described as \u201cmerely . . . alternate grounds for relief, each of which arose out of the same aggregate of operative facts,\u201d in that they both \u201cstem from essentially the same factual averments ... in a situation involving the same parties and, basically, the same facts.\u201d <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>843 F.2d at 44 n.6, 45. The same \u201cfactual underpinnings of the adjudicated . . . count[],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 45 \u2014 namely, the precise locations and boundaries of the various lots involved under the many deeds in the several chains of title and the actual activities that took place thereon claimed to constitute successful adverse possession \u2014 are also critical to the unadjudicated counts, i.e., the remainder of the case that continues and must be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The ruling below correctly recognized that both the homeowners\u2019 rejected \u201cadverse possession under color of title\u201d claim and their conventional adverse possession claim depended on the same proof required for satisfaction of all of the elements of adverse possession as to the central portion of the real estate they assert title to (i.e., the portion their title predecessors had actually occupied openly, notoriously, continuously and adversely for at least twenty years). Consequently, whether we were to affirm or reverse the partial summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the \u201ccolor of title\u201d issue, the homeowners\u2019 evidentiary burden at trial in establishing their title by virtue of adverse possession will not be reduced in any material way. They will still have to establish the locations and boundaries of the various areas in dispute at trial by registry records, surveying materials, and the like and produce historical evidence of the fact and extent of actual adverse possession with respect to the contested subdivision, just as they would have to do to prevail on the \u201ccolor of title\u201d theory (see <em>supra </em>at 381-385). The only significant difference <em>might </em>be in outcome, as to the extent of the relief to which they prove themselves entitled (i.e., the dimensions of the areas they prove to have been adversely possessed and any additional areas that they might be able to show were covered by their deeds under the \u201ccolor of title\u201d doctrine). In short, certification was inappropriate because \u201cthe same essential facts underlie all of the [homeowners\u2019] claims . . . [and consequently] our resolution of the [legal] issues being appealed, however fascinating or important they may be, \u2018will not simplify, shorten or expedite the trial of any of the other claims still pending in the [trial] court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>Sturbridge Camping Club, Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 173, 178-179 (1992), quoting from <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lincoln Homes Corp., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We conclude as matter of law that the partial judgment entered below did not finally adjudicate a separate claim but merely eliminated one of the homeowners\u2019 theories of relief with respect to the unitary claim they advance, legal title to their respective properties. Even though deciding the question formally presented, regarding the contours of the doctrine of adverse possession under color of title, might be of marginal utility in view of the relatively limited number of such cases in this Commonwealth, it will ill-serve the more fundamental interests of sound judicial administration and the proper alloca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tian of scarce judicial resources, because essentially the same facts as underlie that legal issue will in all likelihood come before us again in an appeal by either or all of the parties after the final resolution of the entire case in the trial court. As the Second Circuit has aptly opined, \u201cWe cannot decide the issues intelligently piecemeal and, if we so attempt, are sure to find ourselves uttering pious generalities only which will come back to plague us later.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Farm, Inc., </em>403 F.2d at 942-943, quoting from <em>Cott Bev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., </em>245 F.2d at 796. See <em>Minority Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>South Bend, </em>721 F.2d at 201 (because the factual bases for the adjudicated and the nonadjudicated claims are \u201clargely the same,\u201d even if the court ruled on the legal issues presented by the certified appeal, \u201cwe would have to relearn the same set of facts if and when the case came back to us on appeal from the [trial] judge\u2019s final judgment on the [pending] claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">C. <em>Was there \u201cno just reason for delay?\u201d </em>Though the lack of a final judgment on a truly separate claim is itself sufficient ground to dismiss this appeal, dismissal is also appropriate because the certification was not supported by the requisite analysis and by a sufficient basis for the conclusion that no just reason for delay existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The determination of the presence or absence of a just reason for delay requires that \u201cthe facts of each case be closely examined to ensure that allowing an appeal will not wrongly fragment the case. ... A court should also examine whether [certification] will advance the interests of judicial administration and public policy.\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>v. <em>Fore River Ry. Co., </em>861 F.2d at 325. See <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Herriott, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 322 (certification is proper \u201conly where, after balancing the competing factors, the judge in the trial court can say with assurance based on facts in the record that finality of judgment should be ordered to advance the interests of sound judicial administration . . . , and to prevent the \u2018danger of hardship or injustice\u2019 posed by delay\u201d); <em>AllisChalmers Corp. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>521 F.2d at 364 (listing the several factors to be evaluated by appellate courts in considering the propriety of such a determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The certification at issue did not emerge from an identification or balancing of the factors that must inform a discretionary determination as to the existence, vel non, of a just reason for delay; and, to the extent it alluded to potentially relevant fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tors, either they were not tied to the rule 54(b) analysis or the findings thereon were unsupported by the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">i. <em>Consistency with public policy. </em>The prime factor of facilitating appropriate judicial administration, by avoiding premature and piecemeal appeals, is not mentioned in the certification analysis, despite the mandate to balance the need for the extraordinary relief of immediate review with that historic policy. Failure to account for so vital a consideration cannot be deemed consistent with the \u201cstrict compliance\u201d expected by the Supreme Judicial Court in applying rule 54(b). <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>397 Mass. at 813 n.3. Acknowledgment of a measured concern for judicial economy was almost irresistibly demanded on this record, given the commonality of the issues presented by all of the claims and counterclaims, as well as the recognition in the certification decision of the many complex issues remaining to be decided outside of the certification, including the- entirety of the homeowners\u2019 proof of adverse possession. That scenario virtually guarantees our obligation to consider the same bundle of facts a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">ii. <em>Nature of the case. </em>The record does not establish that this case presents any of the \u201cunusual and compelling circumstances,\u201d <em>Morrison-Knudsen Co. </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>655 F.2d at 966, or constitutes \u201cthe infrequent harsh case,\u201d <em>Brunswick Corp. </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>582 F.2d at 183, or involves the \u201cdanger of hardship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>or injustice,\u201d <em>Acme Engr. &amp; Mfg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Airadyne Co., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 764, quoting from <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Farm, Inc., </em>403 F.2d at 942, or any other extraordinary feature that should exist to justify recourse to the exceptional procedure authorized by rule 54(b). To the contrary, the case appears to be a garden-variety dispute by rival private claimants over title to a piece of land, of the sort that has been a characteristic feature of American (and earlier English) society since the common law of real estate began to be established centuries ago.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Although reference was made in the certification ruling to the \u201cHomeowners [\u2019] . . . anxious uncertainty as to the title to their homes,\u201d the reference was not directed to the appropriateness of invoking rule 54(b) because of the danger of special hardship or injustice or harsh outcomes for the homeowners from any delay in appealing. Rather, the remark was made in connection with a denial of the homeowners\u2019 motion for a stay of all proceedings while they prosecuted a rule 54(b) appeal; a stay was expressly declared to be inappropriate because of the \u201cgreat deal of time, effort and expense for all parties\u201d in developing and preparing the noncertified issues for trial. Even if the observation had been aimed at this critical rule 54(b) factor, however, it fell far from the mark, since the homeowners\u2019 \u201canxious uncertainty\u201d as to their title could only be relieved by their success in proving their basic adverse possession case, which remained the subject of discovery and trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">iii. <em>Mootness. </em>Among the most significant factors to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>considered in deciding if there is no just reason for delaying the appeal \u2014 closely related to the concern for appellate judicial economy \u2014 is \u201cthe possibility that the need for [rule 54(b)] review might ... be mooted by future developments in the [trial] court.\u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>521 F.2d at 364. \u201c[S]uch a possibility [i]s a major negative in the Rule 54(b) equation,\u201d <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>843 F.2d at 45, and \u201cmust weigh heavily against Rule 54[b] certification.\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>v. <em>Fore River Ry. Co., </em>861 F2d at 326. See <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lincoln Homes Corp., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The possibility of mootness is additionally present when a plaintiff appeals the dismissal of some of his \u201cclaims\u201d while others are still pending upon which he yet may be successful and which may gain him the entire remedy he seeks, thereby obviating his need to appeal altogether. See <em>Brunswick Corp. </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>582 F.2d at 184-185; <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>843 F.2d at 44-45; <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>v. <em>Fore River Ry. Co., </em>861 F.2d at 326. The fact that resolution of the pending claim might well have such an effect militates against a rule 54(b) certification. <em>Shrader </em>v. <em>Granninger, </em>870 F.2d 874, 879 (2d Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Both prospects of mootness exist here. The homeowners\u2019 goal is an adjudication of their good title to their respective lots in the subdivision. If they prevail on their pending adverse possession claim, they may well establish such title and retain their land \u2014 quite possibly all or a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d thereof, depending on the nature and extent of their proof \u2014 and thus may never need to appeal the color of title ruling at all.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although a successful adverse possessor might be able to establish entitlement to more extensive title than that which proof of actual adverse possession would provide were he- to succeed as well on a color of title theory, see, e.g., <em>Norton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>West, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 351 (1979), such a highly contingent outcome cannot justify multiple appeals, particularly when the homeowners\u2019 burden of proving all of the elements of adverse possession remains for trial regardless of this appeal. The obverse mootness possibility is equally destructive of certifiability: the homeowners\u2019 failure to satisfy their trial burden as to proof of adverse possession will moot their color of title theory and save this court the toil of hearing successive appeals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lincoln Homes Corp., </em>9 Mass.

App. Ct. at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The findings that accompanied the entry of partial judgment here did not constitute the clear articulation of the reasons and factors that are predicates for entry of a certifiable judgment under rule 54(b). We discern no balancing of the competing purposes underlying rule 54(b), or evaluation of the interrelationship between the legal and factual issues raised by the dismissed and the pending claims, or identification and weighing of the relevant \u201cequities\u201d for and against an immediate appeal. The two factors that were mentioned did not give support to the conclusion that the partial judgment was properly certifiable (see <em>supra </em>at 383-385, 396, 397-398, notes 14-15) and were inconsistent with the explicit perceptions that the central issue in the consolidated case was the conflicting claims to ownership of the locus; that all of the proof required to establish the homeowners\u2019 sole legal contention \u2014 title by adverse possession \u2014 as well as the appellees\u2019 basis for asserting their title over the locus remained to be developed; and that the rival claims and counterclaims, both partially adjudicated and pending, were so intertwined as to be \u201cmirror images of one another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>A rule 54(b) certification must be the product of independent, comprehensive and detailed analysis of the relevant factors established in the case law. Trial judges fulfill their function as the requisite discerning \u201cdispatcher\u201d in such situations only by exercising discretion unambiguously \u201cin the interest of sound judicial administration,\u201d <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Mackey, </em>351 U.S. at 435, 437, by preventing relaxation of \u201cthe rigorous standards that ought to be associated with Rule 54(b) certifications,\u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Cadle Co., </em>101 F.3d at 1449 n.3, and by insuring that the rule continues to be \u201cused sparingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1449.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We see \u201c[n]othing in the papers before us suggesting] a pressing, exceptional need for immediate appellate intervention, or grave injustice of the sort remediable only by allowing an appeal to be taken forthwith, or dire hardship of a unique kind.\u201d <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>843 F.2d at 45-46. The parties, who have presumably proceeded with discovery and trial preparation on the extensive remainder of the case, will have their full day in the Land Court on all relevant issues and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>be able to pursue a proper appeal thereon to this court, if necessary, following a decision finally disposing of all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The appeal is dismissed. The certification and entry, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), of the partial judgment for the appellees on the color of title issue are, accordingly, vacated; the order on summary judgment is restored to its interlocutory status under the second sentence of rule 54(b); and the case is remanded to the Land Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">As stated by the judge (in a formulation not contested by either side), \u201cIn order to establish a right to land under color of title, the claimant must: (1) satisfy the elements of adverse possession; and (2) prove that the claim of ownership is based on a muniment [i.e., a document or writing] of title. The land possessed will be adjudged coextensive with the land described by the deed if these requirements are met. <em>Bellis </em>v. <em>Bellis, </em>122 Mass. 414, 417 (1877). Thus \u2018[t]he advantage which a person may gain from [the doctrine of color of title] is that the activities relied upon to establish adverse possession reach not only the part of the premises actually occupied, but the entire premises described in a deed to the claimant.\u2019 <em>Norton </em>v. <em>West, </em>[8 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 351 (1979)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Indeed, the judge noted that the appellees\u2019 demand for judgment on the entire complaint could not be allowed because they had \u201cnot established with certainty the location of [the lot they claimed title to] in relation to the subdivision. There are no instrument surveys before the court.... The court cannot establish boundaries based on the various deed descriptions without additional survey evidence relating to both of these parcels and abutting parcels. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Rule 54(b) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d The determination and direction described in the rule is commonly referred to as rule 54(b) \u201ccertification,\u201d <em>She Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>License Commn. of </em>Worcester, 10 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 698 n.1 (1980). In the absence of such a determination and direction, no appeal can be taken from a trial court\u2019s partial \u201cjudgment\u201d on a claim prior to entry of a final judgment disposing of all claims against all parties to the action. <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Bradford O. Emerson, Inc., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 422-423 (1985). Rule 54(b) \u201cwas adopted because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the potential scope and complexity of civil actions under the federal rules, given their extensive provisions for the liberal joinder of claims and parties. The basic purpose of Rule 54(b) is to avoid the possible injustice of a delay in entering judgment on a distinctly separate claim or as to fewer than all the parties until the final adjudication of the entire case by making an immediate appeal available.\u201d 10 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2654, at 33 (1998). \u201cRule 54(b) thus attempts to balance conflicting policies: (1) the avoidance of time-wasting, expensive piecemeal appellate treatment; (2) the need for prompt appellate review to avoid delay and resulting injustice.\u201d Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 54.4, at 307 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2000). See <em>infra </em>at 385-389.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The appellees did not protest the rule 54(b) certification below or on appeal, and neither side has briefed the issue. However, because our ability to review the merits of this appeal depends on whether the partial summary judgment, normally a non-appealable interlocutory order (see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 113, 109; <em>Acme Engr. &amp; Mfg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Airadyne Co., 9 </em>Mass.

See <em>Paris </em>v. <em>Snappy Car Rental, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 968, 969 (1984); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>19 Mass.

We note that Federal decisions are sources of precedent with respect to issues under our rule 54(b) because that rule \u201cwas taken verbatim from Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b),\u201d <em>J.B.L. Constr.

The judge\u2019s order on summary judgment did not explicitly or implicitly dismiss any of the parties, all of whom continue to struggle with the claims and counterclaims not covered by the partial judgment. Rather, \u201c[t]he issue here is whether the [trial] court\u2019s order is a final judgment as to a single <em>claim </em>in a multiclaim action\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Ibid. </em>We refer to the multiple-party language in the cited passage only for completeness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Although the conventional label justifying appellate reversal of an inappropriate trial court determination that no just reason for delay existed is that the court committed an \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d in the instant situation that term is inapt as well as unfortunate. As Judge Henry J. Friendly has observed, \u201cThere are a half dozen differing definitions of \u2018abuse of discretion,\u2019 ranging from ones that would require the appellate court to come close to finding that the trial court had taken leave of its senses [see, e.g., <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>235 Mass. 482, 502 (1920) (abuse of discretion by judge means \u201cno conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by him\u201d)] to others which differ from the definition of [legal] error by only the slightest nuance, with numerous variations between the extremes.\u201d Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L.J. 747, 763 (1982). Without essaying a complex analysis of the various types and levels of trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>court discretion encountered by appellate tribunals, it is sufficient for present purposes to quote Chief Justice John Marshall, who stated that most discretionary choices are not left to a trial court\u2019s unbridled \u201cinclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>25 F.

Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>423 Mass. 506, 510 (1996) (\u201cVirtually all the decisions that a trial judge must make, even when the judge has discretion as to the precise result, are decisions of law\u201d). As the discussion, <em>infra </em>at 394-402, demonstrates, in the rule 54(b) context, abuse of discretion has no derogatory or invidious connotation and does not imply that the judge below committed any egregious mistake \u2014 indeed, it is clear from the record that the judge addressed the issues conscientiously \u2014 but rather it signifies only that the decisionmaking process was not completely conducted within the established framework of relevant standards and did not take into account all the proper factors identified by relevant case law as necessary to inform the discretionary exercise.
