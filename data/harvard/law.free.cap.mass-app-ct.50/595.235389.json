In 1960, the plaintiffs built a house and a garage on the farm. Over the next twenty years, they added a bam and paddocks, expanding the use of the farm to include breeding and showing horses, giving riding lessons, and other equestrian endeavors. In 1986, the plaintiffs applied to the Andover zoning board of appeals for a variance to erect an enclosed riding structure on the northwest comer of the lot. Several neighbors, including the defendants, Joseph and Roberta Matto and John and Bonnie Gardner, objected to the nonconforming commercial nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 operations at the farm (in a residential zone) and the expansion of them by the proposed indoor arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">It is not necessary to chronicle in detail the history of adversary proceedings which followed. Suffice it to say, over the next eight years, the defendants apprehended a wide variety of environmental and nuisance violations at Ironstone Farm, and brought each one to the attention of various public agencies, e.g., the Andover zoning board, board of health, police department, conservation commission, fire department, town treasurer, building inspector, and the State Department of Environmental Protection. Several of these initiatives resulted in favorable rulings but most were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In September, 1989, the Gardners hired a helicopter to fly over the farm and take photographs of the farm site to bolster their claims. In December of that year, John Gardner stood at the border between his property and the plaintiffs\u2019 property and uttered several angry epithets in the presence of the plaintiffs\u2019 son. A similar incident occurred on April 1, 1990, in front of some of the plaintiffs\u2019 clients. During the period between 1990 and 1994, there were numerous additional incidents between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Finally, on December 8, 1994, the plaintiffs brought the action which led to this appeal. In six counts alleging abuse of process, invasion of privacy, civil conspiracy, intentional interference with advantageous business relations, civil rights violations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiffs complain that the defendants\u2019 resort to various governmental agencies, the fly-over, and the name-calling constitute tortious harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In due course the parties completed discovery, and on December 26, 1997, three years after the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed, the Mattos filed a special motion to dismiss under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, which was allowed by a Superior Court judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">1. Under the so-called \u201canti-SLAPP statute,\u201d the applicable portion of which is set out in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendants claim that their complaints to various regulatory agencies expressing opposition to the plaintiffs\u2019 expansion of their riding facility are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>protected \u201cpetitioning activity,\u201d and that any claim by the plaintiffs based on that opposition is barred. In contrast, the plaintiffs say that aspects of the defendants\u2019 purported petitioning activities were not that in fact (such as the helicopter flyover, angry epithets, and agreement by the Gardners with their neighbors to fund the battle) and that the concededly petitioning activities nonetheless amounted to nothing more than a sham or pretense, intended to thwart permitted uses of their property. They say that the defendants\u2019 various claims to State and local authorities were motivated by personal animosity, and that such activity is not absolutely privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Massachusetts is one of fifteen States that have enacted antiSLAPP legislation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 165 (1998), the court decided that to gain the prophylactic effect of the statute, the special movant must make a threshold showing through the pleadings and affidavits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the asserted claims against it are \u201cbased on the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167-168. Once that showing appears, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show that the special movant\u2019s petitioning activity is \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Here, the defendants made an adequate initial showing that the claims against them were based on their petitioning activities alone, or at least had no substantial basis other than those activities. While various regulatory agencies and the courts rejected most of their objections, their petitioning activity raised timely concerns with the proper authorities, including die zoning board, and the conservation commission concerning the environmental impact of the plaintiffs\u2019 expansion of the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">After this threshold showing, the burden shifted to the plaintiffs to show that \u201c(1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and (2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The plaintiffs failed to make the requisite showing as to either prong.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Aside from repeated assertions that the defendants were out to \u201cget\u201d them, the plaintiffs make no attempt to explain how the defendants\u2019 actions were devoid of factual support or legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>basis. They concede that the report to the fire department was prompted by a fire burning on their land, that the health board had been called about the mounds of manure they kept near one defendant\u2019s property line, and that they were performing operatians in a protected wetland just as the defendants reported to the conservation commission. The fact that the incidents were resolved in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor (the fire was declared an acceptable controlled bum, the manure piles permissibly located, and the work in a wetland valid under an agricultural exemption to the Wetlands Protection Act) does not mean that there was no colorable basis for their petitions. See <em>Home Sav. Bank of America, FSB </em>v. <em>Camillo, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 912 (1998) (although party \u201cmay turn out to be wrong in the end,\u201d her position is not, therefore, frivolous).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This case differs from <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 414 (2000), where the nonmovant satisfied the burden of showing her neighbors\u2019 suit devoid of any reasonable factual or legal support by submitting \u201caffidavits and documents showing that she had obtained all of the necessary permits . . . <em>before </em>[emphasis ours] the neighbors commenced the declaratory judgment action,\u201d and that \u201cthe neighbors could not have obtained meaningful declaratory relief against her in any event since their suit failed to include a necessary party: the board, which issued the ... permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKZ\">In the instant case, no verified affidavits appear to establish a basis for labeling the defendants\u2019 activities a \u201csham.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Throughout the lengthy hearings before various commissions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>boards, and courts, the defendants pursued timely administrative remedies that were available in cases of this sort. In his depositian testimony, the plaintiff, Richard Donovan, took the position that the defendants\u2019 appearances at public meetings constitute an \u201cassault on his character and that the surveillance of the farm was a form of intimidation.\u201d From what appears in the materials before us, the defendants\u2019 appearances before the varipus administrative agencies indicate that they were acting to protect their legitimate private interests. That they were unsuccessful does not, in and of itself, mean that their opposition did not have some basis in law or foundation in fact. We are handicapped \u2014 and, so far as appears from the record appendix, so was the motion judge \u2014 by not having been furnished with the various findings of the administrative agencies that considered the defendants\u2019 complaints, but that is a deficiency which cuts against the plaintiffs. As we have observed, once the defendants\u2019 materials in support of the \u00a7 59H special motion disclosed legitimate petitioning activity, it was the task of the plaintiffs to contradict the configuration so formed. There was no abuse of discretion or error of law in the judge\u2019s decision to grant the defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"At3\">2. The judge below awarded the defendants, as prevailing special movants, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs as required by \u00a7 59H. He awarded the Gardners $6,723.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $181.00 in costs, and the Mattos $7,300.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $2,270.78 in costs. These amounts were significantly less than what both sets of defendants had sought and documented in their postjudgment motions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although a plain reading of the statute entitles a prevailing moving party to an award for all reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, <em>\u201cincluding </em>those incurred for the special motion and any related discovery matters,\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (emphasis added), in this case the judge was within his discretion to limit the award to only those fees and costs reasonably related to the special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">Since the statute contemplates that a special motion to dismiss will be made within sixty days of the service of the complaint, and that once made, all discovery will be stayed until the motian is decided, this case is problematic. Over three years passed before the special motion was filed. Significant resources were spent on discovery by both parties in the meanwhile. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>purpose of \u00a7 59H is to permit anti-SLAPP suits to \u201cbe resolved quickly with minimum cost\u201d by establishing \u201ca procedural remedy for early dismissal.\u201d <em>Duracraft </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. at 161 (quoting from the preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520). While \u00a7 59H permits the court, in its discretion, to allow special motions to be filed after sixty days, it also grants the court authority to do so \u201cupon terms it deems proper.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, the motion judge found that it would be unjust to award these defendants all three years\u2019 worth of discovery, because the delay in filing the special motion was unwarranted. The motion judge was wise to discourage the strategic delays in filing that might result if all fees and costs attendant upon a late filing were automatically awarded to a successful movant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">To the extent that the plaintiffs, in their cross appeal, argue that the judge\u2019s awards are excessive, their brief offers only conclusory statements that do not rise to the level of appellate argument as required by Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowler, </em>407 Mass. 304, 310 (1990). There are no particulars indicated upon which the plaintiffs show the awards were excessive. The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\">While the Gardners never filed a document entitled \u201cSpecial Motion to Dismiss,\u201d they did file a memorandum in support of such a motion. Since all the parties and the motion judge acted as if there had been a formal motion from both the Mattos and the Gardners, we treat the Gardners\u2019 memorandum as if it had been accompanied below by a special motion to dismiss. Compare <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 658 n.8 (1996) (though motion judge\u2019s formal order only denied two of three motions, all three considered denied because judge\u2019s memorandum of decision discussed and denied all three). In any event, \u201cbecause there was no objection below, the plaintiffs waived the opportunity to raise the procedural issue-on appeal.\u201d <em>Fox </em>v. <em>F &amp; J Gattozzi Corp., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 581, 584 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The acronym \u201cSLAPP\u201d stands for \u201cStrategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.\u201d See G.

Were we to address the merits, however, we observe that the plaintiffs complain that the defendants\u2019 resort to governmental agencies constitutes abuse of process, invasion of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, civil conspiracy, intentional interference with business relations, violation of civil rights under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, of the various incidents documented in the materials submitted by the plaintiffs, only some of the defendants\u2019 reports to the fire department, board of health, conservation commission, and building inspector occurred recently enough to survive the three-year statute of limitations under any of their theories. It is undisputed that most of the defendants\u2019 complained-of conduct occurred prior to December 8, 1992, more than three years from December 8, 1995, the date the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed in the Superior Court. In fact, the plaintiffs have admitted that the allegations contained in paragraphs 10 through 102 of their complaint occurred prior to December 8, 1992. See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A; <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Associated Press, </em>401 Mass. 776, 782 (1988) (invasion of privacy, civil rights violations, and infliction of emotional distress); <em>Cuddy </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 880, 881 (1979) (abuse of process); <em>Pagliuca </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>35 Mass.

Essentially, then, a sham involves a defendant whose activities are not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable governmental action in any form. <em>Video Intl.

I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">By requiring the plaintiffs to pay damages for being harassed by the defendants, this opinion has turned the law on its head. The majority has wrongly concluded that the conduct of the defendants here was entitled to the legislatively created protection of our anti-SLAPP statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. I would like to believe the wise pronouncement of former Justice Good<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>man still has meaning: \u201c[I]f it doesn\u2019t make sense, it can\u2019t be the law.\u201d 16 Mass. App. Ct. 1111, 1125 (June 25, 1983) (Memorial of Justice Reuben Goodman). I would conclude bad faith on the part of the defendants as matter of law, as neither a plausible favorable factual scenario nor a cogent legal ground can be gleaned from this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Here, the defendants\u2019 intentions could not have been clearer; their meritless claims against the plaintiffs were not merely transparent, but were foredoomed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In my view, this case is controlled by our holding in <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 413-415 (2000). \u201cEven if [I] were to assume . . . that the neighbors had met their burden [which in my view, they have not] as the special movant, [the plaintiffs] nonetheless met [their] own statutory burden of showing that the neighbors\u2019 suit was devoid of reasonable factual or legal support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. They and their counsel had to have been aware that the likelihood of the defendants prevailing on the merits was zero as this court had said as much in its 1991 decision. As an aside, it is well known that the possibility of upsetting a variance is real, but the prospect of upsetting a special permit in circumstances, as here, is nil. The plaintiffs also demonstrated the defendants\u2019 acts caused them injury. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 168 (1998). In short, the defendants\u2019 counsel took a position that is beyond reasonable or thoughtful legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">One additional comment is warranted. Even if some of the causes of action pleaded by the plaintiffs may, as the majority notes, be time-barred, I believe the underlying events may still be relied on as evidence of the defendants\u2019 true intentions and their state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">\u201cThis is yet another painful example of how \u2018courts are too frequently called upon to expend the[] limited resources [available] to assist the needy by the machinations of the [selfish and] greedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Long </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Land Bank Commn., </em>35 Mass.
