McDonough Arts Magnet School would not be renewed at the end of the school year. That letter superseded one sent the previous day, April 11, that purported to dismiss him for cause: inefficiency, insubordination, and conduct unbecoming a principal. The question put is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>whether, thus postured, the plaintiff is entitled to the procedural safeguards of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, third par., namely, review of the decision by petition for arbitration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">This, in outline, is the contractual setting of the dispute. Sometime in 1963, the plaintiff began employment as a teacher in the Lowell public schools where he achieved tenure and was subsequently appointed by the superintendent to the position of principal. The last contract between them, signed June 29, 1994, covered the period from July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995. The agreement provided that the plaintiff could be terminated for cause under the statute. On April 11, 1995, the superintendent sent a ten-page letter to the plaintiff notifying him of the decision to dismiss him for cause. On advice of counsel he revoked his decision to dismiss the plaintiff. On the following day the superintendent sent the plaintiff a second letter notifying him of the nonrenewal of his contract effective at the close of the 1995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>school year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, on April 27, 1995, the superintendent\u2019s counsel notified the plaintiffs lawyer that the plaintiff was not being dismissed or demoted but, instead, that his contract was not being renewed by the superintendent. More letters ensued pertaining to the plaintiff\u2019s demand for arbitration on the basis that the nonrenewal letter was equivalent to dismissal, and, alternatively, that \u201ctenured principals\u201d (he had been a principal for more than three years) whose contracts are not renewed are afforded dismissal-type safeguards under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendants seeking a declaratory judgment to that effect. A Superior Court judge, after a hearing on cross motions for summary judgment, allowed the defendants\u2019 motion, and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">1. Prior to June 18, 1993, which was the effective date of St. 1993, c. 71, the Education Reform Act of 1993 (1993 Act), no principal who had served in that position for over three years could be demoted or dismissed without his consent except for cause and only upon a majority vote of the school committee after either a public or private hearing. See <em>Dolloff </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Methuen, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 502, 503 &amp; n.1 (1980). By June 29, 1994, the date on which the plaintiff signed his last contract, the 1993 Act had come into effect and had eliminated the school committee\u2019s involvement as well as a principal\u2019s col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>lective bargaining rights. Instead, principals, like superintendents, and other management personnel within the system, were reclassified as contractual employees. In 1995, some additional changes pertaining to school principals (1995 revisions) went into effect. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">2. The plaintiff bases his claim on the ground that he was \u201cdismissed\u201d and rejects the superintendent\u2019s assertion that his contract was simply allowed to expire without renewal. Both the applicable provisions of the 1993 Act and the 1995 revisions explicitly refer to principals as contractual employees providing .insulation against dismissal except for \u201cgood cause.\u201d These safeguards do not apply should a contract simply expire. A dismissal is not the same as a nonrenewal of a contract. See <em>Costello </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Chelsea, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 826 (1989) (holding that \u201cremoval\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d from continuing employment is distinct from a failure to rehire an employee who is subject to annual renomination and reappointment). Thus, a principal under a one-year, or even a three-year, contract is guaranteed protection in the event of a dismissal only when a superintendent seeks to terminate the employment relationship prior to the expiration of the contractual period. To hold otherwise would grant principals de facto tenure and frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent of limiting appointments to fixed terms. Cf. <em>Porrell </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wayland, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 23, 25 (1998), citing <em>School Comm. of Natick </em>v. <em>Education Assn. of Natick, </em>423 Mass. 34, 38 (1996) (finding no de facto tenure for contractually employed coaches).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The plaintiff argues that, because the 1993 Act (in effect on the date he signed his most recent contract) does not mention \u201cnonrenewal,\u201d dismissal is the only possible means of terminating a principal. Even though the 1995 revisions had been approved at the time he received notice of nonrenewal of his contract, he contends that the change was substantive for purposes of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, and was therefore only applicable to contracts signed after the revisions went into effect. While it is true that the 1995 revisions explicitly address \u201cnonrenewal\u201d (by mandating sixty-day notice to a nonrenewed principal, see note 3, <em>supra), </em>this addition does not mean that the option of \u201cnonrenewal\u201d was precluded under the 1993 Act. The effect of the 1995 revisions is to provide principals with additional rights, rather than to introduce a new, previously unavailable termination option of \u201cnonrenewal.\u201d The introduction of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>safeguards surrounding nonrenewal in the 1995 revisions strengthens the defendants\u2019 argument that the Legislature envisioned two different scenarios, one passive (by expiration of contract) and the other active (by dismissal or demotion). Each alternative triggers its own distinct procedural safeguards: for nonrenewal, notice is required, and for dismissal, just cause and arbitration. While the 1995 revisions made explicit the notice to which a principal is entitled before a contract could effectively not be renewed, which sixty-day notice requirement was satisfied in the instant case, they did not negate a preexisting distinction between active and passive termination. Thus, the issue of the statute\u2019s nonretroactivity is immaterial to the plaintiff\u2019s case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">3. The plaintiff also argues that principals who have served as teachers for more than three consecutive years should be afforded the same protections as those offered to professional teachers. The plaintiff is correct that, in substituting \u201cprofessional teacher status\u201d for the earlier \u201ctenure\u201d status, the 1993 Act creates specific procedural safeguards that professional teachers enjoy prior to a dismissal. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42. Section 41, however, excludes principals from the listed professional employees entitled to that particular status.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s argument turns on whether these safeguards are applicable to contractual employees who have incidentally achieved professional teacher status prior to or concurrent with their role as principals or other positions that are not defined as \u201cteachers.\u201d The plaintiff relies on a case decided before the passage of the 1993 Act which holds that the earlier tenure statute\u2019s reference to \u201cteachers\u201d applies to school principals. See, e.g., <em>McCartin </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Lowell, </em>322 Mass. 624, 627 (1948). This analogy might make sense were it not for the fact that the 1993 Act was by definition intended to \u201creform\u201d education in Massachusetts and specifically redefines the role of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>school principals as managerial in nature. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 53. The title of the 1993 Act itself negates the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the court should defer to the \u201clong history of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">From the language of the 1993 Act, its legislative history, and the context of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, it appears that the plaintiff\u2019s argument to extend teacher protections to principals is untenable. In the very first sentence of the section, principals are excluded from the list of professionals who are considered \u201cteachers\u201d entitled to professional status (i.e., tenure) under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. A number of provisions within the statute distinguish principals from teachers. While teachers may be represented by collective bargaining, principals may not. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, second par. (both the 1993 Act and the 1995 revisions). Because they hire and fire teachers, principals are logically distinct from other school personnel (teachers and other staff) and enjoy different rights and responsibilities. Our conclusion is also informed by \u00a7 53 of the 1993 Act, amending G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, which made a variety of changes relating to the responsibilities of the principal and vests exclusive responsibility for hiring of all teachers and other instructional personnel in the hands of principals. Principals became integral members of the management team of the school district and could no longer be considered \u201csuperior teachers\u201d as they were under the previous cases. See, e.g., <em>McDevitt </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Malden, </em>298 Mass. 213, 214 (1937); <em>McCartin, </em>322 Mass. at 628; <em>Rantz </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Peabody, </em>396 Mass. 383, 386 (1985). Under the 1993 Act, teachers are only rehired annually until they achieve professional teacher status, at which point they can only be dismissed or demoted for cause. In contrast, principals are employed pursuant to employment contracts. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, second par. (both versions; note 3, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The plaintiff argues that we should not interpret G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, to give principals \u201cfewer rights to continued employment than first year teachers.\u201d The plaintiff, as one who has achieved professional teacher status, retained his right to the procedural safeguards he sought insofar as he wished to return to teaching. This, however, is not the relief that the plaintiff requests. The superintendent denied the plaintiff\u2019s right to procedural safeguards only for the nonrenewal of his contract as a principal and not as a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Finally, the contention that the plaintiff\u2019s due process rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>were violated is without merit. Under the statutory scheme, a principal serving under contract does not have a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>409 Mass. 545, 549 (1991); <em>Fontana </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>34 Mass.
