Morse, was convicted in Clinton District Court in February, 1998, on his pleas of guilty to charges (inter alla) of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen (the minor daughter of one Hope Bushey), domestic assault and battery on Bushey, and violation of a no-contact protective order obtained against him by Bushey. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>received a sentence of two and one-half years, six months to be served in a house of correction, t\u00f3 be followed by two years supervised probation, one condition of which was to have no contact with Bushey or her family. On June 18, 1998, Bushey reported to Morse\u2019s probation officer, then complained to the Clinton police department, that the defendant had, on June 17, 1998, at approximately 5:30 p.m., seen her with her daughter and mother in her car at an intersection in Hudson and had yelled at her from his car, \u201cHey, bitch, don\u2019t think I\u2019m done with you and your daughter yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Based upon Bushey\u2019s complaint, on June 18, 1998, a warrant issued from Clinton District Court for Morse\u2019s arrest. A \u201cnotice of surrender and hearing(s)\u201d was also issued by his probation officer listing three claimed violations of the conditions of his probation: (1) the contact with Bushey on June 17, 1998; (2) failure to notify his supervising probation department of a change of address (from Berlin to Hudson); and (3) failure to register as a sex offender in the town where he resided (Hudson). The notice did not indicate whether the hearing on the violation was to be a prehminary hearing or a final revocation hearing. On June 19, 1998, Morse was arrested on the warrant and, after a bail hearing (at which he was represented by counsel), he was held on $50,000 cash bail (which he failed to raise). He was also served with the notice of surrender on June 19. At his arraignment, Morse stated that his current address was in Hudson, although he had previously provided the probation department with an address in Berlin. His case was \u201ccontinued to 6/23/98 for violation of probation hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On June 23, 1998, the presiding judge appointed counsel for Morse, who claimed indigency. (The exact time of that appointment is not revealed by the record.) At some point thereafter (again, the time is unknown), an evidentiary hearing on the charged probation violations took place. Neither Morse nor his counsel raised as an issue whether this was a prehminary or a final revocation hearing. Bushey testified to the facts regarding the June 17 encounter. Morse\u2019s counsel cross-examined Bushey, and then had Morse testify in his own behalf. While admitting that he currently lived in Hudson with a woman named \u201cSally\u201d and that he had neither informed the probation department of that fact nor registered as a sex offender in Hudson, Morse explained that he had never actually resided in Berlin, having only \u201cstayed there [with his brother] probably one night,\u201d but claimed (without substantiation) that he had registered as a sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>offender in Berlin. He explicitly denied (both in direct testimony and in response to a questi\u00f3n from the judge) any contact with Bushey on June 17, claiming that he had been at an auto repair shop in Hudson from about 5:00 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. or possibly as late as 5:30 p.m., talking with \u201ca guy named Tom\u201d about a repair estimate. Admitting that he had no verification \u201ctoday\u201d that he was at the shop as he claimed, Morse said, \u201c[I]f I can be granted more time to receive that I could . . . present that to the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">After closing arguments by the probation officer (who asked for immediate imposition of Morse\u2019s unserved sentence) and Morse\u2019s counsel (who began by saying that he \u201cwould like to have more time to at least prepare for this particular matter\u201d), the judge stated, \u201cI find him in violation of all [three] matters\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and sentenced Morse to serve two and one-half years on and after his \u201coriginal\u201d sentence. On July 3, 1998, Morse filed notices of appeal as to the probation violations found on two of his convictions, which were docketed in this court on December 4, 1998. No notice of appeal was filed as to the third until January 11, 1999 (with the approval of a single justice of this court). On July 24, 1998, Morse\u2019s counsel was permitted to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"AmdT\">On July 28, 1998, Morse filed, pro se, a \u201cmotion to revise and revoke,\u201d claiming that the sentences imposed on the probatian violations were \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d In an affidavit supporting the motion, he acknowledged that on June 17, 1998, he had in fact \u201ccoincidentally r[u]n into [Bushey] at a traffic light in . . . Hudson . . . [while she was] a passenger in her mother\u2019s car,\u201d but he denied saying anything to her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The motion to revise and revoke was heard in Clinton District Court on December 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>1998, by a new judge (the probation surrender judge having retired). Morse was represented at the hearing by a new attorney. The judge denied the motion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and also corrected the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>imposed on the defendant by his predecessor. (The corrected sentence is not currently challenged on appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Morse\u2019s appeal raises several alleged constitutional defects in his probation surrender and revocation proceedings. We agree with the Commonwealth that no reversible error occurred and that the revocation of Morse\u2019s probation should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">1. <em>Insufficient time for counsel to prepare. </em>Pointing to the undoubted right of one facing probation revocation to have a \u201creasonable opportunity to prepare\u201d for the hearing, and in particular a reasonable opportunity for counsel to aid him in his defense, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>418 Mass. 352, 358-360, 365 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 50 (1976), Morse asserts that his due process rights were violated by being given no more than four days\u2019 notice of the hearing on the alleged violations and being assigned counsel only on the day of the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His argument founders on the fact that, while mentioning that they wished they had had more time to prepare, neither he nor his counsel moved for a continuance, much less made an offer of proof or even a statement regarding what they would do or what evidence they would present if they received more time to prepare.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Even were we to construe their unspecific comments as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>requests for a continuance, action on such a request \u201clies within the sound discretion of the judge, and will not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion.\u2019* <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. 105, 108 (1988). Morse has failed to argue, let alone demonstrate, any such abuse on this record, and we discern none. \u201c[I]t was a simple case to prepare and try . . . [and] the record does not support [his] contention that the denial of his motion for [a] continuance prejudiced his case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joubert, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 943, 943-944 (1995) (no abuse of discretion in judge\u2019s refusing to allow a motion for a continuance on the morning of the scheduled probation revocation hearing being held, as here, on an accusation of a violative incident involving a single witness, where the probationer had, as.here, four days\u2019 notice of the accusation, and defense counsel had the morning to interview the witness \u201cand to conduct any investigation deemed necessary\u201d before the hearing began in the afternoon). (As a cautionary note, we remind all participants in the process that there is no mechanical test for evaluating a motion for a continuance; rather, it must be considered in light of the circumstances of the particular case and only after balancing the relevant factors weighing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>and against the need for delay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. at 50-51).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">2. <em>Lack of preliminary, hearing. </em>Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odoardi, </em>397 Mass. 28, 33 (1986), Morse protests that he was given only a final probation hearing and not the preliminary hearing to which he was entitled and which the record does not show he waived. He asserts that his due process rights were thereby violated in a manner that was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the error \u201c contribute[d] to the [outcome].\u201d It is sufficient to reject his conclusory contention by noting that Morse fails to explain how the lack of a preliminary hearing in fact contributed to the adverse outcome, i.e., how he was in any way prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"AM3\">Indeed, <em>Odoardi </em>tilts against Morse on this very point. There, the probationer challenged the Notice of Surrender and Hearing(s), ordering him to appear in court on a certain date for a hearing on the charge that he had violated the terms of his probation, as constitutionally defective<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because it failed to indicate whether the proceeding was to be a preliminary or a final revocation proceeding. While acknowledging that the notice was in fact \u201cunclear,\u201d the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALnd\">\u201cthere was no confusion that the . . . hearing [when held] was a final hearing, and the record reveals no objection by the defendant to the adequacy of the notice. It does not appear that the defendant was in any way prejudiced by the type of notice given. . . . [Djefense counsel. . . assumed that it was a final, rather than a preliminary, revocation hearing. There was no element of surprise involved. It is therefore difficult to perceive how the probation authorities\u2019 failure to specify in the notice what type of hearing was to convene . . . could have affected the defendant adversely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABv\">397 Mass. at 32.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, in this regard, <em>Delisle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 359, 362-363 (1993), in which the probationer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>contended that his due process rights were violated by receiving inadequate notice of the date of the revocation hearing and by being denied a continuance to retain counsel of his own choosing for the surrender hearing. The court rejected these contentions, on the same combined failure-to-raise-below and no-showing-of-prejudice bases as in <em>Odoardi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">\u201cThe [probationer] did not present this issue [as to the notice] to the [tribunal below], and it is therefore not properly before us. We note, nonetheless, that even if the [probationer] received inadequate notice . . . [his] failure to show any prejudice is fatal to his claim [citing Odoardi]. . . . [As to] the claim that he was denied a continuance to retain counsel. . . [tjhe record contains no suggestion that the [probationer] requested [such] a continuance .... See <em>[Commonwealth </em>v.] <em>Durling, </em>[407 Mass. 108,] 112 [1990] (probationer not entitled to full panoply of protections applicable at criminal trial).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">A probationer\u2019s limited due process rights in connection with revocation proceedings, whether viewed as civil or quasi-criminal, are, as these authorities demonstrate, subject to both waiver (like any right, constitutional or otherwise) and harmless error analysis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>429 Mass. 620, 623 (1999) (where the court rejected the defendant\u2019s appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>challenge to the constitutionality of police no-knock entry into his home without a reasonable belief he was inside because he did not raise it below, stating that \u201c[b]ecause the defendant did not alert the trial judge to this argument, the waiver doctrine precludes him from doing so on appeal,\u201d and quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 641 n.15 [1997], for the proposition that \u201ca right that must be claimed<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is not denied if it is not claimed, and the proceeding in which the claim is not made is, in that respect, wholly free from error\u201d); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Tabachnick, 425 </em>Mass. 1010 (1997) (\u201c[W]e shall not address the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims because there is nothing in the record before us that indicates that those claims were adequately raised and preserved in the [lower c]curt proceedings.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In light of the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the three alleged violations (two being admitted by Morse at the time and the third being acknowledged by him shortly thereafter), combined with the want of any valid defense thereto on Morse\u2019s part and his failure to make any showing of prejudice either below or here, it cannot be rationally concluded that a preliminary hearing prior to the final hearing on June 23, 1998, would have been of any material benefit to Morse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 616-617 (1987) (\u201cIn the end ... the axe fell because of the defendant\u2019s own admissions,\u201d notwithstanding \u201c \u2018the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning [supposedly inadequate] notice and other procedural deficiencies as to the [revocation] hearing.\u2019 \u201d As stated in a comparable situation, \u201cThere is little doubt on this record that, if the required hearing had been held, process [in that case, an arrest warrant] would [still] have issued.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>397 Mass. 644, 647 (1986) (in which the defendant claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>reversible error from the Commonwealth\u2019s failure, in violation of G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, to afford him a probable cause hearing to oppose the issuance of the arrest warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Even without deciding whether the issuance of the warrant for Morse\u2019s arrest satisfied the underlying rationale of the preliminary hearing requirement,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and even giving him the benefit of the most stringent constitutional test in criminal cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we can state with confidence that any error that may have occurred by reason of the absence of a preliminary hearing was, on this record, unimportant to the point of insubstantiality and did not contribute in any meaningful way to the revocation ruling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>411 Mass. 249, 260-261 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>414 Mass. 595, 603-605 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>424 Mass. 242, 245-246 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13-14 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">3. <em>Statement ofo reasons and evidence. </em>Morse finally asserts that his due process rights were violated by the failure of the judge to set forth a separate statement of the evidence he relied on to support the revocation of probation, either orally at the hearing or later in the judge\u2019s written \u201cfindings and orders.\u201d He speculates that the judge may have improperly relied upon an outstanding c. 209A restraining order Bushey had obtained against him, which was admitted in evidence over his objection that it was not a noticed basis for the revocation proceeding. Since that order is not contained in his record appendix, his conjecture thereon is unpersuasive, particularly in light of the fact that the judge did make a written finding, that \u201cdefendant violated his . . . probation . . . [by] contact with [the] victim [on] 6/17/98\u201d \u2014 a finding plainly derived from Bushey\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To the extent the restraining order also prohibited contact, it would have been superfluous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Although a separate written statement of the evidence relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>on and the reasons for revocation is one of the probationer\u2019s due process rights in such proceedings, it is not an inflexible or invariably mandatory requirement and can be satisfied in other ways. See <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 498, 504-505 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. at 113-114 (transcription of revocation proceedings accurately reflecting the evidence relied on and reasons for revocation sufficient). See also note 11, <em>supra. </em>It is literally correct that the judge did not explicitly set forth the evidence he relied on (which we agree he preferably should have done). But this was a simple, straightforward case, and the entirety of the short transcript (aside from Morse\u2019s discredited false alibi) <em>is </em>that inculpatory evidence: Bushey\u2019s eyewitness account of their encounter and Morse\u2019s own admissions regarding his failures of required notifications. There is no reasonable basis on this record for a claim of unfair surprise or prejudice supposedly arising from the judge\u2019s reliance upon improper or inadequate evidence. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>414 Mass. at 197-199 (the only evidence introduced at revocation hearing were copies of grand jury indictments which contained none of the facts underlying them and also failed to refer to any of the evidence presented to the grand jury); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michaels, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 646, 648-649 (1996) (no evidence was introduced at revocation hearing except the fact that the defendant\u2019s probation had been revoked in another court for unknown violations of unknown conditions at unknown dates). Morse \u201chad actual knowledge of the \u2018evidence relied on and [the] reasons for revoking [his probation],\u2019 \u201d and fundamental due process was not violated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>that respect. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. at 504-505, quoting from <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The only questions in this case are whether Morse received his minimal due process rights, or their functional equivalent; whether the record discloses sufficient rehable evidence to warrant the findings by the judge that Morse had violated the specified conditions of his probation; and whether the basic due process goals, of providing \u201cfair treatment\u201d to the probationer and an accurate basis for determining whether revocation was proper, were achieved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. at 113-114, 116. We conclude that those questions can confidently be answered affirmatively. \u201cAll that is [otherwise] required for revocation of probation is that the court be satisfied that the probationer has abused the opportunity given him to avoid incarceration.\u201d <em>Rubera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 177, 181 (1976), quoting from <em>Roberson </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>501 F.2d 305, 308 (2d Cir. 1974). The judge below was properly so satisfied, and so are we. The order revoking Morse\u2019s probation is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AGy\">Bushey told the judge, as part of her \u201cvictim impact statement,\u201d that on June 17, she had seen Morse \u201cpull into the auto body shop . . . right after he seen <em>[sic] </em>me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AltO\">In three documents dated June 23, 1998, relating to each of the convictions and entitled \u201cProbation Revocation Proceedings Findings and Orders,\u201d the judge made a \u201cfinal finding that [Morse] violated his . . . probation in the following respects: contact with victim 6/17/98; failure to report to probation change of address 6/22/98; failure to register as Sex Offender in Hudson, MA 6/22/98\u201d; and, describing the evidence upon which he relied, the judge wrote, \u201cDefendant violated the terms of his probation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ArL\">Morse did not include any proceedings in the Clinton District Court subsequent to the July 3, 1998, notices of appeal in the record on appeal, although the docket in his record appendix reveals his filing of the motion to revise and revoke. The Commonwealth moved on August 30, 2000, to expand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the record in this case by inclusion of a certified copy of the defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of that motion plus material related to the subsequent correction of the sentence (see discussion, <em>infra). </em>Morse has vigorously opposed the motion, asserting that the issue of his sentence, not raised by his appeal, is inappropriate for our consideration and that his affidavit \u2014 which concededly \u201ccontradicts\u201d his testimony at the revocation hearing \u2014 is not properly part of the record on appeal. He contended that its introduction into that record is unsupported by any of the authorities relied on by the Commonwealth, all of which dealt with documents or statements that preceded the filing of the notice of appeal. We allow the Commonwealth\u2019s motion as to the affidavit. Contrary to Morse\u2019s position, the affidavit <em>is </em>part of the record in this matter (aside from the fact that its submission did precede his filing of his final notice of appeal). The uncontradicted docket in the record appendix reveals this, see <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>246 Mass. 170, 176 (1923), and it <em>is </em>one of the \u201coriginal papers and exhibits on file,\u201d Mass.R.A.P. 8(a), as amended, 378 Mass. 932 (1979), in the matter of his probation revocation proceeding in the Clinton District Court \u2014 a fact we have actually ascertained and of which we can take judicial notice. See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>388 Mass. 443, 447 (1983); <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Brassard, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 681 (1974); <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 581 n.8 (1923). We may, on our own motion, allow its inclusion as part of the instant record as an \u201comission\u201d that should be included so that the \u201crecord . . . conform to the truth.\u201d Mass.R.A.P. 8(e), as amended, 378 Mass. 934 (1979). In any event, we are entitled to rely on parts of the record even if not included in file record appendix by the parties. See Mass.R.A.P. 18(a), as amended, 378 Mass. 940 (1979).

Further, we are entitled to access to the probation-related document by virtue of the provisions of the criminal offender record information system, whether or not it was technically part of the record on appeal. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 167, 168A &amp; 172. In this connection, we note that a motion to revise and revoke a sentence is in the nature of a motion to reconsider that sentence and is to be considered \u201cin light of the facts as they existed at the time of sentencing . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>424 Mass. 377, 380 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>386 Mass. 291, 295 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Morse immediately filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his motion to revise and revoke; but, four months later and represented by new counsel, he moved to dismiss that appeal, shortly after the Commonwealth had moved to stay the earlier appeal in anticipation of moving to consolidate the two appeals, specifically relying on Morse\u2019s affidavit as relevant to the prior appeal. The Commonwealth\u2019s request for a stay was ultimately denied, and the second appeal was never docketed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">In a postbrief letter filed pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 16(1), as amended, 386 Mass. 1247 (1982), Morse calls our attention to the recently promulgated District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, which require (unless waived) at least seven days\u2019 notice of alleged violations (rule 3[b][iii]) and at least seven days between appointment of counsel and the hearing (rule 4[d]), as well as a \u201creasonable time to prepare\u201d for the hearing generally (rule 8[c]). Such mandatory rules were not applicable at the time of his hearing, and, to the extent they existed as guidelines for the probation department and the District Court at such time, any failure to follow them was not, contrary to Morse\u2019s assertion, per se reversible error. See <em>Rubera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 311 </em>Mass. 177, 185-186 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The Notice of Surrender and Hearing(s) had explicitly stated that \u201c[y]ou may . . . request a continuance [at the scheduled hearing] if additional time is required to protect your rights.\u201d When the hearing began, counsel were asked, \u201cAre we ready?\u201d The probation officer responded, \u201cYes, we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d indicating the posture of both counsel, whereupon the judge said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d If Morse\u2019s counsel had any misgivings about his defense preparation, he said nothing at the time. Morse couches his present argument in terms of denial of the right to counsel, not as a claim of ineffective- assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>418 Mass. at 358-359. The insubstantial and conjectural nature of Morse\u2019s argument can be seen in his imprecise characterization of counsel\u2019s expected performance had he been given more time to prepare: \u201che <em>may </em>have been able to develop the Defendant\u2019s defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>. . . and <em>may </em>have achieved a different outcome.\u201d Although he now claims that, with more time, counsel could have called \u201cTom\u201d from the auto repair shop to testify as to his alibi, such a contention appears disingenuous in light of his contradictory affidavit on his motion to revise and revoke, which admitted his physical encounter with Bushey on the day and at the place she testified to, notwithstanding his explicit denials of having even seen her that day at the hearing (see <em>supra </em>at 584). Even had \u201cTom\u201d appeared as a witness, he could not have rebutted Bushey\u2019s testimony that she and Morse saw each other at the intersection at about 5:30 p.m. on June 17, 1998, or that Morse yelled a vulgar threat at her from his car, especially given the earlier time Morse testified he was at the shop. (We take judicial notice of the fact that the location in Hudson to which Morse testified he drove from the shop at or after 5:30 p.m.. is only a short distance from the intersection at which Bushey testified he encountered her at about 5:30 p.m. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 62, 69-70 n.9 [1997] [judicial notice taken of street locations]). Morse also argues that counsel could have called his brother or \u201cSally\u201d to \u201ccorroborate\u201d the mitigating circumstances regarding his move from Berlin to Hudson. However, aside from the fact that he raises the issue for the first time on appeal, never having identified those individuals as potentially exculpatory witnesses at the hearing, in the absence of any showing what their potential testimony would be, as well as the suspect nature of their relationship with him, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>370 Mass. 746, 752 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 579-580 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dominico, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 721 (1974), such speculative argument is to no avail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AbB\">\u201c[W]ritten notice of any claimed violations of [probation]\u201d and \u201ca preliminary and a final revocation hearing\u201d are two of the minimal due process rights to which a probationer facing revocation of probation is entitled. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odoardi, </em>397 Mass. at 31-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AMl\">The defendant in <em>Odoardi </em>also challenged on due process grounds the probation department\u2019s delay in commencing revocation proceedings until months after the scheduled termination of his probation. In a similar vein, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>court rejected the challenge because the probationer \u201cpoints to no fact of record to indicate . . . that he was prejudiced thereby,\u201d 397 Mass. at 36-37, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sawicki, </em>369 Mass. 377, 387 (1975), which held, in similar circumstances, that, even if the right to a prompt probation revocation hearing were of constitutional dimension, \u201cthere is no indication on this record of <em>specific prejudice </em>to [the probationer] resulting from the delay\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whooley, </em>419 Mass. 421, 425 (1995) (even though probation authorities violated G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 22 n.1 (1999) (Greaney, J., concurring). The Supreme Judicial Court has recently indicated that even so-called \u201cstructural\u201d constitutional errors may be waived if not timely objected to, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>428 Mass. 469, 476 (1998), with the possible exception of an instruction incorrectly describing the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 474-475. Cf. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 47A (\u201cIn a criminal case, any . . . objection based upon defects in the institution of the prosecution . . . shall only be raised prior to trial and only by a motion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>conformity with the requirements of the [Mass.R.Crim.P.]. The failure to raise any such . . . objection by motion prior to trial shall constitute a waiver thereof . . .\u201d); G.

[You] . . . may waive the preliminary hearing if you wish.\u201d As previously noted, Morse and his counsel were immediately made aware that they were involved in a formal evidentiary hearing to determine whether he had violated his probation but made no effort to alert the judge to any objection they might have had to the lack of a preliminary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\"> \u201c[A] probationer is entitled to a preliminary hearing ... to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a violation of his probation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odoardi, </em>397 Mass. at 33. That requirement involves only \u201c \u2018some minimal inquiry\u2019 conducted by \u2018someone not directly involved in the case\u2019 to \u2018determine whether there is . . . reasonable ground to believe that the [probationer] has committed acts that would constitute a violation of [probation] conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stefanik </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Parole, </em>372 Mass. 726, 728 &amp; 729 n.4 (1977), quoting from <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 485 (1972). The court in <em>Stefanik </em>noted, quoting the United States Supreme Court in <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. at 487, 490, that courts \u201cexpressly eschew[] a rigid and mandatory approach: \u2018No interest would be served by formalism in this process\u2019. . . [nor have the courts] \u2018create[d] an inflexible structure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729-730. The ultimate goal of the procedural requirements is \u201cproviding an accurate determination whether revocation is proper.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>407 Mass. at 108. The validity of a revocation process is not to be determined by whether it satisfies an inflexible \u201ccode of procedure,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 113, but rather by whether the probationer has received \u201cfair treatment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 116, which \u201cdepend[s] on the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. A preliminary hearing is not required when the functional equivalent of a preliminary hearing has occurred. See <em>Stefanik, </em>372 Mass. at 730-732 (defendant had received a bind-over probable cause hearing in the District Court). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>414 Mass. 193, 194-199 (1993) (final probation revocation hearing held on grand jury indictments, which are \u201csufficient to warrant a finding of \u2018probable cause to arrest [the] defendant,\u201d\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 198, but are insufficiently reliable to be the sole basis for revocation of probation). Here, a warrant issued from the Clinton District Court on Bushey\u2019s percipient complaint for Morse\u2019s arrest. (Morse challenges neither the warrant nor the arrest.) To be valid, any arrest must be based upon probable cause, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. 777, 783 (1985), which can be predicated entirely upon reliable hearsay. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>422 Mass. 487, 496-497 (1996). Although neither the warrant nor the transcript of the proceedings relating thereto have been included in the record appendix, they are entitled to a presumption of regularity, including a presumption that the warrant was issued by a disinterested magistrate and was based upon \u201cprobable cause supported by oath or affirmation as required by art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution [, by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution] and by G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 22.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldassini, </em>357 Mass. 670, 675 (1970). Cf. <em>Whitely </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>401 U.S. 560, 568 (1971) (an arresting officer is \u201centitled to assume [that the warrant was issued upon] the information requisite to support an independent judicial assessment of probable cause\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>429 Mass. 866, 868 &amp; n.4 (1999) (assuming, without deciding, that such a standard was applicable); but see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmgren, </em>421 Mass. 224, 226 (1995) (the standard of proof in a revocation proceeding is the civil standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>407 Mass. at 112 (\u201cRevocation proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecution . . .

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 449-450 (1993) (\u201cthe judge was not required to accept any of the exculpatory reasons offered by the defendant,\u201d including the claim that an encounter on a public street in violation of a no-contact probation condition was innocent and coincidental).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The Commonwealth included two restraining orders against Morse in its record appendix, both prohibiting his contact with the minor daughter of Hope Bushey, who obtained the orders, but it is not possible to conclude that either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>was the document referred to in the transcript. One is a certified copy of an order that appears on its face to have expired in December 1997; while the other is uncertified and has a typewritten expiration date of \u201c1/8/98\u201d that has been altered by an unknown hand to \u201c1/8/99,\u201d which would create an illegal period of time for the effectiveness of that order, dated \u201c12/23/97.\u201d See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 2 (relief is \u201cnot to exceed one year\u201d). To the extent the restraining order referred to in the transcript arose out of new or additional misconduct by Morse, it would not have been irrelevant to the judge\u2019s discretionary determination whether or not to revoke Morse\u2019s probation if the judge was satisfied that Morse was in violation of any probationary conditions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. at 111. \u201cOne of the primary purposes of probation is to rehabilitate the offender. An offender who continues to violate the law is obviously not being rehabilitated. The Commonwealth has an interest in imposing effective punishment on a convicted criminal when rehabilitation is not possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
