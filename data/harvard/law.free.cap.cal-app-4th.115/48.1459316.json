J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">This case involves interpretation of the criminal discovery chapter (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1054 et seq., hereafter occasionally referred to as the Criminal Discovery Statute) implemented in 1990 as part of Proposition 115. The question of first impression we must decide in this writ proceeding is whether the reciprocal discovery provisions of the Criminal Discovery Statute apply to a probation revocation hearing such that a probationer is obligated to provide discovery to the prosecution in such a proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that the reciprocal discovery provisions set forth in the criminal discovery chapter of Proposition 115 (\u00a7 1054 et seq.) do not apply to a probation revocation hearing, and thus a probationer has no obligation to provide discovery to the prosecution in such a proceeding, because (1) a probation revocation proceeding is not a criminal trial within the meaning of section 1054.3 governing the scope of the discovery obligations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>defense; and (2) neither this chapter, the Constitution of the United States, nor other statutory authority provides for such discovery. Accordingly, we grant defendant Jed Jones\u2019s petition for writ of mandate and direct the trial court to vacate its order requiring the defense to provide discovery to the prosecution in the probation revocation hearing in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In January 1999, Jones pleaded guilty to one count of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)). The conviction arose from his participation in a fight at a house party. One of the participants suffered a severe injury that resulted in quadriplegia. At the sentencing hearing, the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Jones on five years\u2019 formal probation with standard and special terms and conditions plus 365 days\u2019 incarceration in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\n<em>Summary Revocation of Jones\u2019s Probation and Informal Exchange of Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">In December 2002, the People petitioned the court for an order summarily revoking Jones\u2019s probation, alleging that he had violated the terms and condition of his probation in October 2002 by (1) committing an assault (\u00a7 240) in a restaurant in violation of condition No. 6a; (2) failing to abstain from the use of alcohol in violation of condition No. 7i; and (3) using force, threats, or violence on another person in violation of condition No. 10. The court granted the petition and summarily revoked Jones\u2019s probation. Jones made an appearance to deny the allegations, and the court set an evidentiary hearing in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">On May 20, 2003,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defense counsel sent the People a written informal request for discovery and indicated the defense had audiotapes of two witnesses, one of whom was Alisia Parsons, that would be available to the People. Defense counsel also indicated he would call three witnesses to testify at the probation revocation hearing: Alisia Parsons, Marcos Bachling, and Ashley James, all of whom were present at the fight in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\n<em>Probation Revocation Hearing and the Court\u2019s Finding That the Defense Violated Proposition 115 Discovery Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The evidentiary hearing on the probation revocation petition commenced on May 27. Jones admitted he had violated condition No. 7i of his probation by failing to abstain from the use of alcohol and presented a defense as to the remaining probation violation allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>On May 29, after the People rested, the defense called Parsons as its first witness. During cross-examination, Parsons testified that she was present during the fight in the restaurant, and she heard foul language and \u201cguys\u201d cursing at each other when the fight ended. She also testified that Bachling and a man whose first name was \u201cLewis\u201d yelled at Jones; and Lewis, who had a shaved head and tattoos on his arms and chest, and Bachling were the ones who fought with Jones. When asked how she knew Lewis, Parsons testified she had seen him at a few bars around town.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Parsons also testified she had spoken with the defense investigator, Mr. Martino, twice in person and three times by telephone, and she had given him information about Lewis. Parsons stated she recognized Lewis during the fight, but did not talk to the police about him when they arrived at the scene of the fight. She learned from Kristine Newark that Newark and Newark\u2019s brother, Steven, knew Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">After the court excused Parsons, one of the two prosecutors, Hector Jimenez, told the court during a sidebar conference that he was shocked by Parsons\u2019s testimony and complained that \u201c[t]his ... is a three-ring circus.\u201d The other prosecutor, Polly Shamoon, complained that Parsons, a defense witness, knew about a person named Lewis and had given a statement to the defense investigator, but the prosecution was \u201cnever given discovery on anybody named Lewis.\u201d Shamoon accused Bachling, who had testified on May 27 and 28, of falsely testifying that the other man who had fought with Jones was a man named Robert Bunkers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shamoon also stated that \u201cthe defense had to know all of this was happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The court asked defense counsel whether he or his investigator had information, before Parsons testified, that Parsons recognized that the man who was with Bachling during the fight was named Lewis. Defense counsel replied that he did not have such information, and he did not know whether his investigator had that information. The prosecution expressed disbelief at defense counsel\u2019s response, arguing that Parsons had testified that she had told the defense investigator that the second person involved in the fight with Jones was named Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The prosecution then asked the court for an order striking Parsons\u2019s entire testimony and complained that the tape recording of Parsons\u2019s statement provided by the defense did not contain the information that the second man was named Lewis, not Bunkers. Prosecutor Shamoon told the court she had asked the defense for \u201cany other reports for this witness [Parsons] or written notes or anything that we should [have] and they said no.\u201d Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>replied that he had asked his investigator whether he had any reports or notes, and the investigator went through his papers and said he did not think he had any. The court denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to strike Parsons\u2019s testimony and informed counsel it would be willing to grant a continuance to permit the prosecution to further investigate the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Prosecutor Jimenez accused the defense of committing a \u201cpattern of discovery violations,\u201d noting that it was not until the afternoon after Bachling testified that the defense faxed to Jimenez a half-page of notes, consisting of eight lines, pertaining to a statement given by Bachling. Both prosecutors argued the People would have cross-examined Bachling more extensively had they received from the defense information that Parsons knew the second man involved in the fight with Jones was a man named Lewis, not Bunkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The People made an oral motion for a ruling that the defense had violated the \u201cdiscovery laws.\u201d The court gave the defense an opportunity to respond, and defense counsel argued there was no such violation because Bachling \u201cwas a witness to be called by the People in their case in chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The court ruled the defense had committed a discovery violation by failing to provide to the People, before the hearing started, the half-page of notes regarding Bachling\u2019s statement. Referring to the half-page of notes, defense counsel replied, \u201cI never had it until today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Prosecutor Jimenez then asked the court to make a finding that the defense had violated the \u201creciprocal discovery rules\u201d by failing to provide information that Parsons told the defense investigator that Lewis, not Bunkers, was the second man involved in the fight with Lewis. The court granted the People\u2019s request for a continuance to June 6 for the purpose of investigating the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\n<em>Jones\u2019s Motion To Reverse the Court\u2019s Finding That the Defense Had Violated Proposition 115 Discovery Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">On June 6, Jones filed a motion to reverse the court\u2019s ruling that his defense counsel had violated Proposition 115 discovery rules. In his moving papers, Jones stated that on May 29 the court \u201cruled that the defense had failed to provide reciprocal discovery to the prosecution, i.e. 1/3 of an 8 1/2 X 11 page of hand written notes written by an investigator hired by the defense concerning a witness called by the prosecution [Bachling] during the revocation of probation hearing herein.\u201d (Original underscoring.) Jones argued there was no case or statutory law requiring the defense to provide discovery to the prosecution at a violation of probation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\n<em>June 9 Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The court heard Jones\u2019s motion on June 9. Following oral argument, the court issued its ruling (hereafter the June 9 order) that under the Proposition 115 discovery provisions set forth in section 1054 et seq., \u201cthe defense has an obligation to provide reciprocal discovery in a probation revocation hearing.\u201d The court, however, reversed its May 29 finding that the defense had intentionally violated the Criminal Discovery Statute, noting that the law on this question was \u201cunsettled\u201d and the defense had turned over to the prosecution Martino\u2019s notes regarding Bachling\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">After further argument, the court discussed the following hypothetical scenario, recognizing that its ruling that the Proposition 115 discovery rules apply to probation revocation hearings could be prejudicial to a defendant in such a proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cLet\u2019s say that the defense has information as to the whereabouts of a person who was present at the time of the alleged probation violation in this case and that that person would just crucify [Jones] and would say that [Jones] was acting horribly and was an instigator and did all sorts of horrible, violent acts. If the defense does not have an obligation under the statute to turn over discovery, then if this court were to order that discovery be provided and it got provided, then the potential could be extreme prejudice to [Jones] based upon what could be determined to be an erroneous ruling by the court and it could go to a very significant issue as to the proof that the People are providing as to whether there is a probation violation. I just use that as an extreme example of what could be the type of issue at stake when addressing the issue of whether a defendant in .a case has to provide information to the prosecution. [(f] <em>As I said, I believe there is that obliga</em>tion[.] So I think that it makes sense that the defense [desires] to pursue a writ to give the defense a reasonable opportunity to do that prior to potentially having to deal with issues that could be <em>extremely prejudicial to the </em>defendant.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\n<em>Jones\u2019s Writ Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">On June 19, Jones challenged the June 9 order by filing the writ petition in this matter. He alleges therein that the court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion by ruling that (1) he was subject to Proposition 115 discovery rules during the pending probation revocation hearing, and (2) the court could order him to provide the names and statements of incriminating witnesses whom the defense had discovered but did not intend to call to testify during the hearing. Jones seeks an order prohibiting the court from enforcing the June 9 order or, in the alternative, an order compelling the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to vacate the order. Jones also seeks an order prohibiting the court from requiring him to disclose the names and statements of witnesses the defense has discovered but does not intend to call at the probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>The Court\u2019s June 23 Clarification of the June 9 Order</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>5</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">On June 23, after Jones commenced this writ proceeding, the court held a status conference and clarified that the scope of its June 9 order was limited to statements made by witnesses that Jones intended to call at the probation revocation hearing. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cSo I just feel that I need to clarify the record because I don\u2019t believe that I ever said anything about what would happen if . . . the defense investigator had gone out, independently done investigation, found a witness and found out that witness had information for the defense case, I never said . . . that I would order discovery of that under [section] 1054.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\n<em>The People\u2019s Informal Response and the Order To Show Cause (OSC)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The People filed an informal response to Jones\u2019s writ petition and argued that the petition should be summarily denied on various grounds. This court thereafter issued an OSC ordering the court to show cause why the relief requested in Jones\u2019s petition should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\n<em>The People\u2019s Formal Response to the Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">The People filed a formal response to Jones\u2019s writ petition. Abandoning the position taken in the July 7 informal response, which opposed Jones\u2019s petition, the People admit the allegation in Jones\u2019s petition that the court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the reciprocal discovery provisions of Proposition 115 require Jones to provide discovery to the People at the probation revocation hearing. Stating that Jones \u201cis correct in his assertion that the court may not order reciprocal discovery at probation revocation hearings,\u201d the People argue that (1) the plain meaning of California\u2019s criminal discovery statute determines the extent of discovery available at a probation revocation hearing, (2) by its own terms, that statute limits the discretion of a trial court to order discovery in criminal cases, (3) sections 1054.1 and 1054.3 authorize discovery only in the setting of criminal trial, (4) probation revocation hearings are not criminal trials, (5) discovery is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>mandated by the United States Constitution, and (6) there are no express statutory provisions for discovery in revocation proceedings outside the scheme of the criminal discovery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In this writ proceeding, Jones challenges the court\u2019s June 9 order, which construed the Proposition 115 reciprocal discovery provisions set forth in the Criminal Discovery Statute (\u00a7 1054 et seq.) as requiring the defense to provide discovery to the prosecution in the pending probation revocation proceeding. We begin our analysis by examining the constitutional and statutory framework created by the passage of Proposition 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In June 1990, the electorate approved Proposition 115, the \u201cCrime Victims Justice Reform Act\u201d initiative, which authorized the \u201ctwo-way street of reciprocal discovery\u201d between the prosecution and the defense in criminal cases in California. <em>(Izazaga v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 356, 363 [285 Cal.Rptr. 231, 815 P.2d 304].) One leading commentator has noted that Proposition 115 \u201cadded constitutional provisions bearing directly and indirectly on discovery, added a new chapter in the Penal Code on the subject, and repealed provisions that were supplanted by the new law. [Citations.]\u201d (5 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Criminal Trial, \u00a7 30, p. 76.) Witkin also notes that Proposition 115 made two fundamental changes in the California law of criminal discovery. (5 Witkin &amp; Epstein, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 30, p. 76.) First, it made discovery in criminal cases \u201creciprocal\u201d (i.e., available to both the prosecution and the defense). <em>{Ibid.) </em>Proposition 115 added section 30, subdivision (c) to article 1 of the California Constitution. (See parenthetical note, 1C West\u2019s Ann. Const. (2002 ed.) foil. \u00a7 30, p. 415.) That subdivision provides: \u201cIn order to provide for fair and speedy trials, <em>discovery in criminal cases shall be reciprocal in nature, </em>as prescribed by the Legislature or by the people through the initiative process.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Second, as a result of Proposition 115, discovery in criminal cases is now governed primarily by statutory law. (5 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Criminal Trial, \u00a7 30, p. 77.) The California Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[i]n criminal proceedings, under the reciprocal discovery provisions of section 1054 et seq., all court-ordered discovery is governed exclusively by\u2014and is barred except as provided by\u2014the discovery chapter newly enacted by Proposition 115.\u201d <em>(In re Littlefield </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 122, 129 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 248, 851 P.2d 42], citing \u00a7\u00a7 1054.5, subd. (a) &amp; 1054, subd. (e).) Section 1054.5, subdivision (a) provides in part that \u201c[n]o order requiring discovery shall be made in criminal cases <em>except as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>provided in this chapter </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Section 1054, subdivision (e) provides: \u201cThis chapter shall be interpreted to give effect to all of the following purposes: [f] . . . [f] (e) To provide that <em>no discovery shall occur in criminal cases except as provided by this chapter, other express statutory provisions, or as mandated by the Constitution of the United </em>States.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Most of the discovery provisions set forth in the Criminal Discovery Statute expressly apply to discovery in a trial setting. One commentator has observed that \u201c[virtually every discoverable item under the [Criminal Discovery Statute] is <em>trial-related.\u201d </em>(Pipes &amp; Gagen, California Criminal Discovery, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2:16, p. 201, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u201cThe scope of a defense attorney\u2019s discovery obligations under section 1054 et seq. is set forth in section 1054.3.\u201d <em>(In re Littlefield, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 129.) All of the categories of discoverable items the defense is required to disclose to the prosecution under section 1054.3 are trial related: (1) the names and addresses of witnesses (\u201cother than the defendant\u201d) that the defense intends to call \u201cat trial\u201d (\u00a7 1054.3, subd. (a)); (2) \u201ctogether with any relevant written or recorded statements\u201d or \u201creports of the statements\u201d of those trial witnesses that the defense intends to offer in evidence \u201cat the trial\u201d <em>(ibid.); </em>(3) \u201cincluding any reports or statements of experts made in connection with the case\u201d that the defense intends to offer in evidence \u201cat the trial\u201d <em>(ibid.); </em>(4) \u201cincluding the results of physical or mental examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons\u201d that the defense intends to offer in evidence \u201cat the trial\u201d <em>(ibid.); </em>and (5) \u201c[a]ny real evidence\u201d the defense intends to offer in evidence \u201cat the trial\u201d (\u00a7 1054.3, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Section 1054.1,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which governs the prosecuting attorney\u2019s obligation to provide discovery to the defense, also limits that obligation to disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>specific types of information and materials primarily in a trial setting. That section requires the prosecution to disclose the following trial-related information \u201cif it is in the possession of the prosecuting attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the possession of the investigating agencies\u201d: (1) \u201c[t]he names and addresses of persons the prosecutor intends to call as witnesses <em>at triar </em>(\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (a), italics added); (2) felony convictions suffered by any material witnesses \u201cwhose credibility is likely to be critical to the outcome of the trial\u201d (\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (d), italics added); and (3) \u201c[Relevant written or recorded statements of witnesses or reports of the statements of witnesses whom the prosecutor intends to call <em>at the trial, </em>including any reports or statements of experts made in conjunction with the case, including the results of physical or mental examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons which the prosecutor intends to offer in evidence <em>at the </em>trial\u201d (\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (f)). (Italics added.) Three other categories of discoverable items the prosecution is required to disclose to the defense under section 1054.1 are not specifically trial related: (1) \u201c[statements of all defendants\u201d (\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (b)); (2) \u201c[a]ll relevant real evidence seized or obtained as part of the investigation of the offenses charged\u201d (\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (c)); and (3) \u201c[a]ny exculpatory evidence\u201d (\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Section 1054.7 governs the timing of the discovery disclosures required by the Criminal Discovery Statute and generally mandates that such disclosures be made before \u201ctrial.\u201d The section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201cThe disclosures required under this chapter shall be made at least <em>30 days prior to the trial, </em>unless good cause is shown why a disclosure should be denied, restricted, or deferred. If the material and information becomes known to, or comes into the possession of, a party <em>within 30 days of trial, </em>disclosure shall be made immediately, unless good cause is shown why a disclosure should be denied, restricted, or deferred.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Finally, some of the express purposes of the Criminal Discovery Statute, as set forth in section 1054, subdivisions (a) and (c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appear to limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>application of the statute to a pretrial setting. These purposes, such as \u201cpromoting] the ascertainment of truth <em>in trials </em>by requiring timely <em>pretrial </em>discovery\u201d and \u201csav[ing] court time in trial,\u201d refer only to a trial context even though similar objectives would be equally desirable in the context of a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In construing the foregoing provisions of the Criminal Discovery Statute to determine whether they authorized the June 9 order, \u201cour primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed [Proposition 115,]\u201d the initiative measure at issue here. <em>(In re Littlefield, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 130.) \u201cTo determine intent, \u2018 \u201cThe court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018If the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the Legislature (in the case of a statute) or of the voters (in the case of a provision adopted by the voters).\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Delaney v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 798 [268 Cal.Rptr. 753, 789 P.2d 934].)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Here, the statutory language of sections 1054, 1054.1, and 1054.3 (discussed, <em>ante) </em>clearly indicates that the reciprocal discovery obligations mandated by the Criminal Discovery Statute apply only in the context of a criminal \u201ctrial.\u201d Of particular importance are the provisions that govern the obligation of the defense to provide discovery. As already discussed, those provisions are set forth in section 1054.3, which expressly limits the discovery obligations of the defense to the providing of specified types of information concerning witnesses the defendant intends to call \u201cat trial\u201d and any real evidence he or she intends to offer in evidence \u201cat the trial.\u201d Neither section 1054.3, nor any other provision of the Criminal Discovery Statute, obligates the defense to provide discovery in connection with a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The validity of the court\u2019s order in this matter thus turns in large part on whether a probation revocation hearing, such as the one from which this writ proceeding arose, is a \u201ctrial\u201d within the meaning of the Criminal Discovery Statute. One commentator has observed that \u201c[t]he courts have exhibited a tendency to broadly interpret the Criminal Discovery Statute,\u201d and notes that the California Supreme Court stated in <em>People v. Robertson </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 18, 45 [255 Cal.Rptr. 631, 767 P.2d 1109] that \u201c \u2018[t]he meaning of \u201ctrial\u201d varies depending on the context of its use.\u2019 \u201d (Pipes &amp; Gagen, Cal. Criminal Discovery, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2:17, p. 201, &amp; \u00a7 2:30, p. 231.) The same commentator, however, states that \u201c[t]he explicit use of the term \u2018trial\u2019 in the Criminal Discovery Statute is evidence that the statute is limited to a proceeding in which a trier of fact returns a verdict on the charges.\u201d <em>(Id,, </em>\u00a7 2:18, p. 202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Here, both parties assert, and we agree, that a probation revocation hearing is not a \u201ctrial\u201d within the meaning of the Criminal Discovery Statute. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 900, 907 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 391], the Court of Appeal recognized that a probation revocation hearing \u201cis not a trial.\u201d The <em>Perez </em>court noted that \u201c \u2018[probation revocation hearings and criminal trials serve different public interests, and different concerns may shape the People\u2019s pursuit of revocation and conviction.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>Lucido v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 347 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The <em>Perez </em>court explained that, \u201cAs the United States Supreme Court has emphasized, \u2018. . . there are critical differences between criminal trials and probation[ . . . Revocation hearings, and both society and the probationer[ . . . ]have stakes in preserving these differences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 907, quoting <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 778, 788-789 [36 L.Ed.2d 656, 93 S.Ct. 1756].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The California Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[t]he fundamental role and responsibility of the hearing judge in a revocation proceeding is not to determine whether the probationer is guilty or innocent of a crime, but whether a violation of the terms of probation has occurred and, if so, whether it would be appropriate to allow the probationer to continue to retain his conditional liberty. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lucido </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 348.) The high court also stated in <em>Lucido </em>that \u201c[a] probation revocation hearing assesses whether conditions relating to punishment for a prior crime have been violated so that probation should be modified or revoked; a criminal prosecution seeks conviction for wholly new offenses. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 347-348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">While we need not elaborate here on all of the material distinctions between a probation revocation hearing and a trial, we mention a few to illustrate the fundamental difference between these two types of criminal proceedings. There is no right to a jury trial in a probation revocation proceeding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dale </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 191, 195 [112 Cal.Rptr. 93].) The standard of proof that applies at a probation revocation hearing is proof by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard that applies to criminal trials. <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 437, 447 [272 Cal.Rptr. 613, 795 P.2d 783].) Relaxed rules of evidence apply at a probation revocation hearing. (See <em>People v. Maki </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 707, 715 [217 Cal.Rptr. 676, 704 P.2d 743] [stating that in such proceedings courts have shown a \u201cwillingness to consider otherwise inadmissible hearsay evidence when accompanied by reasonable indicia of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>reliability\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 452, 454 [263 Cal.Rptr. 391] [\u201cAs long as hearsay testimony bears a substantial degree of trustworthiness it may legitimately be used at a probation revocation proceeding\u201d].) The exclusionary rule does not apply to a probation revocation hearing. <em>(People v. Harrison </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 803, 811 [245 Cal.Rptr. 204] [\u201c[Federal law does not require application of the exclusionary rule to probation revocation hearings\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Because a probation revocation hearing is not a \u201ctrial\u201d within the meaning of the Criminal Discovery Statute, and none of the express provisions of the Criminal Discovery Statute obligate the defense to provide discovery to the prosecution in connection with a probation revocation hearing, a determination of whether the court properly found that the reciprocal discovery obligations under Proposition 115 apply to a probation revocation hearing depends on whether such discovery is mandated by any other express statutory provisions or the federal Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The parties have cited to no statutory provisions outside the Criminal Discovery Statute, and we are aware of none, that generally require reciprocal disclosure of discovery in connection with a probation revocation hearing. An examination of section 1203.2 et seq., which sets forth the procedural steps in revocation of probation, reveals no such provisions. (See generally 3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Punishment, \u00a7\u00a7 584-586, pp. 777-782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Such reciprocal discovery is also not mandated by the United States Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states in part: \u201cNo state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without <em>due process of law.\u201d </em>In <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 471 [33 L.Ed.2d 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593] <em>(Morrissey), </em>the United States Supreme Court established the minimal due process requirements in parole revocation proceedings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vickers </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 451, 458 [105 Cal.Rptr. 305, 503 P.2d 1313] <em>(Vickers).) </em>In <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. 778, the high federal court extended the <em>Morrissey </em>due process guarantees to probationers. (3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Punishment, \u00a7 582, p. 774.) In <em>Vickers, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at page 458, the California Supreme Court held that the federal <em>Morrissey </em>due process guarantees apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to formal state probation revocation proceedings. Thus, as a matter of due process, a probationer facing a formal probation revocation hearing is entitled to (1) written notice of the claimed violations of probation; (2) disclosure to the probationer of the evidence against him or her; (3) the opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (4) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation; (5) a neutral and detached hearing body; (6) a written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking probation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. at p. 786, citing <em>Morrissey, supra, </em>at p. 489; <em>Vickers, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Prosecutors are constitutionally mandated to disclose exculpatory material evidence to defendants in criminal cases. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Barrett) </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 264], citing <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83, 87 [10 L.Ed.2d 215, 83 S.Ct. 1194].) However, <em>\u201cBrady </em>exculpatory evidence is the only substantive discovery mandated by the United States Constitution. A criminal defendant does not have a general constitutional right to discovery. <em>(Weatherford v. Bursey </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 545, 559 [51 L.Ed.2d 30, 97 S.Ct. 837]; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Netherland </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 152, 168 [135 L.Ed.2d 457, 116 S.Ct. 2074]; accord, <em>People v. Gonzalez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1258 [275 Cal.Rptr. 729, 800 P.2d 1159].)\u201d <em>(Barrett, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at p. 1314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Proposition 115 reciprocal discovery provisions set forth in the Criminal Discovery Statute do not apply to a probation revocation hearing, and thus a probationer has no obligation to provide discovery to the prosecution in such a proceeding, because a probation revocation proceeding is not a criminal trial within the meaning of section 1054.3 governing the scope of the discovery obligations of the defense; and neither the Criminal Discovery Statute, the Constitution of the United States, nor other statutory authority provides for such discovery. Accordingly, we grant Jones\u2019s petition and direct the trial court to vacate its order requiring the defense to provide discovery to the prosecution in the probation revocation hearing in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its order of June 9, 2003, and to enter a new and different order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">McDonald, J., and McIntyre, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-11\"> See Pipes &amp; Gagen, California Criminal Discovery (3d ed. 2003) section 2:30, page 230 (\u201cNo published California opinion has decided whether the Criminal Discovery Statute applies to probation revocation proceedings\u201d); California Criminal Law: Procedure and Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 6th ed. 2002) Probation Revocations, section 45:17, page 1313 (\u201cThe courts have yet to decide whether, for purposes of the [Criminal Discovery Statute], a revocation hearing is a \u2018trial\u2019 \u201d); 3 Erwin et al., California Criminal Defense Practice (2003) Discovery &amp; Investigation, chapter 70.01[4][e], page 70-15 (rel.47-4/01) (\u201cIt is an open question whether the reciprocal discovery scheme [\u00a7\u00a7 1054\u20141054.7] applies to probation revocation hearings, which arguably are not included within the meaning of \u2018criminal cases,\u2019 as used in the discovery scheme\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-12\"> All further dates refer to calendar year 2003 unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> Bunkers testified on May 29, before Parsons gave her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b75-12\"> As will be seen, the court\u2019s clarification of the June 9 order rendered moot the portion of the prayer in Jones\u2019s petition that requested an order prohibiting the court from requiring him to disclose the names and statements of witnesses the defense has discovered but does not intend to call at the probation revocation hearing.
