(a)), one count of possession of methamphetamine for sale (\u00a7 11378), one count of maintaining a place for the use or sale of methamphetamine (\u00a7 11366), a misdemeanor count of possession of less than an ounce of marijuana (\u00a7 11357, subd. (b)), and one count of sale or transportation of methamphetamine (\u00a7 11379, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on all counts, except for possession of methamphetamine for sale, on which he was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Defendant requested that he be sentenced under Proposition 36. The court denied defendant\u2019s request, suspended imposition of sentence, and placed him on formal probation for three years, conditioned on his serving 180 days in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">I.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Defendant claims the trial court erred in denying his request for the benefits of sentencing under Proposition 36. Under Proposition 36, subject to certain exceptions, \u201cany person convicted of a nonviolent drug possession offense shall receive probation.\u201d (Penal Code, \u00a7 1210.1, subd. (a).) Defendant contends, \u201c[a] violation of section 11366 [opening or maintaining a place for the use or sale of methamphetamine], at least in this case, qualifies as a \u2018nonviolent drug possession offense.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">Section 11366 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who opens or maintains any place for the purpose of unlawfully selling, giving away, or using any [specified] controlled substance . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year or the state prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>A conviction of this offense requires proof of \u201copening\u201d or \u201cmaintaining\u201d a place for a purpose proscribed by the statute. <em>(People v. West </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 595, 612 [91 Cal.Rptr. 385, 477 P.2d 409] [decided under former section 11557].) For that reason, section 11366 is not a lesser offense included in the offense of possession of a controlled substance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Under Penal Code section 1210, subdivision (a), \u201c[t]he term \u2018nonviolent drug possession offense\u2019 means the unlawful personal use, possession for personal use, or transportation for personal use of any controlled substance identified in Section 11054, 11055, 11056, 11057 or 11058 of the Health and Safety Code, or the offense of being under the influence of a controlled substance in violation of Section 11550 of the Health and Safety Code. The term \u2018nonviolent drug possession offense\u2019 does not include the possession for sale, production, or manufacturing of any controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\u201c[T]he purpose of Proposition 36 is \u2018[t]o divert from incarceration into community-based substance abuse treatment programs non-violent defendants, probationers and parolees charged with <em>simple drug possession or drug use offenses.\u2019 </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Esparza </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 691, 695-696 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 377], italics added.) Expressly excluded from the definition of \u201c \u2018non-violent drug possession offenses\u2019 \u201d are drug charges that are commercial in nature, i.e., \u201csale, production, or manufacturing of any controlled substance.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1210, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, he is not \u201cprecisely the type of offender at which Proposition 36 was aimed.\u201d \u201c[T]he ballot argument in favor of Proposition 36 indicates \u2018the initiative was intended to exclude any defendant who was more than a \u2018simple,\u2019 \u2018nonviolent\u2019 drug offender: \u201cProposition 36 . . . only affects those guilty of simple drug possession.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Glasper </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1104, 1114 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 4].) The offense of opening or maintaining a place \u201cfor the purpose of unlawfully selling, giving away, or using any controlled substance\u201d is not a simple possession offense. Rather, it is more like the commercial offenses expressly excluded from the provisions of Proposition 36. Because it is more like a commercial offense than a simple possession offense, we conclude that a defendant convicted of opening or maintaining a place \u201cfor the purpose of unlawfully selling, giving away, or using any controlled substance\u201d is not eligible for Proposition 36 sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Davis, J., and Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 28, 2004.
