The primary issue on appeal is whether the trial court committed prejudicial error by allowing a human resources management expert to opine (hat certain facts in evidence were \u201cindicators\u201d that the Lab discharged Kotla for retaliatory reasons. We hold that the expert\u2019s testimony was improper and prejudicial, and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Dee Kotla had worked for the Lab for 14 years before she was terminated in 1997. At the time of her discharge, she was working as a computer support technician in the Lab\u2019s Administrative Information Systems (AIS) Department, providing network and server maintenance services for the Lab\u2019s Plant Engineering Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Kotla was concerned about gender and departmental pay disparities among Lab employees and had raised that issue in meetings with management. Kotla also became an advocate for a Lab secretary she supervised, Kim Norman, who spoke with Kotla about sexual harassment she was experiencing from a male manager named Charlie Brown. Kotla helped Norman to bring her harassment complaints to the attention of management.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Norman eventually sued the Lab for damages arising from Brown\u2019s sexual harassment (the <em>Norman </em>case). Gabriela Odell was assigned as in-house counsel for the Lab to handle this case. Odell had her paralegal interview several potential witnesses who worked for the Lab, but did not request that Kotla be interviewed. According to Odell, she did not request Kotla to be interviewed because Kotla had no firsthand knowledge pertaining to the <em>Norman </em>case. Norman\u2019s attorney took Kotla\u2019s deposition in December 1996. Odell did not attempt to meet with Kotla before the deposition, and she informed Norman\u2019s counsel at its outset that she was not representing Kotla. Kotla, who had heard that other employees were represented by the Lab counsel at their depositions, was surprised and alarmed to learn this.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Kotla came to the deposition with Robert Fomaciari, a retired lab employee. She testified that Fomaciari was her \u201cpartner,\u201d that he did consulting work for an entity called Spectrum Consulting, and that she did some programming work in connection with that business. Kotla was married and having an affair with Fomaciari at the time. Kotla was bothered by the questions she was being asked about Fomaciari and Spectrum because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>felt they were not relevant to the <em>Norman </em>case and believed an attorney should be representing her. During a break in the deposition, Kotla overheard Odell tell another defense attorney in the women\u2019s restroom, \u201c[I]f Kotla knew what was good for her, she would shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Kotla brought to the deposition three pages of typewritten notes she had made about Brown\u2019s harassment of Norman. She stated that the notes had been prepared contemporaneously as the events occurred and that she had stored them on the Lab computer file server, in a file named \u201cKim.\u201d Kotla was asked at the deposition to provide her computer password so the attorneys present could determine when the notes had been created and modified. Kotla refused to furnish the password without permission from her supervisor. At a break in the deposition, Odell contacted the head of Kotla\u2019s department, David Seibel, to authorize Kotla to disclose her password. Seibel did so. During Odell\u2019s conversation with Seibel she told him that Kotla was a \u201chostile witness.\u201d Odell also expressed concern that the computer files on the server could be modified or deleted. After the call, Seibel had Kotla\u2019s work computers secured and a snapshot taken of the files on Kotla\u2019s computer file server.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Seibel faxed the snapshot to Odell while Kotla\u2019s deposition was still in progress. Odell noticed that the snapshot showed a file folder entitled \u201cSpectrum.\u201d Since Kotla had just testified that she performed work for an outside company called Spectrum Consulting, it occurred to Odell that Kotla might be violating Lab policy by misusing Lab computers for outside work.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The deposition was adjourned for the day when Kotla refused to continue without counsel present to represent her. After the deposition, Odell immediately reported her suspicion about possible computer misuse to the head of the Lab\u2019s Office of Investigative Services (OIS). Lab policy required incidents of computer misuse to be reported to OIS. OIS requested Kotla\u2019s supervisor to remove the office computers she used to a locked room until they could be examined by OIS. OIS arranged for a Lab police officer and a computer security specialist to investigate whether Kotla had used the Lab\u2019s computers to perform work for an outside business. OIS first informed Kotla of the investigation by voicemail message left for her on December 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Kotla, who took a few days off after the deposition, came back to the Lab after hours on December 18. Although OIS had disabled her personal password, she was able to access the computer server using a special administrative password. At 10:51 p.m. on the evening of December 18, Kotla deleted the \u201cSpectrum\u201d files and her other personal files, leaving only the \u201cKim\u201d files on the server. However, copies of the deleted files remained on Kotla\u2019s two office computers, which had been locked up due to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>OIS interviewed Kotla. She admitted using Lab computers to assist Fomaciari, without pay, on three projects. Kotla also admitted deleting the \u201cSpectrum\u201d and other files on December 18. However, she denied being aware of the OIS investigation on that date, and stated that she deleted the files because she was concerned about retaliation for her role in the <em>Norman </em>case and did not want Odell to have access to personal files unrelated to that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">OIS prepared a detailed investigation report which was forwarded to the Lab\u2019s Staff Relations Division (Staff Relations). Beverly Thomas of Staff Relations reviewed Kotla\u2019s telephone records, which showed that Kotla placed 75 telephone calls to Fomaciari from the Lab between June and December 1996. Thomas also reviewed a summary chart showing how the Lab had handled other computer misuse cases. The chart showed that: (1) of eight employees who had downloaded pornography onto Lab computers, seven had received warning letters or short suspensions and one had resigned; (2) two employees who provided non-Lab personnel with user accounts on Lab computers received 20-day suspensions; and (3) four employees who had used Lab computers for outside business had resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The information gathered by OIS was transmitted to Kotla\u2019s manager, David Seibel, who was responsible for recommending to Staff Relations the disciplinary action to be taken. Seibel also reviewed a report prepared by Thomas summarizing Kotla\u2019s telephone records and stating that \u201c[i]n [all] prior computer misuse cases [at the Lab], when outside business activity was an issue, employees were dismissed.\u201d Before finalizing his decision, Seibel spoke with Kotla by telephone to explain his view of the serious nature of the charges in the OIS report and to get her reaction to them. According to Seibel, Kotla did not explain or apologize for her actions. Kotla stated that Seibel did the talking in that telephone conversation and did not give her an opportunity to explain her side of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">A few days after speaking with Kotla, Seibel wrote to Robert Perko, head of Staff Relations, recommending Kotla\u2019s dismissal. Seibel\u2019s letter cited the following facts: \u201cMs. Kotla has admitted that she used [the Lab] computer assigned to her to do work for a private firm. Evidence also strongly suggests that she used [the Lab] telephone assigned to her to conduct work for this firm. Ms. Kotla also, during off working hours, removed files from her computer system which were relevant to the investigation of this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Perko concurred in Seibel\u2019s recommendation, and notified Kotla in writing of the Lab\u2019s intent to dismiss her from employment on February 20, 1997 based on her \u201cmisuse of government property and breach of ethical standards of honesty, integrity and trust.\u201d She was afforded an opportunity to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>decision, which she did in writing through a representative on April 4, 1997. Perko notified Kotla of her dismissal on April 15, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Kotla sued the Lab and proceeded to trial on the theory that her termination violated the antiretaliation provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Government Code section 12940 et seq. After seven days of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict for Kotla, nine jurors voting in favor, for $325,000 in economic damages and $675,000 in emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Following entry of judgment, the Lab moved for a new trial on the ground, in part, that the jurors committed misconduct by agreeing to augment the verdict to include attorney fees. The trial court ordered a new trial as to damages only unless Kotla consented to a remittitur of the noneconomic damages award from $675,000 to $420,000. Kotla consented to the remittitur. The Lab timely appealed from the ensuing judgment (case No. A099228) and Kotla cross-appealed from the order granting a new trial on damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Lab also appeals from a separate postjudgment order awarding attorney fees to Kotla (case No. A100918). We have consolidated the two appeals for briefing, argument, and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">I. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The Lab contends the trial court erred in permitting Kotla\u2019s human resources management expert to testify that: (1) certain predischarge events were \u201cindicators\u201d of the Lab\u2019s retaliatory motive in discharging Kotla; (2) his opinions were based in part on a detailed comparative analysis of previous computer misuse cases at the Lab that the trial court had ruled were irrelevant and inadmissible; and (3) the Lab should have conducted a more thorough investigation of Kotla\u2019s retaliation claim and should have selected a more appropriate level of discipline for her admitted computer misuse. We agree, in part, with the Lab\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Kotla\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Jay Finkelman, holds a Ph.D. in industrial psychology. His professional background included service as an in-house supervisor and outside consultant to many corporate human resources departments. In those capacities, he oversaw or personally conducted investigations of retaliation, discrimination, and harassment complaints. Dr. Finkelman also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>taught industrial psychology and human resources as a tenured and adjunct university professor, including courses on handling retaliation complaints, and has published widely on human resources issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">A. <em>Retaliation Opinions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The Lab moved in limine to preclude Dr. Finkelman from offering an opinion that Kotla\u2019s termination was retaliatory, arguing such testimony would not assist the jury and would supplant the jury\u2019s role as fact finder. The trial court ruled Dr. Finkelman could not testify about the \u201cultimate issue\u201d of whether the Lab retaliated against Kotla. However, just before calling Dr. Finkelman to the stand, Kotla sought a determination that this ruling did not preclude the expert from testifying that certain facts in evidence were \u201cindications\u201d or \u201cevidence\u201d of a retaliatory motive on the Lab\u2019s part. Although observing there was a \u201cvery fine line\u201d between Dr. Finkelman\u2019s proposed testimony and the type of opinion testimony barred by its earlier ruling, the trial court allowed Kotla to proceed with the testimony, reserving its discretion to sustain objections to specific questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Over the Lab\u2019s objections, Dr. Finkelman was allowed to testify about the significance of various facts in evidence as follows; (1) the Lab counsel\u2019s failure to interview Kotla in connection with the <em>Norman </em>case \u201cis indicative of [an employer] who is trying to either avoid or mislead, in my opinion, as to what that testimony is going to be\u201d; (2) the <em>Norman </em>case was important in establishing evidence of retaliation because Kotla had information the Lab \u201cperceived to be very detrimental\u201d and \u201canything that they [could] do to somehow undermine that testimony would be to their advantage\u201d; (3) evidence that Kotla was an \u201cinstigator\u201d of Norman\u2019s sexual harassment complaint and of potential future claims \u201cwould be a main reason . . . indicative of retaliation . . . would [be] a reason that there would have been a motivation to retaliate\u201d; (4) the manner in which information Kotla provided in the <em>Norman </em>lawsuit was turned against her is further potential evidence of retaliation; (5) Odell\u2019s statement to Seibel that Kotla was a \u201chostile witness\u201d at her deposition was \u201c[c]ritically important\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d in indicating \u201cthe intent of . . . laboratory counsel who has the role to protect all parties, now creating a separation of who is the bad guy and who is with us and who is not\u201d; (6) Odell\u2019s comment during a break in the deposition that \u201cif [Kotla] knows what\u2019s good for her, she will keep her mouth shut,\u201d was \u201cself-explanatory\u201d as evidence of retaliation; (7) since Kotla\u2019s penalty was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u201cexcessive for the nature of the offense,\u201d retaliation would be \u201ca very obvious motive\u201d; (8) a comment by one investigator classifying Kotla\u2019s computer misuse as a relatively low-level infraction of Lab policies was an \u201cextremely important\u201d indicator of retaliation in light of her eventual punishment; and (9) the Lab\u2019s failure to investigate Kotla\u2019s concern about retaliation is an extremely important factor buttressing Dr. Finkelman\u2019s opinion that there was \u201cevidence of retaliation in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We find this testimony was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 801. Section 801 limits permissible opinion evidence in pertinent part as follows: \u201cIf a witness is testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to such an opinion as is: [][] (a) Related to a subject that is <em>sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact, </em>and [f] (b) Based on matter . . . that is of a type <em>that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In our view, Dr. Finkelman\u2019s testimony satisfied neither requirement of Evidence Code section 801. It improperly invaded the province of the jury to draw conclusions from the evidence and it lacked any reliable foundation in Dr. Finkelman\u2019s professional experience and expertise. The trial court implicitly recognized this when it barred Dr. Finkelman from opining in a direct fashion that the Lab had acted out of a retaliatory motive. Unfortunately, by thereafter allowing Dr. Finkelman to testify that certain facts in evidence were \u201cindicators\u201d of retaliation, the court substantially undercut its earlier ruling and abused its discretion. This error was compounded by jury instructions that, in effect, encouraged jurors to give unwarranted weight to Dr. Finkelman\u2019s view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Expert opinion should be excluded \u201c \u2018when \u201cthe subject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of ordinary education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. McAlpin </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1289, 1300 [283 Cal.Rptr. 382, 812 P.2d 563], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 351, 367 [208 Cal.Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709].) A trial court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24, 39 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240].) \u201cHowever, the discretion to admit or exclude evidence is not unlimited. \u2018The discretion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>trial judge is not a whimsical, uncontrolled power, but a legal discretion, which is subject to the limitations of legal principles governing the subject of its action, and to reversal on appeal where no reasonable basis for the action is shown. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Korsak </em>v. <em>Atlas Hotels, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1516, 1523 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 833].) \u201c[T]he courts have the obligation to contain expert testimony within the area of the professed expertise, and to require adequate foundation for the opinion.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The parties have cited no California case involving the admissibility of testimony like that given by Dr. Finkelman in this case. However, a number of federal circuit and district court cases have discussed similar testimony in the employment context, and most have rejected it. (See <em>Curtis v. Oklahoma City Public Schools Bd. </em>(10th Cir. 1998) 147 F.3d 1200, 1219 [jury could determine for itself whether recruitment plan was evidence of retaliation]; <em>Barfield v. Orange County </em>(11th Cir. 1990) 911 F.2d 644, 651, fn. 8 [opinion testimony about whether plaintiff was a victim of discrimination would not assist the trier of fact]; <em>Ward v. Westland Plastics, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 651 F.2d 1266, 1270-1271 [question whether gender was the basis of differential treatment is not so technical as to require the aid of an expert]; <em>Brink </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1997) 41 F.Supp.2d 402, 405 [age discrimination claim can be evaluated and understood by jury without assistance of a human resources expert]; <em>Smith v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co. </em>(D.Colo. 1992) 794 F.Supp. 1035, 1044 [expert testimony that employer substantially motivated by discriminatory bias improperly circumvents fact finder\u2019s decisionmaking process]; <em>Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico </em>(D.P.R. 1990) 740 F.Supp. 921, 925 [opinion testimony as to whether hostile work environment existed usurps the prerogative of the jury as the fact finder]; cf. <em>Green v. Kinney Shoe Corp. </em>(D.D.C. 1989) 715 F.Supp. 1122, 1123-1124 [court should exercise special caution in admitting expert testimony on the issue of evaluating an employer\u2019s motivations in discrimination cases].)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Kotla cites two employment cases from other jurisdictions upholding the trial court\u2019s discretion to admit the testimony of a human resources expert under circumstances comparable to those presented here: <em>Davis v. Combustion Engineering, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1984) 742 F.2d 916 <em>(Davis) </em>and <em>Texas Dept, of Human Services v. Green </em>(Tex.App. 1993) 855 S.W.2d 136 <em>(Green). </em>We find neither case persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The trial court in <em>Davis </em>had permitted a personnel management expert to testify that, based on his review of plaintiff\u2019s employment records, plaintiff\u2019s discharge was the result of age discrimination and could not be explained by other factors. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>742 F.2d at p. 918.) The appellate court held that the trial court\u2019s action \u201cwas not clearly erroneous, given the broad [federal] standards\u201d of whether such opinion testimony would assist the trier of fact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>(Id. </em>at p. 919.) Significantly, the jury in <em>Davis </em>had been instructed that it could \u201c \u2018totally disregard\u2019 \u201d the expert\u2019s opinions if it found them unsound for any reason. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 920.) The court considered this an important factor in ameliorating any prejudice from the improper admission of opinion testimony. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The jury instructions used in this case, based on BAJI No. 2.40, in no way ameliorated the risk of improper expert opinion and may have actually compounded it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In <em>Green, </em>a Texas appellate panel upheld the admissibility of expert testimony that the defendant\u2019s cumulative acts constituted retaliation, but offered little supporting analysis. <em>(Green, supra, </em>855 S.W.2d at pp. 149-150.) The court gave no apparent consideration to the risk that jurors would lend undue weight to such testimony. <em>Green </em>is not persuasive authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We hold that Dr. Finkelman\u2019s testimony and opinions about the significance of the evidence did not assist the jury in its factfinding process. Instead, that testimony created an unacceptable risk that the jury paid unwarranted deference to Dr. Finkelman\u2019s purported expertise when in reality he was in no better position than they were to evaluate the evidence concerning retaliation. Absent unusual facts, it must be presumed that jurors are capable of deciding a party\u2019s motive for themselves without being told by an expert which finding on that issue the evidence supports.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Moreover, in the context of employment litigation, motive must be inferred from a <em>unique </em>constellation of facts that are subject to conflicting interpretations. However experienced Dr. Finkelman is in his field, it is extremely unlikely if not impossible that he has previously encountered circumstances duplicating those that gave rise to this litigation. Certainly, no foundation was established at trial that Dr. Finkelman had so frequently observed employers exploiting information about computer misuse uncovered during employee depositions as pretexts for retaliation that he could confidently apply the same explanation to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Nor did Dr. Finkelman testify that there is some general formula, framework, or theory utilized specially by human resources experts, that allows motive to be calculated from any given set of circumstances. In fact, we find no basis in the record for believing that Dr. Finkelman possessed any special expertise for weighing the evidence of motive in a wrongful termination case. That is the jury\u2019s function, assisted by the trial court\u2019s instructions and the arguments of counsel. Dr. Finkelman\u2019s opinions about the evidence in this case did not offer the jury anything \u201cmore than the lawyers can offer in argument.\u201d <em>(In re Air Crash Disaster at New Orleans, La. </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 795 F.2d 1230, 1233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in permitting Dr. Finkelman to offer opinion testimony about whether certain facts were \u201cindicators\u201d of a retaliatory motive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">B. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We find it reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the Lab would have been reached in the absence of the error. <em>(Seaman\u2019s Direct Buying Service, Inc. v. Standard Oil Co. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 752, 770 [206 Cal.Rptr. 354, 686 R2d 1158], overruled on another ground in <em>Freeman &amp; Mills, Inc. </em>v. <em>Belcher Oil Co. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 85, 87 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 420, 900 P.2d 669].) This was a close case. Although there was evidence from which retaliation could be inferred, there was also evidence of a plausible nonretaliatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision to discharge Kotla. Kotla admitted that she misused a government computer, and admitted returning to the Lab after hours to erase computer files that provided evidence of her misuse. As a government contractor performing highly classified work, the Lab has a heightened need to ensure the loyalty and integrity of its employees. After hearing the evidence for and against plaintiff\u2019s retaliation theory, the jury deliberated for seven days before mustering the minimum number of votes required to reach a verdict in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">On this record, it appears likely that Dr. Finkelman\u2019s testimony played a decisive role in the jury\u2019s verdict. In his closing argument, Kotla\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>took the jury point by point through all of the facts that Finkelman deemed to be indicative of retaliation, using demonstrative blow-ups of the key passages. Counsel called the testimony \u201cvery powerful\u201d and emphasized that it was the uncontradicted testimony of an expert in the field. The jury instructions given on the weighing of expert testimony encouraged the jury to pay special deference to uncontradicted expert testimony. This further reinforced the potential impact of Dr. Finkelman\u2019s improper opinion testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On the record before us, we find it reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a verdict more favorable to the Lab had proper limits been placed on Dr. Finkelman\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">II. Permission Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Over the Lab\u2019s objection, Kotla testified that her immediate supervisor had once given her permission to copy two disks for Fomaciari on the Lab computer. Kotla used this evidence to argue that she had permission to do what she was fired for doing, and therefore must have been terminated for reasons other than those offered by the Lab. The Lab argued unsuccessfully that the asserted permission was irrelevant to prove a retaliatory motive unless the managers who participated in the decision to discharge Kotla were aware of the claim and failed to investigate or consider it before discharging her. The Lab pointed out that despite the many opportunities Kotla had to explain or mitigate her apparent violation of company computer policies during the investigation leading to her dismissal, she in fact never asserted that she had permission from her supervisor to perform outside work.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We agree with the Lab\u2019s position. Absent a showing that the claimed permission came to the attention of Mr. Seibel or Mr. Perko before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>decision was made to dismiss Kotla, it was error to permit evidence of it. The controlling issue in this case was the state of mind of these decision makers. Facts unknown to them are not logically relevant to establishing their state of mind, either directly or by any chain of inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The trial court\u2019s error in permitting evidence of Kotla\u2019s claimed permission compounded the prejudice created by Dr. Finkelman\u2019s improper opinion testimony. Kotla\u2019s counsel repeatedly reminded the jury of the permission testimony in his closing argument, and the jury asked to have that testimony read back during its deliberations. In view of the length of the deliberations, the closeness of the jury\u2019s vote on liability, and the jury\u2019s interest in this issue, we cannot discount the possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict but for the \u201cpermission\u201d testimony.  In any event, we hold that the cumulative effect of this testimony in combination with Dr. Finkelman\u2019s improper opinion testimony was certainly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">III. Evidence of Comparable Cases<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Stein, Acting R J., and Swager, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> Kotla\u2019s notice of cross-appeal also includes a protective cross-appeal from the judgment in relation to certain interim orders. However, Kotla has waived its purported protective cross-appeal by offering no argument in support of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> Kotla\u2019s counsel did not ask the trial court on the record to qualify Dr. Finkelman as an expert in any defined subject area. However, the Lab raised no objection to Finkelman\u2019s qualifications in the trial court. We therefore assume for purposes of our analysis that Dr. Finkelman was properly qualified as an expert in the fields of human resources management and industrial psychology.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> In addition, Kotla\u2019s trial counsel asked Dr. Finkelman why he believed Odell\u2019s action in reporting the Spectrum files to OIS was evidence of retaliation. Although the Lab successfully moved to strike Dr. Finkelman\u2019s response, the jury first heard him testify as follows: \u201cIt would be rather extraordinary if there were any motivation other than retaliation ... in the middle of a totally different matter to decide to do a criminal investigation of something that\u2019s on her computers that appears to be rather innocuous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> The jury was instructed in pertinent part as follows: \u201cYou are not bound by an opinion. Give each opinion the weight you find it deserves. <em>However, you may not arbitrarily or unreasonably disregard the expert opinion testimony in this case which was uncontradicted. Therefore, unless you find it is not believable, it is conclusive and binding on you.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"> Kotla also cites <em>Colgan </em>v. <em>Fisher Scientific Co. </em>(3rd. Cir. 1991) 935 F.2d 1407, and <em>Crenshaw v. Bozeman Deaconess Hosp. </em>(1984) 213 Mont. 488 [693 P.2d 487]. The issue in <em>Colgan </em>was whether the plaintiff presented enough evidence to overcome a summary judgment motion, not whether expert opinion testimony that the plaintiff had suffered discrimination was admissible in a jury trial. <em>Crenshaw </em>is also distinguishable. The challenged testimony in that case concerned whether the employer had followed proper personnel standards in discharging plaintiff. That issue was directly relevant to one of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action in <em>Crenshaw </em>and falls well within the professional expertise of a personnel management expert. Neither <em>Colgan </em>nor <em>Crenshaw </em>is germane to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\"> We fashion no general rule here precluding the use of human resources experts in employment cases. We are concerned solely with Dr. Finkelman\u2019s testimony that the facts in evidence were indicators of or had a tendency to show retaliation. Expert testimony on predicate issues within the expertise of a human resources expert is clearly permissible. For example, evidence showing (or negating) that an employee\u2019s discharge was grossly disproportionate to punishments meted out to similarly situated employees, or that the employer significantly deviated from its ordinary personnel procedures in the aggrieved employee\u2019s case, might well be relevant to support (or negate) an inference of retaliation. Opinion testimony on these subjects by a qualified expert on human resources management might well assist the jury in its factfinding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> Kotla\u2019s appellate counsel pointed out at oral argument that the Lab proposed the wording of this instruction. Although the record is not entirely clear on that point, the source of the language is immaterial. Neither party claims the instruction was erroneous. Its significance is that it is a relevant factor in evaluating whether the trial court\u2019s error in admitting Dr. Finkelman\u2019s testimony was likely to have influenced the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> The Lab also argues the trial court should have excluded Finkelman\u2019s opinions about whether the Lab could have \u201cmore appropriately\u201d investigated and disciplined Kotla. The Lab maintains, and we agree, that neither the propriety of the Lab\u2019s disciplinary processes nor the wisdom of its decision were in issue. For the guidance of the trial court in any retrial of this case, opinion testimony on these subjects should be carefully monitored and appropriate limiting instructions given. Opinion testimony that the Lab materially deviated from its own standards and practices in Kotla\u2019s case is fair game because such evidence would support an inference of retaliation. But evidence that the Lab could have done a better investigation or decided on a fairer punishment supports no such inference, has no other legal relevance in a retaliation case, and poses a risk of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\"> Kotla\u2019s supervisor testified that he gave her permission to copy two disks for a friend, not to use Lab computers in furtherance of an outside business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> Due to this disposition of the case, Kotla\u2019s cross-appeal from the trial court\u2019s conditional order denying a new trial and the Lab\u2019s appeal from the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees are dismissed as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 283.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
