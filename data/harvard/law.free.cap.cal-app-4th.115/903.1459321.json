She also asserts her due process rights were violated when the court appointed a guardian ad litem for her without proper notice. Although we conclude Leticia was improperly served and the court should not have appointed a guardian ad litem without affording Leticia the opportunity to be heard on the issue of the appointment, both errors are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Leticia is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic. She was supposed to treat her schizophrenia by taking a daily oral medication and a monthly injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">By June 2003, Leticia had not refilled the prescription for her oral medication since December 2002 and had not received her injection since April 2003. Later in June, she refused to allow family members into her home to see Daniel, who was then nine months old. Although it is not clear from the record, her refusal to let anyone see Daniel for more than one week apparently caused family members to seek assistance from the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (the Agency) or the police. Leticia was placed on a section 5150<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hold because she was considered a danger to herself and others, and Daniel was placed in protective custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">A social worker attempted to speak to Leticia at the hospital about Daniel\u2019s removal, but Leticia\u2019s doctor would not let her do so because he believed it would be detrimental to Leticia\u2019s mental health. The doctor also would not allow Leticia to appear at the detention hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">In mid-July, the social worker was allowed to speak with Leticia. However, she was cautioned that Leticia was not \u201cprocessing anything,\u201d and was \u201cvery angry, very agitated[,] and aggressive.\u201d Three days later, when the social worker attempted to see Leticia in person, hospital personnel said Leticia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>mental health remained unstable and she was still not \u201cprocessing anything.\u201d Consequently, the social worker contacted Leticia by telephone and advised her of the upcoming jurisdictional and dispositional hearing. Leticia wrote down the place, date, and time of the upcoming hearing, but was very incoherent and agitated. As a result, the social worker terminated the telephone call because she believed Leticia did not comprehend its purpose. Hospital personnel also told the social worker that Leticia would not be allowed to attend the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing if she remained in the intensive care unit, because she was \u201ctoo much of a risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In late July, the court appointed a guardian ad litem for Leticia and continued the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing to allow him an opportunity to speak with her at the hospital. At the August jurisdictional and dispositional hearing, the guardian ad litem and counsel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeared on Leticia\u2019s behalf. Counsel presented no evidence on Leticia\u2019s behalf and submitted at the hearing. The court made a true finding on the petition and ordered reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">DISCUSSION I. NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Leticia contends the jurisdictional and dispositional order must be reversed because she was not properly noticed and consequently, the court never obtained jurisdiction over her. She also asserts the court erred when it appointed a guardian ad litem without notice to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Because the interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children is a compelling one, before depriving a parent of this interest, the state must afford him or her adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>(In re Emily R. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1351 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 285].) Notice must be reasonably calculated to apprise the parent of the pendency of the action and afford him or her an opportunity to present any objections. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">A. <em>Notice of the Detention Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Leticia argues she did not receive proper notice of the detention hearing. Under section 290.1, once a social worker determines a child shall be \u201cretained in custody,\u201d he or she must file a dependency petition and serve notice of the hearing to, among others, the mother of the child. (\u00a7 290.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>subd. (a)(1).) Notice may be written or oral, but must be given as soon as possible after the filing of the petition. (\u00a7 290.1, subds. (c), (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Here, the social worker attempted to speak with Leticia about Daniel\u2019s removal the same day she signed the petition, presumably to serve her with notice of the detention hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, Leticia\u2019s physician refused to let the social worker speak with Leticia or, we assume, to leave a copy of the petition, because it would be detrimental to Leticia\u2019s health. Because the social worker attempted to serve notice but was prevented from doing so by Leticia\u2019s physician, there was no due process violation when Leticia did not receive notice of the detention hearing. (See, e.g., <em>McKenzie v. City of Thousand Oaks </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 426, 430 [111 Cal.Rptr. 584] [compliance with procedural statute may be excused when it is \u201cimpracticable, impossible!,] or futile\u201d to comply].)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">B. <em>Notice of the Jurisdictional and Dispositional Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Leticia contends she did not receive proper notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing because the notice was sent to her home, even though the court and the Agency knew she was in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Under the Welfare and Institutions Code, Leticia must receive notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing. (\u00a7 291, subd. (a)(1).) Because Daniel was detained and Leticia was not present at the detention hearing, she had to be noticed either by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. (\u00a7 291, subd. (e)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Here, the social worker did not personally serve Leticia. Although she attempted to see Leticia, presumably to serve her, she was told that Leticia was not processing anything and was angry and agitated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the record does not indicate hospital staff prevented the social worker from seeing Leticia, we infer the social worker did not believe doing so was useful or practical, thereby rendering personal service impossible. The only attempt to serve Leticia by mail was when the court sent her a copy of the minute order from the detention hearing by certified mail. However, this minute order was sent to Leticia at her home address, not at the hospital, even though the record clearly showed Leticia was at the hospital. Leticia, citing to <em>In re Arlyne A. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 591 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 109] and <em>David B. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1010 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 586], asserts this service was insufficient because the Agency and the court knew she was hospitalized and not at home. Neither case aids our analysis because neither addresses service to a person who has a mental illness that renders him or her incapable of comprehending notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The issue presented here is whether Leticia\u2019s significant mental illness eliminated the duty to provide notice to Leticia at her actual location. We believe the court and the Agency did not have to serve Leticia with notice, given her mental state, but had to provide Leticia\u2019s temporary conservator<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with notice of the proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In drawing this conclusion, we are guided by Code of Civil Procedure section 416.70, which addresses service of summons on a conservatee. We recognize dependency proceedings are special proceedings governed by their own rules and statutes. (\u00a7 300 et seq.; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1440 et seq.) We also recognize rules applicable to civil cases are not applicable to dependency actions unless expressly made so <em>(In re Angela R. </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 257, 273 [260 Cal.Rptr. 612]; <em>In re Jennifer R. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 704, 711 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 759]), and there is no provision in the Welfare and Institutions Code adopting Code of Civil Procedure section 416.70. However, because that section is the only legislative provision we have located on the subject of service to an incompetent person for whom a conservator has been appointed, we appropriately look to it for guidance. (See <em>Williams v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 352 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 882, 852 P.2d 377].)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 416.70 provides: \u201cA summons may be served on a person (other than a minor) for whom a guardian, conservator, or similar fiduciary has been appointed by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to his guardian, conservator, or similar fiduciary and to such person, but, for good cause shown, the court in which the action is pending may dispense with delivery to such person.\u201d Here, Leticia\u2019s mental state constituted sufficient good cause to dispense with delivery to her. However, because she had a temporary conservator, service should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>made on that person. Accordingly, Leticia was not properly notified of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">C. <em>Notice To Appoint the Guardian Ad Litem</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Leticia asserts the court violated her due process rights by appointing a guardian ad litem without notice to her. She also asserts the court could not properly appoint a guardian ad litem until she . was properly served with notice of the dependency petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">In any proceeding in which an incompetent person is a party, that person shall appear by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action is pending. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 372.) The appointment of a guardian ad litem for a parent in a dependency proceeding is significant because the effect of such an appointment is to remove the control of litigation from the parent. <em>(In re Jessica G. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1186-1187 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].) Consequently, the parent\u2019s due process rights must be protected before a guardian ad litem is appointed. <em>(In re Sara D. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 661, 667-668 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 909].) Those rights are satisfied if the parent consents to the appointment of a guardian ad litem or, if the parent does not consent, the court holds an informal hearing in which the parent has an opportunity to explain why a guardian ad litem is not required. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 668, 671.) Further, the court may not appoint a guardian ad litem until the party has been properly served. <em>(Briggs v. Briggs </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 312, 318 [325 P.2d 219].)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">There is no evidence Leticia consented to the court\u2019s appointment of a guardian ad litem or was allowed an opportunity to state her position about the appointment of a guardian ad litem for her. Further, as discussed above, Leticia was not properly served with a copy of the petition. Thus, the court should not have appointed a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">II. PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Having concluded Leticia was not properly notified of either the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing or the hearing to appoint a guardian ad litem and the guardian ad litem was improperly appointed, we turn to the question of whether these orders warrant reversal. Errors in notice do not automatically require reversal. <em>(In re Angela C. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 389, 393-394 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 922].) We review such errors to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>they are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 392-395; <em>In re Sara D., supra, 87 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 673.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The failure to notice Leticia about the hearing to appoint a guardian ad litem is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. A guardian ad litem is appropriate when a parent is unable to understand the consequences of the proceeding and is unable to assist in the preparation of his or her case. <em>(In re Jessica G., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1186.) Although Leticia argues reversal is required because there is no evidence she was unable to cooperate with her attorney, the record does not support her contention. At the time of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing, Leticia was unable to \u201cprocess anything.\u201d She was agitated, angry, aggressive, and unstable, despite being on medication. She was in intensive care and was not allowed to attend the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing because she was \u201ctoo much of a risk.\u201d She was unable to comprehend what the social worker was telling her during a telephone call one month before the hearing. This call occurred five days before the court appointed the guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Moreover, the court could not delay holding the hearings to appoint the guardian ad litem or to determine whether Daniel was a person described by section 300 and should be removed from Leticia\u2019s care for an unlimited time. (See, e.g., <em>D.E. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 502, 513 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 10].) Time is of the essence in dependency matters <em>(In re O.S. </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1409 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 571]), because childhood does not wait for the parent to become adequate <em>(In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 310 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826]). Further, children in protective custody have an interest in the prompt resolution of their custody status. <em>(D.E. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th at p. 513.) Once the petition is filed, a detention hearing must be held no later than the expiration of the next judicial day. (\u00a7 315.) After the child is detained, the court must hold a jurisdictional hearing within 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>judicial days of the detention hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (\u00a7 334.) The dispositional hearing may not be held more than 60 days after the detention hearing unless exceptional circumstances exist and may not, under any circumstances, be held more than six months after the detention hearing. (\u00a7 352, subd. (b).) Given these strict time lines, neither the court nor the Agency could wait for an indefinite period of time for Leticia to sufficiently regain her mental faculties to be able to appreciate notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing or the hearing to appoint a guardian ad litem. (See <em>In re Christina B., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1451, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The error in not providing notice to Leticia\u2019s temporary conservator, which voided the appointment of the guardian ad litem <em>(Weisfeld </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 110 Cal.App.2d 148, 152 [242 P.2d 29]), is also harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the result of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing would have been the same regardless of whether proper notice was given or whether a guardian ad litem was appointed. There was simply no defense to the petition and no alternative but to remove Daniel from Leticia\u2019s care. The Agency filed a section 300 petition on Daniel\u2019s behalf because Leticia had a mental illness, was not taking her medication, and had been hospitalized because she was a danger to herself and others. Each of these assertions was borne out by the record. Further, Leticia had refused to let family members check on Daniel\u2019s welfare for more than one week. At the time of the jurisdictional hearing, she was still hospitalized and could not care for herself or anyone else. She was not \u201cprocessing anything,\u201d and was agitated, aggressive, and angry. She was not stabilizing on her medication. Because there was no defense to the allegations in the petition and no option but to remove Daniel from her care, the jurisdictional and dispositional findings would have been the same regardless of whether Leticia received notice or whether a guardian ad litem was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Leticia argues the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because neither her attorney nor her guardian ad litem had the authority to submit the matter at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing without a benefit to her.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A guardian ad litem may not compromise the parent\u2019s fundamental rights, including the right to trial, without some benefit to the parent. <em>(In re Christina B., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>There is at least one reason Leticia would benefit by submission. At the hearing, the court ordered reunification services. Had Leticia contested jurisdiction, the court might have inquired whether Leticia\u2019s mental disability fell under the description in Family Code section 7826,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which could have provided the court a basis to deny Leticia services under section 361.5, subdivision (b)(2). Thus, submitting served a useful tactical purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In addition, the guardian ad litem may have received permission from Leticia to submit. Although Leticia implies he never spoke with her, the court continued the jurisdictional hearing, presumably at the guardian ad litem\u2019s request, so that he could speak with her. Because he sought no further continuances, we assume, in the absence of any information in the record to the contrary, he spoke with her. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.) He did not request a hearing; therefore we assume Leticia either consented to waive her right to a hearing or the guardian ad litem believed waiving the hearing was in Leticia\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Leticia also argues the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because even though she was represented, there is no evidence her attorney spoke with her and she did not authorize the attorney to take a position on her behalf. An attorney has a duty to speak with his or her client. <em>(In re O.S., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 1410; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd. (m).) However, in the absence of any evidence in the record to the contrary, we assume the attorney discharged his duty and spoke with Leticia. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.) Moreover, once the guardian ad litem was appointed, the attorney would have been in communication with him, not Leticia.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Leticia also asserts the court did not have \u201cin personam\u201d jurisdiction over her by appointing a guardian ad litem. We assume Leticia meant to argue the court had no personal jurisdiction over her because \u201cin personam\u201d jurisdiction is a concept that allows a court to have jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant in a civil matter based on that person\u2019s contact with the state. (See <em>Great-West Life Assurance Co. v. Guarantee Co. of North America </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 199, 204, 205 [252 Cal.Rptr. 363].) Leticia is neither an out-of-state resident nor a defendant in a civil matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Regardless, to the extent Leticia is arguing the court had to take personal jurisdiction over her to proceed with the dependency proceedings, she is mistaken. The court does not take jurisdiction over the parent; it takes jurisdiction over the child.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (\u00a7 300.) Personal jurisdiction over a parent in dependency proceedings is obtained when the parent is properly noticed, because notice gives the parent the choice whether to appear in the dependency proceeding. <em>(David B. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 1016; <em>In re O.S., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 1408.) Although the notice to Leticia was improper, as discussed above, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Benke, Acting P.
