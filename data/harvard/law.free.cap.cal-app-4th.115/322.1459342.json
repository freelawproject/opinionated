J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABR\">Agnes Bernardo, Pamela Colip and Saundra Dufify-Hawkins (collectively, Bernardo) brought suit for injunctive relief against Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties (PPSDRC) (together Planned Parenthood) under California\u2019s unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) and false advertising law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500 et seq.). Bernardo alleged that PPFA\u2019s and PPSDRC\u2019s Internet Web sites (&lt;http://www.plannedparenthood.org.html&gt; and &lt;http://www.planned.org.html&gt;, respectively) contained \u201cunlawful, unfair, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>confusing, and misleading statements/advertisements\u201d that caused women to make critical health care decisions without full, complete, and accurate information about (1) the safety of abortion, (2) the safety of abortion vis-a-vis childbirth, and (3) the scientific/medical literature that Bernardo claims establishes a link between induced abortion and breast cancer (hereafter sometimes referred to as the ABC link).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Bernardo sought two types of injunctive relief: (1) an injunction restraining Planned Parenthood from publishing its statements that abortion is safe or safer than childbirth and its position that the weight of credible medical research has failed to establish a link between induced abortion and breast cancer; and (2) a mandatory injunction requiring Planned Parenthood to provide to all of its former and prospective abortion patients information supporting Bernardo\u2019s position that medical research has established the existence of the claimed ABC link.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Planned Parenthood filed a special motion to strike Bernardo\u2019s complaint under Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 425.16, California\u2019s anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) statute (hereafter referred to as section 425.16 or the anti-SLAPP statute), which was specifically enacted to provide both a summary disposition and mandatory attorney fees and costs to prevailing defendants in such actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Planned Parenthood argued that Bernardo\u2019s action was a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) prohibited by California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The court found that Bernardo\u2019s lawsuit was a SLAPP, granted Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion, and dismissed the action. The court awarded reasonable attorney fees to Planned Parenthood in the amount of $77,835.25 under the mandatory attorney fees provision of section 425.16, subdivision (c) (hereafter section 425.16(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Bernardo has filed two appeals, which have been consolidated for purposes of disposition. In case No. D040186, Bernardo appeals the court\u2019s order dismissing her action as a SLAPP under section 425.16. Bernardo contends that Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site statements constitute commercial speech that may properly be regulated under Business and Professions Code sections 7200 and 17500 and that the court erred when it granted Planned Parenthood\u2019s section 425.16 motion to strike because it failed to properly apply the \u201cminimal merit\u201d screening standard provided by the anti-SLAPP statute. In the alternative, Bernardo contends that if the court correctly applied section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>425.16, that statute is unconstitutional because (1) it impermissibly chills Bernardo\u2019s First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances, which encompasses the right to access the courts by filing litigation, and (2) it violates Bernardo\u2019s due process rights because \u201cthe \u2018reasonable probability of success on the merits\u2019 standard [under section 425.16] is meaningless in practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">In her second appeal, case No. D040866, Bernardo seeks reversal of the court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees to Planned Parenthood in the amount of $77,835.25 under section 425.16(c). Bernardo contends that section 425.16(c) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, asserting the attorney fees award levied against her is a \u201cfine,\u201d a \u201cdraconian penalty\u201d or \u201cstrict liability penalty,\u201d and an \u201citem of damages\u201d that violates her constitutional rights to petition the government for redress of grievances and to access the courts by filing litigation, as well as her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws. We reject all of Bernardo\u2019s contentions. Accordingly, we affirm the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AQr\">A. <em>PPFA and PPSDRC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">PPFA is a national nonprofit charitable organization. According to its published mission statement, PPFA believes in \u201cthe fundamental right of each individual ... to manage his or her fertility.\u201d It also believes in voluntary \u201creproductive self-determination,\u201d and preservation of an individual\u2019s right to privacy. Based on these beliefs, PPFA\u2019s mission is to (1) \u201cprovide comprehensive reproductive and complementary health care services in settings which preserve and protect the essential privacy and rights of each individual\u201d; (2) \u201cadvocate public policies which guarantee these rights and ensure access to such services\u201d; (3) \u201cprovide educational programs which enhance understanding of individual and social implications of human sexuality\u201d; and (4) \u201cpromote research and the advancement of technology in reproductive health care and encourage understanding of their inherent bioethical, behavioral, and social implications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">PPFA has also published numerous policy statements indicating that it is the policy of PPFA to \u201cassure that all individuals have the freedom to make reproductive decisions\u201d; to promote \u201caccess to information and services related to sexuality, reproduction, methods of contraception, fertility control, and parenthood\u201d; \u201censure that women have the right to seek and obtain medically safe, legal abortions under dignified conditions and at reasonable cost\u201d; provide \u201cinformation on the nature, consequences, and risks of the [abortion] procedure, and counseling on the alternatives available to women, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>so as to assure an informed and responsible decision concerning the continuation or termination of pregnancy\u201d; \u201csupport[] a range of activities designed to reduce adolescent pregnancy and childbearing\u201d; and \u201cadvance understanding of the interrelationship between population growth and the quality of life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">PPFA does not itself provide health care services. However, its 127 member affiliates do provide such services annually to nearly 4 million people at 875 clinics. In 1999, those clinics served communities in the District of Columbia and every state except Hawaii, North Dakota and Mississippi. The clinics (hereafter also referred to as health centers or Planned Parenthood centers) adhere to national health standards and provide comprehensive reproductive health care services, including pregnancy tests, birth control and counseling, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and breast examinations. Some of PPFA\u2019s affiliates, including PPSDRC, provide abortion services.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The Planned Parenthood centers also provide educational programs in a variety of settings, from universities and social service agencies to religious institutions and civic organizations. The programs focus on numerous topics, such as teenage pregnancy and puberty education, contraception and family planning, sexually transmitted infections, parent-child communication, women\u2019s health, and sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In the 1990\u2019s, PPFA reported total annual revenues of around $400 to $500 million. For the year ending June 30, 2000, total revenues were $627 million, with clinic revenue accounting for 35 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">B. <em>PPFA\u2019s Web site and \u201cFact Sheets\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">PPFA maintains an Internet Web site (PPFA\u2019s Web site) at &lt;http://www.plannedparenthood.org.html&gt;. PPFA assists the public in contacting its affiliates\u2019 health centers by providing on its Web site an interactive dialogue box in which visitors can type in their zip codes and be linked to the Web sites of the health centers closest to them. Once the visitor to PPFA\u2019s Web site has been linked to the Web site of a PPFA affiliate, such as PPSDRC, he or she may access a wide array of information on public affairs and health issues, as well as information about specific services the affiliate provides. PPFA\u2019s Web site also provides a toll-free telephone number that the Web site visitor may call to ask medical questions or to schedule an appointment with \u201cthe nearest Planned Parenthood center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">PPFA publishes on its Web site various \u201cfact sheets\u201d on reproductive health and public affairs issues, including four containing statements that Bernardo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sought to enjoin in this matter: (1) \u201cAnti-choice Claims About Abortion and Breast Cancer\u201d (the Anti-Choice Claims Web page); (2) \u201cChoosing Abortion\u2014Questions and Answers\u201d (the Choosing Abortion Web page); (3) \u201cSurgical Abortion\u2014Questions &amp; Answers\u201d (the Surgical Abortion Web page); and (4) \u201cMedical and Social Health Benefits Since Abortion Was Made Legal in the U.S.\u201d (the Medical and Social Health Benefits Web page).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims Web page stated PPFA\u2019s position that the ABC link is a \u201ctheory [that] has not been borne out by research,\u201d and the principal promoters of this theory oppose abortion. It also explained that \u201c[t]he theory linking pregnancy termination and breast cancer is based on the hormonal disruption that occurs when a woman\u2019s pregnancy is interrupted. Pregnancy initiates a surge of sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin), which leads to differentiation of the cells in the breast glands in preparation for lactation. . . . Adherents of this theory claim that interruption of the first trimester of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation that may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous growth in these tissues.\u201d The Web page also explained the role of a first full-term pregnancy in reducing the long-term risk of breast cancer (hereafter the \u201cprotective effect\u201d): \u201cWhile researchers do not know what causes breast cancer, reproductive factors have been associated with risk for the disease since the 17th century, when breast cancer was noted to be more prevalent among nuns. It is known that <em>having a full-term pregnancy early in a woman\u2019s childbearing years is protective against breast cancer </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The Anti-Choice Claims Web page also contained a review of some of the many studies of the alleged ABC link published during the previous 20 years, including studies that support Bernardo\u2019s position that such a link exists. For example, the page stated: \u201cIn 1996, Joel [L.] Brind[, Ph.D.] and his colleagues published a meta-analysis [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] of 28 published reports describing 23 studies on induced abortion and breast cancer. Based on these studies, the authors calculated that induced abortion places women at a slightly increased risk for developing breast cancer.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The Web page also noted that a published 1994 study of 845 women in the State of Washington found that \u201camong women who had been pregnant at least once, the risk of breast cancer in those who had experienced an induced abortion was 50 percent higher than among other women.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The Anti-Choice Claims Web page reviewed other studies that support PPFA\u2019s position on the ABC link issue, such as a study of 1.5 million women, published in 1997 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine, </em>which PPFA asserted found no overall connection between abortion and breast cancer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It also cited a 20-year study of 49,000 women in Sweden, published in 1989, which PPFA stated found no indication of an overall risk of breast cancer after an induced abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims Web page also discussed research concerning various factors that can render a study of the ABC link unreliable and asserted that \u201c[c]ancer researchers at the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and major universities say that the most reliable studies show no increased risk, and they consider the entire body of research inconclusive.\u201d The Web page concluded with a \u201cWorks Cited\u201d bibliography that cited 32 published studies on the ABC link issue, including Brind\u2019s meta-analysis and others that support Bernardo\u2019s position on the ABC link.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In its Choosing Abortion Web page, PPFA answered the question \u201cDoes abortion cause breast cancer?\u201d by stating, \u201cNo. But abortion does not offer the same protection against breast cancer as a full term pregnancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">On PPFA\u2019s Surgical Abortion Web page, a visitor could select the question \u201cWhat are the health risks of abortion?\u201d, which would connect the visitor to another page that answered the question by stating, \u201cIn the first 20 weeks, abortion is much safer than giving birth.\u201d This statement, however, was followed by an explanation of eight \u201c[cjomplications from early abortion,\u201d including death. PPFA stated that death \u201coccurs in 1 of 100,000 abortions,\u201d and \u201c[cjhildbirth carries seven times more risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Bernardo also tried to enjoin portions of PPFA\u2019s Medical and Social Health Benefits Web page. Bernardo objected to both the use of the phrase \u201csafe, legal abortion\u201d and the following statement: \u201cToday, abortion is one of the most commonly performed clinical procedures, and the current death rate from abortion at all stages of gestation is 0.6 per 100,000 procedures. This is <em>eleven times safer than carrying a pregnancy to term </em>and nearly twice as safe as a penicillin injection [citations].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">C. <em>PPSDRC\u2019s Web site and \u201cFact Sheets\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">PPSDRC\u2019s Internet Web site (PPSDRC\u2019s Web site) is found at &lt;http://www.planned.org.html&gt;. Like PPFA, PPSDRC publishes various Web site pages that address reproductive health and public affairs issues, including some that Bernardo tried to suppress in this matter. For example, PPSDRC\u2019s Web site contained a fact sheet titled \u201cAbortion Info: Q&amp;A: Future [Pregnancies]\u201d (the Abortion Info Web page), which answered the question \u201cDoes abortion cause breast cancer?\u201d by stating, \u201cNo, but abortion does not offer the protection against breast cancer that having several full-term pregnancies does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">D. <em>Terms of Use of Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web Sites</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Both PPFA and PPSDRC included in their Web sites a terms-of-use page notifying Web site visitors that Planned Parenthood provided the Web sites subject to the visitors\u2019 \u201cagreement to comply with the Terms of Use.\u201d Each terms-of-use page informed visitors that the information provided on the Web sites was for the visitors\u2019 personal education only and that nothing on the Web sites constituted a recommendation for medical care. Each page also advised visitors to \u201c[a]rm yourself with good information about sexual and reproductive health maintenance, and <em>visit a qualified health care provider for personal medical evaluation, counseling, and services.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">E. <em>Bernardo\u2019s SLAPP Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">In August 2001, Bernardo filed her SLAPP complaint for injunctive relief against Planned Parenthood under California\u2019s unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq., hereafter the UCL) and false advertising law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>(Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500 et seq., hereafter the FAL). Bernardo alleged that PPFA and PPSDRC\u2019s Internet Web sites contained \u201cunlawful, unfair, confusing, and misleading statements/advertisements\u201d that caused women to make critical health care decisions without full, complete, and accurate information about the safety of abortion, the safety of abortion vis-a-vis childbirth, and the \u201cscientific/medical literature\u201d that Bernardo believed established the existence of the ABC link.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">1. <em>Injunctive relief requested</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In her complaint, Bernardo sought an injunction restraining Planned Parenthood from publishing statements that abortion is safe or safer than childbirth and that the weight of credible medical research has failed to establish a link between induced abortion and breast cancer. In effect, Bernardo\u2019s action thus sought to enjoin portions of PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims, Choosing Abortion, Surgical Abortion and Medical and Social Health Benefits Web pages, as well as PPSDRC\u2019s Abortion Info Web page (all of which are discussed, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Bernardo also sought a mandatory injunction requiring Planned Parenthood to provide to all of its former and prospective abortion patients a series of statements drafted by Bernardo and her counsel that support Bernardo\u2019s view that medical research has established the existence of the claimed ABC link.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>2. <em>Brind\u2019s affidavit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In support of these allegations, Bernardo attached to her complaint an affidavit of Joel L. Brind, Ph.D. (Brind), a professor of biology in the Department of Natural Sciences of Baruch College of the City University of New York, and the author of a paper titled <em>Induced Abortion as an Independent Risk Factor for Breast Cancer: A Comprehensive Review and Meta-Analysis </em>(hereafter Brind\u2019s meta-analysis),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which was published in 1996 in the British Medical Association\u2019s Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In his affidavit, Brind stated that of 36 independent studies published worldwide that presented specific data on induced abortion and the incidence of breast cancer, 17 had reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of breast cancer overall among women who have one or more induced abortions, and 10 had reported a risk increase that did not achieve statistical significance. He also stated that three of the 36 studies reported no tendency for increased or decreased risk, three reported a decrease in risk that did not achieve statistical significance, and three reported a statistically significant decrease in risk. He explained that, as he discussed in his 1996 meta-analysis, when he compiled the data for all 36 studies, using either a weighted or unweighted average, he calculated that \u201cthe risk of breast cancer among those women who had experienced an induced abortion was 30 [percent] higher than among women who had not, independently of the effect due to abortion\u2019s delay of first full-term pregnancy,\u201d and since the lifetime risk of breast cancer for an average American woman is between 10 and 12 percent, this 30 percent increase \u201camounts in absolute terms to at least a three percent, or 3 in 100, excess risk of developing breast cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Brind also opined in his affidavit that PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims Web page is \u201ca thoroughly biased and misleading presentation of the scientific literature on this subject,\u201d which \u201ccreates the untrue and/or misleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>impression that the preponderance of the scientific analysis supports the assertion that there is no link between induced abortion and increased risk of breast cancer.\u201d He challenged numerous specific statements contained in the Anti-Choice Claims Web page.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Brind opined that Planned Parenthood\u2019s answer of \u201cNo\u201d to the question \u201cDoes abortion cause breast cancer?\u201d was \u201cuntrue and/or misleading, because the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence indicates that abortion does cause breast cancer, both by removing the protection against breast cancer to be gained by completing the pregnancy already in progress, and by increasing the risk of breast cancer independently of the loss of this protective effect.\u201d He also opined that the Planned Parenthood Web site statements he challenged were \u201clikely to mislead reasonable members of the public as to the safety of abortion, the safety of abortion vis-a-vis childbirth, and the link between induced abortion and breast cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">F. <em>Planned Parenthood\u2019s Special Motion To Strike Under the Anti-SLAPP Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Planned Parenthood filed a special motion under the anti-SLAPP statute to strike Bernardo\u2019s complaint. Planned Parenthood argued that the complaint was a meritless SLAPP intended to use California\u2019s consumer protection statutes (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17200 et seq. &amp; 17500 et seq.) to thwart Planned Parenthood from exercising its constitutional right to speak about abortion; stop it from \u201cproviding free information on the [W]orld [W]ide [W]eb regarding abortion, an issue of great public concern, and on the related issue of breast cancer and abortion\u201d; force it to adopt Bernardo\u2019s view of medicine on Planned Parenthood\u2019s own Web sites and tell women that abortion' causes breast cancer; and \u201cfrighten women into refraining from exercising a constitutional right to reproductive choice\u201d based on \u201cvery questionable science\u201d and Bernardo\u2019s \u201canti-abortion agenda.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Planned Parenthood also argued that Bernardo could not meet her burden under the anti-SLAPP statute (section 425.16, subd. (b)(1), hereafter \u00a7 425.16(b)(1))<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of showing a probability that she would prevail on any of her claims because (1) Planned Parenthood advised all visitors to its Web sites in the terms of use (discussed, ante) that the health information provided on the Web sites was for the visitors\u2019 personal education only; (2) the information did not concern any product or service within the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>UCL, nor did it concern or advertise any product or service within the meaning of the FAL, and thus did not fall within the ambit of these consumer protection statutes; and (3) even if it did, the Web site health information was supported by ample peer-reviewed scientific studies as shown by the supporting expert declarations of four health professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">In support of the motion to strike, Planned Parenthood submitted the declarations of David B. Preskill, M.D., the Chief of Service for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Southern California Kaiser Permanente in San Diego; Georgia Robbins Sadler, Ph.D., Associate Clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine, and the Associate Director for Outreach at the UCSD Cancer Center; Steven R. Drosman, M.D., the former Chief of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Section of Sharp Memorial Hospital and currently the Chief of Staff for Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women at Sharp Memorial Hospital, and Polly A. Newcomb, Ph.D., who is a member of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington School of Public Health, and an associate editor who provides editorial service to 18 peer-review epidemiology journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine and the American Journal of Epidemiology.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Planned Parenthood filed a written request that the court take judicial notice of the fact that abortion is one of the most controversial political issues in our nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Bernardo opposed the special motion to strike, asserting that this case is not about the right to abortion. Bernardo contended the motion should be denied on two main grounds: (1) Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech was false and misleading, such speech was not entitled to legal protection, and thus Planned Parenthood had failed to make the requisite prima facie showing that they were engaged in protected activity within the meaning of section 425.16; and (2) Bernardo was able to make a prima facie showing of a probability of succeeding on the merits because Planned Parenthood Web site statements were made in connection with their offer of abortion services so as to constitute advertising within the meaning of the UCL and FAL, and Bernardo had \u201call but conclusive evidence\u201d that those statements misled the public about the safety of abortion, the safety of abortion vis-a-vis childbirth, and the evidence showing that induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In support of her opposition, Bernardo submitted the declarations of all three individual appellants; Brind\u2019s declaration; and the declaration of five medical doctors, \u201cone from each medical specialty required to address the increased risk of breast cancer caused by induced abortion over the life of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>woman,\u201d who all opined that induced abortion causes increased risk of breast cancer: Elizabeth Shadigian, M.D., a board certified obstetrician/gynecologist engaged in clinical practice and teaching at the University of Michigan School of Medicine; Jane Anderson, M.D., a board certified pediatrician teaching at the University of California, San Francisco; Chris Kahlenbom, M.D., a board certified physician of internal medicine engaged in clinical practice and epidemiological research who has published on the ABC link; Jose Bufill, M.D. (Bufill), who studied medicine at the University of Navarre in Spain, and is practicing oncology and hematology and teaching at the Indiana University School of Medicine; and Angela Lanfranchi, M.D., a surgeon specializing in breast surgery and a clinical professor at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">G. <em>Order Granting Planned Parenthood\u2019s Anti-SLAPP Motion To Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The court granted Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion to strike Bernardo\u2019s complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute on the ground that Bernardo had failed to show the requisite probability of prevailing on the merits of the complaint and obtaining the injunctive relief she sought. Specifically, the court found that the challenged statements in Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web pages \u201c[could not] be construed as pure commercial speech or pure advertisement\u201d and, even if they could be so construed, Bernardo had failed to present sufficient evidence to show a probability of prevailing on the UCL and FAL claims that Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site statements were unlawful, that they constituted an unfair or fraudulent business practice, and that they also constituted false or deceptive advertising. The court noted that contrary to Bernardo\u2019s argument that Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web sites were deceptive by failing to recognize the \u201cprotective effect\u201d against breast cancer that a full-term pregnancy provides, Bernardo had acknowledged Planned Parenthood\u2019s statement (in the Choosing Abortion and Abortion Info Web pages) that \u201cabortion does not offer the same protection against breast cancer as a full term pregnancy.\u201d The court also noted Bernardo\u2019s allegation that Planned Parenthood had made a false statement of fact by claiming that abortion is safer than childbirth, but found that this allegation was centered on Bernardo\u2019s position that abortion causes breast cancer and that her own evidence showed there were two \u201ccamps of thought\u201d and an \u201con-going debate in the scientific community\u201d on the issue of whether there is link between induced abortion and breast cancer. The court further found that Planned Parenthood had not failed to disclose (in its Anti-Choice Claims Web page) that numerous studies supported Bernardo\u2019s position that induced abortions increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer. In appeal No. D040186, Bernardo has appealed the order granting Planned Parenthood\u2019s section 425.16 motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>H. <em>Order Awarding Attorney Fees to Planned Parenthood</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Planned Parenthood brought a motion for a mandatory award of attorney fees under section 425.16(c) in the amount of $77,835.25. Bernardo opposed the motion, claiming the lawsuit was not a \u201csham\u201d; that Planned Parenthood was seeking an improper enhancement on a contingency fee basis that would punish Bernardo\u2019s counsel in violation of his due process rights to notice; and that an award of fees under section 425.16(c) would violate Bernardo\u2019s rights under the United States and California Constitutions to petition the government for redress of grievances and exercise free speech in connection with a public issue, as well as Bernardo\u2019s due process right to meaningful notice as to when mandatory costs and fees will be levied, and the guarantee of equal protection in that section 425.16(c) \u201cfunctions as a content-based penalty for certain suits and creates an invidious distinction between classes of litigants and causes which is not narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling governmental interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The court issued an order granting the attorney fees motion and awarding attorney fees to Planned Parenthood in the sum of $77,835.25.

[Citations.]\u201d We note that Planned Parenthood asserts, and the record shows, that Bernardo does not claim that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech may be regulated under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 or 17500 if it is noncommercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Here, Bernardo\u2019s own evidence in opposition to Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion to strike shows that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech on the claimed ABC link is noncommercial speech entitled to full First Amendment protection. Bernardo\u2019s complaint alleged that PPFA and PPSDRC\u2019s Internet Web sites contained \u201cunlawful, unfair, confusing, and misleading statements/advertisements\u201d in violation of Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500 that caused women to make critical health care decisions without full, complete, and accurate information about the safety of abortion in general, the safety of abortion vis-a-vis childbirth, and the scientific/medical literature that Bernardo claims establishes a link between induced abortion and breast cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>In opposing Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute, Bernardo submitted photocopies of the various challenged documents that Planned Parenthood published on its Web sites: (1) PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims Web page; (2) PPFA\u2019s Choosing Abortion Web page; (3) PPFA\u2019s Surgical Abortion Web page; (4) PPFA\u2019s Medical and Social Health Benefits Web page; and (5) PPSDRC\u2019s Abortion Info Web page. On appeal, Bernardo maintains she met her burden of showing a probability of prevailing on her claim that Planned Parenthood made false statements of fact on those Web pages by claiming that abortion is safer than childbirth and that induced abortion does not cause breast cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The evidence submitted by Bernardo shows, however, that none of Planned Parenthood\u2019s challenged Web pages proposed a commercial transaction in its contents. Rather, they were all educational in nature and asserted Planned Parenthood\u2019s positions on disputed scientific and medical issues of public interest with which Bernardo strenuously disagreed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For example, PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims Web page, which addressed the claimed ABC link that was of central importance in Bernardo\u2019s action against Planned Parenthood, stated PPFA\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d that the ABC link is \u201ca theory [that] has not been borne out by research\u201d; explained the ABC link \u201ctheory\u201d; and asserted that the principal promoters of that \u201ctheory\u201d opposed abortion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Web page also contained a review of some of the many studies of the alleged ABC link published over the previous 20 years, including some, such as Brind\u2019s meta-analysis (see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>that support Bernardo\u2019s position that such a link exists, and others that supported PPFA\u2019s position on the ABC link issue, such as a study of 1.5 million women, published in 1997 by the New England Journal of Medicine (see fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>which, according to PPFA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>found no overall connection between abortion and breast cancer. The Anti-Choice Claims Web page also discussed research regarding various factors that can render a study of the claimed ABC link unreliable and concluded with a \u201cWorks Cited\u201d bibliography that cited 32 published studies on the ABC link issue, including Brind\u2019s meta-analysis and others that support Bernardo\u2019s position on the ABC link. The foregoing shows that PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims Web page was educational, not commercial, in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In support of the contention that Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements are commercial speech, Bernardo points to the authenticated photocopies of Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web sites that she submitted in opposition to the motion to strike, which show (1) that on \u201c[vjirtually every web page,\u201d PPFA provided \u201chealth info,\u201d \u201chealth centers\u201d and \u201csexual health\u201d hyperlinks that provided Web site visitors with access to sexual health information and the locations of affiliated health centers (including PPSDRC), as well as a toll-free telephone number that visitors could call to schedule an appointment; and (2) that PPSDRC\u2019s Web pages provided visitors with an opportunity to obtain payment information and clinic locations and to make an appointment. The brief text of the hyperlinks (such as \u201chealth info,\u201d \u201chealth centers\u201d and \u201csexual health\u201d) on the various Web pages did not advertise or promote any services provided by clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood. While the toll-free number provided to Web site visitors a means for scheduling an appointment for medical services, it is significant that both PPFA and PPSDRC included in their Web sites a terms-of-use page notifying visitors that Planned Parenthood was providing the Web sites subject to the visitors\u2019 \u201cagreement to comply with the Terms of Use.\u201d Each terms-of-use page informed visitors that the information provided on Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web sites was for the visitors\u2019 <em>\u201cpersonal education, </em>but nothing on this site constitutes a recommendation for medical care . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Each page also advised visitors to \u201c[ajrm yourself with good information about sexual and reproductive health maintenance, and visit a qualified health care provider for personal medical evaluation, counseling, and services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Bernardo also relies on the fact that PPSDRC and other affiliates of PPFA provide abortion and other services from which PPFA and the affiliates derive revenue. However, any economic motivation that Planned Parenthood may have had in publishing the challenged Web site speech regarding the claimed ABC link and the safety of abortion would be insufficient by itself to turn the statements into commercial speech. In <em>Bolger, supra, </em>463 U.S. 60, a manufacturer and distributor of contraceptives brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging a federal statute that prohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 61-63.) The manufacturer decided to undertake a campaign of mailing to the public on an unsolicited basis some informational pamphlets (among other things) that not only promoted its products, but also contained discussions of important public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>issues such as venereal disease and family planning. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 62, 67-68.) The Supreme Court found that most of the manufacturer\u2019s mailings fell \u201cwithin the core notion of commercial speech\u2014\u2018speech which does \u201cno more than propose a commercial transaction.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 66.) Although the <em>Bolger </em>court held that the mailings constituted commercial speech, noting that the informational pamphlets were \u201cconceded to be advertisements\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the high court explained that \u201cthe fact that [the manufacturer] ha[d] an economic motivation for mailing the pamphlets would clearly be insufficient by itself to turn the materials into commercial speech. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67.) Similarly here, any \u201ceconomic motivation\u201d Planned Parenthood may have had in publishing the Web site speech that Bernardo challenges in this case would be insufficient by itself to turn the statements into commercial speech actionable under the UCL and FAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Even were we to assume that the toll-free number and Planned Parenthood\u2019s hyperlinks to information about specific clinics and services constituted commercial speech, the noncommercial speech published in the various Web pages would still receive full First Amendment protection. In <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 1, 9 [89 L.Ed.2d 1, 106 S.Ct. 903], the United States Supreme Court held that a utility\u2019s newsletter, which was distributed to ratepayers in the monthly billing envelopes and the contents of which ranged from political editorials to energy saving tips and billing information, \u201cextended] well beyond speech that proposes a business transaction . . . [citations], and include[d] the kind of discussion of \u2018matters of public concern\u2019 that the First Amendment both fully protects and implicitly encourages. [Citation.]\u201d Under similar reasoning, Planned Parenthood\u2019s noncommercial speech in the various Web pages at issue here was fully protected under the First Amendment despite any claimed contiguous commercial speech set forth directly or indirectly in the hyperlinks or in the text accompanying the toll-free telephone number, discussed, <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Bernardo also relies on <em>Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 939, as supporting her contention that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech is commercial. Bernardo\u2019s reliance on <em>Nike, </em>however, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In <em>Nike, </em>the plaintiff, acting on behalf of the general public, brought suit under the UCL and FAL alleging that the defendant corporation, Nike, Inc. (Nike), responded to public criticism and induced consumers to continue to buy its products by making false statements of fact about its labor practices and about working conditions in factories that made its products. <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 945, 946-947, 949-950.) Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that Nike made statements in press releases, in letters to newspapers, in a letter to university presidents and athletic directors, and in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>documents distributed for public relations purposes to the effect that workers who made Nike products were \u201cprotected from physical and sexual abuse, that they [were] paid in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations governing wages and hours, that they [were] paid on average double the applicable local minimum wage, that they received a \u2018living wage,\u2019 that they received free meals and health care, and that their working conditions [were] in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 947-948.) The California Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal after the trial court sustained Nike\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend on the ground Nike\u2019s statements were constitutionally protected noncommercial speech. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 948-949, 970.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">In holding that Nike\u2019s speech was commercial, the Supreme Court articulated and applied a \u201climited-purpose test\u201d (the <em>Nike </em>test), stating that <em>\u201cwhen a court must decide whether particular speech may be subjected to laws aimed at preventing false advertising or other forms of commercial </em>deception, categorizing a particular statement as commercial or noncommercial speech requires consideration of three elements: the speaker, the intended audience, and the content of the message.\u201d <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 960, original italics.) The <em>Nike </em>court explained that \u201c[i]n typical commercial speech cases, the <em>speaker </em>is likely to be someone engaged in commerce\u2014that is, generally, the production, distribution, or sale of goods or services or someone acting on behalf of a person so engaged, and the <em>intended audience </em>is likely to be actual or potential buyers or customers of the speaker\u2019s goods or services, or persons acting for actual or potential buyers or customers, or persons (such as reporters or reviewers) likely to repeat the message to or otherwise influence actual or potential buyers or customers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>With respect to the \u201ccontent-of-the-message\u201d element of the <em>Nike </em>test, the high court stated that \u201cthe <em>factual </em>content of the message should be <em>commercial in character. </em>In the context of regulation of false or misleading advertising, this typically means that the speech consists of <em>representations of fact about the business operations, products, or services of the speaker </em>(or the individual or company that the speaker represents), <em>made for the purpose of promoting sales of, or other commercial transactions in, the speaker\u2019s products or services.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 961, italics added.) The court rephrased its <em>Nike </em>test by stating that \u201cin relation to regulations aimed at protecting consumers from false and misleading promotional practices, <em>commercial speech must consist of factual representations </em>about the business operations, products, or services of the speaker (or the individual or company on whose behalf the speaker is speaking), made for the purpose of promoting sales of, or other commercial transactions in, the speaker\u2019s products or services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 962, italics added.) Thus, the three elements of the <em>Nike </em>test are (1) a commercial speaker, (2) an intended commercial audience, and (3) representations of fact of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>commercial nature. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 964.) The high court stressed that the UCL and FAL \u201cdo not suppress points of view but instead suppress false and misleading statements of fact.\u201d <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 967.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Applying the foregoing elements of the <em>Nike </em>test to the record presented in this appeal, we conclude that Bernardo failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on her contention that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech is commercial under that test. Assuming without deciding that Planned Parenthood is a commercial speaker on the ground it receives revenue from affiliated health centers, Bernardo has failed to show that Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site statements regarding the claimed ABC link and the safety of abortion constitute representations of fact of a commercial nature within the meaning of the <em>Nike </em>test. In <em>Nike, </em>the Supreme Court held that this third element of the <em>Nike </em>test was satisfied because \u201c[i]n describing its own labor policies, and the practices and working conditions in factories where its products are made, Nike was making <em>factual representations about its own business </em>operations.\u201d <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 963, italics added.) The court further explained that \u201c[i]n speaking to consumers about working conditions and labor practices in the factories where its products are made, <em>Nike addressed matters within its own knowledge. </em>The wages paid to the factories\u2019 employees, the hours they work, the way they are treated, and whether the environmental conditions under which they work violate local health and safety laws, are all matters likely to be within the personal knowledge of Nike executives, employees, or subcontractors. Thus, <em>Nike was in a position to readily verify the truth of any factual assertions it made on these topics.\u201d (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Here, however, Bernardo sought to enjoin not readily verifiable <em>factual </em>assertions about matters within Planned Parenthood\u2019s own knowledge, but Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements of <em>opinion </em>about the claimed ABC link that one of Bernardo\u2019s own experts, Bufill, conceded was the subject of \u201c[t]wo schools\u201d of \u201cscientific debate.\u201d (See fn. 12, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Bernardo does not claim, nor can she, that the claimed ABC link, a matter of genuine scientific debate, is a matter that is within Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201cown knowledge\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Nike </em>test. The evidence of the Anti-Choice Claims Web page submitted by Bernardo shows that PPFA stated therein under the subheading, \u201cThe Planned Parenthood Position is That Abortion Poses no Demonstrated Health Risks\u201d (original boldface), that \u201c[t]he link between induced abortion and breast cancer is a theory\u201d that \u201chas not been borne out by research.\u201d The reference to Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d indicates that Planned Parenthood was expressing its <em>opinion </em>about this disputed \u201ctheory.\u201d Bufill, in his declaration filed by Bernardo in opposition to Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion to strike the complaint under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>anti-SLAPP statute, specifically discussed the \u201cschool[]\u201d (to which Planned Parenthood indisputably belongs) that argues there is no causal association between induced abortion and breast cancer, and stated that \u201c[t]he arguments they offer in support of their <em>opinion </em>center on a critique of the statistical methods used in the epidemiologic studies specifically addressing the association . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, Bernardo\u2019s expert witness evidence shows that the position taken on the ABC link issue by the school to which Planned Parenthood belongs constitutes an opinion, not a representation of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Bernardo has also failed to show that the intended audience of Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site speech was \u201clikely to be actual or potential buyers or customers\u201d of the health services of the affiliated Planned Parenthood centers. <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 960.) The record shows that Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements were published on the Internet, on Web sites accessible by the general public, and were not directed to any particular audience. Because Planned Parenthood\u2019s challenged statements about the claimed ABC link were statements of opinion to the general public about matters not within its own personal knowledge, they were not actionable under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500. <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 962, 964.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Bernardo has also failed to show a probability of prevailing on her claim that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech concerning the safety of abortion constituted commercial speech that was actionable under the UCL and FAL. In her complaint Bernardo challenged (1) PPFA\u2019s statement in its Surgical Abortion Web page that \u201c[i]n the first 20 weeks, abortion is much safer than giving birth\u201d; (2) PPFA\u2019s statements in its Medical and Social Health Benefits Web page that \u201cthe current death rate from abortion at all stages of gestation is 0.6 per 100,000 procedures,\u201d and \u201c[t]his is eleven times safer than carrying a pregnancy to term and nearly twice as safe as a penicillin injection\u201d; and (3) PPSDRC\u2019s statement in its Abortion Info Web page that \u201cabortion is about twice as safe as having your tonsils out and is safer than childbirth,\u201d and \u201cabortion is 11 times safer than giving birth up to the 18th week of pregnancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On appeal, Bernardo contends her evidence shows that these statements about the safety of abortion are statements of fact, not opinion, and that they are false. This contention, however, is predicated on evidence she submitted in opposition to Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion to strike, which she maintains established that induced abortion causes breast cancer. Specifically, Bernardo asserts in her opening brief that \u201c[Planned Parenthood\u2019s] statements of fact are false because <em>induced abortion does cause breast cancer and, as a result, abortion is not safer than </em>childbirth.\u201d (Italics added.) Bernardo also states that \u201c[Planned Parenthood\u2019s] comparison of mortality rates of abortion and childbirth is false and misleading because it does not factor in deaths <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>resulting from the abrogation of the protective effect [<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] caused by termination of a pregnancy via induced abortion and resulting in breast cancer deaths.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In determining whether Bernardo has established a probability of prevailing on her claims under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500 regarding Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements about the safety of abortion, our analysis thus necessarily focuses again on Planned Parenthood\u2019s published <em>opinion </em>that credible scientific evidence has not established that induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. Bernardo\u2019s claim that Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements about the safety of abortion are false is based solely upon her claims that (1) the ABC link is an established scientific fact, and (2) Planned Parenthood has misrepresented the safety of abortion by failing to \u201cfactor in deaths resulting from the abrogation of the protective effect caused by termination of pregnancy via induced abortion and resulting in breast cancer deaths.\u201d However, as already discussed, Bernardo\u2019s own evidence established that the ABC link is <em>not </em>an established scientific <em>fact </em>because, according to one of her own expert witnesses (Bufill), it is the disputed subject of both a genuine scientific debate and of opposing opinions held by two schools (see fn. 12, <em>ante). </em>Bernardo\u2019s own evidence also shows that she belongs to the school that believes the ABC link is an established scientific fact, and Planned Parenthood belongs to the school that is of the opinion that it is not an established scientific fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We conclude the court properly found that Planned Parenthood\u2019s challenged Web site speech is not commercial speech because \u201c[Planned Parenthood\u2019s] statements are not made in connection with an offer to sell abortion services, are not \u2018promotional\u2019 of abortion and/or do not propose a \u2018commercial transaction.\u2019 [Citations.] Rather, [Planned Parenthood\u2019s] statements [are] educational and/or informative in nature, as opposed to advocating and or \u2018advertising\u2019 (in the sense of inducing or offering a financial transaction) abortion services.\u201d Under any recognized test for commercial speech, including the <em>Nike </em>test on which Bernardo relies, Bernardo has failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that Planned Parenthood\u2019s challenged Web site speech is commercial or that its statements concerning the claimed ABC link and the safety of abortion are false, misleading or deceptive representations of fact that are actionable under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>2. <em>Assuming Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements were statements of fact, not opinion, and commercial speech, Bernardo has failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on her claims that the statements violated the UCL or FAL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Even if Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site statements were deemed to be commercial speech as representations of fact rather than expressions of opinion concerning the claimed ABC link, Bernardo\u2019s own evidence shows that she failed to establish a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that the statements violated Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500 as alleged in her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">a. <em>UCL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">California\u2019s unfair competition law \u201cprohibits unfair competition, which is defined as \u2018any <em>unlawful, unfair or fraudulent </em>business act or practice . . . .\u2019 ([Bus. &amp; Prof. Code,] \u00a7 17200.) \u2018Because Business and Professions Code section 17200 is written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair competition\u2014acts or practices which are <em>unlawful, or unfair, or </em>fraudulent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Shvarts </em>v. <em>Budget Group, Inc. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1157 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 722].)

In <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 845, 851 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 389] <em>(Gregory), </em>a <em>post-Cel-Tech </em>decision, the Court of Appeal recently stated that \u201c[t]he term unfair is not precisely defined in the statute, and the courts have stmggled to come up with a workable definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Referring to the term \u201cunfair\u201d as used in the UCL, the California Supreme Court in <em>Cel-Tech </em>stated that \u201c[a] few Courts of Appeal have attempted a definition. (E.g., <em>People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 530 [206 Cal.Rptr. 164] [\u2018[A]n \u201cunfair\u201d business practice occurs when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscmpulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\u2019]; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.

In a footnote, however the high court held that this new definition does not apply to consumer cases, stating in part: \u201cThis case involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this test are limited to that context. Nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as \u2018fraudulent\u2019 or \u2018unlawful\u2019 business practices or \u2018unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 187, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Nevertheless, some <em>post-Cel-Tech </em>state appellate decisions have held that the new <em>Cel-Tech </em>test applies even to consumer cases. In <em>Schnall </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1144 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 439], which involved a class action brought by a car renter under the UCL against a car rental corporation, the Court of Appeal noted that \u201c[t]he <em>Cel-Tech </em>court required \u2018that any finding of unfairness to competitors under [Business and Professions Code] section 17200 be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition[]\u2019 [citation]\u201d <em>(Schnall, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1166, fn. omitted), and stated that the <em>Schnall </em>plaintiff\u2019s UCL claim, \u201cunlike that in <em>Cel-Tech, </em>does not pertain to unfair competition between direct competitors. Nonetheless, accepting the suggestion of <em>Cel-Tech </em>that <em>any </em>claims of unfairness under the UCL should be defined in connection with a legislatively declared policy, we find such a test satisfied in this case.\u201d <em>(Schnall, supra, </em>at p. 1166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In <em>Gregory, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at page 854, the Court of Appeal apparently agreed with the <em>Schnall </em>court, stating that <em>\u201cCel-Tech </em>. . . may signal a narrower interpretation of the prohibition of unfair acts or practices in <em>all </em>unfair competition actions . . . .\u201d (Second italics added.) The <em>Gregory </em>court also stated that \u201cwhere a claim of an unfair act or practice is predicated on public policy, we read <em>Cel-Tech </em>to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be \u2018tethered\u2019 to specific constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions.\u201d <em>(Gregory, supra, </em>at p. 854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We need not decide which test or definition of the term \u201cunfair\u201d applies in the instant case. We conclude that, regardless of which applies, Bernardo failed to substantiate her claim that Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>constituted an \u201cunfair\u201d business practice or act within the meaning of the UCL. Bernardo points to no legislative policy, or to any public policy \u201ctethered\u201d to any specific constitutional, statutory or regulatory provision, which was allegedly offended or violated by Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech. In her reply brief, Bernardo continues to argue that she has \u201cdetailed a long list of specific <em>factual </em>representations [by Planned Parenthood] that are <em>false\u201d </em>(Italics added.) For reasons already discussed, we have rejected Bernardo\u2019s contention that Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site statements concerning the claimed ABC link were \u201cfactual representations\u201d because her own evidence shows that those statements were expressions of <em>opinion </em>regarding a disputed issue that is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate between proponents of Bernardo\u2019s view that induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer, and proponents of Planned Parenthood\u2019s position that credible scientific evidence does not establish such a link. The court properly found that \u201cthe very fact that [Bernardo\u2019s experts] recognize and discuss the contrary opinions in their declarations shows that the issue of whether induced abortions increase the risk of breast cancer is far from being a foregone scientific conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Furthermore, the authenticated photocopies of Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web pages submitted by Bernardo show that PPFA explained to visitors of the Anti-Choice Claims Web page that there are two opposing views on the claimed ABC link. That Web page contained a review of some of the many studies of the alleged ABC link published during the past 20 years, including studies that support Bernardo\u2019s position that such a link exists, such as Brind\u2019s meta-analysis (see fii. 4, <em>ante) </em>and Baling\u2019s study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (see fn. 5, <em>ante). </em>The Web page included a \u201cWorks Cited\u201d bibliography that cited 32 published studies on the ABC link issue, including Brind\u2019s meta-analysis, Baling\u2019s study, and others works that supported Bernardo\u2019s 'position on the ABC link. In addition, the Web page explained the ABC link theory that Bernardo advocates: \u201cThe theory linking pregnancy termination and breast cancer is based on the hormonal disruption that occurs when a woman\u2019s pregnancy is interrupted. Pregnancy initiates a surge of sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin), which leads to differentiation of the cells in the breast glands in preparation for lactation. . . . Adherents of this theory claim that interruption of the first trimester of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation that may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous growth in these tissues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The unfairness prong of Business and Professions Code section 17200 \u201c \u2018has been used to enjoin <em>deceptive or sharp practices. . . </em>.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Klein v.

Regarding the ABC link issue, PPFA\u2019s Anti-Choice Claims Web page informed visitors that there are two schools of scientific research with opposing points of view on the issue of whether an induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. That Web page discussed Bernardo\u2019s point of view as well as Planned Parenthood\u2019s position and provided citations to all published studies and articles referenced therein, including those that supported Bernardo\u2019s position, thereby providing all interested visitors the means to independently view both sides of the controversy for themselves. Although Bernardo claims that Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements comparing mortality rates of abortion and childbirth were false and misleading because they did not factor in deaths resulting from the abrogation of the \u201cprotective effect\u201d caused by termination of pregnancy via induced abortion and resulting in breast cancer deaths, Bernardo\u2019s own evidence shows that PPFA expressly acknowledged in its Anti-Choice Claims Web page that \u201c[i]t is known that having a full-term pregnancy early in a woman\u2019s childbearing years is <em>protective against breast cancer\u201d </em>(italics added); PPFA stated in its Choosing Abortion Web page that \u201cabortion does not offer the same <em>protection against breast cancer </em>as a full term pregnancy\u201d (italics added); and PPSDRC stated in its Abortion Info Web page that \u201cabortion does not offer the <em>protection against breast cancer </em>that having several full-term pregnancies does\u201d (italics added). We conclude that Bernardo failed to meet her burden of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech was likely to deceive members of the public and that it constituted a fraudulent business act or practice within the meaning of the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>b. <em>FAL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u201cCalifornia\u2019s false advertising law ([Bus. &amp; Prof. Code,] \u00a7 17500 et seq.) makes it \u2018unlawful for any person, . . . corporation . . . , or any employee thereof with intent directly or indirectly to dispose of real or personal property or to perform services ... or to induce the public to enter into any obligation relating thereto, to make or disseminate . . . before the public in this state, ... in any newspaper or other publication ... or in any other manner or means whatever . . . any statement, concerning that real or personal property or those services . . . which is untrue or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or misleading . . . .\u2019 ([Bus. &amp; Prof. Code,] \u00a7 17500.)\u201d <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The <em>Nike </em>court explained that \u201cto state a claim under either the UCL or the false advertising law, based on false advertising or promotional practices, \u2018it is necessary only to show that \u201cmembers of the public are likely to be deceived.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Nike, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 951.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We have already concluded that Bernardo failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that Planned Parenthood\u2019s challenged Web site speech is commercial or that its statements concerning the claimed ABC link and the safety of abortion are false, misleading or deceptive representations of fact that are actionable under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500. Were we to assume that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech could properly be characterized as advertising actionable under Business and Professions Code section 17500, we would conclude that Bernardo failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her FAL claim, because for reasons discussed, <em>ante, </em>her own evidence established she failed to meet her burden of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claim that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech was likely to deceive members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">3. <em>Claim that the court improperly evaluated Bernardo\u2019s evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Bernardo contends the court \u201cengaged in an improper evaluation of [her] prima facie showing by repeatedly weighing the credibility of her experts and the comparative probative strength of competing evidence when addressing [her] claims.\u201d Bernardo also complains the court \u201crepeatedly viewed evidence in the light least favorable to [her] claims,\u201d \u201crejected [her] evidence by characterizing [Planned Parenthood\u2019s] statements as education, not advertising or statements made in connection with an offer of services, and as no more than statements of opinion.\u201d Bernardo maintains that the court\u2019s \u201cimproper evaluation\u201d of her prima facie showing produced erroneous legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>conclusions, such as the court\u2019s conclusion that Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site statements were not unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Bernardo\u2019s contentions are moot. As already discussed, we independently review the order granting Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute under a de novo standard of review <em>(Kajima Engineering &amp; Construction, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 929). We thus independently decide whether the granting of that motion was correct, but we need not decide whether the court\u2019s reasoning in granting that motion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">For reasons already discussed, we have concluded that Bernardo\u2019s own evidence in opposition to Planned Parenthood\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion to strike shows that she did not, and could not, state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim under either the UCL or FAL, and thus she failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing as required by section 425.16(b)(1) and case law interpreting that subdivision. (See <em>Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) Accordingly, we need not, and do not, address the specifics of Bernardo\u2019s contention that the court improperly evaluated her prima facie showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">4. <em>Claim that application of section 425.16 violated Bernardo\u2019s constitutional rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Last, Bernardo contends that \u201cif the [court\u2019s] application of [section 425.16] is correct, then the statute violates [her] First Amendment and Due Process rights.\u201d Bernardo apparently maintains that the court\u2019s granting of Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion to strike her complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute violated her First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances by filing her lawsuit under the UCL and FAL. Bernardo also asserts that due process is a \u201cconcept which voids laws that are vague or overbroad as well as those that deprive citizens of their rights without adequate notice,\u201d and complains that the court \u201cemployed a standard that could never be predicted in advance\u2014one that essentially required [her] to predict with certainty the way in which the Court would view her evidence and the way in which the Court would resolve questions of fact and law.\u201d Specifically, she maintains that section 425.16 violates her due process rights because \u201cthe \u2018reasonable probability of success on the merits\u2019 standard is meaningless in practice,\u201d and she complains that she \u201chas been barred from the courts of [California] based on a standard that, if properly applied in this case, bars all litigants but those that can predict the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">We reject Bernardo\u2019s contention that application of the anti-SLAPP statute violated her First Amendment rights. The California Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he right to petition is not absolute, providing little or no protection for baseless litigation\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 64.) Here, Bernardo does not dispute that Planned Parenthood met its threshold burden under section 425.16(b)(1) of showing that Bernardo\u2019s claims against Planned Parenthood for injunctive relief under the UCL and FAL arose from protected activity. The court properly took judicial notice of the fact that abortion is one of the most controversial political issues in our nation. Because Bernardo\u2019s complaint challenged Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site speech concerning the claimed ABC link and the risks involved in abortion procedures, as Planned Parenthood argued in its motion papers, Planned Parenthood met its burden of showing that Bernardo\u2019s suit arose from \u201cwritten . . . statements] . . . made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3) discussed, <em>ante. </em>For reasons already discussed, Bernardo failed to meet her burden under section 425.16(b)(1) of stating and substantiating a legally sufficient claim (see <em>Navellier, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 88-89). By properly finding that Bernardo\u2019s lawsuit was a SLAPP and dismissing it under section 425.16, the court did not interfere with her First Amendment free speech or petitioning rights. The California Supreme Court has explained that the anti-SLAPP statute \u201csubjects to potential dismissal only those causes of action as to which the plaintiff is unable to show a probability of prevailing on the merits (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)), a provision we have read as \u2018requiring the court to determine only if the plaintiff has stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim\u2019 [citation]. So construed, \u2018section 425.16 provides an efficient means of dispatching, early on in a lawsuit, [and discouraging, insofar as fees may be shifted,] a plaintiff\u2019s <em>meritless </em>claims.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 63 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685], italics added.) The anti-SLAPP statute did not prevent Bernardo from bringing a meritorious claim; it properly prevented her from continuing to prosecute her meritless SLAPP suit. The application of section 425.16 in this matter did not violate Bernardo\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We also reject Bernardo\u2019s contention that the \u201creasonable probability of success on the merits\u201d standard under section 425.16 is both meaningless and a violation of her right to due process. As already discussed, the California Supreme Court has explained that in order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing required by section 425.16(b)(1),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a plaintiff \u201cneed only have \u2018 \u201cstated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Put another way, the plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 88-89.) This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>standard is sufficient for due process purposes to put a plaintiff like Bernardo on adequate notice as to the burden that must be met under section 425.16(b)(1) to defeat a motion to strike brought under the anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In sum, the gravamen of Bernardo\u2019s action against Planned Parenthood was (1) her unsubstantiated assertion that the ABC link is an established scientific fact, and (2) her unsubstantiated claim that Planned Parenthood published on its Web sites commercial speech consisting of false and misleading statements of fact about the safety of abortion, the safety of abortion vis-\u00e1-vis childbirth, and the scientific and medical literature that Bernardo believes has established the existence of the ABC link that should be enjoined under the UCL and FAL and replaced by speech to be published on Planned Parenthood\u2019s own Web sites, pursuant to a mandatory injunction, that would have expressed her view that the claimed ABC link is an established scientific fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We hold that the dismissal of Bernardo\u2019s action under the anti-SLAPP statute was proper on the ground she failed to meet her statutory burden under section 425.16 of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims for injunctive relief because (1) her own evidence demonstrated that Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements about the claimed ABC link were noncommercial expressions of opinion about an issue of genuine scientific debate that were fully protected under the First Amendment and thus not actionable under either the UCL or FAL; (2) her challenge to Planned Parenthood\u2019s statements regarding the safety of abortion failed as a matter of law because this challenge was based on the unsubstantiated premise that the claimed ABC link is an established scientific fact; and (3) she failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that Planned Parenthood\u2019s speech, assuming it consisted of commercial statements of fact, was unlawful, unfair or fraudulent within the meaning of the UCL or constituted false advertising within the meaning of the FAL. We also hold that the dismissal of her action under the anti-SLAPP statute did not violate her First Amendment or due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Because the claimed link between abortion and breast cancer is a public health issue about which scientific researchers and public health advocates in good faith have disagreed, the proper resolution of this appeal requires application of the fundamental public speech principle enunciated by the United States Supreme Court that \u201c[u]nder the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an <em>opinion </em>may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas.\u201d <em>(Gertz v.

Here, Planned Parenthood\u2019s Web site speech interpreting, evaluating and discussing the content and weight of the scientific literature addressing the claimed ABC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>link represents the kind of rigorous debate on issues of public concern that the First Amendment was designed to promote and protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">BERNARDO\u2019S APPEAL FROM THE MANDATORY ATTORNEY FEES AWARD UNDER SECTION 425.16(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Bernardo separately appeals the court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees to Planned Parenthood in the amount of $77,835.25 under the mandatory fees provision set forth in section 425.16(c).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Bernardo contends that section 425.16(c) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, asserting the attorney fees award levied against her is a penalty that violates her constitutional right to (1) petition the government for redress of grievances and access the courts by filing litigation; (2) due process; and (3) equal protection.

In support of this contention, Bernardo cites several United States Supreme Court and California Supreme Court decisions for the proposition that, as a general First Amendment principle, the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>cannot impose penalties or tort liability for filing a lawsuit absent a showingthat the suit is objectively groundless.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Bernardo\u2019s arguments are based on the unsupported premise that the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s fee shifting provisions \u201cpenalize\u201d or impose \u201cliability\u201d on plaintiffs whose complaints are dismissed under section 425.16. In <em>Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th 53, the California Supreme Court held that a defendant moving to strike a cause of action under section 425.16 on the ground it is a SLAPP need not show that the plaintiff brought the action with the subjective intent of chilling the defendant\u2019s exercise of constitutionally protected speech or petitioning activity. <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 57, 68.) In arguing that an intent-to-chill proof requirement was a constitutionally compelled element of the anti-SLAPP statutory scheme, the plaintiff in <em>Equilon </em>asserted that the First Amendment generally bars \u201cliability\u201d for filing lawsuits that are not \u201cshams.\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>at p. 62.) Noting that \u201c[hjundreds of California statutes provide for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party [citations]\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 62), the <em>Equilon </em>court rejected that argument and stated that fee shifting under section 425.16(c) \u201cdoes not make a party \u2018liable\u2019 for filing a lawsuit, but rather simply requires the party that creates the costs to bear them.\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>at p. 62.) The high court also rejected the argument that the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s fee-shifting provisions unconstitutionally \u201cpunish\u201d plaintiffs, explaining that \u201c[p]laintiffs as well as defendants may recover fees: defendants . . . only when the plaintiff burdens free speech with an unsubstantiated claim [citation]; plaintiffs whenever a defendant\u2019s motion to strike is \u2018frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay\u2019 (\u00a7 425.16(c)).\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Equilon </em>is equally applicable here. By providing for a mandatory award of attorney fees in favor of a defendant who prevails on a motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute, section 425.16(c) does not punish, penalize, or impose \u201cliability\u201d on the SLAPP plaintiff. The fee shifting simply requires the plaintiff, as the party whose SLAPP suit caused the defendant to incur attorney fees and other costs, to bear those fees and costs. <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 62.) In this regard, Bernardo correctly acknowledges in her appellant\u2019s opening brief that the fee award under section 425.16(c) \u201cis designed to <em>compensate </em>defendants for the cost of defending the suit. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Our conclusion that the court\u2019s award of attorney fees in favor of Planned Parenthood under section 425.16(c) did not violate Bernardo\u2019s constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances is also compelled by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Schroeder v. Irvine City Council </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 174 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 330] (Schroeder). In <em>Schroeder, </em>the plaintiff, a taxpayer, sued a city, its city council and several city council members, seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the city\u2019s program to increase voter registration was an illegal expenditure of public funds. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 179.) The defendants moved to dismiss the action under the anti-SLAPP statute. The trial court granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff had failed to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits, and awarded attorney fees to the defendants as the prevailing parties under section 425.16(c). <em>(Schroeder, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 179.) On appeal, the plaintiff challenged the dismissal of the lawsuit and also challenged the attorney fee award on the grounds that a mandatory attorney fee award against a taxpayer who has challenged a governmental program would unconstitutionally infringe upon his or her right to petition the government for redress of grievances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 193.) We rejected the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge to the fee award, and held that \u201c[t]he right to petition for redress of grievances includes the right to sue [citation] private as well as governmental entities. [Citation.] However, \u2018the right to petition has never been absolute\u2019 [citation] and \u2018baseless litigation is not immunized by the First Amendment right to petition.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . [Constitutional rights to petition have been subjected to reasonable restrictions to prevent abuse of the right, and narrowly drawn restrictions on that right can be valid. \u201d <em>(Schroeder, supra, </em>at p. 195.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In <em>Schroeder, </em>we recognized that \u201cthe government is injured by meritless suits, that the right to petition does not provide an absolute immunity to citizens who bring meritless suits, and the Legislature may by statute grant governments the ability to recoup their attorney fees. . . .[T]he right to petition may be subject to legislatively imposed conditions and restrictions, provided the restrictions are narrowly drawn to achieve a substantial governmental interest that is content neutral and unrelated to the suppression of the exercise of First Amendment rights. . . . [T]he Legislature may provide for an award of attorney fees to governmental entities for defending against frivolous lawsuits without impermissibly infringing on the right of petition for redress of grievances.\u201d <em>(Schroeder, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 196.) We concluded that the mandatory attorney fee provision set forth in section 425.16(c) \u201cis valid because it seeks to achieve a substantial governmental interest that is content neutral and unrelated to the suppression of the exercise of First Amendment rights and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. There is a substantial governmental interest in deterring unmeritorious lawsuits generally, and that interest assumes greater weight in the arena governed by section 425.16[(c)]: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>unmeritorious lawsuits that can chill the defendant\u2019s exercise of First Amendment rights. Although [plaintiff] argues that the statute is designed to suppress protected activity\u2014his right to sue the government\u2014we conclude the statute is primarily designed to <em>promote and encourage </em>protected conduct\u2014the right of defendants to exercise their First Amendment rights without fear of unmeritorious SLAPP lawsuits.\u201d <em>(Schroeder, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 196, original italics.) We further held that the attorney fee clause of section 425.16 passes constitutional muster because it \u201capplies to all unmeritorious lawsuits premised on acts taken in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of petition or free speech, regardless of the point of view espoused by the plaintiff. It applies only to that narrow category of lawsuits . . . that are premised on acts taken in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s rights of speech, and leaves untouched any other type of lawsuit. . . . Finally, it is closely tailored to achieve these substantial governmental interests because it has no application to most lawsuits . . . but instead applies only to lawsuits in which two narrow conditions are satisfied: first, the court must be satisfied that the lawsuit seeks recovery for acts taken in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s rights of free speech or petition; and second, the lawsuit must be so lacking in merit that, even when the evidence is viewed most favorably to the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Schroeder, supra, </em>at p. 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">2. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Bernardo also claims that section 425.16(c) violated her due process rights in two ways. First, she repeats her contentions that \u201cthe \u2018reasonable probability of success on the merits\u2019 language is unconstitutionally vague,\u201d this standard is \u201cmeaningless in practice,\u201d and \u201c[t]he net result of the standard imposed by [section 425.16] is to require [her] to predict the inherently unpredictable under pain of <em>penalty </em>in the form of attorney fees.\u201d (Italics added.) For the reasons discussed, <em>ante, </em>we have already concluded that the \u201creasonable probability of success on the merits\u201d standard codified in section 425.16(b)(1) (see fn. 11, <em>ante), </em>as interpreted by the California Supreme Court (see <em>Navellier, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 88-89), is not unconstitutionally vague and thus the court\u2019s application of that standard in this matter did not violate Bernardo\u2019s right to due process. As already discussed, the Supreme Court has held that the section 425.16(c) fee-shifting provision that Bernardo challenges here does not unconstitutionally \u201cpunish\u201d plaintiffs whose SLAPP causes of action are subject to dismissal for failure to show a probability of prevailing on the merits. <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 63.) The fee shifting under section 425.16(c) \u201csimply requires the party that creates the costs to bear them.\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Second, Bernardo contends the mandatory fee-shifting provision of section 425.16(c) violates due process because it does not require a showing of fault, such as a reckless disregard for the truth, supported by a heightened evidentiary standard, such as clear and convincing evidence, that she claims is required to impose \u201cdamages,\u201d \u201cliability,\u201d a \u201cfine,\u201d or a \u201cdraconian penalty\u201d in the form of a fee award for activity that involves the exercise of fundamental First Amendment rights, such as the right to pursue litigation. As already discussed, however, the California Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018[t]he right to petition is not absolute, providing little or no protection for baseless litigation\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 64.) Bernardo\u2019s contention is based on the unsupported premise that she had a fundamental First Amendment right to bring a SLAPP against Planned Parenthood. Bernardo has cited no authority, and we are aware of none, that supports her implied assumption that a litigant has a fundamental constitutionally protected right to file a SLAPP suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">3. <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Last, Bernardo contends that the mandatory fee-shifting provision of section 425.16(c) violates her right to equal protection of the law because it \u201ccreates an unconstitutional penalty\u201d and imposes fee liability for \u201cthe exercise of First Amendment rights that discriminates between parties based on the nature of their First Amendment activity and the nature of the plaintiff.\u201d Specifically, Bernardo maintains that (1) the \u201cstatutory language and purpose\u201d indicate that section 425.16(c) and its attorney fees provision are designed to \u201cfavor a defendant\u2019s First Amendment rights to speech over a plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment right to petition and access courts\u201d; and (2) section 425.16, subdivision (d) (hereafter section 425.16(d), discussed, <em>post) </em>\u201ccreates impermissible classifications based upon the identity of the plaintiff as either a public or private attorney general.\u201d We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall \u2018deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,\u2019 which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.

[Citation.] [f] The equal protection clause of the California Constitution similarly states that a person \u2018may not be denied equal protection of laws\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7), and statutory classifications challenged thereunder are analyzed by the same rules applicable to challenges to the Fourteenth Amendment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Health Laboratories, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at pp. 447-448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The <em>Health Laboratories </em>court further explained that \u201c[legislative classifications are presumed valid and will be sustained if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Most statutes challenged on equal protection grounds are tested by this rational basis standard. [Citation.] Only when the classification jeopardizes the exercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic is the statute subject to the heightened review employed in strict scrutiny test. [Citation.] To pass constitutional muster in that case, such statutes must be suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest. [Citation.] For purposes of the strict scrutiny test, a fundamental right means a fundamental constitutional right. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Health Laboratories, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">As already discussed, the California Supreme Court has held that the mandatory section 425.16(c) fee-shifting provision does not unconstitutionally \u201cpunish\u201d or impose \u201cliability\u201d on plaintiffs whose SLAPP causes of action are subject to dismissal for failure to show a probability of prevailing on the merits. <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Bernardo complains that section 425.16(c) \u201cprovides differing liability for fees based upon the nature of petitioning activity\u201d because under that subdivision a plaintiff is liable for mandatory fees without any showing of fault if the defendant prevails, but a defendant is liable for fees only upon a showing that the defendant\u2019s motion to strike is frivolous or solely intended to cause delay. Bernardo asserts that the court\u2019s award of attorney fees in favor of Planned Parenthood in this matter violated her right to equal protection because the result of the application of the section 425.16(c) mandatory fee provision is \u201cto punish the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of the fundamental right to petition the courts by creating a cost not bom[e] by opponents in litigation,\u201d and \u201cthe statute, in effect, makes the courts available to different parties, on different terms, depending upon the nature of their petitioning activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">These assertions are unavailing. There is no fundamental First Amendment right to petition the courts by filing a SLAPP. As already discussed, the California Supreme Court has explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he right to petition is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>absolute, providing little or no protection for baseless litigation\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 64.) Furthermore, the mandatory fee-shifting provision of section 425.16(c) does not bar Bernardo or any other plaintiff from bringing a meritorious claim. Contrary to Bernardo\u2019s assertion, section 425.16(c) does not make the courts \u201cavailable to different parties, on different terms, depending upon the nature of their petitioning activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We also reject Bernardo\u2019s contention that the anti-SLAPP statute unconstitutionally discriminates against her by refusing her the \u201cimmunity\u201d accorded to public prosecutors under section 425.16(d), which provides: \u201cThis section shall not apply to any enforcement action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the Attorney General, district attorney, or city attorney, acting as a <em>public </em>prosecutor.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Bernardo claims that she brought this action for injunctive relief against Planned Parenthood on behalf of the public, without seeking any personal gain, and the effect of section 425.16(d) \u201cis to create a discrimination against private parties advancing the public interest that is inimical\u201d to her constitutionally protected right <em>to </em>equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">This claim is unavailing. In <em>Health Laboratories, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at page 451, the Court of Appeal held that the provision of the anti-SLAPP statute exempting public prosecutors from its strictures does not violate the equal protection clauses (U.S. Const., 14th Amend., \u00a7 1; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7). The <em>Health Laboratories </em>court noted that \u201cSLAPP suits are typically characterized as suits brought not to vindicate a legal right but to interfere with the defendant\u2019s ability to pursue his or her interest. [Citation.] SLAPP plaintiffs do not care so much about winning their lawsuits as they care about delaying and distracting the defendant from his or her objective, which is generally economically adverse to those of the SLAPP plaintiff. SLAPP plaintiffs achieve their goal if their suits deplete the defendant\u2019s resources and energy. [Citations.] The legislative history of section 425.16 plainly implies that its purpose was to prevent the harm caused by such plaintiffs.\u201d <em>(Health Laboratories, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The <em>Health Laboratories </em>court also noted that, \u201c[b]y contrast, a public prosecutor\u2019s enforcement action is not motivated by a retaliatory attempt to gain a personal advantage over a defendant .... <em>The prosecutor\u2019s motive derives from the constitutional mandate to assure that the laws of the state are uniformly enforced and to prosecute any violation of these laws, so that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>order is preserved and the public interest protected. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Health Laboratories, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 450, italics added.) The court explained that \u201c[n]othing in the legislative history of section 425.16 implies that the problem the Legislature sought to rectify thereby was created by prosecutors bringing meritless enforcement actions. The state may properly limit a regulation to the class of persons as to whom it thinks the need for regulation is more crucial or imperative. [Citation.] [f] To enable prosecutors to perform their constitutional duties thoroughly and effectively, laws have been enacted to insulate them from actions that would hinder or deter their enforcement actions. . . . [f] The exclusion of public prosecutors from the anti-SLAPP motion procedure is consistent with the rationale of these immunity statutes. Subjecting them to such a procedure could unduly hinder and undermine their efforts to protect the health and safety of the citizenry at large by delaying an enforcement action. Not only would prosecutors have to respond to the motion at the trial level, they could become ensnared in an appeal, insofar as the grant or denial of a SLAPP motion is immediately appealable. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (j).) False advertising enforcement actions could be particularly susceptible to delay by the moving manufacturer\u2019s easy assertion that the prosecutor\u2019s action interfered with its commercial free speech rights.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 450-451.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">A <em>private </em>plaintiff bringing suit under the UCL or FAL allegedly on behalf of the public is not similarly situated to a public prosecutor because the private litigant\u2019s motive, unlike that of a public prosecutor, does not derive \u201cfrom the constitutional mandate to assure that the laws of the state are uniformly enforced and to prosecute any violation of these laws, so that order is preserved and the public interest protected\u201d <em>(Health Laboratories, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 450). We conclude that the classification created by section 425.16(d)\u2019s exemption of public prosecutors\u2019 enforcement actions from anti-SLAPP motions does not jeopardize the exercise of a fundamental right or categorize litigants on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic; it is rationally related to the state\u2019s legitimate interest in allowing public prosecutors who did not create the SLAPP problem to pursue actions to enforce laws, unencumbered by delay, intimidation, or distraction; and thus it does not violate the equal protection clause of either the United States or California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The orders are affirmed.

Therefore, having an abortion results in a higher risk of getting breast cancer later in life than carrying the pregnancy to term for women under age 30 who have not yet had a full-term pregnancy, [ft] Second, having an abortion increases a wom[a]n\u2019s risk of breast cancer even more than the risk is increased by delaying a first full-term pregnancy.
