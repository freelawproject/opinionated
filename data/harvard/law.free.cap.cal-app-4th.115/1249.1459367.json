The trial court denied the requested relief because the employer\u2019s claim was not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c). The employer contends the court erred in interpreting subdivision (c), because it is not an \u201cinsurer\u201d within the meaning of that provision. It also contends that it has a right to proceed directly against the manufacturer of the overhead door that injured the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">We disagree on both counts. First, the employer, as a self-insurer for purposes of providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits, is deemed to be an \u201cinsurer\u201d providing \u201cother insurance\u201d within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9). Therefore, its claim is excluded as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d and CIGA is not responsible for the amounts paid to the injured employee from the employer\u2019s self-insured retention. Furthermore, to permit the employer to recover the sums directly from the manufacturer of the door, whose insurer was insolvent, would be to permit the employer, as an \u201cinsurer\u201d for the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, to obtain indirectly what it could not obtain directly from CIGA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">John Michael Roth (Roth), a Nutrilite Products (Nutrilite) employee, was injured on November 1, 1999, during the course and scope of his employment. While Roth was on Nutrilite premises, a metal overhead trailer door fell to a \u201cclosed\u201d position, striking him in the back of the head. Roth suffered injuries to his head, neck and left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>Nutrilite paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Roth through RSKCo., Nutrilite\u2019s independent third party workers\u2019 compensation benefits administrator. Nutrilite had workers\u2019 compensation insurance through Insurance Company of Pennsylvania. However, Nutrilite was responsible for the first $250,000 per incident, as its self-insured retention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">In October 2000, Roth filed a complaint against L.A. Door Company (L.A. Door), alleging that it had designed and manufactured the door. He asserted causes of action for negligence, strict products liability and breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">In November 2000, Nutrilite \u201cc/o RSKCo.\u201d filed a complaint in intervention. It sought reimbursement for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits it had paid to Roth on account of his injuries. Nutrilite ultimately paid at least $78,985.99 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Roth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">L.A. Door had insurance coverage through United Pacific Insurance Company. Roth\u2019s claim was covered by that insurance. United Pacific Insurance Company was a subsidiary of Reliance Insurance Company. Reliance Insurance Company was declared insolvent on October 3, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Roth settled his claim against L.A. Door before trial and dismissed his complaint. On the date scheduled for trial on the complaint in intervention, L.A. Door stipulated to liability. The matter went to trial on the issue of whether a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation claim is considered a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the laws applicable to CIGA, and if not, whether Nutrilite could proceed directly against L.A. Door.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">The court ruled against Nutrilite, for two reasons. First, it held the complaint in intervention was barred by Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) because Nutrilite, \u201cas a permissively self-insured employer, [was] an \u2018insurer\u2019 pursuant to Labor Code section 3211 and because its claim as set forth in the complaint in intervention [was] a subrogation claim.\u201d Second, Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9) barred the complaint in intervention because Nutrilite was \u201cnot the \u2018original claimant\u2019 as its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>claim for reimbursement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits [was] derivative and also because [Nutrilite\u2019s] claim [was] a claim by way of subrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Nutrilite filed an appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">A. <em>CIGA: \u201cCovered Claims\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">CIGA was formed to provide insurer insolvency insurance for its members. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.) Pursuant to Insurance Code section 1063.2, CIGA pays and discharges \u201ccovered claims.\u201d The term \u201ccovered claims\u201d is defined in Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c). Subdivision (c)(1) defines \u201ccovered claims\u201d as \u201cthe obligations of an insolvent insurer . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">However, Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c) contains a number of exclusions from this definition. Subdivision (c)(5) provides in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not include any obligations to insurers, insurance pools, or underwriting associations, nor their claims for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation, equitable or otherwise . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9) provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not include (i) any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article available to the claimant or insured nor (ii) any claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name . . . and does not include any claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">At issue is whether the trial court correctly interpreted these provisions in determining, in essence, that Nutrilite\u2019s claim against CIGA was not a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">B. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Subrogation Under CIGA Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">(1) <em>Nutrilite\u2019s contention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">Nutrilite claims that the trial court, in interpreting Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c), incorrectly applied <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number><em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 624 [278 Cal.Rptr. 23], rather than <em>Burrow </em>v. <em>Pike </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 384 [235 Cal.Rptr. 408]. Nutrilite claims there is a split of authority between the appellate courts in the Fifth District <em>(Burrow) </em>and the Third District <em>(Argonaut), </em>and that the trial court should have followed the former as the better reasoned. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">(2) <em>Burrow </em>v. <em>Pike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">We first address <em>Burrow v. Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 384, on which Nutrilite relies. In that case, the plaintiff, an employee of the Department of Transportation, was injured when struck by a truck. The plaintiff filed suit against the owner and the operator of the truck. The Department of Transportation, seeking to recoup the money it had paid to the plaintiff in workers\u2019 compensation benefits, filed a notice of lien claim against any judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff. During the pendency of the action, the defendants\u2019 insurer became insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">The defendants then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the claim of lien, and the trial court granted the motion. Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $75,000 in favor of the plaintiff. However, because the plaintiff and the defendants had stipulated that the workers\u2019 compensation credit was $50,000, the trial court reduced the amount of the award to $25,000. The Department of Transportation filed an appeal, claiming the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine the validity of the lien claim or to affect its right to seek reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation expenses it had paid. The appellate court agreed with the Department of Transportation, and reversed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">At the outset, we observe, first, that <em>Burrow v. Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 384 revolves around certain procedural peculiarities, most notably the judgment on the pleadings with respect to the claim of lien and, second, that the discussion of the workers\u2019 compensation subrogation issue is in dictum. The appellate court held there was no legal basis for the granting of the motion for judgment on the pleadings against the Department of Transportation, which was not a party to the action, and there was no basis for reducing the verdict. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 390.) For this reason, the appellate court not only reversed the judgment on the verdict, but also permitted (a) the withdrawal of the stipulation that was based on the order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings and (b) a limited new trial on the issue of the Department of Transportation\u2019s concurrent negligence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">The appellate court then noted that it was \u201carguably unnecessary\u201d to address the merits underlying the decision of the trial court. (Burrow <em>v. Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 393.) For the purposes of judicial economy, it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>so anyway. The defendants asserted that the claim of lien was barred by, inter alia, the Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c) exclusion from covered claims of claims presented by any person other than the original claimant or claims asserted by right of subrogation. The appellate court reviewed the Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c) definition of \u201ccovered claims,\u201d and certain exclusions therefrom, including the exclusion for \u201c \u2018one claiming by right of subrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Burrow </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 395, italics omitted.) It also considered the underlying purpose of CIGA. The court concluded that, for policy reasons, the section 1063.1, subdivision (c) exclusions from covered claims should not operate to bar recovery in the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">It stated: \u201c[W]e believe the policy which justifies reimbursement of workers\u2019 [compensation benefits for the good of employer and employee alike outweighs the policy underlying the statutory exclusions on which defendants rely, i.e., that neither solvent insurance companies nor state agencies should be allowed to recoup their losses, occasioned when a member insurer becomes insolvent, from those funds earmarked to pay claims of injured individuals otherwise unable to recover from the insolvent member. [][] Therefore, we conclude that defendants\u2019 objection to appellant\u2019s lien based on Insurance Code section 1063 is without merit.\u201d <em>(Burrow v. Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at pp. 399-400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">This is the reasoning Nutrilite would like us to apply. It would like us to conclude, as did the court in <em>Burrow v. Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 384, that the right to recoup monies paid as workers\u2019 compensation benefits trumps the statutory exclusions from \u201ccovered claims\u201d as contained in Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c). We decline to adopt this conclusion, however, inasmuch as we find the reasoning of <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d 624 to be more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">(3) <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">The Third District in <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at page 633 declined to follow the decision in <em>Burrow v. Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 384. In <em>Argonaut, </em>an employee of Hexadyne Energy Corporation was injured when hit by a car driven by an employee of Capitol Oil Corporation. Argonaut Insurance Company, Hexadyne\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, paid benefits to the injured employee. Cal Farm, the insurer for Capitol, was insolvent. The injured employee sued the driver of the car and Capitol. Argonaut intervened to recover the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits it had paid to the injured employee, seeking reimbursement from CIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>CIGA filed a complaint for declaratory relief, requesting a declaration that it was not required to reimburse Argonaut. The trial court denied the requested relief, based on <em>Burrow </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 384. The appellate court reversed, rejecting the <em>Burrow </em>decision. In a lengthy discussion of the case, it characterized the <em>Burrow </em>decision as \u201crewriting] Insurance Code section 1063.1 . . . .\u201d <em>(California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The <em>Argonaut </em>court saw the statutory scheme as clear and unambiguous. It stated: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 are the obligations of insolvent insurers (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(1)), with certain exceptions. Among these exceptions are \u2018obligations to insurers, insurance pools, or underwriting associations, [and] their claims for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation, . . .\u2019 (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(4)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]) and \u2018any claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name . . . and shall not include any claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation. . . .\u2019 (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(9)(ii)).\u201d <em>(California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 628-629, fn. added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The court held that Insurance Code section 1063.1 did not permit CIGA to provide reimbursement to Argonaut because the statute excluded obligations to insurers and claims made by right of subrogation as \u201ccovered claims.\u201d It emphasized that CIGA was intended to provide additional protection for injured persons, and was not meant to be \u201c \u2018a fund for the protection of other insurance companies from the insolvencies of fellow members.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">As we view it, <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d 624 is the better reasoned case. It addresses CIGA\u2019s statutory liabilities in a simple and straightforward manner. The Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c) exclusions are clear and unambiguous and mandate that there is no coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Nutrilite disagrees with our analysis and maintains that the reasoning of the Fifth District in <em>Burrow v. Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 384 should apply. However, as L.A. Door points out, <em>Burrow </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 384 is not the most recent Fifth District case. The Fifth District has spoken again, in <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 104 Cal.App.4th 1433 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 53]. We turn our attention to that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>(4) <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">In <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433, an employee suffered a cumulative injury over the period of a year. During the first two months of that period, the employer was self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. During the remaining 10 months, the employer had workers\u2019 compensation insurance through HIH America. HIH America was subsequently declared insolvent. The employer asserted that CIGA was required to guarantee HIH America\u2019s proportionate share of the workers\u2019 compensation obligation. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board disagreed and dismissed CIGA as a party to the workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">On a writ of review, the appellate court affirmed. In reaching its decision, the court analyzed the various statutory provisions applicable to the workers\u2019 compensation and CIGA issues. First, it stated that \u201c[e]very California employer must secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits by either purchasing third party insurance or obtaining a \u2018certificate of consent to self-insure\u2019 from the Director of Industrial Relations. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Denny\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1439.) It further stated: \u201cWithin the workers\u2019 compensation laws, the term \u2018insurer\u2019 specifically denotes permissibly self-insured employers. Labor Code, section 3211, provides: \u2018 \u201cInsurer\u201d includes the State Compensation Insurance Fund and any private company, corporation, mutual association, reciprocal or interinsurance exchange authorized under the laws of this State to insure employers against liability for compensation <em>and any employer to whom a certificate of consent to self-insure has been issued. </em>\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">In concluding that CIGA was properly dismissed from the proceeding, the <em>Denny\u2019s </em>court stated: \u201c[W]hile the Guarantee Act does not expressly mention employer-provided self-insurance, it references workers\u2019 compensation insurance, which statutorily includes employers with permission to self-insure. Accordingly, an employer self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes provides \u2018other insurance of a class covered by\u2019 the Guarantee Act within the meaning of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9).\u201d <em>(Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1441.) In other words, the claim of the self-insured employer, as a provider of \u201cother insurance\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (c)(9), is not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d payable by CIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Despite the explicit language of <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433, Nutrilite contends the case is inapplicable. As Nutrilite sees it, the case only had to do with the allocation of liability as between multiple responsible parties under Labor Code section 5500.5. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>court in <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at page 1437 explained: \u201cWhen an employee suffers a cumulative injury over time, the employee may claim workers\u2019 compensation benefits against any one or more of successive employers or insurance carriers that employed or insured the employee during a maximum one-year injury period. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5500.5; [citation].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">While it is true that the allocation of liability as between multiple parties was at issue in the case, it certainly was not the only issue the court decided. The court specifically stated that \u201cDenny\u2019s believes a self-insured employer does not provide \u2018insurance\u2019 and is not an \u2018insurer\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Denny\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1440.) The court squarely rejected this contention (ibid.)\u2014the same one that Nutrilite is making now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">(5) <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. v. Superior Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">After oral argument in this case, the Third District again addressed Insurance Code section 1063.1, in <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 109 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 466]. We gave the parties an opportunity to submit further briefing on <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">In <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th 109, a trucker leased two trailers from a trucking company, Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. (Black Diamond), and also contracted to transport freight for Black Diamond. The trucker was required to have Black Diamond named as an additional insured on his liability insurance policy. He was involved in an accident that resulted in the death of one individual and the injury of another. In the ensuing personal injury and wrongful death action, Black Diamond was sued on a respondeat superior theory. Black Diamond was self-insured for the first $1 million in damages and the costs of defense. It filed a cross-complaint for indemnity against the trucker. CIGA, stepping in because the trucker\u2019s insurer was insolvent, asserted that an indemnity cause of action could not be maintained against the insured of an insolvent insurer. The trial court agreed, but the appellate court did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">The appellate court reiterated: \u201cCIGA was created to protect members of the public against the insolvency of an insurance company. It was not created to protect insurance companies against the insolvency of fellow members. [Citation.] Accordingly, the laws relating to CIGA were crafted so that, in the event of an insurer\u2019s insolvency, CIGA would assume the obligations of the insurer up to a statutory maximum, but not where payment would inure to the benefit of a solvent insurer who had insured the risk. (See <em>California Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number><em>Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 624, 629-630 [278 Cal.Rptr. 23]; <em>Collins-Pine Co. v. Tubbs Cordage Co. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 882, 886-887 [271 Cal.Rptr. 20].)\u201d <em>(Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th at p. 116.) Black Diamond, however, was not an insurer, the court held, \u201cand its retention limit [was] not insurance available to it. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Nutrilite asserts that <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th 109, dictates the answer in the case before us because Nutrilite had a self-insured retention, just as did Black Diamond. Therefore, Nutrilite reasons, it is no more an \u201cinsurer\u201d within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(5) than was Black Diamond. However, there are critical distinctions between the two cases that Nutrilite overlooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Black Diamond was not an employer providing workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for an injured employee plaintiff. Rather, Black Diamond, as a purported employer, was itself being sued along with the trucker, its purported employee, and was seeking indemnity from that individual. Unlike the situation before us, and the one in <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433, where workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage was at issue, there was no statutory scheme requiring Black Diamond to provide insurance with respect to the trucker plaintiff. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 3700, subds. (a) &amp; (b) [requiring a private employer to obtain either workers\u2019 compensation insurance or a certificate of consent to self-insure from the Director of Industrial Relations]; <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1439.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">The significance of these factual distinctions was highlighted in <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433, wherein the court stated: \u201c[Wjhile a self-insured employer may not be an \u2018insurer\u2019 when it protects itself against general civil liabilities [citation], an employer is * expressly deemed an \u2018insurer\u2019 if issued a certificate to self-insure for workers\u2019 compensation. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3211.) It reasonably follows that the workers\u2019 compensation liability protection an employer provides itself under the self-insurance program is a class of \u2018insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1441.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">Contrary to Nutrilite\u2019s assertion, the situation in <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th 109 was not \u201cexactly\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>same as the one before us, just because both cases have to do with a self-insured retention. <em>Black Diamond Asphalt, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th 109, is distinguishable from both this case and <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433, for the reasons we have stated, and is of no assistance to Nutrilite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">(6) <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\"><em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433, answers the question before us. Nutrilite, as an authorized self-insurer for the purpose of providing workers\u2019 compensation insurance, is deemed to be an \u201cinsurer\u201d providing \u201cother insurance\u201d within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9). Therefore, its claim is excluded as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d and CIGA is not responsible for the amounts Nutrilite paid to Roth in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. \u201cThe Legislature did not establish the CIGA to protect [the employer] as a self-insurer, but rather, to protect [the employee] as a member of the insured public by ensuring [the employee] received a full disability award. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Also, as L.A. Door emphasizes, <em>Denny\u2019s Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 1433, as the most current opinion on the topic emanating from the Fifth District, serves to resolve the previous split of authority between that district and the Third District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">C. <em>Direct Action Against L.A. Door</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Nutrilite argues that, even if this court holds it has no avenue of recovery against CIGA, it can still proceed directly against L.A. Door. Nutrilite is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">As case law clearly shows, when a claim against CIGA is not a \u201ccovered claim,\u201d the claimant cannot pursue an action for indemnity against the insured whose insurer is insolvent. Otherwise, an \u201cindemnity action would . . . permit [the party bringing the action] to be an indirect conduit to the same insurers who are barred from receiving such indemnity directly. Such a result does not comport with the statutory scheme . . . .\u201d <em>(Collins-Pine Co. v. Tubbs Cordage Co. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 882, 887-888 [271 Cal.Rptr. 20]; see also <em>E. L.

J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-9\"> The record reflects that Nutrilite has been somewhat inconsistent in its characterization of the $250,000 responsibility. The parties\u2019 joint list of stipulated facts describes the amount as a \u201cdeductible.\u201d However, Nutrilite stated in its complaint in intervention that it was \u201cauthorized as a self-insured entity for purposes of providing general workers\u2019 compensation insurance benefits to its employees.\u201d The declaration of Nutrilite\u2019s attorney, in support of the complaint in intervention, contains a statement to the same effect. On appeal, Nutrilite again characterizes its policy as containing \u201ca $250,000 retention per incident.\u201d The judgment implies a finding that Nutrilite was \u201ca permissively self-insured employer,\u201d and there is substantial evidence to support that finding.
