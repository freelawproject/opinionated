Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25249.5-25249.13), adopted by vote of the people at the November 1986 election as Proposition 65, regulates the discharge of specific toxins into California\u2019s drinking water. A Proposition 65 plaintiff alleging an unlawful discharge bears the burden of proving that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>discharge has in fact occurred. Regulations adopted pursuant to Proposition 65 establish a hierarchy of four \u201ctiers\u201d of tests that may be used to measure whether a listed toxin has been discharged. The regulations provide that a discharge occurs if the toxin is detectable using a test from the highest available tier.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In this case, plaintiff alleged that plumbing parts distributed by defendants discharge lead into drinking water. On a motion for summary judgment, defendants asserted that a Tier 1 test for lead in drinking water exists, the trial court agreed that a Tier 1 test exists, and the trial court granted summary judgment because plaintiff had not performed a Tier 1 test. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the test put forward by the defendants is a Tier 1 test. Consequently, we reverse the judgment for defendants and remand for the trial court to consider whether the tests plaintiffs actually performed qualify under any of the tiers provided by Proposition 65\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Defendants Edmund A. Gray Co., Grinnell Corporation, and Thrifty Supply Company (collectively Plumbing Distributors) are distributors of galvanized plumbing parts in California. Galvanization is a process in which steel is dipped in a hot zinc bath. As the zinc cools, it forms a thin coating. The zinc coating protects against rust and corrosion. However, according to an expert for plaintiff Mateel Environmental Justice Foundation (Mateel), when lead is present in a galvanizing bath, it moves to the surface of the zinc coating as the zinc cools. Consequently, the galvanized steel may have small islands of lead on its surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Mateel sued five plumbing distributors. It contended in its first two causes of action that the distributors had violated the discharge and warning provisions of Proposition 65 by selling plumbing parts that discharge lead into drinking water and by failing to warn consumers of this exposure. In a third cause of action, Mateel alleged that these Proposition 65 violations were unlawful business practices under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The trial court trifurcated the case. The first stage was confined to determining whether Mateel could prove that a discharge of lead had occurred. Shortly before the first-stage trial, the Plumbing Distributors filed separate motions for summary adjudication of plaintiff\u2019s various claims. With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>respect to the two pure Proposition 65 claims, the trial court granted summary adjudication after it determined that Mateel had failed to serve legally sufficient 60-day notices of the alleged violations before filing suit. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25249.7.) Those claims are no longer at issue. The trial court allowed the derivative UCL claim to proceed, concluding that Proposition 65\u2019s presuit notice requirements did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">With respect to the UCL discharge claim, the Plumbing Distributors argued that Mateel had no evidence their products discharged lead. In particular, they argued that under California Code of Regulations, title 22, section 12901 (Regulation 12901), Mateel was required to show the existence of lead discharged frorh defendants\u2019 products by means of a state-approved methodology, if one existed. According to the Plumbing Distributors, such a test existed: the Lead and Copper Rule (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 64670 et seq.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mateel responded by submitting seven tests of its own, each purporting to show that defendants\u2019 products discharged lead into drinking water. Mateel argued that it was not required by Regulation 12901 to employ a state-approved methodology if one existed, that its tests were sufficient to show a discharge, and that, in any event, the Lead and Copper Rule was not a state-approved methodology for detecting lead discharged from individual plumbing parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The trial court agreed with the Plumbing Distributors on all issues. It concluded that as a matter of law a state-approved methodology had to be employed if one existed, that the Lead and Copper Rule was such a methodology, that Mateel failed to submit evidence that lead had been detected using the Lead and Copper Rule, and thus that the Plumbing Distributors were entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Mateel has timely appealed, challenging only the ruling on its UCL discharge claim. On appeal, we granted the Attorney General leave to file an amicus curiae brief and appear at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">I. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">A \u201cmotion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) A defendant moving for summary adjudication of a cause of action must show either that one or more elements of the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>action cannot be established or that there is a complete defense. \u201c[A]ll that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff cannot establish at least one element of the cause of action .... [T]he defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such element. . . .\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 853 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493], fn. omitted.) If that burden is met, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact with respect to that cause of action or defense. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2); see <em>Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 467 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 627].)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We review a summary judgment motion de novo to determine whether there is a triable issue as to any material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>(Galanty v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 368, 374 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 67, 1 P.3d 658]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) We are not bound by the trial court\u2019s stated reasons or rationales. <em>(Kids\u2019 Universe v. In2Labs </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 870, 878 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 158].) \u201cIn practical effect, we assume the role of a trial court and apply the same rules and standards which govern a trial court\u2019s determination of a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>(Lenane v. Continental Maritime of San Diego, Inc. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1079 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 121].) Thus, we independently determine the construction and effect of the facts presented to the trial judge as a matter of law. <em>(Saldana v. Globe-Weis Systems Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511-1515 [285 Cal.Rptr. 385].) Summary judgment is a drastic remedy to be used sparingly, and any doubts about the propriety of summary judgment must be resolved in favor of the opposing party. <em>(Kulesa </em>v. <em>Castleberry </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 103, 112 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 669]; <em>WYDA Associates </em>v. <em>Merner </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1709 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">With these principles in mind, we consider the propriety of the summary judgment entered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">II. <em>Proposition 65</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Proposition 65 was designed, in pertinent part, to regulate the discharge or release of cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens) and reproductive toxins (teratogens) into drinking water. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25249.5-25249.13;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>People ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 298 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042].) Under section 25249.5, the discharge prohibition, \u201cNo person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>reproductive toxicity into water or onto or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water, notwithstanding any other provision or authorization of law except as provided in Section 25249.9.\u201d Section 25249.8 requires the state to publish and update annually a list of these known carcinogens and teratogens. Lead is a listed carcinogen and teratogen. (Regs., \u00a7 12000, subd. (b), (c).) It is known to harm sperm formation, impair ovulation, and affect fetal development.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Section 25249.9 sets out several affirmative defenses. Of relevance here, \u201cSection 25249.5 shall not apply to any discharge or release that meets both of the following criteria: ffl(l) The discharge or release will not cause any significant amount of the discharged or released chemical to enter any source of drinking water; [f](2) The discharge or release is in conformity with all other laws and with every applicable regulation, permit, requirement, and order.\u201d (\u00a7 25249.9, subd. (b).) Proposition 65 defines \u201csignificant amount\u201d as \u201cany detectable amount except an amount which would meet the exemption test in subdivision (c) of Section 25249.10 if an individual were exposed to such an amount in drinking water.\u201d (\u00a7 25249.11, subd. (c).) The burden for showing this affirmative defense is on the defendant: \u201cIn any action brought to enforce Section 25249.5, the burden of showing that a discharge or release meets the criteria of this subdivision shall be on the defendant.\u201d (\u00a7 25249.9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Thus, Proposition 65 establishes a series of shifting burdens. In the first instance, a plaintiff must show that a discharge has occurred. Once this burden has been met, the defendant may show, inter alia, that the amount of the discharge is not significant. We deal here only with plaintiff\u2019s initial burden of proving a discharge under section 25249.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">IE. <em>The Lead and Copper Rule Is Not a Tier 1 Test for Lead from Sources Other Than Public Water Systems</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\n<em>A. Regulation 12901</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">A \u201cdischarge\u201d is not defined by Proposition 65, but is defined by the regulations adopted by the California Health and Welfare Agency (HWA)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>implement Proposition 65. Those regulations define a discharge thusly: \u201cFor purposes of Sections 25249.5 and 25249.6 of the Act, no discharge, release or exposure occurs unless a listed chemical is <em>detectable </em>as provided in this section.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (g), italics added.) In turn, subdivision (a) of Regulation 12901 provides, \u201cFor purposes of Section 25249.11, subdivision (c) of the Act, the term \u2018any detectable amount\u2019 means a level detected using a method of analysis referred to in this section. For purposes of this section, \u2018method of analysis\u2019 refers to the method of detection or detection and calculation for a listed chemical in a specific medium, including, but not limited to, water, air, food, or soil, and shall include methods and procedures concerning the number of samples and the frequency and site of sampling that are specific for the listed chemical in question.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Subdivisions (b) through (e) of Regulation 12901 describe a hierarchy of methods of analysis that are to be used in detection. Under subdivision (b), Tier 1 tests are those that have been adopted or employed by one of a specified list of state and local agencies, including the California Department of Health Services. Under subdivision (c), Tier 2 tests are those that have been adopted or employed by a federal agency. Under subdivision (d), Tier 3 tests are those that are generally accepted in the scientific community, as evidenced by publication in professional journals and compilations. Finally, under subdivision (e), Tier 4 tests are those that are scientifically valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Mateel, the Attorney General, and the Plumbing Distributors offer three competing interpretations of this regulation. According to Mateel, it need only prove that any amount of a listed chemical has been discharged; it need not prove that the amount is \u201cdetectable\u201d within the meaning of Regulation 12901, subdivision (g). It is then defendant\u2019s burden to prove that the amount involved is not detectable. According to the Attorney General, a plaintiff must prove that a detectable amount\u2014that is, an amount capable of detection using the applicable tier test\u2014has been discharged, but it may do so by any available evidence, and need not submit a test from the highest tier available. Finally, according to the Plumbing Distributors, a plaintiff must prove that an amount capable of detection using the highest available tier test has been discharged, and if it conducts scientific testing, it may only do so by performing and submitting the results of a test from the highest available tier. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>As we shall explain, at this stage, we need not resolve which of these competing interpretations of the burden of proof under Regulation 12901 is correct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Under Mateel\u2019s and the Attorney General\u2019s interpretations, a defendant seeking summary judgment must produce its own test that shows no detected amount of the toxin. This is the traditional <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 242 [91 L.Ed.2d 202, 106 S.Ct. 2505] approach to a summary judgment, in which the defendant presents evidence on a material issue and puts plaintiff to the test of coming forward with contradictory evidence. The Plumbing Distributors have not employed this approach; they have not submitted their own negative test results as part of their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Under the Plumbing Distributors\u2019 interpretation, a second approach is available: a defendant may show simply that a test from a specific tier exists, and that plaintiff has not produced a positive test from that tier. This approach is a variation on the <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 317 [91 L.Ed.2d 265, 106 S.Ct. 2548] approach, as recently approved in California by <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 845-855, under which a defendant points to an element of plaintiff\u2019s case and demonstrates that the plaintiff will be unable to come forward with evidence to substantiate that element. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">However, even if the Plumbing Distributors\u2019 interpretation of Regulation 12901 were correct\u2014and we expressly do not decide whether this is so\u2014 summary judgment would only be available once the defendant established that a test from a specific tier within the hierarchy exists. The Plumbing Distributors have pointed to a specific test, the Lead and Copper Rule, which they contend is a Tier 1 test, and have tried to show that Mateel\u2019s tests are not Tier 1 tests. We conclude that the Lead and Copper Rule is not a Tier 1 test; therefore, the Plumbing Distributors have failed to meet their summary judgment burden even under their own interpretation of Regulation 12901.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">B. <em>The Lead and Copper Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">The Lead and Copper Rule (Regs., \u00a7 64670 et seq.) was adopted by the California Department of Health Services to monitor and address lead and copper levels in public drinking water distribution systems. It establishes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>protocol for monitoring lead and copper levels in public water systems. (Regs., \u00a7 64670, subd. (a); see Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 64400.10, 64401.85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Under the Lead and Copper Rule, public water distribution systems must identify sampling sites within the distribution system. (Regs., \u00a7 64682, subd. (a).) These sampling sites must each contain lead solder or lead pipes or be served by a lead service line. (Regs., \u00a7 64682, subds. (c)-(f).) One-liter tap and service line water samples must be drawn after letting the water sit in the distribution system for at least six hours. (Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 64671.25, 64683, subds. (a)-(c).) The Lead and Copper Rule specifies the number and frequency of samples to be drawn. (Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 64684-64685.) Subsequent analysis of the samples is to be done in accordance with federal regulations governing the monitoring of contaminants in public water systems. (Regs., \u00a7 64672; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 141.23, 141.89 (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Lead and Copper Rule establishes a threshold concentration, one microgram per liter, below which the lead level shall be considered zero. (Regs., \u00a7 64672, subd. (c)(3).) Public water systems must report their test results on a regular basis (Regs., \u00a7 64691) and, depending on those results, must take steps to install corrosion control, treat the system source water, remove lead service lines, and/or issue warning notices to residents served by the distribution system. (Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 64673-64680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Under Regulation 12901, a method of analysis is any \u201cmethod of detection or detection and calculation for a listed chemical in a specific medium.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (a).) A method of analysis is a Tier 1 method if \u201cthe California Department of Health Services [or one of several other agencies] has adopted or employs [the] method of analysis for a listed chemical in a specific medium . . . .\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The Plumbing Distributors contend that the Lead and Copper Rule is a Tier 1 method of analysis that must be employed by plaintiff in order to meet its burden of proving a detectable amount of lead in drinking water. They argue that it is a test \u201cfor a listed chemical in a specific medium,\u201d specifically, lead in water. (See Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (b)). The Plumbing Distributors reason that the Lead and Copper Rule was adopted by the California Department of Health Services, and tests adopted or employed by that agency are Tier 1 tests (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (b)); a scientific test qualifies as a method of analysis under Regulation 12901 so long as it specifies the \u201cmethods and procedures concerning the number of samples and the frequency and site of sampling,\u201d and the Lead and Copper Rule does so; and the Lead and Copper Rule complies with \u201cgenerally accepted standards and practice for sampling, collection, storage, preparation, chemical analysis, statistical analysis of data, interpretation of results and modeling.\u201d (See Regs., \u00a7 12901, subds. (a), (f).) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Thus, according to the Plumbing Distributors, this makes the Lead and Copper Rule a Tier 1 test, and defendants argue that because Mateel failed to comply with the exact protocol, summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We disagree with this interpretation and application of Regulation 12901. The Lead and Copper Rule is a method of analysis, but it is not a Tier 1 test for lead from sources other than public water systems. When an agency designs, adopts, or employs a test in a manner that renders it specific to a particular context or environment, that test qualifies as a method of analysis only when applied in the same context or environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Lead and Copper Rule includes detailed context-specific sampling procedures. (Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 64671.25, 64682-64685.) These procedures include the requirement that a \u201cwater system\u201d identify and take samples at between 5 and 100 sites over at least two six-month periods. (Regs., \u00a7 64684, subds. (a), (b).) The pool of sites is limited to residences containing copper pipes with lead solder, lead pipes, or pipes serviced by lead service lines. (Regs., \u00a7 64682, subds. (c)-(g).) These sampling requirements limit the applicability of the Lead and Copper Rule. The rule cannot be applied outside a public water system. Given the requirements that multiple sampling sites be used and that those sites involve already-in-place lead solder, lead pipe, or lead service lines, it is of no use for detecting lead discharges from a single specific plumbing part such as the galvanized steel parts at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The Plumbing Distributors argue that the Lead and Copper Rule can be used to test for lead discharges from individual parts. We are not persuaded. Nothing in the Lead and Copper Rule authorizes a private plaintiff to identify places where a defendant\u2019s parts are already in use (or plumb in new parts), go to a public water distribution system, demand that specific new sampling sites be used adjacent to those parts (which may or may not comply with the Lead and Copper Rule\u2019s limits on where samples must be taken), and then separate out the sampling results from those sites, while discarding the results from the dozens or hundreds of other samples taken in accordance with the Lead and Copper Rule\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Moreover, the Lead and Copper Rule has been adopted and employed by the California Department of Health Services only for testing for lead in water in public water systems. It is not a universal test for lead in water; it has never been adopted or employed as a methodology of general application. Because it has only been employed in the context of analyzing an entire public water system, it is not a valid Tier 1 test outside that context, nor is it a valid test for detecting discharges from other sources. Thus, the fact that this case involves testing for lead in water, and the Lead and Copper Rule <em>also </em>involves testing for lead in water, does not qualify the Lead and Copper Rule as a Tier 1 test for purposes of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Consider the hypothetical of a lead discharge directly into a water reservoir. (See <em>People ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 304.) Should a plaintiff be required to take the allegedly polluted water, inject it into various parts of a public water system, and then test it there? Clearly not. A scientifically valid, state-adopted test suitable for measuring a particular toxin in a particular medium in one unique environment may not be a suitable way to test for that toxin in that medium in any other environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we do not second-guess the judgment of either the HWA in establishing standards for each tier of tests or the California Department of Health Services in adopting the Lead and Copper Rule. Instead, our conclusion is consonant with the reasoning underlying Regulation 12901\u2019s hierarchy. The reason the HWA chose to look first to tests employed by local and state regulatory agencies was because \u201cit is likely [regulated] entities are using such methods\u201d already to self-monitor their own emissions. (HWA, Final Statement of Reasons (1988) p. 6.) In addition, \u201cthe selection of methods by State and local regulatory agencies is based on considerations of the availability of the method to the regulated community and of the suitability of the method to characteristics unique to a particular locality.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>When a methodology\u2019s protocol confines its application to one unique context\u2014here, an entire public water distribution system\u2014there is no likelihood that regulated entities in wholly different contexts will already be using the method to self-monitor. Nor does the methodology carry with it any agency imprimatur that it is suitable for testing in any other context. Moreover, the acknowledgement that the suitability of a method may vary from locality to locality supports the notion that tests may be context or environment specific, and that a test suitable in one context may not be appropriate in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">We note as well that the elements identified by the Plumbing Distributors as necessary to qualify a test as a Tier 1 are not in fact all necessary. Regulation 12901 defines a \u201cmethod of analysis\u201d for detecting toxic chemicals simply as any \u201cmethod of detection or detection and calculation for a listed chemical in a specific medium.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (a).) By its terms, Regulation 12901 does not require a specific sampling protocol as a necessary element of a method of analysis. Rather, the regulation more narrowly requires that if a method of detection does specify \u201cmethods and procedures concerning the number of samples and frequency and site of sampling that are specific for the listed chemical in question, \u201d those methods and procedures shall be considered an integral part of the method of analysis and must be followed and applied. <em>{Ibid.) </em>If the methodology\u2019s design does not include chemical-specific sampling procedures, then a party employing the method must still abide by \u201cgenerally accepted standards and practice for sampling\u201d when performing the test. (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Regulation 12901\u2019s testing hierarchy was intended to eliminate threshold disputes over conflicting test results using different methodologies and over which tests should be used. It was not intended to create an insuperable barrier to identifying actual discharges when they occur. We decline to interpret or apply the Regulation in a fashion that would frustrate the purpose of the statute which it implements, Proposition 65\u2014a statute intended to eliminate, insofar as possible, toxic discharges into California\u2019s drinking water. (See <em>State ex rel. Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 314 [as a \u201cremedial statute,\u201d Proposition 65 must be \u201cconstrued broadly to accomplish [its] protective purpose\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Consequently, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the ground that the Plumbing Distributors had shown a Tier 1 test to exist and Mateel had failed to conduct a Tier 1 test. It remains possible that a Tier 1 test for lead in water does exist. For example, the Lead and Copper Rule requires that \u201c[a]nalyses for lead ... be conducted using the methods as prescribed at 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 141.89.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 64672, subd. (a).) In turn, the Code of Federal Regulations identifies specific methods for lead detection that may well apply generally to the detection of lead in water and may well qualify as either Tier 1 or Tier 2 tests. (40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 141.89, 141.23 (k)(l).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the Plumbing Distributors did not attempt to prove that these methods were Tier 1 or 2 tests, nor did they attempt to prove that Mateel had failed to comply with one or more of these methodologies. Instead, they rested their argument on the Lead and Copper Rule as a whole. Because the Lead and Copper Rule does not qualify as a Tier 1 test for purposes of these allegations, summary judgment on this basis cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">IV. <em>The Trial Court Must Rule in the First Instance on the Plumbing Distributors\u2019 Evidentiary Objections and Whether Any ofMateel\u2019s Tests Qualify as a Method of Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In the alternative, the Plumbing Distributors propose that summary judgment was proper because several of Mateel\u2019s tests were inadmissible. We will remand this case to the trial court to consider these evidentiary matters in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In response to the Plumbing Distributors\u2019 motions, Mateel came forward with a series of scientific tests detecting lead discharged from the Plumbing Distributors\u2019 plumbing parts. Under Regulation 12901, these tests constitute evidence of a discharge so long as they are admissible and fall within at least the lowest tier of available tests, Tier 4, the tier that covers all \u201cscientifically valid\u201d tests that do not fall within a higher tier. (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In the trial court, the Plumbing Distributors moved to exclude four of the seven tests performed by Mateel: the Hovanec test, the NSF test, the Exhibit 9 test, and the Exhibit 10 test. They argued that these tests failed to satisfy the standards for scientific reliability imposed by the <em>Kelly </em>rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]; see <em>Frye v. U.S. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1923) 54 U.S. App. D.C. 46 [293 F. 1013].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court granted this motion, but the record demonstrates that it did not do so on <em>Kelly </em>grounds. At an April 23, 2002, hearing, Mateel sought clarification of the basis for the exclusion. The trial court confirmed that it excluded the tests based on Mateel\u2019s purported failure to comply with Regulation 12901. In other words, it excluded the tests because it concluded that the Plumbing Distributors had shown a Tier 1 test existed (the Lead and Copper Rule), and thus the results of any test which was not a Tier 1 test were irrelevant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Generally, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Rowland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 266 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 841 P.2d 897].) However, when the exclusion of expert testimony rests on a matter of statutory interpretation, we apply de novo review. <em>(Plunkett v. Spaulding </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 114, 126 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 377], disapproved on other grounds by <em>Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser </em>(1999) 22 Cal.4th 31, 39-40 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 293, 989 P.2d 720].) As discussed <em>ante, </em>we disagree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>12901\u2019s requirements for Tier 1 tests. Because the Lead and Copper Rule is not a Tier 1 test, the premise underlying the trial court\u2019s exclusion was incorrect, and the tests should not have been excluded on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Plumbing Distributors invite us to decide whether the challenged tests are admissible under <em>Kelly. </em>We decline. When a trial court finds it unnecessary to rule on evidentiary objections, \u201cit is not the function of an appellate court to make such evidentiary rulings in the first instance.\u201d <em>(Sambrano </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 225, 235 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].) Thus, while we review a trial court\u2019s ruling, not its rationale, and will not reverse a correct ruling issued for the wrong stated reason <em>(Mayer v. C.W. Driver </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 48, 64 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 535]), it is not for us to determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling might still be correct on a factual and evidentiary basis not yet considered by it. That task is reserved for the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Our analysis of the Lead and Copper Rule requires that this matter be remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the trial court must reconsider the Plumbing Distributors\u2019 motions in limine and determine whether the four challenged tests are admissible under <em>Kelly. </em>Provided that one or more of Mateel\u2019s tests is admissible under <em>Kelly, </em>the motion for summary judgment must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">To assist the trial court on remand, we address one final issue. The Plumbing Distributors contend that Mateel\u2019s tests are categorically invalid because they were not performed on drinking water, as opposed to any other water, and Regulation 12901 requires that tests be performed for the listed chemical in a \u201cspecific medium.\u201d Nothing in Regulation 12901 or the supporting Final Statement of Reasons supports such a narrow construction of the phrase \u201cspecific medium.\u201d In particular, Regulation 12901 defines a method of analysis as a \u201cmethod of detection or detection and calculation for a listed chemical in a specific medium, <em>including, but not limited to, water, air, food, or soil </em>. . . .\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 12901, subd. (a), italics added.) The examples given show that \u201cwater\u201d is a specific medium under Regulation 12901, and that a test for lead in \u201cwater\u201d will qualify as a method of analysis so long as it meets the other requirements of Regulation 12901.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mateel\u2019s tests are not categorically invalid for any alleged failure to use \u201cdrinking water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The judgment for defendants is reversed.
