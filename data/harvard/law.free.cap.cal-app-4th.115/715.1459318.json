We reverse the portion of the judgment for unpaid double-time hours worked, and remand the order re plan of distribution. In all other respects the judgment and postjudgment orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">1. <em>Early Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The plaintiffs are former or current claims representatives working for FIE in California who brought this action on behalf of themselves and other claims representatives employed in a similar capacity. Their complaint filed October 2, 1996, and amended two months later alleges that FIE followed the practice of refusing to pay overtime compensation to claims representatives on the ground that they were employed in an administrative capacity and therefore exempt from the overtime pay regulations of the California Industrial Welfare Commission. The plaintiffs sought unpaid overtime compensation under Labor Code section 1194 for a period beginning on October 1, 1993, and continuing until trial, as well as injunctive relief to assure future compliance with state overtime regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">After extensive discovery, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification supported by depositions of prospective class members and other evidence. Granting the motion in an order filed May 28, 1998, the trial court found that the class was \u201cso numerous as to make it impracticable to join all members,\u201d there were \u201cquestions of law and fact common to the class,\u201d plaintiffs were representative of the class, and a class action was \u201csuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d The order defined the class as consisting of claims representatives working for FIE\u2019s Personal Lines Division in California during the relevant period, who were assigned to handle property, automobile physical damage, and liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">FIE sought review of the order certifying the class in an earlier appeal, which we dismissed as procedurally improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Plaintiffs effectively sought an adjudication of FIE\u2019s liability in a motion for summary adjudication of the exempt or nonexempt status of the class members. In an order filed April 21, 1999, the trial court rejected FIE\u2019s claim that the claims representatives were employed in an exempt administrative capacity and ruled that the class was subject to the overtime regulations of the Industrial Welfare Commission. The court found that claims adjusting was \u201ca product or service which FIE\u2019s operation exists to provide\u201d and that claims representatives \u201cdevote their time to carrying out [this] product/service as opposed to its \u2018administrative\u2019 functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The trial court subsequently awarded the plaintiffs interim attorney fees on a finding that they had \u201cprevailed on liability issues.\u201d Appealing from this award, FIE challenged the adjudication of nonexempt status as a predicate for the attorney fee award and questioned the trial court\u2019s statutory authority to award interim attorney fees. In our decision in <em>Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 805 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 59] (hereafter <em>Bell II), </em>we upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiffs were nonexempt employees but reversed the interim award of attorney fees on separate statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">2. <em>Contested Class Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On September 22, 1999, approximately six months after the summary adjudication of nonexempt status, FIE moved for \u201can order granting declaratory judgment as requested by plaintiffs . . . , decertifying the class and issuing an injunction requiring individual class members to commence administrative proceedings before the Labor Commissioner for a determination of individual damage claims.\u201d FIE argued that damages could best \u201cbe litigated on an individual basis\u201d in an administrative proceedings pursuant to Labor Code section 98. Opposing the motion, plaintiffs relied in part on the rule that class decertification must be based on a showing of changed circumstances. The trial court denied the motion on this basis, finding \u201cno changed circumstances rendering class certification no longer proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">FIE next moved for the court to issue a second notice of pendency of action, both to employees who received the original notice mailed in July 1998 and those who were hired thereafter, which would give employees an opportunity to opt out of the class. The trial court ordered the notice, with a request for exclusion from the class, to be sent only to new employees who had not received the first notice. Approximately 5 percent of the class ultimately chose to opt out of the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">On May 24, 2001, less than a month before trial, FIE moved again to decertify the class on the ground that the recently completed depositions of the statistical sample of class members revealed that 9 percent of the class members did not claim unpaid overtime compensation. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that the inclusion of these employees in the class did not prejudice FIE and \u201cjudicial economy is served\u201d by denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">3. <em>Trial Management Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Following the adjudication of the plaintiffs\u2019 nonexempt status, the parties submitted to the court a series of proposals and counterproposals for management of the damages-phase trial, which led to an initial ruling entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>April 28, 2000, that set the context for later pretrial rulings. In status conference statements filed in 1999, plaintiffs proposed to prove class-wide aggregate damages by statistical sampling. FIE took the \u201cposition that damages recoverable by each class member must be tried on an individual basis\u201d and announced an intention to take an initial 52 depositions of an estimated 2,500 individuals in the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">By February 2000, both parties were assisted by statisticians\u2014plaintiffs retained Richard Drogin and FIE retained Roy Weinstein. Plaintiffs submitted a proposed trial management plan for a scheduled hearing on April 21, 2000, supported by a declaration of Richard Drogin, which proposed statistical sampling to achieve a one-hour-per-week margin of error with a \u201cconfidence interval\u201d of 95 percent. He calculated that a sample of 95 employees would be necessary to achieve this level of accuracy. In response, FIE called for \u201cindividual mini-trials,\u201d but, if they were not allowed, it proposed a sampling plan based on the same 95 percent confidence interval but designed to achieve a half-hour-per-week margin of error. Its statistician, Roy Weinstein, calculated that a sample of 1,325 employees would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In reply, plaintiffs noted that the wide variation in estimated class size reflected different assumptions about the variability of the data. They proposed a two-stage plan. The parties would first conduct a pilot random sample of 50 class members to refine their assumptions as to the variability of the data, and then seek rulings on the appropriate margin of error and the size of the employee sample. Generally accepting this methodology, Weinstein filed a supplemental declaration shortly before the hearing on April 21, 2000, that characterized the plaintiffs\u2019 proposal as \u201creasonable.\u201d At the hearing itself, the parties announced an agreement on the initial step of taking depositions of a randomly chosen sample of 50 individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The order following the hearing filed April 28, 2000, provided that \u201c[tjhe damages-phase trial\u201d would \u201cdetermine classwide aggregate damages\u201d by extrapolating from \u201ca representative sampling of class members.\u201d The order directed depositions of \u201can initial pilot sample of 50 randomly selected class members\u201d and appointed a special master to resolve any disputes concerning these depositions. The court directed a target date for completion of these depositions and asked for the submission of a joint report of their experts. The order further directed the parties to \u201cregularly meet-and-confer\u201d following the depositions \u201cin an attempt to reach agreement on the number of weekly overtime hours worked and/or the number of hours worked per week by each of the 50 deposed class members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Both parties filed status conference statements for a hearing on August 4, 2000. Plaintiffs proposed a margin of error of 1.5 overtime hours per week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and FIE proposed a margin of error of 0.75 hours per week. In a joint declaration submitted for the hearing, the experts, Drogin and Weinstein, announced that they had \u201cidentified a range of sample sizes associated with different margins of error. A decision as to the appropriate margin of error for purposes of this litigation is left for the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d The margins of error ranged from one-half hour per week to two hours. Thus, a margin of error of 0.75 hours would call for a sample size of 529 and a margin of error of 1.5 hours would require a sample of 159. In either case, the results of the 50 depositions in the pilot sample could be deducted from the total number of individuals examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The experts\u2019 calculations were made possible by the parties\u2019 success in reaching agreement on work calendars reflecting the deposition testimony regarding work patterns of the 50 employees in the pilot sample. In addition, the parties \u201cagreed upon a method [of] determining an appropriate measure for overtime hours worked\u201d and calculated total overtime hours for each deponent. They then divided total overtime hours of all deponents by total weeks worked to arrive at \u201can estimate of average weekly overtime hours worked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">At the August 4th hearing, the trial court suggested that the parties consider a one-hour weekly margin of error, which, according to the experts\u2019 joint declaration, would require a total of 330 depositions. With the apparent agreement of the parties (see pp. 755-757, <em>post), </em>the court provisionally ordered 280 additional depositions to be taken, with this number to be reviewed after completion of 100 depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Later in the year, Drogin and Weinstein filed a second joint declaration stating that they had reviewed the results of an additional 99 depositions (one transcript was not available) and calculated that a one-hour-per-week margin of error could be achieved with a sample size of only 286. Relying on the declaration, the trial court ordered an additional 136 depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The parties ultimately exceeded this goal and deposed a total of 295 individuals. Remarkably, they reached agreement on work calendars reflecting the testimony of all deponents. (See p. 757, <em>post.) </em>The two experts both calculated that the average (or mean) weekly overtime recorded in the work calendars was 9.42 hours per week and they calculated the margin of error to be 0.9 hours per week, slightly better than originally contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">FIE nevertheless argued that the sample was subject to varying interpretations. These differences in interpretation between plaintiffs and FIE framed the issues at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>4. <em>Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In a brief jury trial, the plaintiffs presented only two expert witnesses, statistician Richard Drogin, and a certified public accountant, Paul Regan. FIE relied on a single witness, statistician Roy Weinstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Drogin recounted that, in early 2000, he began working with FIE\u2019s expert, Weinstein, to develop a random sample for a statistical estimate of average overtime. He related the process of developing agreed work calendars for a sample of 295 employees and calculating overtime hours under California law. The parties reached virtually identical calculations of the total overtime hours in the sample, i.e., 438,000, and the total number of weeks the deponents worked within the class of claims representatives, i.e., 46,607. By simply dividing total overtime hours by total weeks, it could be calculated that the average weekly overtime was 9.42 hours\u2014a figure that included 0.37 hours per week of work entitled to double-time compensation. Because the sample was representative of the population, Drogin testified that it was \u201cstatistically appropriate\u201d to extrapolate the average number of overtime hours to the entire class. The margin of error for this extrapolation was plus or minus 0.9 of an hour per week, with a 95 percent level of confidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Regan testified that he secured FIE payroll records for all 2,402 class members for the period beginning October 1, 1993, and ending June 26, 2001. In a 625-page printout, he calculated overtime on a person-by-person basis using the average overtime figure of 9.42 hours per week and aggregated the individual calculations into a classwide total. He separately calculated unpaid overtime compensation reflecting time-and-a-half of base salary, overtime on bonus pay, and overtime reflecting a double-time rate of pay. The totals were $89,425,942, for time-and-a-half overtime, $1,265,255 for overtime on bonus pay, and $1,210,337 for double time. When Weinstein later offered a somewhat different interpretation of FIE\u2019s payroll records in his trial testimony, Regan presented on rebuttal a revised calculation of $88,647,787 for time-and-a-half overtime on base salary, which gave effect to FIE\u2019s interpretation of its records.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Through its expert witness, Weinstein, FIE presented a case for determining aggregate overtime on the basis of median weekly overtime of 7.27 hours. Weinstein offered two reasons for using the median figure rather than the mean which was used by Drogin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he maintained that the mean may be misleading when a sample includes extreme values, or outliers, deviating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>widely from other data. He stressed the variation in weekly overtime reported by the 295 deponents, including 11 employees who reported working an average of 26 hours or more of overtime. Secondly, he argued that the sample results were distorted upward by \u201cresponse bias.\u201d Some 36 claims representatives did not respond to deposition notices and subpoenas, forcing the parties to depose another group of 36 randomly selected class members. He inferred that those who responded to the notices felt more positively about the plaintiffs\u2019 claims than those who failed to respond and therefore the substitution affected \u201cthe integrity of the original sample\u201d by introducing an upward bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The case was submitted to the jury on the afternoon of July 9, 2001. The next day, the jury unanimously returned a special verdict finding that unpaid time-and-a-half overtime compensation owed to the class as a whole was $88,798,871.12 and unpaid double-time overtime compensation was $1,210,337. The former figure corresponded closely to Regan\u2019s revised calculation of overtime on base salary but excluded overtime on bonus pay; the latter figure accepted Regan\u2019s calculation of unpaid double-time compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">5. <em>Posttrial Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Shortly after the jury verdict, plaintiffs proposed three options for a plan of distribution: (1) a distribution attributing the average weekly overtime hours to all employees and calculating individual payments solely on the basis of employment tenure and salary, (2) a distribution preceded by the mailing of claim forms requiring class members to say if they claimed \u201csome\u201d damages or none, and (3) a detailed claim form with an administrative proof-of-claims procedure. Plaintiffs argued that FIE had no standing to intervene in the plan of distribution. For its part, FIE called for the third option of an administrative proof-of-claims procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Without directly ruling on FDE\u2019s right to object, the trial court stated at a hearing on August 1, 2001, that it would allow FIE to comment on the plan of distribution as a matter of courtesy and directed the parties to meet and confer to resolve issues presented by the third option. In two later hearings, the plaintiffs developed a revised version of the third option reflecting FIE\u2019s written objections and arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">On September 20, 2001, the court entered an order adopting plaintiffs\u2019 revised plan of distribution, subject to certain further modifications. The plan provided for the distribution of a damages fund consisting of the award for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>unpaid overtime ($90,009,208.12), plus prejudgment interest,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> less costs and fees payable to class counsel as a percentage of the common fund and \u201cservice payments\u201d to the five named plaintiffs compensating them for their efforts in bringing the action. Any statutory attorney fees and costs awarded under Labor Code section 1194 would be offset against attorney fees and costs payable from the common fund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court entrusted administration of the plan of distribution to a claims administrator and retained jurisdiction to oversee its administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The plan provided that payments to the 295 employees in the random sample, as well as 48 additional employees deposed during the damages phase of the litigation, would be based on their deposition testimony of overtime hours worked. Other payments would be made only to those employees submitting proof-of-claim forms with statements of average weekly overtime hours worked. The payments would be based on these statements of overtime worked, as well as the wages and tenure of the employees as class members. The information regarding employees\u2019 wages and tenure would be drawn from the FIE database and preprinted on the claim forms mailed to class members, who would be given an opportunity to challenge it. Any unresolved disputes would be referred to a special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In the event claims should exceed the net damages fund, the claims administrator would distribute to each class member a percentage of the fund equivalent to that class member\u2019s claim share as a proportion of all class members\u2019 claim shares. If claims should be less than the net damages fund, the judgment gave FIE a right to recover undistributed prejudgment interest but deferred a decision on any unpaid residue of the damages fund itself to a later proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">A judgment filed on September 24, 2001, adopted by reference the plan of distribution. Two subsequent postjudgment orders addressed important aspects of the plan of distribution. First, on November 28, 2001, the court awarded to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attorney fees in the amount of 25 percent of the total damages fund recovered for the class, consisting of back pay and interest, plus expenses in the sum of $941,884.73. Secondly, on April 23, 2002, the court appointed a claims administrator and approved a claim form, with an accompanying background statement and claim form instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The background statement accompanying the claim form explained that the employees were entitled to money under the terms of a judgment awarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>damages for unpaid overtime compensation to claims representatives working for FIE in California. The amount of the damage fund was determined by deposing a representative sample of 295 employees regarding their overtime hours. The statement informed employees that the deposed employees worked an average of 9.42 overtime hours per week and set forth in a chart the precise numbers of employees reporting at intervals between zero to 38 hours of overtime, i.e., 39 employees worked between 4.01 and 6 hours of overtime, 35 between 6.01 and 8 hours, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The instructions gave precise directions on how to calculate overtime hours worked. The estimate of weekly overtime hours worked was to be based on the employee\u2019s \u201cbest recollection, but it need not be precise if [the employee did] not have precise records or recollections.\u201d By signing the claim form, the employee was \u201cdeclaring under penalty of perjury\u201d that the information provided was correct to the best of his or her knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">A. <em>Law of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In its first assignment of error, FIE urges that we reconsider our decision in the prior appeal in light of \u201c[r]ecent developments in federal law.\u201d As FIE recognizes, the reconsideration of a prior appeal is ordinarily precluded by the law-of-the-case doctrine. \u201cUnder this doctrine, \u2018the decision of an appellate court, stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case, conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Nally </em>v. <em>Grace Community Church </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 278, 301-302 [253 Cal.Rptr. 97, 763 P.2d 948]; see also <em>Adams v. Pacific Bell Directory </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-100 [3 Cal.Rptr. 3d 365].) The law of the case, however, is a procedural rule that is subject to certain exceptions. <em>(George Arakelian Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1279, 1291 [265 Cal.Rptr. 162, 783 P.2d 749].)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">\u201cThe principal ground for making an exception to the doctrine of law of the case is an intervening or contemporaneous change in the law.\u201d <em>(Clemente v. State of California </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 202, 212 [219 Cal.Rptr. 445, 707 P.2d 818].) The exception is limited to changes in \u201cthe <em>controlling </em>rules of law.\u201d <em>(Salazar </em>v. <em>Eastin </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 836, 859 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 21, 890 P.2d 43], italics added; <em>DiGenova v. State Board of Education </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 167, 179-180 [18 Cal.Rptr. 369, 367 P.2d 865].) As explained in <em>Gore v. Bingaman </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 118, 123 [124 P.2d 17], \u201cthe rule should never be made the instrument of injustice. Thus, where the controlling rules of law have been altered or clarified in the interval between the first and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>second appeal and adherence to the previous decision would result in defeating a just cause, it has been held that the court will not hesitate to reconsider its prior determination.\u201d (See also <em>Davidson v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 514, 530 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 739]; <em>Building Industry Assn. v. City of Oceanside </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 744, 759-760 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">FIE predicates its claim of an intervening change in the controlling rules of law on an opinion letter of the Administrator of the Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division, two appellate court decisions and one district court decision arising from the Ninth Circuit <em>(Bothell v. Phase Metrics, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 299 F.3d 1120; <em>Webster v. Public School Employees of Washington </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 247 F.3d 910; <em>Palacio v. Progressive Ins. Co. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2002) 244 F.Supp.2d 1040), and two other federal district court decisions <em>(Jastremski v. Safeco Ins. Companies </em>(N.D.Ohio 2003) 243 F.Supp.2d 743; <em>Schaefer </em>v. <em>Indiana Michigan Power Co. </em>(W.D.Mich. 2002) 197 F.Supp.2d 935). To assess the significance of these authorities, we must first review our prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In <em>Bell II, </em>we upheld the trial court\u2019s summary adjudication that claims representatives working for FIE\u2019s Personal Lines Division in California were not exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the Industrial Welfare Commission\u2019s wage order No. 4, codified in California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 11040, subdivision 1(A). Our analysis proceeded in four steps. First, we construed the exemption as requiring an employer to prove <em>both </em>that an employee is employed in an \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d <em>and </em>that the employee is \u201c \u2018engaged in work which is primarily intellectual, managerial, or creative, and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 810-812.) Secondly, we concluded that federal authorities construing parallel provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq. (ELSA)) were relevant to construing the exemption provision of wage order No. 4. <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>at pp. 812-819.) Thirdly, we found that a core concept appearing in the federal interpretative regulations and decisional law\u2014the administrative/production worker dichotomy\u2014provided a useful approach to determining whether an employee worked in an \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d as required by the exemption provision of wage order No. 4. <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>at pp. 819-823.) Fourthly, we found that the evidence submitted on the motion for summary adjudication compelled the conclusion that the plaintiff employees were production workers within the meaning of the administrative/production worker dichotomy and, on that ground, we held that they were not employed in an administrative capacity within the meaning of the exemption of title 8, section 11040, subdivision 1(A). <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>at pp. 823-829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>In this appeal, FIE primarily directs its argument at the third and fourth parts of the opinion. The analysis in the third section of the opinion evolved from our prior conclusions that the Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) intended the term \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d to have an independent meaning and that the parallel provisions of federal law could provide guidance in determining that intended meaning. We noted that federal interpretative regulations relating to the term \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d could be grouped into those relating to \u201cthe <em>role </em>of administrative employees in a business enterprise, the actual <em>duties </em>of the employees, and the employees\u2019 level of remuneration.\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 819.) Of these three approaches, it was the body of federal interpretative law dealing with the employee role in the business enterprise that served to give the term \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d a meaning independent of other language in title 8, section 11040, subdivision 1(A). A central concept in this body of interpretative law is the administrative/production worker dichotomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The administrative/production worker dichotomy draws on 29 Code of Federal Regulations (hereafter C.F.R.) part 541.2 (2003), which defines the statutory phrase \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d as referring to an employee whose primary duty consists of \u201cwork directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer . . . .\u201d (See also \u00a7 541.214(a).) As elucidated in part 541.205(a), this language calls for a distinction between \u201cthose types of activities relating to the administrative operations of a business as distinguished from \u2018production\u2019 or, in a retail or service establishment, \u2018sales\u2019 work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">This dichotomy suggested by 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(a) has become a generally accepted framework of analysis in the decisional law construing the statutory term \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d in the FLSA. The cases distinguish between \u201c \u2018those employees whose primary duty is administering the business affairs of the enterprise from those whose primary duty is producing the commodity or commodities, whether goods or services, that the enterprise exists to produce and market.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 821, citing <em>Dalheim </em>v. <em>KDFW-TV </em>(5th Cir. 1990) 918 F.2d 1220, 1230, fn. omitted.) Thus, in <em>Reich v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. </em>(D.Kan. 1994) 853 F.Supp. 1325, 1330, the court \u201cexamined the duties of the plaintiff escrow closers \u2018to determine whether they carry out Chicago Title\u2019s day-to-day operations [as production workers] ... or whether they administer the business affairs . . . [of the company as administrative workers].\u2019 \u201d (See <em>Bell II, supra, </em>at pp. 822-823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The fourth section of our opinion in <em>Bell II </em>reviewed the evidence concerning the work of claims representatives in the California branch claims offices of FIE\u2019s Personal Lines Division. We concluded; \u201cthe undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>evidence places the work of the claims representatives squarely on the production side of the administrative/production worker dichotomy. The undisputed evidence establishes that claims adjusting is the sole mission of the 70 branch claims offices where plaintiffs worked. The claims representatives are fully engaged in performing the day-to-day activities of that important component of the business.\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Turning to the propriety of the summary adjudication, we noted that \u201cthe administrative/production worker dichotomy is a somewhat gross distinction that may not be dispositive in many cases.\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 826.) While federal interpretative regulations served to elucidate and qualify the distinction, there are no comparable interpretative regulations governing IWC work orders. Accordingly, we stressed \u201cthat California courts must use great caution in granting summary judgment or summary adjudication on the basis of such a broad distinction as the administrative/production worker dichotomy.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 827.) Nevertheless, we found that the evidence <em>in the record before us </em>was sufficiently clear to justify the trial court\u2019s summary adjudication. Our opinion in <em>Bell II </em>was based on the restricted record before us and cannot be read out of that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The record showed that the claims representatives processed \u201ca large number of small claims\u201d and, according to FIE\u2019s own characterization, their duties were restricted to \u201c \u2018the routine and unimportant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 827-828.) We concluded that these work activities \u201cplace[dj plaintiffs in the sphere of rank and file production workers\u201d in this part of the FIE business organization. <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>at p. 828.) Our conclusion obviated the need to inquire whether the employees\u2019 duties came within the criteria of subdivision 1(A)(1) of wage order No. 4, \u201cthat is, whether the plaintiffs are \u2018engaged in work which is primarily intellectual, managerial, or creative, and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>at p. 828.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We find nothing in <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Public School Employees of Washington, supra, </em>247 F.3d 910, and <em>Bothell v. Phase Metrics, Inc., supra, </em>299 F.3d 1120, that is inconsistent with our decision. The decisions both pursued the administrative/production worker dichotomy as a generally accepted framework of analysis, but the factual situations in the two cases did not easily lend themselves to this customary analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In <em>Webster, </em>the plaintiff was a field representative for a public employees\u2019 union. Seeking to put himself on the production side of the dichotomy, he argued that he assisted in performing the primary service goal of the unions\u2014the negotiation of collective bargaining units. The court observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>that the purpose of the dichotomy is to clarify the meaning of \u201c \u2018work directly related to the management policies or general business operations\u2019 \u201d as found in 29 C.F.R. part 541.2. <em>(Webster v. Public School Employees of Washington, supra, </em>247 F.3d 910, 916.) The dichotomy would defeat the purpose of the administrative exemption if it were applied to work units carrying out management functions. Following <em>Bratt v. County of Los Angeles </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 912 F.2d 1066, the court found that the plaintiff was an exempt administrative employee because his primary duty involved advising the bargaining units how to conduct their business. <em>(Webster v. Public School Employees of Washington, supra, </em>at pp. 916-917.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>Bothell, </em>the plaintiff was a field service engineer for one of his employer\u2019s largest customers. He claimed to be a repairman; his employer characterized him as an account executive. Applying the administrative/production worker dichotomy, the district court granted summary judgment on the ground that the job was \u201cancillary\u201d to his employer\u2019s main activities and therefore did not fall on the production side of the dichotomy. The appellate court observed that the dichotomy \u201cis useful only to the extent that it helps clarify the phrase \u2018work directly related to the management policies or general business operations.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bothell v. Phase Metrics, Inc., supra, 299 </em>F.3d 1120, 1126.) But \u201c[ojnly when work falls \u2018squarely on the \u201cproduction\u201d side of the line,\u2019 has the administration/production dichotomy been determinative.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1127, fn. omitted.) Remanding the case to the district court for trial, the court held that the plaintiff\u2019s status called for a \u201cfact-specific inquiry\u201d into the plaintiff\u2019s work activities. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>Webster </em>and <em>Bothell </em>underscore our observations in <em>Bell II </em>that \u201cthe administrative/production worker dichotomy is a somewhat gross distinction that may not be dispositive in many cases.\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 826.) But the decisions do not draw into question our use of the dichotomy under the specific facts of the present case. The work at issue here falls \u201c \u2018squarely on the \u201cproduction\u201d side of the line\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bothell v. Phase Metrics, Inc., supra, 299 </em>F.3d 1120, 1127); it places the plaintiffs in a broad category of rank and file workers carrying out the service that an important component of the FIE business organization exists to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In <em>Palacio </em>v. <em>Progressive Ins. Co., supra, </em>244 F.Supp.2d 1040, the federal district court reached a result different from <em>Bell II, </em>but pursued the same mode of analysis and distinguished the facts of the case from those in <em>Bell II. </em>The plaintiff, a claims adjuster for an automobile insurance company, brought actions for unpaid overtime compensation under the FLSA and wage order No. 4 of the California Industrial Welfare Commission. The court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>summary judgment for the employer under the ELSA, but denied the motion for summary judgment under wage order No. 4, relying on the authority of <em>Bell II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In deciding the ELSA claim for the employer, the court analyzed the case in terms of the administrative/production worker dichotomy but found that plaintiff\u2019s job came within the employer\u2019s administrative operations as defined in 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(b) (\u201cThe administrative operations of the business include the work performed by . . . employees engaged in \u2018servicing\u2019 a business as, for example, advising the management, . . . negotiating, representing the company . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Turning to the state claim, the court noted that, in applying the administrative/production worker methodology, <em>Bell II </em>reached an opposite conclusion \u201cupon considering somewhat similar circumstances.\u201d <em>(Palacio </em>v. <em>Progressive Ins. Co., supra, </em>244 F.Supp.2d 1040, 1050.) But the court did not question the authority of <em>Bell II </em>under state law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and observed that it presented distinguishable facts. In particular, \u201cclaims handling [in <em>Bell II] </em>constituted the insurance company\u2019s business\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1050) and the employer restricted the claims representatives to \u201croutine and unimportant\u201d duties. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the court\u2019s view, the similarity and differences between the cases revealed a triable issue of fact under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">FIE relies on another federal district court decision, <em>Schaefer v. Indiana Michigan Power Co., supra, </em>197 F.Supp.2d 935, which has no factual similarity to the present case. The plaintiff was an environmental specialist at a nuclear power plant and was engaged in supervisory and policy-formulation work, analogous to the kind of work that <em>Bell II </em>expressly notes that plaintiffs did not perform. <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 823, 828.) The <em>Schaefer </em>holding that the plaintiff was an exempt employee is entirely consistent with <em>Bell II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Lastly, FIE cites <em>Jastremski v. Safeco Ins. Companies, supra, </em>243 F.Supp.2d 743, a federal district court decision that is in fact irreconcilable with <em>Bell II. </em>The decision is notable chiefly because it relies on the opinion letter dated November 19, 2002, by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor (hereafter DOE Opinion Letter) in denying the claim of an insurance adjuster for unpaid overtime under the ELSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The DOL Opinion Letter is based on a request by an association of insurance companies for an opinion confirming \u201cthat insurance claims adjusters are exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act\u201d and is premised on a description of the claims adjusters\u2019 work provided by the insurance companies. The letter describes the adjusters as being \u201cprimarily responsible for resolving a claim.\u201d They \u201cweigh the factual information\u201d and \u201cevaluate whether there is coverage for the claim under the policy.\u201d They have full authority to settle claims within \u201ctheir established authority,\u201d which \u201cranges from a minimum of $3,000 to more than $50,000.\u201d On claims above their personal limits, they make recommendations to supervisors, \u201cwhich are generally approved,\u201d pursue negotiations, and \u201cadvise the company on whether to settle the claim or to pursue litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The DOL Opinion Letter concludes that the claims adjusters\u2019 duties are \u201cadministrative in nature\u201d on the basis of an analysis of 29 C.F.R. part 541.205. It characterizes the adjusters as being \u201c \u2018engaged in \u201cservicing\u201d a business\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of part 541.205(b) and states that the Wage and Hour Division \u201chas long recognized that claims adjusters typically perform work that is administrative in nature.\u201d The opinion then proceeds to find that the adjusters\u2019 work is of \u201csubstantial importance to the company\u201d within the terms of part 541.205(a). While the opinion notes that part 541.205(a) distinguishes the \u201cadministrative operations of a business\u201d from production work, it does not mention the body of federal law applying the administrative/production worker dichotomy derived from that provision and, in fact, it cites only one judicial <em>decision\u2014Palacio v. Progressive Ins. Co., supra, </em>244 F.Supp.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The deference to be given to DOL opinion letters is governed by <em>Christensen v. Harris County </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 576 [146 L.Ed.2d 621, 120 S.Ct. 1655], which follows an earlier decision, <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>(1944) 323 U.S. 134 [89 L.Ed. 124, 65 S.Ct. 161]. Distinguishing opinion letters from \u201cformal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking,\u201d the decision explains that interpretations contained in the letters \u201clack the force of law,\u201d but are \u201c \u2018entitled to respect\u2019 ... to the extent that those interpretations have the \u2018power to persuade\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>(Christensen, supra, </em>at p. 587, citation omitted.) In a more complete statement of this point, the <em>Skidmore </em>decision states the opinions \u201cdo constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>(Skidmore, supra, </em>at p. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Since DOL opinion letters lack the force of law, they may be rejected categorically as a source of an intervening change of law under the law-of-the-case doctrine. Moreover, in our view, the DOL Opinion Letter here does not offer persuasive reasons to reconsider our decision in <em>Bell II.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>First, the letter is based on distinguishable facts. The evidence in <em>Bell II </em>disclosed that the claims adjusters in the Personal Lines Division were \u201cordinarily occupied in the routine of processing a large number of small claims.\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 827-828.) With few exceptions, their settlement authority was set \u201cat $15,000 or lower and often [was] $5,000 or lower.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 828.) For the most part, their work consisted of gathering facts, filling out appropriate forms, and \u201c \u2018communicating with policy holders and third party claimants about the indemnity value of the claim ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 826.) \u201cOn matters of relatively greater importance,\u201d they acted as \u201cconduits of information to supervisors\u201d or as \u201c \u2018go-betweens\u2019 in conveying information to [an] attorney.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 828.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Secondly, the persuasive power of the DOL Opinion Letter is undermined by its failure to review the body of federal decisions applying the administrative/production worker dichotomy derived from 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(a). In this respect, it appears to represent a departure from past opinion letters of the DOL Wage and Hour Division that have repeatedly employed this analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The administrative/production worker dichotomy, as <em>Bell II </em>notes, offers a common frame of reference for federal decisions in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>area and has led to summary judgment for the employees in \u00e1 line of decisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Thirdly, the statement that the DOL has \u201clong recognized\u201d the work of claims adjusters to be \u201ctypically\u201d administrative in nature is overly simplified. In <em>Bell II, </em>we noted a 1940 DOL report stating that \u201c \u2018the term \u201cclaim agent\u201d may cover a great variety of employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 827, citation omitted.) As indicated in 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(c)(5), the job category includes exempt employees employed in the capacity of \u201cadvisory specialists and consultants.\u201d But the duties of the claims representatives in <em>Bell II </em>closely resembled an \u201cinspector for an insurance company,\u201d listed as a nonexempt employee in 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(c)(2). Moreover, 29 C.F.R. part 778.405 lists insurance adjusters as an example of those nonexempt employees with irregular hours who may enter into contracts guaranteeing constant pay for varying workweeks under section 7(f) of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Much of the argumentation of FIE and amici curiae seeks to demonstrate that our decision in <em>Bell II </em>was in error. These arguments cannot easily be reconciled with the law-of-the-case doctrine. Our high court has stated that the doctrine demands that the court adhere to a principle or rule of law enunciated in an earlier appeal of the same case even though it may \u201cbe clearly of the opinion that the former decision is erroneous in that particular.\u201d <em>(Tally </em>v. <em>Ganahl </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 418, 421 [90 R 1049].) But, stretching the limits of the change-of-law exception to the doctrine, FIE argues that the five recent federal decisions and the DOL Opinion Letter provide further clarification of the applicable state law, revealing errors in our analysis, and that a reconsideration of the decision is required to avoid injustice to California employers. We think that we have adequately answered this argument by showing that the federal appellate decisions in <em>Webster </em>and <em>Bothell, </em>as well as the district court decision in <em>Schaefer, </em>are entirely consistent with our analysis in <em>Bell II. </em>The <em>Palacio </em>decision also is basically compatible with our opinion because it applies the same analytical methodology on distinguishable facts. FIE\u2019s arguments rest on the questionable relevance of the DOL Opinion Letter to interpretation of wage order No. 4 and on the single federal district court decision <em>(Jastremski) </em>that has cited the DOL Opinion Letter as authority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Nevertheless, we will reply to FIE\u2019s arguments on the merits. FIE and amici curiae pursue four lines of argument: (1) the <em>Bell II </em>opinion \u201ctreat[s] employees\u2019 job duties as irrelevant,\u201d (2) it causes relief to turn on FIE\u2019s organizational structure and the geographic location of the plaintiffs\u2019 jobs, (3) it misconstrues \u201cthe product of an insurance company,\u201d and (4) it fails to recognize the \u201cancillary\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 services.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The first argument is based on an apparent misreading of the opinion. In <em>Bell II </em>we held that wage order No. 4 required proof both of employment in an administrative capacity and of job duties meeting certain criteria (\u201c \u2018work which is primarily intellectual, managerial, or creative, and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment\u2019 \u201d). Concluding that plaintiffs were not employed in an administrative capacity, we did not reach the criteria relating to job duties in the second prong of the exemption or explore the corresponding body of federal interpretative law. We did not, however, treat the plaintiffs\u2019 job duties as irrelevant. To the contrary, we examined the plaintiffs\u2019 jobs using the expression \u201cduties,\u201d as well as equivalent terms such as \u201cactivities,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d \u201cmission,\u201d and \u201cfunction,\u201d to describe the jobs in the context of the employer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The second argument similarly reflects a misunderstanding of the opinion. We see nothing in <em>Bell II </em>that would suggest it \u201ctum[s] on the happenstance of geographic location/corporate structure.\u201d The decision engages in a review of the undisputed facts relevant to an adjudication of the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative capacity. Holding that plaintiffs were not employed in an administrative capacity, we carefully phrased our opinion in terms of these facts, that is, on \u201can analysis of the peculiar nature of FIE\u2019s business and the claims representatives\u2019 role in that business . . . .\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 829.) But the opinion does not assign to particular facts, such as those concerning corporate structure or the plaintiffs\u2019 work location, a significance exceeding their actual relevance to the issue of administrative capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Indeed, the opinion never went beyond the strictly factual observation that the plaintiff claims representatives worked in branch offices, which performed none of the activities constituting the administrative or executive functions of the corporation. These activities were delegated to other corporate entities or performed elsewhere. The work performed by the plaintiff claims representatives in branch offices was devoted entirely to carrying out one important component of the business\u2014claims adjustment\u2014and was limited to the routine aspects of performing that function. We see nothing in our discussion of the undisputed facts to suggest that the determination of administrative capacity turns on the location or departmental organization of the place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The third argument is based on an abstract characterization of the \u201cproduct of an insurance company\u201d and deduces from this characterization that plaintiffs were not production workers. It is argued, for example, \u201cthat the product of an insurance company is its policies, not claims adjusting,\u201d and therefore claims adjusters cannot be production workers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Amici curiae construe the decision in <em>Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1997) 126 F.3d 1, 9-10, as supporting their reasoning. But as we read the <em>John Alden </em>decision, it explores the significance of a stipulation of facts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We decline to follow two federal district court decisions that have relied on the <em>John Alden </em>dicta to deny overtime claims. <em>(Wilshin v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(M.D.Ga. 2002) 212 F.Supp.2d 1360, 1376; <em>Hogan v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(M.D.Fla. 2002) 210 F.Supp.2d 1312, 1320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The relevant issue concerns the propriety of the administrative/production worker dichotomy as an analytic tool. We recognized in <em>Bell II </em>that the dichotomy may lose its utility as it is applied to small or specialized segments of a business. <em>(Bell II, </em>supra, 87 Cal.App.4th 805, 826; see also <em>Bothell v. Phase Metrics, Inc., supra, </em>299 F.3d 1120, 1126.) But the federal decisions applying the dichotomy to grant relief to particular employee groups do not tie its use to a global characterization of the employer\u2019s business.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Bell II, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>we found <em>Reich </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., supra, </em>853 F.Supp. 1325, to be \u201cespecially instructive.\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>at p. 822.) Applying the dichotomy to grant summary judgment to escrow closers, the court observed that the employer\u2019s \u201c \u2018status as a title insurer does not alter the fact that escrow closings are a very real product . . . which it markets and sells separate from ... its overall title insurance operations.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 823.) We consider that, under the facts of the present case, the administrative/production worker dichotomy may similarly be applied to the work of claims adjusting in \u201can important component of [FIE\u2019s] business organization\u201d notwithstanding the existence of other business activities in the organization. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 828.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In a related argument, amici curiae argue that claims adjusting is ancillary to the business function of an insurance company and therefore administrative in nature. The argument relies on a short line of decisions stemming from a comment in <em>Martin v. Cooper Elec. Supply Co., supra, </em>940 F.2d 896. Affirming a lower court finding that salespersons did not come within 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(b), i.e., administrative employees \u201cservicing\u201d a business, the court observed, \u201c \u2018Servicing\u2019 a business within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.205(b) denotes employment activity <em>ancillary </em>to an employer\u2019s principal production activity .... It follows that inside salespersons do not \u2018service\u2019 Cooper\u2019s business by making wholesale sales\u2014wholesale sales <em>is </em>Cooper\u2019s business.\u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Cooper Elec. Supply Co., supra, </em>at pp. 904-905.) In other words, the employees did <em>not </em>perform ancillary activities and hence did not come within this subcategory of administrative employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">A later case, <em>Reich </em>v. <em>John Alden Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>126 F.3d 1, applied this language to the converse fact situation: it found that the employees <em>did </em>perform an ancillary function and hence could be regarded as engaged in \u201cadministrative \u2018servicing\u2019 within the meaning of section 541.205(b).\u201d <em>(Reich </em>v. <em>John Alden Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 10; see also <em>Haywood v. North American Van Lines, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 121 F.3d 1066, 1072.) The federal district court decision in <em>Palacio </em>v. <em>Progressive Ins. Co., supra, </em>244 F.Supp. 1040, contains language that can be regarded as taking the concept of \u201cancillary\u201d services still further to limit the application of the \u201cadministrative/production dichotomy\u201d in 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(a). <em>(Palacio v. Progressive Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 1047.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In <em>Bothell v. Phase Metrics, Inc., supra, </em>299 F.3d 1120, 1126, the court recognized that the concept of \u201cancillary\u201d services arises as a gloss on 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(b), though \u201c[s]ome cases do use the term \u2018ancillary\u2019 as a short-hand description of administrative activities.\u201d Like the <em>Bothell </em>court, we think the concept of \u201cancillary\u201d services should be confined to its original context as an explication of 29 C.F.R. part 541.205(b). With this limited reference, it has no bearing on our finding that the plaintiffs belong \u201cin the sphere of rank and file production workers.\u201d <em>(Bell II, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 805, 828.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">B. <em>Amendment to Wage Order No. 4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Lastly, FEE argues that the judgment should be set aside with respect to any damages or injunctive relief applying after the amendment of wage order No. 4 on October 1, 2000. We note that FEE never raised this argument in the trial court and therefore has waived any assignment of error on appeal. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 394, p. 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We conclude that reconsideration of our decision in <em>Bell II </em>is precluded by the law-of-the-case doctrine. FEE has failed to show an intervening change in the controlling rules of law that would justify a departure from this procedural rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">C. <em>Class Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">1. <em>Legal </em>Background<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">FEE next contends that the trial court abused its discretion in initially certifying the class of claims representatives on May 28, 1998, and later denying the motions for decertification filed on September 22, 1999, and May 24, 2001. The contention requires us to briefly review the principles governing the certification of class actions in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The class action in California evolved from \u201cthe equitable doctrine of virtual representation which \u2018 \u201crests upon considerations of necessity and paramount convenience, and was adopted to prevent a failure of justice.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 703-704 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732].) The only statutory authorization for the class action consists of a phrase at the end of a statute dealing with compulsory joinder. Code of Civil Procedure section 382 states: \u201c. . . and when the question is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.\u201d Reflecting a \u201cgeneral support of class actions\u201d <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 459 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the California Supreme Court \u201chas urged trial courts to be procedurally innovative\u201d in determining whether to allow class suits, \u201cencouraging them to incorporate procedures from outside sources,\u201d in particular \u201crule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .... [28 U.S.C.]\u201d <em>(City of San Jose v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 453, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">California courts have long \u201cheld that two requirements must be met in order to sustain any class action: (1) there must be an ascertainable class [citations]; and (2) there must be a well defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact involved affecting the parties to be represented.\u201d <em>(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 695, 704; <em>Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 2 P.3d 27]; <em>Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470 [174 Cal.Rptr. 515, 629 P.2d 23]; <em>Vasquez v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 809 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964].) While the requirement of an ascertainable class normally requires little elaboration,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the community of interest requirement has been held to embody three factors: \u201c(1) predominant common questions of law or fact; (2) class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class; and (3) class representatives who can adequately represent the class.\u201d <em>(Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 470; <em>Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., supra, </em>at p. 435; <em>Bartold v. Glendale Federal Bank, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 816, 828; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1781, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The certification of a class is a discretionary decision that demands the weighing of many relevant considerations. <em>(Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 429, 435.) In <em>Collins v. Rocha </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 232, 238 [102 Cal.Rptr. 1, 497 P.2d 225], our high court observed, \u201cThe ultimate question in every case of this type is whether, given an ascertainable class, the issues which may be jointly tried, when compared with those requiring separate adjudication, are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.\u201d Following this language, numerous later cases have \u201cadmonished trial courts to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.\u201d <em>(City of San Jose v. Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 447, 459; see also <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1096, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>1104\u20141105 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 63 P.3d 913]; <em>Washington Mutual Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 906, 914 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 320, 15 P.3d 1071]; <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 381, 385 [134 Cal.Rptr. 393, 556 P.2d 755]; <em>Caro </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 644, 655 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 419].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">By preventing \u201ca failure of justice in our judicial system\u201d <em>(Linder </em>v. <em>Thrifty Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 429, 434), the class action not only benefits the individual litigant but serves the public interest in the enforcement of legal rights and statutory sanctions. (Cf. <em>Bartold v. Glendale Federal Bank, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 816, 830-831.) Thus, in upholding a consumer class action, the court in <em>Vasquez v. Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 800, 807, quoted with approval an argument for stockholder class action suits: \u201c \u2018Modem society seems increasingly to expose men to . . . group injuries for which individually they are in a poor position to seek legal redress, either because they do not know enough or because such redress is disproportionately expensive. If each is left to assert his rights alone if and when he can, there will at best be a random and fragmentary enforcement, if there is any at all.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In a proper case, \u201cthe judicial system substantially benefits by the efficient use of its resources\u201d afforded by class certifications. <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 462, 474.) Class actions offer a means of avoiding \u201crepetitious litigation\u201d <em>(Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 429, 435) and \u201ca multiplicity of legal actions dealing with identical basic issues . . . .\u201d <em>(Vasquez v. Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 800, 810.) Nevertheless, by greatly expediting the resolution of claims, class actions can create possibilities for injustice in an individual case. <em>(City of San Jose v. Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 477, 458.) A line of California cases follows the principle of mle 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.), which \u201cprovides that, for a class action to be maintained, it must be \u2018superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u2019 This \u2018superiority\u2019 criterion has been held to be \u2018manifest\u2019 in the . . . requirement that the class mechanism confer \u2018substantial benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 758, 773 [259 Cal.Rptr. 789]; <em>Caro </em>v. <em>Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 644, 662; <em>Schneider v. Vennard </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1340, 1346-1347 [228 Cal.Rptr. 800]; <em>Lazar </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 128, 143 [191 Cal.Rptr. 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\u201cBecause trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action, they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification\u201d <em>(Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 429, 435) or motions for decertification. <em>(Occidental Land, Inc. v. Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 355, 360 [134 Cal.Rptr. 388, 556 P.2d 750].) \u201c[I]n the absence of other error, this court will not disturb a trial court ruling on class certification which is supported by substantial evidence unless (1) improper criteria were used [citation]; or (2) erroneous legal assumptions were made [citation].\u201d <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 462, 470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">2. <em>Legal Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in initially certifying the class of claims representatives on May 28, 1998, FIE and amici curiae advance an array of arguments with little actual citation to the record. This failure to address the record defeats their challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding of a community of interest among class members. The trial court found that the class was \u201ccomposed of hundreds of similarly situated employees\u201d employed as claims representatives and that there were \u201ccommon questions of law and fact common to the class . . . with respect to such class members\u2019 claims for overtime pay.\u201d The finding was based on plaintiffs\u2019 extensive evidentiary showing in support of the motion for certification. In opposing the motion and moving twice for decertification, FIE never claimed that there were differences among the various duties performed by class members that would bar class certification; and in this appeal, it does not offer any reasoned argument, based on actual citations to the record, to this effect. The trial court\u2019s findings of fact with respect to a community of interest remain unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Arguing that \u201cquestions specific to each individual claims representative\u201d predominated over common legal issues, FIE points only to matters, such as overtime hours worked, pertaining to the determination of individual damages. It is well established that the necessity for an individual determination of damages does not weigh against class certification. The community of interest requirement recognizes that \u201cultimately each class member will be required in some manner to establish his individual damages . . . .\u201d <em>(Vasquez v. Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 800, 815; <em>Collins v. Rocha, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 232, 238; <em>Acree v. General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 385, 397 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 99]; <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 908, 916 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761].) As explained in <em>Employment Development Dept. v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 256, 266 [178 Cal.Rptr. 612, 636 P.2d 575], \u201ca class action is not inappropriate simply because each member of the class may at some point be required to make an individual showing as to his or her eligibility for recovery or as to the amount of his or her damages.\u201d In <em>B.W.I. Custom Kitchen v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1341, 1354 [235 Cal.Rptr. 228], the court quoted a comment from a federal decision: \u201c \u2018In almost every class action, factual determinations [of damages] ... to individual class members must be made. [Citations.] Still we know of no case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>where this has prevented a court from aiding the class to obtain its just restitution. Indeed, to decertify a class on the issue of damages or restitution may well be effectively to sound the death-knell of the class action device.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Relying on language in <em>Ramirez </em>v. <em>Yosemite Water Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 785 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 978 P.2d 2], amici curiae call for \u201can individualized, employee-by-employee assessment of the exemption standards,\u201d involving \u201ca fact-intensive inquiry into the duties actually performed by employees.\u201d But close attention to the facts may require an individual adjudication of exempt status in certain cases while permitting a group adjudication in others. We do not need to pursue amici curiae\u2019s suggestion that other cases may call for individual adjudication of exempt status. Our decision here must be based on the record in this appeal, which amici curiae do not discuss. Amici curiae offer no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that class members here were \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d under circumstances presenting common issues of law and fact, which permitted an adjudication of whether they were employed in an \u201cadministrative capacity\u201d within the meaning of wage order No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In its second motion for decertification, FIE opposed class certification on the ground that 9 percent of the 295 employees in the random sample did not claim compensation for unpaid overtime. In this appeal, it urges that the discovery of this fact constituted a \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d that justified its second motion for decertification. The record discloses, however, that most of the employees not claiming overtime had worked as claims representatives for very short periods of time\u2014often measured in a few weeks. The nonclaimants accounted for only 4 percent of total weeks worked in the class. Moreover, a segment of the nonclaimants were .currently employed as claims representatives and thus had an interest in the injunctive relief sought by the class representatives. If these employees are excluded from the total, only 5.7 percent of the employees in the random sample lacked an interest in the objectives of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The presence of this marginal element of nonclaimants did not make the class less ascertainable or significantly reduce the required community of interest. Class members were identifiable by their employment in pertinent job categories. The small number of nonclaimants did not deprive plaintiffs of their representative status. The record contains nothing to suggest that nonclaimants constituted an employee segment with distinct interests conflicting with other class members. Finally, it did not affect the common issues of law and fact. The case called for individual adjudications only of the damages resulting from unpaid overtime. The question of an employee\u2019s \u201celigibility for recovery\u201d did not present a distinct issue of liability, as FIE argues, but rather depended on the same factual showing\u2014unpaid overtime hours worked\u2014as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the question of the amount of the employee\u2019s damages. (See <em>Employment Development Dept. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 256, 266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">FIE notes that proof of the fact of damages is required in individual actions for unpaid overtime <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 721, 726 [245 Cal.Rptr. 36]) and argues that the presence of nonclaimants demonstrated that plaintiffs could not establish this element of their cause of action for all class members. But if proof of individual damages were required by all potentially affected parties as a condition for class certification, it would go far toward barring all class actions. As noted in <em>B.W.I. Custom Kitchen </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc., supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d 1341, 1354, most class actions contemplate individual proof of damages, which necessarily entails the possibility that some class members will fail to prove damages. FIE cites no authority that class certification should be ordered only under circumstances promising universal recovery within the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Considerations of the efficient use of judicial resources supported the class action, despite the discovery of a marginal element of nonclaimants. On its facts, the present case is remarkably close to <em>Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 462. The plaintiffs there filed a class action for fraud and violation of the Subdivided Lands Act against a developer of a recreational home subdivision. In the class certification hearing, the developer introduced the results of a survey in which it had asked homeowners to express their view of the subdivision by checking one of three boxes. Approximately 6 percent of the class returned the survey with a check in the box indicating satisfaction with the developer\u2019s performance. The trial court relied on the survey to deny class certification. Reversing the order on appeal, the California Supreme Court observed, \u201cSince the judicial system substantially benefits by the efficient use of its resources, class certifications should not be denied so long as the absent class members\u2019 rights are adequately protected.\u201d <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 474.) \u201cThe results of the flyer questionnaire show no more than approximately 6 percent of the class of some 4,000 persons antagonistic to the class action suit. This small number should not be sufficient to defeat the motion for certification.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Lastly, FIE argues that the large size of the employees\u2019 claims\u2014the average claim is $37,394\u2014precludes class certification. But, addressing a similar argument in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Rocha, supra, 1 </em>Cal.3d 232, 238, our high court observed \u201cthat while the impracticability of bringing an individual action for comparatively small potential recovery [is] a consideration in favor of permitting a class action, the converse [is] not necessarily controlling, i.e., the possibility of a potential recovery for each class member larger than a nominal sum does not militate against the maintenance of such an action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>We note, first, that the size of individual claims does not necessarily have a bearing on the consideration of judicial efficiency favoring class actions. Whatever the size of the claims, a class action may be required \u201cwhen the parties are numerous, and it is impractical to bring them all before the court,\u201d as provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 382. FIE advocates the alternative of individual \u201cmini-trials,\u201d but this vaguely described concept would still involve \u201ca multiplicity of legal actions dealing with identical basic issues\u201d <em>(Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 800, 810), which would burden litigants and the courts with repetitious litigation. <em>(Linder </em>v. <em>Thrifty Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 429, 435.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Moreover, class actions may be needed to assure the effective enforcement of statutory policies even though some claims are large enough to provide an incentive for individual action. While employees may succeed under favorable circumstances in recovering unpaid overtime through a lawsuit or a wage claim filed with the Labor Commissioner, a class action may still be justified if these alternatives offer no more than the prospect of \u201crandom and fragmentary enforcement\u201d of the employer\u2019s legal obligation to pay overtime. <em>(Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 800, 807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">FIE maintains that where claims are as large as $37,000, the right to recover attorney fees, costs, and interest provides \u201cample incentive\u201d for an individual lawsuit. But the size of the average claim in part reflects the accrual of unpaid overtime over the five-year duration of this lawsuit prior to trial. When the complaint was first filed in October 1996, the average claim would have been smaller and a large portion of the claims may not have been reasonably adequate to fund the expense of individual litigation. The length of this litigation in fact underscores the practical difficulties vindicating claims to unpaid overtime. Employees will seldom have detailed personal records of hours worked. Their case ordinarily rests on the credibility of vague recollections and requires them to litigate complex overtime formulas and exemption standards. For current employees, a lawsuit means challenging an employer in a context that may be perceived as jeopardizing job security and prospects for promotion. If the employee files after termination of employment, the costs of litigation may still involve travel expenses and time off from work to pursue the case, and the value of any ultimate recovery may be reduced by legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In its second motion for decertification FIE argued that employees may seek administrative relief through what is commonly known as the \u201cBerman\u201d hearing procedure codified in Labor Code sections 98 to 98.8. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1190, \u00a7\u00a7 4\u201411, pp. 5368-5371.) This procedure is \u201cdesigned to provide a speedy, informal, and affordable method of resolving wage claims,\u201d but it has several disadvantages for the employee. <em>(Cuadra </em>v. <em>Millan </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>855, 858 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 952 P.2d 704]; <em>Lolley </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 367, 372 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 571, 48 P.3d 1128].) Injunctive relief is not available. The employer is typically represented by counsel; and if employees choose also to retain counsel, they cannot recover attorney fees. Moreover, a losing employer has a right to a trial de novo in superior court where the ruling of the hearing officer is entitled to no deference. (Lab. Code \u00a7 98.2, subds. (b) &amp; (c); <em>Post v. Palo/Haklar &amp; Associates </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 942, 948 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 4 P.3d 928].) Opposing the first motion for decertification, plaintiffs submitted a declaration by a former chief counsel of the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), who cautioned, \u201cRequiring two thousand or so class members to go through individual \u2018Berman\u2019 hearings would obviously be extremely inefficient as compared to a single class action. Also, a deluge of claims would simply outstrip the resources of the DLSE . . . impacting not only these claimants but others unrelated to this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">If the costs to the courts of repetitious litigation and the public interest in effective enforcement of overtime laws are taken into account, the trial court clearly acted within its discretion in finding that a class action was a superior means of adjudicating the present controversy. Hence, on the present record, we conclude that FEE has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion for class certification and later denying the two motions for decertification. Our decision is based solely on the issues raised by these motions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">D. <em>Trial Management</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">1. <em>Trial Court Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">FIE next challenges the use of the statistical methodology of random sampling and extrapolation for the determination of aggregate classwide damages. The issue is a novel one in California. It is true that California courts have relied on expert testimony on statistical methods to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>certain issues in damage calculations,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and <em>Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 695, offers a precedent for determining aggregate classwide damages through a process of logical inference,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but we must look to federal law for closer precedents. In discussing these federal precedents, we are mindful that class actions in the past have sometimes also called for judicial innovations guided by the experience of the federal courts. <em>(City of San Jose v. Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 447, 453.) In this area of litigation, the California Supreme Court has in fact \u201cchallenged the trial courts to develop \u2018pragmatic procedural devices\u2019 to \u2018simplify the potentially complex litigation while at the same time protecting the rights of all the parties.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 460, 471 [224 Cal.Rptr. 605, 715 P.2d 564].)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The record does not present the evidentiary issues that sometimes accompany the use of statistics in litigation. FIE did not challenge the scientific methodology employed by the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness or question his qualifications. Our analysis will be confined to two inquiries: (1) was adoption of the trial management plan within the scope of the trial court\u2019s discretion? and (2) did the use of statistical inference violate FIE\u2019s due process rights? While our inquiries may draw on the use of statistical methodology in disparate fields,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we recognize claims for unpaid overtime compensation present certain unique and distinguishing characteristics. In the area of federal ELSA litigation, the touchstone is the seminal decision in <em>Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 680 [90 L.Ed. 1515, 66 S.Ct. 1187] (hereafter Aft <em>Clemens).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In the <em>Mt. Clemens </em>case, the plaintiff employees complained that the employer failed to compensate them for time spent walking to their work stations and completing certain necessary activities before and after their scheduled shifts, but they could not accurately prove the amount of uncompensated work. The Supreme Court noted that an employee who brings suit under the FLSA \u201chas the burden of proving that he performed work for which he was not properly compensated. The remedial nature of this statute and the</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>great public policy which it embodies, however, militate against making that burden an impossible hurdle for the employee.\u201d <em>(Mt. Clemens, supra, </em>328 U.S. 680, 686-687.) Where the employer fails to keep proper records, the courts should not \u201cpenalize the employee by denying him any recovery on the ground that he is unable to prove the precise extent of uncompensated work. Such a result would place a premium on an employer\u2019s failure to keep proper records in conformity with his statutory duty . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 687.) Instead, the court held: \u201can employee has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work <em>as a matter of just and reasonable inference. </em>The burden then shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed .... If the employer fails to produce such evidence, the court may then award damages to the employee, even though the result be only approximate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 687-688, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Following <em>Mt. Clemens, </em>the federal courts have consistently granted back wages to nontestifying employees on the basis of a pattern or practice adduced from the testimony of other employees within their job category.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As stated in <em>Donovan v. Bel-Loc Diner, Inc. </em>(4th Cir. 1985) 780 F.2d 1113, 1116, \u201c[tjhere is no requirement that to establish a <em>Mt. Clemens </em>pattern or practice, testimony must refer to all non-testifying employees. ... [][].. . Courts have frequently granted back wages under the FLSA to non-testifying employees based upon the representative testimony of a small percentage of the employees. [Citation.] The requirement is only that the testimony be fairly representational.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>In some eases, the courts have relied on statistical analyses of evidence to infer wages owed to nontestifying employees within the same group as testifying claimants. In <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Hudson Stations, Inc. </em>(D.C. Kan., Oct. 14, 1983, Nos. 77-2172 &amp; 77-2173) 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12751, 26 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. (BNA) 795 [99 Lab.Cas.P. 34,463], the Secretary of Labor deposed 572 employees out of a group of 15,000 employees, but only 50 of this number were randomly selected. The deposition data was used to calculate the average amounts of \u201cshortages paid\u201d and \u201ctime worked off the clock\u201d by employees. At trial, the Secretary asked that \u201cthese averages be applied to calculate the back pay award for all defendants\u2019 employees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 801.) While recognizing that the survey was not conducted in \u201ca scientific manner,\u201d the court found that it was sufficient to establish uncompensated work \u201c \u2018as a matter of just and reasonable inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Again, in <em>Reich v. Waldbaum, Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1993) 833 F.Supp. 1037, 1049, a \u201ccomputer specialist\u201d for the Labor Department calculated actual hours worked by nontestifying employees by a process of \u201cwithin-store averaging\u201d or \u201cacross-store averaging.\u201d Noting that \u201c[j]ust as some employees are overcompensated by the calculations, others are undercompensated,\u201d the court concluded that the method was \u201creasonable,\u201d though \u201cnot ideal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1049.) Similarly, in <em>McLaughlin v. Dialamerica Marketing, Inc. </em>(D.N.J. 1989) 716 F.Supp. 812, 816-817, a \u201ccompliance specialist\u201d developed \u201ca computerized summary of all of the available data\u201d and devised formulas to reconstruct actual hours worked from the record of units of production. The court awarded back wages to both testifying and nontestifying employees based on these calculations of the average relation of units of production to hours worked. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The present case differs from these precedents only in the size of the employee group and the use of a scientific methodology to infer aggregate classwide damages. If hours worked by nontestifying employees may be inferred from the testimony of other employees within a small employee group, we see no reason why it should not be allowed for a larger employee group. And if rough approximations and statistical estimates pass scrutiny for smaller groups, a scientific methodology based on a random sampling should also qualify as a \u201cjust and reasonable inference\u201d of uncompensated hours worked in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">FIE vigorously argues that the use of statistical inference improperly \u201crelieved class members of their initial burden of showing they worked overtime,\u201d a burden recognized both by the <em>Mt. Clemens </em>decision and by California law applying to the recovery of damages in individual wage claims. <em>(Hernandez v. Mendoza, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d 721, 726; <em>Mt. Clemens, supra, </em>328 U.S. 680, 687; cf. <em>Collins v. Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>(1986) 187 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Cal.App.3d 62, 72 [231 Cal.Rptr. 638].) FIE notes, and we agree, that substantive rules of law may not be altered in the interests of efficient litigation. <em>(Cimino </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1998) 151 F.3d 297, 312; <em>Granberry v. Islay Investments </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 738, 749 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 650, 889 R2d 970].) However, statistical sampling does not dispense with proof of damages but rather offers a different method of proof, substituting inference from membership in a class for an individual employee\u2019s testimony of hours worked for inadequate compensation. It calls for a particular form of expert testimony to carry the initial burden of proof, not a change in substantive law. We note that the use of statistical sampling in the present case is analogous to FLSA precedents that allow back pay to nontestifying claimants. By basing relief on evidence of a pattern or practice, these decisions have also relieved some employees of the procedural necessity of making individual proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">FIE appears to complain that the determination of aggregate damages on the basis of statistical inference entails the possibility of awarding back wages to particular employees who are not entitled to them. But this possibility also exists in FLSA cases (see, e.g., <em>Reich </em>v. <em>Chez Robert, Inc., supra, </em>821 F.Supp. 967, 974-975, 988-993) and is not a unique problem of statistical sampling; it is inherent in many class action decisions. FIE\u2019s argument for individualized proof of damages, if accepted, would challenge all class action judgments adopting reasonably expeditious means of distributing the recovery among class members. <em>(State of California v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 460, 473-476; <em>Bruno v. Superior Court, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d 120, 123-130.) We decline to adopt this point of view, preferring the more pragmatic approach characterizing federal decisions. (See generally 7B Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Fed. Practice and Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1784, pp. 85-88; 3 Conte &amp; Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 10:12, pp. 505-509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Nevertheless, from the perspective of the administration of justice,' we see an important negative consequence of the use of statistical sampling to calculate damages: it necessarily yields an average figure that will overestimate or underestimate the right to relief of individual employees. As Professor Robert Bone writes, \u201csampling can yield an extremely accurate average damage figure and thus an accurate total damage figure for the whole aggregation when the sample average is multiplied by the total number of plaintiffs. [] . . . [Hjowever, sampling imperfectly distributes this total relative to the expected outcome of an individual trial, giving some plaintiffs more and some less than their individual entitlements.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As we will see, the plan of distribution in this case is designed to ameliorate this problem, but it still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>offers an imperfect method of distributing damages in comparison to individual adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Weighing against this disadvantage is the consideration that statistical inference offers a means of vindicating the policy underlying the Industrial Welfare Commission\u2019s wage orders without clogging the courts or deterring small claimants with the cost of litigation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In a particular case, the alternative to the award of classwide aggregate damages may be the sort of random and fragmentary enforcement of the overtime laws that will fail to effectively assure compliance on a classwide basis. In <em>Mt. Clemens, </em>the court held that \u201cthe remedial nature of this statute and the great public policy which it embodies\u201d justified a reduced standard of proof of damages. <em>(Mt. Clemens, supra, </em>328 U.S. 680, 687.) The same consideration militates in favor of a reasonably expeditious means of calculating and distributing classwide aggregate damages if individual adjudication of the entitlements of all class members, or a substantial portion of the members, would impose impossible burdens on the courts and litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In our view, it was within the discretion of the trial court to weigh the disadvantage of statistical inference\u2014the calculation of average damages imperfectly tailored to the facts of particular employees\u2014with the opportunity it afforded to vindicate an important statutory policy without unduly burdening the courts. As stated in <em>In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1997) 109 F.3d 1016, 1018, \u201c[o]ur review of a trial court\u2019s plan for proceeding in a complex case is a deferential one that recognizes the fact that the trial judge is in a much better position than an appellate court to formulate an appropriate methodology for a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">2. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">FIE maintains, however, that the use of statistical sampling and extrapolation violated its right to due process in the determination of damages. Under <em>Connecticut v. Doehr </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 1, 11 [115 L.Ed.2d 1, 111 S.Ct. <em>2105](Doehr), </em>the question whether a procedural device used in judicial proceedings to deprive a defendant of property comports with due process is determined by a balancing of interests: \u201c[Fjirst, consideration of the private interest that will be affected by the [procedure]; second, an examination of the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures under attack and the probable value of additional or alternative safeguards; and third, . . . principal attention to the interest of the party seeking the [procedure], with, nonetheless, due regard for any ancillary interest the government may have in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>providing the procedure or forgoing the added burden of providing greater protections.\u201d (See also <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 319, 335 [47 L.Ed.2d 18, 96 S.Ct. 893]; <em>Hilao v. Estate of Marcos </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 103 F.3d 767, 786; <em>In re Simon II Litigation, supra, </em>211 F.R.D. 86, 152-153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In this case, the interest of FIE that was affected by the use of statistical sampling is its total or aggregate liability to the plaintiff class for unpaid overtime compensation. FIE may object to statistical sampling on due process grounds only to the extent that the procedure affected its overall liability for damages. <em>(Sanders v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 252, 263 [90 Cal.Rptr. 169, 475 P.2d 201] [defendant lacked standing to object to a common fund attorney fee award]; <em>Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, supra, </em>103 F.3d 767, 786 [the defendant\u2019s \u201cinterest is only in the total amount of damages for which it will be liable\u201d]; <em>In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1984) 597 F.Supp. 740, 839 [defendant has no valid objection so long as it is \u201cliable for no more than the aggregate loss fairly attributable to its tortious conduct\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">FIE\u2019s aggregate liability was <em>not </em>affected by the method of determining individual entitlements to members of the plaintiff class. This issue pertains only to the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion in ordering a trial management plan. Similarly, the presence of nonclaimants in the class, which may be relevant to the trial court\u2019s discretion in certifying the class, has no relevance to FEE\u2019s due process claim so long as the inclusion of these class members did not increase the total amount of damages. The record shows that the damage award was in fact calculated on the basis of an average weekly overtime figure that factored in the presence of nonclaimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Turning to the third interest in the <em>Doehr </em>analysis, the interest of the plaintiffs in using statistical inference as a basis for an aggregate classwide recovery \u201cis enormous, since adversarial resolution of each class member\u2019s claim would pose insurmountable practical hurdles.\u201d <em>(Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, supra, </em>103 F.3d 767, 786.) Relatively few class members have a realistic capability of assuming the costs and personal risks involved in judicial and administrative remedies. The ancillary interest of the government (i.e., the Industrial Welfare Commission and the courts) in using statistical inference for the award of damages lies in the means it affords to enforce the objectives of the Industrial Welfare Commission\u2019s wage orders, advance the judicial policy of giving small claimants access to the courts, and avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the judicial system in the enforcement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>The second part of the <em>Doehr </em>test\u2014the risk of erroneous deprivation\u2014 leads to the complex body of law and scholarship dealing with the use of statistical inference in adjudication, but in the end it reveals a serious constitutional issue only with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for double-time compensation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We will discuss, first, the due process issue pertaining to the $88,798,871.12 award for time-and-a-half overtime compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">(a) <em>Time-and-a-half Compensation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">FIE argues that the statistical methods used to determine its aggregate liability for time-and-a-half compensation involved a risk of erroneous deprivation of property because \u201c[t]he extrapolation process produced a range of overtime compensation figures between $80 million and $100 million\u2014an arbitrary swing of $20 million.\u201d More accurately, the record discloses that the statistical methodology employed by the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Richard Drogin, with the apparent concurrence of FIE\u2019s expert, Roy Weinstein, not only estimated the average weekly unpaid overtime of the class on the basis of random sampling of 295 employees, but provided a measure of the possible inaccuracy of the estimate. This measure of possible inaccuracy consisted of a \u201cconfidence interval,\u201d based on a 95 percent degree of confidence. The term \u201cinterval\u201d can be expressed in more familiar language in terms of a margin of error, which is one-half of the interval. Drogin calculated that, with a 95 percent degree of confidence, the average weekly hours of unpaid overtime of the sample of 295 employees, i.e., 9.4 hours, reflected \u201cthe true average overtime hours\u201d of the entire class of 2402 employees, subject to a margin of error of 0.9 hours.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We note, first, that, by a process of rounding upward to the nearest 10, FIE overstates the possibility of error. The margin of error of 0.9 weekly hours in fact yields a range of $17 million, or $8.5 million above or below the estimated aggregate classwide damages<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Secondly, FIE\u2019s argument that repetition of the sampling would result in an \u201carbitrary swing\u201d between the limits of the margin of error implicitly assumes that there would be an even distribution of outcomes within this range. But there is no basis for such an assumption, or, for that matter, for the contrary assumption that repetition would result in a clustering of outcomes close to the value of the initial sample. The confidence interval provides a quantitative measure <em>only </em>of the limits of the possible inaccuracy of the estimated average value. It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>convey any information regarding the probable distribution of outcomes within the margin of error, and the record contains no testimony on this point.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">A due process critique of the accuracy of statistical inference implicitly assumes that it is a less reliable method of reaching a correct verdict than individual adjudication. But the proof of damages in an individual claimant\u2019s trial may also involve estimates, inferences and other sources of error.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The proof of damages by statistical inference chiefly differs in that it openly acknowledges the possibility of error and offers a quantitative measure of possible inaccuracy. In other words, it is overtly probabilistic.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">By attacking the statistical proof of damages as \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cspeculative,\u201d FEE takes a position at odds with the growing acceptance of scientific statistical methodology in judicial decisions and scholarship. Forty years ago, the courts indeed displayed some reluctance to admit survey data,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> but today \u201c[statistical assessments are prominent in many kinds of cases, ranging from antitrust to voting rights.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Citing varied uses of statistics, the court in <em>In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc., supra, </em>109 F.3d 1016, 1020, observes, \u201cThe applicability of inferential statistics have long been recognized by the courts.\u201d Underlying the contemporary reliance on the methodology of inferential statistics is a recognition that \u201c[ejxperts have developed appropriate modeling techniques for reaching statistically significant and reliable conclusions.\u201d <em>(In re Simon II Litigation, supra, </em>211 F.R.D. 86, 153; see also <em>Ratanasen v. California Dept. of Health Services </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 11 F.3d 1467, 1469-1472; <em>Michigan Dept. of Educ. v. U.S. Dept. of Educ. </em>(6th Cir. 1989) 875 F.2d 1196, 1205-1206; <em>Pfizer, Inc. v.

We find little basis in the decisional law for a skepticism regarding the appropriateness of the scientific methodology of inferential statistics as a technique for determining damages in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In the hearings on the trial management plan on August 4, 2000, FIE made representations to the court that appeared to concede that a one-hour margin of error satisfied its due process concerns. In a memorandum proposing a 0.75-hours margin of error, FIE noted, \u201ccase law that supports the position that statistical sampling is appropriate and does not violate [FIE\u2019s] due process rights <em>only </em>when the appropriate margin of error is used\u201d and concluded that a margin of error of 0.75 hours \u201chelps ensure that the aggregate damages [FIE] is required to pay do not exceed [FIE\u2019s] actual liability in this action.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> At the hearing on August 4, 2000, when the trial court suggested a one-hour margin of error as a compromise, FIE\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cWe would be agreeable to a 1.0 number.\u201d The sampling ultimately achieved a slightly better result\u2014a 0.9-hours margin of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">At trial, the plaintiffs\u2019 statistical methodology withstood FIE\u2019s challenges. The evidence revealed that over 90 percent of the employees randomly selected for depositions were actually deposed, a response rate regarded as producing a reliable and accurate sample.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Drogin testified that the depositions of the second half of the sample did not vary much from the figures yielded by the first 150 depositions. Moreover, the elimination of the largest claimants, asserting claims for unpaid hours worked over 25 hours per week, would have a negligible impact on the average weekly figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We conclude that the proof of aggregate damages for time-and-a-half overtime by statistical inference reflected a level of accuracy consistent with due process under the <em>Doehr </em>balancing test. This conclusion is supported by persuasive authority. <em>(In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc., supra, </em>109 F.3d 1016, 1020; <em>Hilao </em>v. <em>Estate of Marcos, supra, </em>103 F.3d 767, 786-787; <em>Yorktown Medical Laboratory, Inc. v. Perales </em>(2d Cir. 1991) 948 F.2d 84, 89-90; <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of N.J. v.

The calculation of this figure was based on deposition testimony of the sample group regarding hours worked over 12 hours in a day or over 8 hours on the seventh day of a work week. The judgment awarded plaintiffs $1,210,337 as compensation for unpaid double-time hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">FIE\u2019s expert, Roy Weinstein, calculated that the use of the sample average of 0.37 hours of unpaid double-time compensation to determine unpaid double time for the entire class was subject to a margin of error of 0.12 hours or about 32 percent. Moreover, the distribution of employees claiming unpaid double time was highly skewed. Some 83 employees claimed some amount of unpaid double-time compensation, but only 54 employees claimed 0.37 hours or more, and a group of only 16 employees accounted for half of the double-time award.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In our view, the possible inaccuracy of the estimate of unpaid double-time compensation presents an issue of constitutional dimension. We do not mean to suggest that the margin of error alone may afford a bright-line constitutional distinction. The reliability of an estimate subject to a large margin of error might conceivably be bolstered by evidence of a high response rate, probable distribution within the margin of error, absence of measurement error, or other matters. We have been unable to find in the present record, however, anything that addresses the issues of reliability involved in the calculation of double-time damages. The estimate of unpaid double-time pay appears as a kind of afterthought in the trial management plan. The parties\u2019 experts did not offer foundational calculations for the determination of double-time or propose an appropriate class size, margin of error, or sampling methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">We recognize that there are circumstances when a rough approximation of damages is preferable to a failure of justice resulting from no award at all. The record, however, reveals no consideration of possible alternatives or refinements to the statistical methodology and trial procedures used for calculation of the double-time element of damages. Under the <em>Doehr </em>analysis, the absence of evidence regarding possible alternatives is relevant not only to the risk of error but also to the ancillary government interest in the procedure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The government cannot have an interest in a procedure if superior alternative procedures are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Employing the balancing test mandated by <em>Doehr, </em>we conclude that the award of double-time compensation does not withstand due process challenge. We therefore reverse the portion of the judgment awarding unpaid double-time compensation of $1,210,337.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">(c) <em>Implementation of Trial Management Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Without any actual citation to the record, FIE makes a series of representations that it was barred from contesting the plaintiffs\u2019 proof of damages. For example, it states: \u201cAllowing proof of damages by a statistical showing . . . deprived FIE of its right to contest [plaintiffs\u2019] evidence.\u201d We agree that the trial management plan would raise due process issues if it served to restrict FIE\u2019s right to present evidence against the claims <em>(Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co. </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 306, 314 [94 L.Ed. 865, 70 S.Ct. 652]; <em>People v. Sandoval </em>(1989) 206 Cal.App.3d 1544, 1550 [254 Cal.Rptr. 674] [restitution]), but we have searched the record without finding any indication that this occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Although FIE originally proposed individual trials to establish damages, it appears that it acquiesced to statistical proof of damages at the hearing on April 21, 2000, which led to the initial order adopting a trial management plan.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This interpretation tends to be confirmed by the parties\u2019 collaboration in preparation of joint declarations of their experts and their agreement on a margin of error of one hour at the hearing on August 4, 2000. There was no mention of individual adjudication of damages at either hearing. It was not until shortly before trial that FIE raised the contention in a footnote to a status conference statement that it had not waived its demand for individual trials of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Following the depositions of the 295 employees in the sample, FIE and plaintiffs agreed to work calendars, i.e., tabulations of data, that reflected the content of each employee\u2019s testimony. FIE later waived the right to impeach the employees\u2019 testimony at trial. Under the guidance of the special master, the parties agreed to a series of deadlines by which FIE was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>identify any deponent whom it wished to impeach. FIE initially challenged the testimony of two deponents and then resolved differences with plaintiffs with respect to these two witnesses. In a pretrial hearing before the special master, FIE reserved the right to introduce testimony of class members outside the sample, but we find no indication that it pursued this option. It never included individual employees in its witness list or sought to offer their testimony at trial.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">We find only one pretrial ruling that significantly restricted FIE\u2019s right to contest plaintiffs\u2019 proof of damages: the order precluding its expert witness, Roy Weinstein, from testifying on probable measurement error in the deposition testimony of sample members. By measurement error, he meant a tendency for deponents to overstate average hours worked. After an extensive argument and offer of proof, the trial court excluded the testimony on the ground, among others, that it involved an asserted psychological phenomenon outside the scope of Weinstein\u2019s expertise as an economist and statistician. FIE has <em>not </em>assigned error to this ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In short, we find nothing in the record that substantiates FIE\u2019s claim that the trial management plan restricted its opportunities to contest the evidence of damages or to present rebuttal evidence relating to hours worked by individual employees. Plaintiffs proved damages by a process of \u201cjust and reasonable inference\u201d as in other wage claim actions, and FIE was afforded the opportunity to \u201ccome forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed or with evidence to negative the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee\u2019s evidence.\u201d <em>(Mt. Clemens, supra, </em>328 U.S. 680, 687-688.) In doing so, FIE appears to have chosen to rely on its own statistical evidence as a matter of trial tactics. To the extent that the use of statistical sampling led to rough or expedient justice, it was in the adjudication of the relative entitlements of individual claimants to share in the aggregate award. FIE itself was not prejudiced by this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">E. <em>Postjudgment Plan of Distribution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In light of our discussion of FIE\u2019s due process objections to the trial management plan, we see little need to comment on its contention that \u201cthe postjudgment claims procedure does not cure the due process violations.\u201d Since we have found no due process violations in the award of aggregate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>classwide damages for time-and-a-half overtime compensation, the judgment does not present any due process infirmity to be cured. \u201cA class action which affords due process of law to the defendant through the time when the amount of [its] liability is calculated cannot suddenly deprive [it] of [its] constitutional rights because of the way the damages are distributed.\u201d <em>(Bruno </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d 120, 129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">It is well established that \u201cthe allocation of that aggregate sum [of the judgment] among class members is an internal class accounting question that does not directly concern the defendant. . . .\u201d (2 Conte &amp; Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4:26, p. 233.) The trial court here followed the accepted practice of establishing a non-adversary proof-of-claim procedure. After \u201cthe defendant\u2019s total damage liability is paid over to a class fund[,] . . . individual class members are afforded an opportunity to collect their individual shares by proving their particular damages, usually according to a lowered standard of proof.\u201d <em>(State of California v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 460, 472; see also <em>In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litigation, supra, </em>73 F.R.D. 322, 353; <em>In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, supra, </em>333 F.Supp. 278, 287.) The record does not show that the class members, who are directly affected by this procedure, have raised any complaint. FIE may raise a due process objection only by showing that the procedure affected the total amount of its liability. (See p. 752, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We also note that FIE has raised only two narrow issues concerning the specific provisions of the postjudgment orders adopting a plan of distribution and awarding common fund attorney fees and costs: the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 384 to disposition of any residue in the damages fund and the need for a mechanism \u201cto question an apparently excessive claim.\u201d It has not assigned error to the award of common fund attorney fees. Moreover, it does not question the timing of the postjudgment notice requiring class members to submit proof-of-claim forms. Indeed, FIE did not request the mailing of such notices to class members prior to the damage phase of the trial but rather sought a second opt-out notice and pursued motions for class decertification. We thus have no occasion to consider the feasibility, or possible merit, of requiring submission of claim forms prior to the adjudication of aggregate classwide liability. (See 7B Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Fed. Practice and Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1784, p. 79; <em>In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, supra, </em>333 F.Supp. 278, 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">FIE raises a potentially difficult issue regarding the disposition of any residue in the damages fund, which turns on the interpretation and application of Code of Civil Procedure section 384. The plan of distribution logically entails the possibility that the total sum of damage claims submitted by class members, plus prejudgment interest, will be less than the judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>aggregate classwide damages and interest. The judgment expressly provides for this possibility with respect to prejudgment interest; if the total amount of prejudgment interest paid to class members upon payment of their claims should be less than the actual award of prejudgment interest,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> FIE \u201cmay seek to amend the Judgment to allow it to recover the difference (if any) between the total amount awarded by the Court . . . and the total lesser amount payable to claiming class members . . . .\u201d The plan of distribution, however, deferred a ruling on the disposition of any unclaimed damages to a later proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 384. It directs the plaintiffs or the claims administrator to submit \u201ca postdistribution report stating the total amount that was actually paid to class members . . . .\u201d After receiving class counsel\u2019s recommendation on \u201chow any such residue should be distributed,\u201d the court is to determine how \u201cto distribute the residue consistent with C.C.P. \u00a7 384(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure section 384 states the legislative intent \u201cto ensure that the unpaid residuals in class action litigation are distributed, to the extent possible, in a manner designed either to further the purposes of the underlying causes of action, or to promote justice for all Californians.\u201d Subdivision (b) contemplates a report to the court followed by an order paying the residue to a charity: \u201cThe court shall... set a date when the parties shall report to the court the total amount that was actually paid to the class members. After the report is received, the court shall amend the judgment to direct the defendant to pay the sum of the unpaid residue ... to nonprofit organizations or foundations to support projects that will benefit the class ... or that promote the law consistent with the objectives and purposes of the underlying cause of action, to child advocacy programs, or to nonprofit organizations providing civil legal services to the indigent. . . .\u201d (See <em>Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 128 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 999 P.2d 718].)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">FIE acknowledges that the distribution of the unpaid residue of a class action judgment to a nonprofit organization may be appropriate where the judgment requires a defendant to disgorge money that was fraudulently or unjustly acquired. (See <em>Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 116, 127.) Such a distribution may be appropriate for tort damages that serve a broad remedial purpose and are incapable of precise measurement. But FIE reasonably argues that the sole purpose of the judgment here is to provide for payment of overtime compensation that is due and payable and the amount of this unpaid compensation is subject to precise calculation. Under these circumstances, FIE maintains, it would constitute a taking in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>violation of due process to distribute any excess in the damage fund to a third party as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">FIE\u2019s constitutional objections, however, are directed at a contingency that has not yet occurred and indeed may be unlikely. By deferring a decision on the disposition of unpaid residue in the damage fund, the plan of distribution not only followed the procedure mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 384 but also adopted a course of action consistent with the principle that \u201cwe do not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely required to do so to dispose of the matter before us.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 663, 667 [128 Cal.Rptr. 888, 547 P.2d 1000]; <em>Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority </em>v. <em>Guardino </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 220, 230 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 207, 902 P.2d 225]; <em>Walker v. Kiousis </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1441 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 69].) The application of section 384 to the present case may require the trial court to consider constitutional issues bearing on the interpretation and enforceability of the statute. These issues can best be deferred to a later stage in the proceedings when it is known whether such a residue exists and the issues regarding its disposition can receive a full and adequate briefing. In so holding, we construe the plan of distribution as calling for a hearing before the trial court in which both parties will be given an opportunity to brief the full range of statutory and constitutional issues involved in the disposition of any residue in the damages fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">FEE next complains that the plan of distribution \u201cdoes not provide a mechanism for the claims administrator to question an apparently excessive claim.\u201d The plaintiffs question whether FIE has standing to object to excessive claims, but we think it necessarily follows that, if FIE can assert a claim on due process grounds for an undistributed residue in a postjudgment hearing, it has standing to question the procedure that may affect the amount of this residue, even though it may be unlikely that the residue will actually materialize. We do not reach the question whether FEE\u2019S interest in the morale of its employees is sufficient to give it standing to question the plan of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Plaintiffs properly object that FIE is attempting to inject at this late stage in the proceeding a costly and time-consuming procedure that will undermine the advantages of a class action for aggregate damages. In <em>In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation, supra, </em>597 F.Supp. 740, 838, the federal court observed, \u201cIf the judicial and monetary economies of the class action are not to be lost through lengthy and expensive individual trials on damages, some mechanism must be devised to decide damage claims without the need for a full-fledged trial for each plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiffs here proposed the simple mechanism of distributing damages to all class members based on average overtime hours for the class. At FIE\u2019s request, the trial court ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>a proof-of-claim procedure that relies on the accuracy and honesty of individual employees to achieve its purposes and involves considerably more administrative complexity. We reject FIE\u2019s effort to transform this proof-of-claim procedure into a quasi-adversary proceeding that will cause the economies of the class action to be \u201clost through lengthy and expensive trials on damages.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Nevertheless, FIE\u2019s assignment of error embraces a much narrower concern relating to precautions against fraud. We may appropriately consider whether this narrower issue has been addressed, or is capable of being addressed, in ways that will not unduly burden the claims procedure. Our high court\u2019s discussion of the issue in <em>State of California v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 460, is the only authority on point that we have found.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In <em>Levi Strauss </em>the court considered a plan to distribute $9.3 million in damages to consumers who were entitled to an average individual recovery of $2.60 to $3.00 for each purchase of the defendant\u2019s jeans. Notices of the settlement were mailed to 8.6 million households and other forms were made available at post offices. The trial court ordered that the top 5 percent of claims would be treated as suspect and the claim forms would be \u201creturned with instructions to resubmit with a notarized statement confirming their veracity.\u201d <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Levi Strauss &amp; Co., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 460, 470.) Over 80 percent of these claims were not resubmitted. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The intervener argued that the plan rewarded \u201cinflated or baseless claims\u201d and was afflicted with \u201cwidespread fraud.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476.) The Supreme Court noted that \u201cthere appears to be no reported decision in any jurisdiction approving a plan so lacking in safeguards against fraud\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 477), but still affirmed the judgment \u201c[d]ue to . . . practical considerations . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Though the court affirmed the plan of distribution, we read the <em>Levi Strauss </em>decision as saying that precautions against fraud are a legitimate concern in crafting a plan of distribution, and a failure to provide adequate precautions against fraud may constitute an abuse of discretion. The plan of distribution here includes four features that may be regarded as precautions against fraud: (1) the claims of the 343 employees who were deposed (14 percent of the total) will be based on their deposition testimony; (2) other claims must be signed under penalty of perjury; (3) employees who claim to have worked an average of more than 40 overtime hours per week will have their payments based on 40 overtime hours per week; (4) if claim forms are not properly completed, the claims administrator or class counsel may contact class members and provide them with an opportunity to file amended claims, and, if necessary information is still lacking, submit a recommendation to the court concerning the appropriate distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Under this procedure, if an undeposed employee properly completes a proof-of-claim form and reports less than 40 hours per week of average overtime, the only procedural safeguard against fraud is the requirement of signing the form under penalty of perjury. We have no way of knowing whether the fear of peijury, as well as personal honesty and peer pressure, will prove sufficient to guarantee the integrity of the claims process. We are troubled, however, that the plan does not empower the claims administrator to take action if it receives a quantity of large claims that markedly exceeds the frequency of such claims reported in depositions of the random sample. The most obvious response would be to give the claims administrator or his designee discretionary authority to challenge a small and strictly limited number of claims presenting indicia of possible fraud. The challenge could be governed by the existing procedures applying to employee challenges to preprinted information on the claim form, which may lead ultimately to a decision by the special master.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> If combined with a conspicuous notice informing employees that the claims administrator has authority to investigate claims for fraud and with a cap on allowable average overtime hours well below the unrealistic limit of 40 hours per week, a strictly limited power of challenge might significantly reduce the possibility of fraud without unduly burdening the claims administration process. We remand the case to the trial court for a limited amendment of the plan of distribution and the order approving claim forms and instructions, which will authorize the claims administer to challenge suspect claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">F. <em>Improper Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Lastly, FIE maintains that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel improperly argued to the jury in his opening argument that their verdict would be \u201can important message,\u201d which would be heard by FIE\u2019s corporate headquarters and by other employers.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> FIE waited until the end of counsel\u2019s argument to object that the remark was an appeal to \u201cthe jury\u2019s passion\u201d and represented an attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>impose the equivalent of punitive damages. The trial court asked plaintiffs\u2019 counsel if he was willing to state to the jury that he did not request punitive damages. Counsel agreed to do so, and the court concluded, \u201cI think that will clear it.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> FIE again raised its objection in its motion for new trial. Rejecting the claim of error, the trial court found that counsel\u2019s remarks \u201cwere not misconduct and in any event were cured by counsel\u2019s other statements to the jury, and there is no indication that the jury was influenced by passion or prejudice . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We consider that any arguable claim of impropriety disappears if the argument is considered as a whole. <em>(Nishihama v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 298, 304\u2014306 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 861].) Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel repeatedly stated that the jury should award plaintiffs what they were entitled to.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> He explained, \u201c[T]he reason it\u2019s so important is because the overtime laws embody a fundamental public policy of the State of California. And people are entitled to be paid overtime at premium rates.\u201d In this context, counsel simply appealed to the jury to vindicate the public policy underlying the overtime laws by holding FIE accountable for the full amount of overtime compensation owing to plaintiffs. We do not view this argument as suggesting that the jury should inflate the damage award or award the equivalent of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On the present record, we do not need to invoke the rule giving counsel wide latitude in arguing to the jury <em>(Tingley v. Times Mirror </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 1, 23 [89 P. 1097]; <em>Menasco </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 729, 732 [203 Cal.Rptr. 748]) or to rely on the deference to be given the trial court\u2019s ruling on alleged misconduct. <em>(Sabella </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 311, 319 [74 Cal.Rptr. 534, 449 P.2d 750]; <em>Cope v. Davison </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d.193, 203 [180 P.2d 873, 171 A.L.R. 667].) We do not consider that counsel exceeded the bounds of proper argument. Moreover, we see no possibility of prejudice to FIE. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel dispelled any possible suggestion of impropriety by disclaiming a request for punitive damages in his later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>statement to the jury. The jury verdict was properly based on the quantitative calculations of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness, rather than any subjective measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The portion of the judgment filed September 24, 2001, based on the special verdict of $1,210,337 for unpaid double-time hours worked by the class is reversed and the judgment is otherwise affirmed. The order re plan of distribution filed September 20, 2001, and the order approving claim forms and instructions filed April 23, 2002, are reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the postjudgment orders subject to appeal are affirmed.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Marchiano, P.
