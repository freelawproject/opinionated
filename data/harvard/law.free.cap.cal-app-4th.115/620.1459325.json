(Lab. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 5950; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 57.) Crown believes the WCAB\u2019s decision is unreasonable and unsupported by substantial evidence even though Crown\u2019s owner expressed her belief that Wong was faking a disability and treated him badly before dismissing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">We recognize that it is unusual to publish a denial of a petition for writ of review of a WCAB decision. Under the circumstances, we have decided to do so for two reasons. First, there is little case law interpreting section 132a prohibiting an employer from discriminating against an employee for exercising his or her rights under the workers\u2019 compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Second, Crown is apparently unaware of an appellate court\u2019s well-settled role in reviewing the WCAB\u2019s factual determinations. (\u00a7 5953; <em>LeVesque v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.Sd 627, 635-637 [83 Cal.Rptr. 208, 463 P.2d 432].) Obviously, Crown has an absolute right to seek relief from an appellate court. We publish to remind the parties, however, that it is still important to evaluate the merits of a potential appeal because a meritless petition may, as in this case, draw adverse consequences. Here, we find a wealth of substantial evidence of employer discrimination and therefore agree with Wong that the petition for writ of review lacks a reasonable basis. Accordingly, we remand to the WCAB to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. (\u00a7 5801.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\n<em>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORIES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Wong sustained an industrial injury to his left elbow and back in August 2000 while employed as a delivery driver and appliance installer for Crown in Modesto, California. The parties settled Wong\u2019s underlying disability claim but continued to dispute whether Crown discriminated against Wong under section 132a.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">At a March 2003 WCAB hearing, Wong testified that he had a very good relationship with the owner of Crown, Mary Sanchez, before his injury. Their rapport changed, however, after Wong returned to work on light duty. Sanchez constantly complained about Wong\u2019s performance and gave him the impression nothing he did was good enough. Sanchez also excluded Wong from monthly employee meetings. Their relationship did not improve even after Wong returned to his usual and customary job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Sanchez fired Wong in May 2001 at a time when Crown\u2019s business was very busy. She told him he used bad language in front of a customer and that a screw fell out of a dishwasher installation he had done a year earlier. Wong was unaware of any complaints regarding his performance before he was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Mathew Bums worked at Crown and described the rapport between Wong and Sanchez before Wong\u2019s injury as \u201cfriendly.\u201d When Wong returned on light duty, however, Sanchez was \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cice cold\u201d toward Wong. Bums saw Wong\u2019s employment change from a \u201cgreat job\u201d to \u201cnothing was good enough.\u201d Bums confirmed that Wong was excluded from work meetings. Sanchez told Bums that she believed Wong was faking his injury and was not hurt. She also said Wong \u201cwas not an employee and doesn\u2019t want to work.\u201d Bums thought Wong was a good employee and could not believe he would leave out a screw on an installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Sharon Sharp was a customer of Crown who voiced a complaint to Sanchez about Wong. She could not recall if she complained in July 2000 or July 2001, after Sanchez had fired Wong in May 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Sanchez explained that she terminated Wong because of customer complaints and not his workers\u2019 compensation claim. She recalled that Wong\u2019s personnel file contained three complaints, but she could not locate the file. She documented the complaints herself within a two-day period in May 2001 and last saw them at an Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (UIAB) hearing in June 2001. Sanchez felt Wong\u2019s work performance while on light duty was unsatisfactory, but she believed that she could not fire him until he returned to regular duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In May 2003, a workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) found that Crown had violated section 132a by terminating Wong. In July 2003, the WCAB granted Crown\u2019s petition for reconsideration and remanded the case to the WCJ for the limited purpose of assessing attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">I. <em>Employer discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Section 132a expressly declares California\u2019s public policy that \u201cthere should not be discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment.\u201d (See <em>Judson Steel Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658, 667 [150 Cal.Rptr. 250, 586 P.2d 564].) An employer violates the express provisions of section 132a and is guilty of a misdemeanor if it \u201cdischarges, or threatens to discharge, or in any manner discriminates\u201d against an employee for (1) filing, or making known his or her intention to file, a workers\u2019 compensation claim; (2) receiving a disability rating, award, or settlement; or (3) testifying, or making known his or her intentions to testify, in another\u2019s disability claim. (\u00a7 132a, subds. (1), (3).) An employer who discriminates against an injured worker must increase the employee\u2019s disability compensation by 50 percent, up to $10,000, plus reinstate the employee and provide lost wages and benefits. (\u00a7 132a, subd. (1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Section 132a not only condemns the types of discrimination specifically proscribed by that section, but also contemplates preventing all forms of discrimination against injured employees. <em>(Judson Steel Corp., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 667.) Further, section 132a liability attaches regardless of the employer\u2019s intentions. A worker demonstrates a prima facie showing of section 132a discrimination by proving that \u201cas the result of an industrial injury, the employer engaged in conduct detrimental to the worker.\u201d <em>(Barns </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 524, 531 [266 Cal.Rptr. 503]; see 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed. 2001) \u00a7 10.11[1], p. 10-20.) If the worker makes this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>showing, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that its conduct was necessary and directly linked to the realities of doing business. <em>{Barns, supra, </em>at p. 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Affirming the WCJ\u2019s finding that Crown discriminated against Wong in retaliation for his disability claim, the WCAB reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u201cAt trial, applicant testified that he was treated well by the owner, Mary Sanchez, before his injury, when he worked as a delivery driver and installer. When he returned from his injury to a light duty capacity, however, applicant was treated harshly. He was required to clean bathrooms, break up cardboard and perform menial errands. He was no longer invited to meetings as he was before the injury. Further testimony reveals that the owner expressed that she believed applicant was faking his injury and that he was not really hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201cThe evidence also indicates that there may have been complaints regarding applicant, but there is no evidence of when these complaints originated, whether before or after his injury. Applicant was not reprimanded for these complaints before his injury, but he was reprimanded for these events after his injury. In fact, applicant testified that he was unaware of any customer complaints about him until he was terminated. Additionally, applicant\u2019s personnel file could not be located by the employer. There were allegedly two verbal complaints regarding applicant and one written complaint, although the employer could not document the complaints because of the missing personnel file, [f] . . . [f]</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u201cIn the instant case, . . . there is no recognizable reality of business which the employer can point to in order to justify applicant\u2019s termination. The employer\u2019s position that it terminated applicant based upon customer complaints is not capable of verification by the employer, and there is no record or testimony of any action being taken by the employer against applicant regarding the alleged complaints until after his injury. Therefore, we agree with the WCJ that applicant\u2019s termination was performed in such a manner to discriminate against applicant, pursuant to Labor Code \u00a7 132a.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Crown disputes the WCAB\u2019s interpretation of the record and instead claims \u201cthe evidence is clear that the complaints against Mr. Wong occurred after his injury, and his termination was necessitated by the realities of doing business.\u201d Crown relies on Sanchez\u2019s testimony that she attended the UIAB hearing and presented the board with the complaints from Wong\u2019s personnel file. In May 2001, according to the UIAB\u2019s written opinion admitted into the WCAB record, \u201ctwo customer complaints were reduced to writing by the employer and the claimant was confronted with the written summary of the complaints. The claimant signed below the written warnings acknowledging that he had these matters discussed with him by the employer.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The UIAB record also described a third complaint Sanchez recalled receiving the next day regarding a faulty dishwasher installation from a year earlier. However, the UIAB administrative law judge found the complaints of little weight in determining whether Crown discharged Wong for misconduct (see Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1030, 1032, 1256):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">\u201cThe claimant testified under oath and was subject to cross-examination by the undersigned as well as the employer. On the other hand, the statements attributed to the customers were entirely in hearsay form since they were only in the hand written reportings of the employer and what she stated was related to her. Even the described incomplete installation of the dishwasher is in the form of hearsay since the worker that completed the reinstallation did not submit a written statement or otherwise testify in this matter. Therefore, the hearsay submitted by the employer is found to be outweighed by the claimant\u2019s sworn testimony to the [contrary].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The UIAB was also skeptical of Crown\u2019s contention that Wong had inappropriately installed the dishwasher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cThe fact that the dishwasher stayed in its hole for over a year fails to show that the installation initially was improper. Sometimes events like that happen without any fault at all and the evidence as presented by the employer has not established that the claimant was even at fault, much less knowingly or willingly failed to follow the proper installation procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The WCAB similarly was not persuaded by Sanchez\u2019s testimony, noting that \u201c[t]he employer\u2019s position that it terminated applicant based upon customer complaints is not capable of verification by the employer, and there is no record or testimony of any action being taken by the employer against applicant regarding the alleged complaints until after his injury.\u201d The WCAB thus found \u201cthere is no recognizable reality of business which the employer can point to in order to justify applicant\u2019s termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">As the trier of fact, the WCAB is empowered to resolve conflicts in the evidence and make credibility determinations. <em>(Garza v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [90 Cal.Rptr. 355, 475 P.2d 451].) \u201cIn resolving the petition for writ of review, we must determine whether the evidence, when reviewed in the light of the entire record, supports the Board\u2019s decision; and in doing so, we must consider the weight or persuasiveness of all the evidence, not just whether there is substantial evidence in favor of respondents employer and insurer.\u201d <em>(Rubalcava v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 901, 908 [269 Cal.Rptr. 656].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Although Crown argues the evidence before the UIAB supports its contention it dismissed Wong for legitimate business reasons, it fails to recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>that even that tribunal doubted the veracity of the customer complaints against Wong. Moreover, the WCAB could infer from Smith\u2019s testimony that she complained of Wong before his injury in June 2000, yet Crown used the complaint against Wong only after he filed his workers\u2019 compensation claim. Based on substantial evidence that Sanchez treated Wong poorly after his industrial injury, that she believed he was faking his disability, and that she wanted to dismiss Wong since he returned to work on light duty, the WCAB acted within its authority in finding that Crown fired Wong in retaliation for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">II. <em>Attorneys \u2019 fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Wong requests attorneys\u2019 fees associated with responding to Crown\u2019s petition for writ of review. Under section 5801, when an injured employee prevails in defending against an employer\u2019s WCAB petition for writ review and the appellate court finds \u201cno reasonable basis for the petition,\u201d the court must remand the matter to the WCAB for a supplemental attorneys\u2019 fees award determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Attorneys\u2019 fees are not, however, automatically awarded simply because an appellate court affirms the WCAB\u2019s decision. <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1265, 1274 [268 Cal.Rptr. 699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 104 [120 Cal.Rptr. 48]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sets forth two examples in which an appellate court might conclude that a petition lacks a reasonable basis. Attorneys\u2019 fees may be appropriate either (1) \u201cwhen an employer contends that an award is not supported by substantial evidence and a review of the evidence shows that the award is supported by the competent opinion of one physician, although inconsistent with other medical opinions,\u201d or (2) \u201cwhen an employer raises an issue in the petition for writ of review which was not raised in the petition for reconsideration before the board, thus, an issue which we may not consider . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 108, 109; see also <em>Nelson &amp; Sloan </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 51, 53 [144 Cal.Rptr. 614].) \u201c[T]hese circumstances for finding no reasonable basis for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>review petition are \u2018analogous to the lack of merit of a frivolous appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Klee </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1519, 1524 [260 Cal.Rptr. 217], citing <em>Bekins Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 675, 685 [163 Cal.Rptr. 213].) An action is frivolous when it serves \u201cto harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse judgment or when it indisputably has no merit when any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">We find Crown\u2019s petition for writ of review indisputably without merit and substantially similar to the first category of situations lacking a reasonable basis under <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d at pages 108-109. Crown did not present this court with a question of law and only argued that the WCAB\u2019s decision was unreasonable and unsupported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record. Testimonial evidence from both Wong and his coworker reveals, however, that Wong\u2019s employment relationship significantly changed after he filed his workers\u2019 compensation claim. Sanchez became \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cice cold\u201d toward Wong, excluded him from company meetings, and felt he was no longer an employee. Crown ignores the great weight of evidence in favor of the WCAB\u2019s decision and instead asks this court to rely on evidence discounted as unpersuasive by not only the WCAB, but also the UIAB. Even if this court were convinced Crown dismissed Wong for the realities of business, we could not reweigh the evidence to decide a disputed question of fact supported by substantial evidence. (\u00a7 5953; <em>Western Growers Ins. Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 233 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 26].)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>DISPOSITION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The petition for writ of review is denied. Under authority of section 5801, we find no reasonable basis for the petition and remand the cause to the WCAB to make a supplemental award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the attorneys for respondent Morton Wong based on the services rendered in answering the petition.
