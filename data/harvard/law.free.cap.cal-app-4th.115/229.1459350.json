On appeal, both contend that the court erred in finding that a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officer did not impermissibly use military personnel to obtain the evidence supporting the search warrant in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA). (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385.) In a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which we have ordered considered together with the appeal, Dave asserts that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not advise Dave that he would be subject to mandatory deportation and exclusion from the United States for conviction of the charge to which he pled.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">On July 6, 2000, DEA Agent Joseph Muenchow and other agents made a third trip to a public storage facility at 1395 Mabury Road in San Jose on an investigation unrelated to this case that began in November 1999. Because the two sheriff\u2019s narcotics detection dog and handler teams that Muenchow normally used were unavailable that day, Muenchow had contacted agent Stan Baroff at the DEA office at San Francisco airport who arranged for the assistance of United States Army Sergeant James Harris, and Harris\u2019s narcotics detection dog, Rocko. Army narcotics detection canine teams were given previous assignments for the DEA, and \u201cdog handlers and their dogs rotate in and out to assist DEA task force . . . .\u201d Muenchow did not check for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>availability of a dog team with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) whose narcotics detection dog teams he had also used in the past or with other local narcotics task forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Muenchow was aware of the PCA and knew that use of the military by civilian law enforcement was not allowed. The PCA provides \u201c[w]hoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1981, Congress amended the PCA to allow for certain military assistance in fighting the war on drugs (10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371-378), but the statutory exceptions were intended to be narrowly limited, so as \u201cnot [to] include or permit direct participation by a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps in a search, seizure, arrest, or other similar activity unless participation in such activity by such member is otherwise authorized by law.\u201d (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 375.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Muenchow relied on his supervisor when he accepted the assistance of Harris and Rocko.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Harris and Rocko met the agents at the storage facility. On their way to the area Muenchow was interested in, they \u201cjust happened to stroll\u201d past defendants\u2019 locker, B-46. Rocko had been let off his leash, and he went directly to the vicinity of B-46 and sat down. This was the signal Rocko and Harris used for a positive \u201calert\u201d for narcotics. It was not clear whether Rocko was alerting to B-46 or B-47, so Harris walked him away and then twice let him return to the area. At that point, it became clear to Harris that Rocko was alerting to locker B-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Harris and Rocko were certified by the Military Working Dog team on December 17, 1999. In the affidavit in support of the search warrant, Muenchow stated that Rocko was certified as a patrol dog in narcotics detection at a 93 percent accuracy rate. Under military rules,. a dog loses certification if the detection rate falls below 90 percent for three or more consecutive months, if the dog is separated from the handler, or fails to train for 30 or more consecutive days, or if a new trainer/handler is assigned. Rocko and Harris were currently certified and currently were in compliance with all military requirements. Rocko was certified to detect cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana in all its forms. Because of the extent of Rocko\u2019s training, it was not possible to determine what type of controlled substance caused him to \u201calert.\u201d Muenchow stated Rocko may have alerted on any individual controlled substance or any combination for which he is trained.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Using a federal administrative subpoena which may be authorized by the acting supervising agent at the DEA office, Muenchow obtained the rental agreement which identified Michael as the renter and Dave as someone who had access to the locker. Muenchow ran a record check on defendants and learned that Dave had two arrests in Fresno and Coalinga in 1994 for using a false compartment in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11366.8. No disposition was listed for the Fresno case and the Coalinga case was dismissed. However, marijuana and \u201c$4,000 was seized\u201d in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Muenchow obtained the search warrant the same day, and then returned to the storage facility and searched locker B-46. He seized approximately 100 pounds of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The next day, Muenchow went to defendants\u2019 home, searched their house, found a small bag of marijuana in Michael\u2019s bedroom, and arrested them. Dave admitted that he and Michael shared the storage locker.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Defendants were charged and pled guilty to a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11359, possession for sale of marijuana. Their earlier motions to quash the search warrant and suppress the evidence had been denied and the plea bargain promised them prison terms of 16 months. They received the agreed-upon sentences. These appeals ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">ISSUE ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Defendants assert their motions to quash and suppress should have been granted because the evidence supporting issuance of the search warrant was obtained through the impermissible use of military personnel in civilian law enforcement in violation of the PCA. Dave argues this violated his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cIn ruling on [a motion to suppress evidence], the trial court (1) finds the historical facts, (2) selects the applicable rule of law, and (3) applies the latter to the former to determine whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not violated. [Citations.] \u2018The [trial] court\u2019s resolution of each of these inquires is, of course, subject to appellate review.\u2019 [Citations.] [f] The court\u2019s resolution of the first inquiry, which involves questions of fact, is reviewed under the deferential substantial-evidence standard. [Citations.] Its decision on the second, which is a pure question of law, is scrutinized under the standard of independent review. [Citations.] Finally, its ruling on the third, which is a mixed fact-law question that is however predominantly one of law, ... is also subject to independent review.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 243, 279 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 532, 6 P.3d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Defendants complain that Harris\u2019s and Rocko\u2019s \u201calert\u201d constituted direct involvement of the military in a civilian law enforcement procedure. In denying the motion to quash and suppress at preliminary hearing, the magistrate said, \u201cthis dog, I believe, gave them a tip. I think that was indirect military involvement .... I don\u2019t think this indirect assistance to civilian authorities without subjecting civilians to the exercise of military power that is regulatory, proscriptive or compulsory in nature, was what occurred. ... I believe this was indirect assistance to a civilian authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">When the motion was brought de novo in superior court, the judge denied the motion stating, \u201cI don\u2019t see where Sergeant Harris\u2019 involvement resulted in some kind of regulatory compulsive military power or exercise. It certainly didn\u2019t amount to a direct or active involvement in execution of laws. He was there to report. He wasn\u2019t there to enforce, and it does not seem that he pervaded the activity of the civilian authorities, i.e., the Department of Justice fellow who was part of the investigation. He was there as sort of an assistant or an ancillary tool to help rather than to direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Defendants had a protectable privacy interest in the storage locker that they rented. However, they did not have a protectable privacy interest in the air space around the locker or the air that emanated from the locker. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mayberry </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 335, 341 [182 Cal.Rptr. 617, 644 P.2d 810].) Agent Muenchow and Sergeant Harris were rightfully in the public space of a public storage facility on an investigation unrelated to defendants. It is unknown if this investigation was related to airport security, the purpose for which Sergeant Harris and Rocko were assigned to San Francisco airport. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>While Muenchow and Harris were where they had a right to be, they observed Rocko unexpectedly \u201calert\u201d on a storage locker. \u201c[E]xposure of respondent\u2019s luggage, which was located in a public place, to a trained canine-did not constitute a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Un<em>ited States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 696, 707 [77 L.Ed.2d 110, 103 S.Ct. 2637].) Our Supreme Court has also found a dog sniff not to be a search requiring any level of objective justification under the Fourth Amendment. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The significance and reliability of Rocko\u2019s \u201calert\u201d was conveyed to Muenchow by Rocko\u2019s handler, Harris. Rocko\u2019s alert as interpreted by Harris was a \u201ctip\u201d from an informant who made an observation that caused him to believe a crime was being committed which he reported to a law enforcement officer. No one, officer or citizen or member of the military, happening on a fact indicating that a crime is being committed during an investigation of another case, has to ignore it. (See <em>People v. Ortiz </em>(1956) 147 Cal.App.2d 248, 252 [305 P.2d 145].) Harris properly communicated the significance of Rocko\u2019s \u201calert\u201d to Muenchow. Harris did not participate any further in the investigation of the tip. He did not write the search warrant affidavit, testify before the magistrate, conduct the search of the locker, or seize the marijuana. Giving a tip did not constitute an exercise of regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory military power or direct involvement in the execution of laws, nor did it pervade<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the activities of civilian authorities. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Kahn </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 35 F.3d 426, 431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Muenchow obtained the search warrant and conducted the search. The magistrate correctly found reasonable cause for issuance of the warrant. A dog alert can provide the probable cause needed for a search warrant. <em>(United States v. Spetz </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 721 F.2d 1457, 1464; <em>Estes v. Rowland </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 508, 532 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 901].) Harris and Rocko were reliable informants. Muenchow knew their identity, their training and experience, and the fact that Harris and Rocko were acting voluntarily and openly with no apparent reason to speak falsely. (See <em>People v. Superior Court (Meyer) </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 579, 582 [173 Cal.Rptr. 544].) Muenchow corroborated the tip by his personal observation of Rocko\u2019s behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and his past experience with canine narcotics detection teams. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Schunk </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1334 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 438].) Muenchow knew from his training and experience that drugs are commonly kept in storage lockers. Muenchow also knew from his investigation of defendants before he sought the search warrant of Dave\u2019s prior possession of marijuana and $4,000 and his arrests for the use of a false compartment. Defendants\u2019 motions were correctly denied. There was probable cause for issuance of the warrant and there was no violation of the PCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">WRIT PETITION</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Dave contends that his trial counsel\u2019s representation fell below the standards for effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to advise him that deportation and exclusion from readmission<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was mandatory (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)) for possession of marijuana for sale, an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under federal law (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B)), and did not attempt to negotiate a plea bargain to a nonaggravated felony such as offering to sell marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11360).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The People respond that the petition should be dismissed for failure to first seek relief in the trial court and that even if the petition is properly before this court, Dave has not met his burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">An appellate court will usually deny a writ of habeas corpus where the petitioner has failed to make a motion or otherwise raise the point in the trial court. <em>(People v. Lempia </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 393, 398 [301 P.2d 40].) However, a habeas corpus petition may be entertained in the first instance by an appellate court if a fundamental constitutional right is involved. (I<em>n re Moss </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 913, 922 [221 Cal.Rptr. 645].) Here, the fundamental constitutional right of effective assistance of counsel is in issue. \u201cWe, therefore, entertain the present matter in the first instance. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">In response to Dave\u2019s allegations in his petition, in a declaration under penalty of perjury, his attorney declared that the defense effort was focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>primarily on the motion to quash the search warrant and suppress the evidence, and when that failed, his strategy shifted to negotiation of a plea bargain with the most lenient sentence possible. The attorney knew that Dave had a green card and was not a citizen, and he knew that violation of Health and Safety Code section 11359 was a deportable offense. He advised Dave that he \u201cwould be deported\u201d as a result of conviction unless for some reason an INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) hold was not placed upon him. The attorney did not attempt to \u201cplead upward,\u201d that is, pursue a negotiated plea for violation of a greater but nonaggravated offense such as sale, transport, or offer to sell or transport (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11360) because \u201c[t]he possibility . . . never entered my mind in this case. [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Accordingly [he] never advised [Dave] that an upward plea such as sales would carry a stiffer prison sentence yet would not result in deportation.\u201d The attorney obtained a 16-month term for Dave, which is the lowest term allowable for conviction under Health and Safety Code section 11359. (See \u00a7 18.) Dave served his term in prison, and upon his release, the INS transported him to El Centro where he was held for deportation after determination of his appeal. He has since been released pending the outcome of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The petitioner in a habeas corpus proceeding bears the initial burden of demonstrating that he or she has been deprived of effective assistance of counsel. <em>(People v. Haskett </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 210, 248 [276 Cal.Rptr. 80, 801 R2d 323].) He or she must establish that no reasonably competent attorney would have done what defense counsel did and that he or she was prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s conduct <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 979 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183]), i.e., that it is reasonably probable a more favorable determination would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings. <em>(People v. Lucas </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 436 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 525, 907 P.2d 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Michael K. Mehr, an attorney who has practiced extensively in representation of immigrants in criminal courts in the State of California to avoid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>minimize adverse immigration consequences of criminal convictions and to obtain postconviction relief to eliminate immigration consequences, submitted a declaration as an expert witness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mehr stated he answered four questions for Dave\u2019s appellate counsel: (1) What are the <em>actual </em>immigration consequences of the conviction and sentence in this case for Dave; (2) Did the representation and advice given by the attorney fall below the standards for reasonably effective assistance of counsel under California law with regard to his advice and representation during plea bargaining; (3) Whether the defendant had a reasonable probability of obtaining a plea bargain with less adverse immigration consequences; and (4) If the defendant had been convicted of a removable offense which was not an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d what would be his chances of obtaining discretionary immigration relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Mehr noted that Dave was a long-time permanent resident of the United States. With the exception of the instant crime, Dave had never been convicted of any crime. He was 28 years old and had lived in the United States for more than 17 years. His entire family lived in San Jose, California, including his father and his American citizen mother, his five siblings who are all American citizens, his wife, and his two American citizen children, a one-and-a-half-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Mehr stated the conviction for possession for sale of marijuana made Dave subject to mandatory removal from the United States, permanent ineligibility to reenter the country (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)), and also made him inadmissible to reenter (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(H)) because he was convicted for an offense relating to controlled substances and drug trafficking (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C)). Because the conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for immigration purposes, Dave is permanently precluded from naturalization (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(8)). If Dave returned illegally after deportation, he would be subject to imprisonment for up to 20 years for the federal offense of illegal reentry after deportation for an \u201caggravated felony\u201d (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In Mehr\u2019s opinion, the representation fell below objective standards of reasonableness. \u201cDefendant received only a pro forma caution from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>attorney about the deportation consequences of his guilty pleas.\u201d <em>(People v. Soriano </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1481-1482 [240 Cal.Rptr. 328].) A defendant should be able to make \u201cinformed decisions\u201d after \u201cmeaningful consultation with his attorney\u201d about pleas which will have different immigration consequences and whatever advice is given must be \u201cfounded on adequate investigation of federal immigration law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the attorney had researched the matter or \u201cmade a 5 minute phone call to an immigration attorney or a criminal attorney experienced in the immigration consequences of criminal convictions,\u201d he would have known that a final conviction of the charge would make Dave inadmissible for reentry to the United States, permanently ineligible to return, and precluded from naturalization, and if he reentered illegally, he would face 20 years in federal prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">One technique the attorney could have used to defend against adverse immigration consequences was to plead to a different but related offense. Another was to \u201cplead up\u201d to a nonaggravated felony even if the penalty was stiffen In defendant\u2019s case, because he was a long-time resident of the United States, he would have been eligible for discretionary immigration relief called \u201cCancellation of Removal\u201d even with this conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Mehr stated that he believed that if the attorney had offered to plead-up to offering to sell or transportation or offering to sell or transport marijuana, the prosecution would have accepted. Mehr based this opinion on the fact that the offer would have been to plead to a more serious offense with a greater sentencing exposure. On two cases which Mehr handled personally and three cases on which he consulted, such a disposition was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Dave submitted a declaration in support of the writ petition which stated that the INS told him he was to be deported solely as a result of this conviction. Because he lived here all his life and his entire family were here, deportation would cause extreme hardship to his family. Dave did not become aware of the grounds for his petition until he received the information in the appellate proceedings and after he was taken to El Centro. If Dave had known before he pled guilty that there were alternatives that would not create the devastating immigration consequences he is facing now, he would not have agreed to enter a plea to possession for sale. He would have asked his attorney to defend the case in every way possible to avoid or at least minimize the adverse immigration consequences to him. He would have used the immigration consequences to request that the charge be changed to simple possession or to an equivalent nonaggravated felony offense, and he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>have offered to serve more time in custody if necessary to eliminate the possibility of mandatory deportation, or he would have taken the case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In the People\u2019s brief in response to Dave\u2019s petition, the People argue that Dave cannot establish prejudice because he would almost certainly be deported regardless of whether he pleaded guilty to violating Health and Safety Code section 11359 or section 11360. \u201cWhile it is true that a violation of section 11360 does not necessarily constitute an aggravated felony triggering mandatory deportation under federal immigration law, [Dave] would undoubtedly have been deported under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C) [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] which requires the deportation of any alien believed to be involved in drug trafficking, regardless of whether the alien has been convicted of a criminal offense.\u201d The federal courts have held that 8 United States Code section 1182(a)(2)(C) does not require a conviction for inadmissibility or deportation; inadmissibility or deportation for controlled substances offenses may be established by the admission to the commission of such an offense. (See, e.g., <em>Alarcon-Serrano v. I.N.S. </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 220 F.3d 1116, 1119; <em>Pondoc Hernaez </em>v. <em>I.N.S. </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 244 F.3d 752, 756.) In this case, Dave pleaded guilty to possessing over 100 pounds of marijuana in July 2000, and had two arrests in 1994 involving controlled substance offenses. An immigration officer could reasonably infer from Dave\u2019s admission and record that he is a drug trafficker, and order his deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Although the People contend that the attorney\u2019s declaration does not support Dave\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, that Dave\u2019s arrest history and the facts of his case support the conclusions that Dave is a drug trafficker and that the expert\u2019s declaration does not discuss important considerations in evaluating Dave\u2019s chances for relief from deportation, if Dave\u2019s position prevails with a referee, he has made a persuasive case: (1) that he was not properly advised of the immigration consequences of his plea; (2) that there was more than a remote possibility that the conviction would have one or more of the specified adverse immigration consequences, namely, that the INS has notified him that he will be deported when decision on his appeal is rendered; and (3) that he was prejudiced by the nonadvisement, that is, it is reasonably probable that he would not have pleaded guilty if properly advised. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Totari </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 876, 884 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 76, 50 P.3d 781].) Defense counsel admitted that the techniques for defending against the adverse consequences never crossed his mind.
