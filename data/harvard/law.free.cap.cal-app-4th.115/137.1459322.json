J.</author>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">While incarcerated in state prison, defendant Aaron Collins was charged with possession of heroin in state prison, possession of heroin for sale, and battery on a nonconfined person. It was further alleged defendant had suffered four prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, defendant pled nolo contendere to possession of heroin in state prison and admitted one prior conviction. The remaining charges and prior conviction allegations were dismissed and defendant was sentenced to a four-year term. The trial court stated it would issue a certificate of probable cause to permit defendant to challenge the denial of his earlier motion to disclose an informant\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">On this appeal, defendant primarily contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We find no merit to this contention. Secondarily, he seeks review of the trial court\u2019s denials of his motions to disclose the identity of an informant and for Pitchess<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> discovery. We conclude that to the extent these two motions were intertwined with litigating the legality of the search, these contentions are cognizable on this appeal pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m), notwithstanding defendant\u2019s plea. Consequently, we have reviewed the sealed transcript of the in camera hearing conducted in regard to the informant motion and find no error. In regard to the <em>Pitchess </em>motion, the court denied the motion in a public proceeding on the basis that defendant had failed to establish good cause for the discovery request. That ruling was not an abuse of discretion. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The following evidence was presented at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The search of defendant was initiated after several prison officials at Lancaster State Prison received anonymous notes stating defendant was selling drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The first anonymous note was received on May 24, 2000, by Correctional Lieutenant Rose Walton. The note had been slid under her office door. Walton found it when she arrived at work at 6 a.m. The handwritten note identified defendant by name, cell, and prison number. The note stated he was selling drugs in the prison. The note was not signed. After reading the note, Walton threw it into the trash. She explained she did so \u201cbecause most of the notes that are slid underneath doors are just another reason to try to get another inmate off the yard to allow them [the senders of the notes] to continue to sell their drugs.\u201d When asked on cross-examination by defense counsel: \u201cSo you didn\u2019t determine it to be credible at that time,\u201d Walton replied: \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The next morning, May 25, Walton received another note in the same manner. She testified the note reiterated defendant had drugs on his person and read, in effect: \u201cSo you are not going to do anything to Collins [defendant] until something serious happens on the yard?\u201d The note also said copies were being sent to other prison personnel. The note did not identify its writer. Walton contacted Facility Captain Linda Schulteis to discuss the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Schulteis had received a copy of the same unsigned note that morning of May 25. The note stated defendant had a large amount of drugs \u201con him right now\u201d and threatened to inform the inspector general of these facts. The two compared the two notes and Schulteis directed Walton to search defendant and his cell as soon as possible. Schulteis testified she did so because \u201c[h]aving the information and having the responsibility to preserve the safety and security of the institution, it was my job to order that we react to the information.\u201d Walton explained the purpose of the search was to determine the validity of the charges made in the anonymous notes because the notes created a reasonable suspicion of drug possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The anonymous notes that Walton, Schulteis, and other prison officials had received were destroyed. This destruction was consistent with prison policy because the notes were not going to be used either as part of a disciplinary action against defendant, such as placement in administrative segregation or loss of time credits, or for the purpose of a criminal prosecution. Schulteis explained the anonymous notes could not form the basis of a disciplinary action because there was \u201cno test of reliability of the informant or informants.\u201d Disclosure of the notes would not have revealed the identity of their author(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The prison officials intended to conduct an \u201cunclothed body search\u201d of defendant. Schulteis explained that meant \u201c[t]o have the inmate completely disrobe and to look at every part of the inmate\u2019s body but not to be intrusive or invasive upon the inmate\u2019s body.\u201d It requires the inmate to \u201c[c]ough and bend over ... to look to see if there\u2019s anything protruding from his rectum.\u201d They \u201ccan only look\u201d but \u201ccan\u2019t touch\u201d the rectal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Prison policy authorizes visual body cavity searches in a variety of circumstances. For instance, California Code of Regulations, title 15, section 3287, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAn inmate is subject to an inspection of his or her person, either clothed or unclothed, when there is a substantial reason to believe the inmate may have unauthorized or dangerous items concealed on his or her person, or that he or she may have been involved in an altercation of any kind. Such inspections may also be a routine requirement for inmate movement into or out of high security risk areas. Random or spot-check inspections of inmates may also be authorized by the institution head to prevent possession and movement of unauthorized or dangerous items and substances into, out of, or within the institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Section 52050.18.1 of the Operations Manual for the Department of Corrections (Operations Manual) provides: \u201cInmates are subject to an inspection of their person either clothed or unclothed when there is reasonable cause to believe the inmate may have unauthorized or dangerous items or substances concealed on their person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">And section 52050.18.3 of the Operations Manual, entitled \u201cUnclothed Body Search,\u201d provides that after the inmate has completely disrobed, \u201c[sjtaff shall inspect and search each item of clothing and visually inspect the inmate\u2019s body. [][] The inmate shall face the staff member who shall visually inspect the inmate\u2019s hair, ears, mouth, nose, body, armpits, hands, scrotum, genitals, and legs. The inmate shall turn away from staff upon instruction and staff shall then inspect the inmate\u2019s back, buttocks, thighs, toes, bottom of the feet[,] and lastly, the anal area by having the inmate bend over, spread the cheeks of their buttocks and cough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Schulteis\u2019s testimony amplified this policy. She explained a random unclothed body search can be conducted in a variety of circumstances: after a prisoner has visited with an outsider, after a prisoner has returned from an outside location such as a work assignment, and after a prisoner has received medical treatment. The search can also be conducted any time a prison officer has a reason to believe an inmate might have contraband on their person. There is no requirement an officer obtain permission from a supervisor to conduct an unobtrusive unclothed body search.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">In contrast, a body cavity search requires reasonable cause and judicial authorization. It can only be performed by medical personnel in a medical setting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>After Walton received her direction from Schulteis, she contacted Officer Anthony Bennett. As defendant was exiting the dining hall, Walton \u201cordered Officer Bennett to conduct a clothed body search and then [to] place [defendant] in restraints and handcuffs and escort him to the medical clinic\u201d to \u201c[c]onduct an unclothed body search.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Bennett first conducted a clothed body search to see if anything was concealed under defendant\u2019s clothes. This search is similar to a patdown search. The officer found nothing. He then handcuffed defendant and informed him he would be taken to the medical clinic for an unclothed body search.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">As Bennett was escorting defendant to the medical clinic, defendant began to physically resist. In particular, defendant \u201cbegan to dig with his right hand . . . down the back of his pants and inside his boxer shorts [,] . . . lifting his boxer shorts up.\u201d To Bennett, \u201cit seemed like [defendant] was reaching into his pants to get rid of something.\u201d As Bennett stopped defendant\u2019s actions, Officer Michael Becker came over to assist him in taking defendant to the medical clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In the medical clinic, Bennett removed defendant\u2019s handcuffs and directed him to remove his clothes. Defendant complied. Bennett searched each item of clothes, found nothing, and then \u201cperformed the specific steps of the unclothed body search: looked at his hands, both top and bottom, underneath his arms as he raised them, his armpit area, inside his mouth, behind his ears [and] had him lift his penis [to] see if there was anything hidden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Having completed that aspect of the search, Bennett asked defendant \u201cto do a squat and cough\u201d in which defendant would \u201cturn around, bend over and cough\u201d so the officer could perform a visual inspection of the surface area of defendant\u2019s rectal cavity. Defendant refused, became verbally agitated, demanded to know why he was being subjected to a search, and eyed the toilet area in the medical clinic. Because Bennett believed if defendant \u201chad anything, he was going to try to make it to the toilet,\u201d the officer placed himself between defendant and the toilet area. Defendant responded by rushing toward Bennett with great force. At that point, Becker saw defendant use his right hand to remove an object from his buttocks. When defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>struck Bennett, the object fell from defendant\u2019s hand to the floor. The two officers quickly restrained defendant. Becker retrieved the object. The object, the size of a golf ball, consisted of several balloons wrapped in plastic wrap. The balloons contained heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Defendant testified that after Bennett completed the unclothed body search, Bennett \u201cdid not tell [him to] turn around, bend over and cough or squat.\u201d Instead, according to defendant, the officer simply told him: \u201cTurn around for a rectal search.\u201d Defendant refused and questioned the legality of the search which he believed involved \u201ca probe search of [his] rectal cavity specifically for drugs.\u201d After defendant was told to comply, Bennett suddenly \u201cgrabbed\u201d him and \u201ctook [him] down to the ground\u201d and handcuffed him. Defendant never attacked the officer. Defendant denied having withdrawn the balloon package from his buttocks, denied having dropped or thrown anything in the medical clinic, and denied having seen the balloon package on the floor of the clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In the trial court, the defense theory was that Bennett intended to subject defendant to an unlawful rectal cavity search, not a mere unobtrusive visual check of defendant\u2019s anal area. Although defendant never testified that after being restrained he was forcibly subjected to a rectal cavity search, defense counsel nonetheless suggested that had happened in arguing the heroin should be suppressed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The trial court explicitly rejected the defense characterization of the events. It ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">\u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between a prison setting and the setting on the streets. I also think that reasonable cause is an objective legal test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201cI would like to take and distill things down to the simplest terms so I can get to the bottom of the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">\u201cOver the last several days, I\u2019ve learned the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">\u201cThat the officials of the Department of Corrections received information that [defendant] was trafficking in narcotics and after the first note was received, they received a second note or more people received the second note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">\u201cBasically, the second note to me was something more or less a threat to the prison officials that if they didn\u2019t do something, that there was going to be some whistle-blowing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201cThen Assistant Warden Schulteis, who I particularly found to be the most credible witness of everybody\u2014I\u2019m not saying anybody else was not credible\u2014but she was the most credible one, she made a determination that [defendant] had to be searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">\u201cI think that not only did the Department of Corrections have a right to investigate and conduct a search of [defendant], I think they had a duty to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">\u201cThe officers did their duty and they started an unclothed body search of the exterior portion of [defendant\u2019s] body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201cDuring the search, this golf ball-sized object was seen dropping from his hand. There\u2019s not been one bit of evidence that\u2019s been produced to indicate that there was any intrusive, internal rectal probing or internal search of [defendant],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201cMr. Collins [defendant], I mean this as a compliment, you have a very resourceful mind and a great imagination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\u201cI think that [your] past experience in searches, as [you] testified to, kind of belies what [you] testified to yesterday [that you believed the officers intended to perform a rectal cavity search].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201cIt certainly would have been nice if the Department of Corrections had kept all the letters; however, I don\u2019t think that the letters were critical to the 1538.5 motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">\u201cI think [defendant\u2019s] use of force was not proper or in a proper way to resist what he deemed to be an unlawful search. There\u2019s other methods to remedy what he thought was wrong and I particularly think that [defendant\u2019s] legal reasoning was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">\u201cI grant you there certainly were conflicts in testimony [among the People\u2019s witnesses]. . . . But I don\u2019t think any of the inconsistencies were really important to the determination of this motion, so I\u2019m going to deny it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">After the trial court denied the motion to suppress evidence, defendant pled nolo contendere to possession of heroin in state prison and admitted one prior conviction. The prosecutor dismissed the other charges and prior conviction allegations. The court sentenced him to a four-year term, to be served consecutively to his present term.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The court indicated it would issue a certificate of probable cause to permit defendant to challenge on appeal the denial of his earlier motion to disclose the identity of the author of the two notes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">This defense appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">A. MOTION TO DISCLOSE INFORMANT\u2019S IDENTITY</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">In the beginning stage of the case, defense counsel had asked for disclosure of the identity of the individual(s) who wrote the notes delivered to the prison officials. Prison officials invoked the privilege of nondisclosure. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1040-1041.) Thereafter, two motions to obtain that information were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The first, filed by counsel, urged, \u201cthis informant is a material witness on the issue of guilt or innocence in this action, and as such, the disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity is essential to a full and fair determination of the case.\u201d Counsel\u2019s declaration averred: \u201cA reasonable possibility exists that the confidential informant could give evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence in this action that would result in the exoneration of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The second, filed by defendant in pro. per., essentially urged disclosure was necessary for a fair adjudication of the motion to suppress. Given that the notes had been destroyed, the motion questioned whether the notes ever existed or, if they did, whether they contained the information the correctional officers represented had been in the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Before the evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion commenced, defense counsel requested the court to conduct an in camera hearing. He argued, \u201cthe informant issue is relevant to the 1538.5 and that is the primary basis of our motion to suppress\u201d because the informant\u2019s notes had been the reason the prison officers decided to search defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">The court conducted an in camera hearing at which Schulteis and Walton testified about the anonymous notes. Thereafter, the court denied the motion in public proceedings. It ruled: \u201cThere is no reason to disclose the identity, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>would not help [defendant] in any way. There is no conceivable way it can help [him], absolutely none. . . . There\u2019s just simply no way it would help him. ... If I thought for a minute there was any potential that it would help [defendant], I\u2019d certainly tell them [the prison officials] to disclose it, but there just isn\u2019t any potential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A sealed transcript of the in camera hearing has been forwarded to this court. Defendant asks us to review that transcript \u201cto determine if the trial court followed appropriate procedure and for abuse of discretion.\u201d Resolution of that contention requires us to first clarify the dual nature of the motion to disclose. As set forth above, the motion had two theories. One was that the informant was a material witness on the issue of guilt or innocence. The second was that the existence of the informant and the contents of the informant\u2019s notes were relevant to litigating the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In regard to the first purpose, well-established precedent makes clear that a guilty plea bars an appellate contention that the trial court improperly denied a defendant\u2019s motion to disclose the identity of an informant to assist in establishing the defendant\u2019s innocence of the charged offenses. In this context, defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere has the same legal effect as a guilty plea. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016; see also <em>People v. Hobbs </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 948, 955 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 651, 873 P.2d 1246].) By so pleading, defendant admitted his guilt of the charged offense of possession of heroin in state prison. Defendant cannot admit he possessed the heroin by pleading nolo contendere and then question the judgment on the ground that evidence he was not permitted to discover would have established to the contrary. The two positions are mutually inconsistent. (See <em>People v. Hunter </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 37, 42 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 229]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 960, 963 [117 Cal.Rptr. 295].) \u201cAn order denying a motion to disclose the identity of an informant is not subject to review on appeal after the defendant has entered a plea of guilty [citation]. This is so because the purpose of the motion relates solely to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, an issue which is removed by the guilty plea.\u201d <em>(People v. Castro, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 963; accord, <em>People v. Coleman </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 287, 292-293 [139 Cal.Rptr. 908]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 373, 375-376 [127 Cal.Rptr. 557].) We therefore do not address the merits of the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The trial court\u2019s issuance of a certificate of probable cause to \u201cpermit\u201d appellate review of this issue does not change our conclusion. A certificate of probable cause cannot render reviewable a claim that is otherwise not cognizable on appeal from a guilty plea. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoffard </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1170, 1178 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 899 P.2d 896]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaanehe </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 1, 9 [136 Cal.Rptr. 409, 559 P.2d 1028]; <em>People v. Meyer </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1157 [228 Cal.Rptr. 635].) As the record does not reflect that defendant\u2019s plea was premised upon the assumption he could obtain appellate review of the denial of his informant motion, defendant is not entitled to withdraw his plea because we now decline to reach the merits of the challenged ruling. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1361, fn. 6 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 324] and cases discussed therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In regard to the second purpose of the motion, defendant may pursue that contention by virtue of Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m). The statute provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA defendant may seek further review of the validity of a search or seizure on appeal from a conviction in a criminal case notwithstanding the fact that the judgment of conviction is predicated upon a plea of guilty.\u201d This provision has been interpreted to permit appellate review of denial of an informant motion to the extent the motion is \u201cdirected to the legality of the search.\u201d <em>(People v. Hobbs, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 948, 956; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Seibel </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1279, 1285 [269 Cal.Rptr. 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Having reviewed the sealed transcript of the in camera hearing with that principle in mind, we conclude the trial court properly denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">B. THE <em>PITCHESS </em>MOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Defendant, in pro. per., filed on March 29, 2001, a <em>Pitchess </em>motion seeking discovery of the personnel records for Schulteis and Walton. Defendant\u2019s declaration averred the \u201citems requested may contain records showing disciplinary actions and suspension of said officers following review of the complaints by superior officers and fellow officers concerning past incidents of the officers engaging in illegal activities, improper tactics, dishonesty, planting evidence, improper search and seizure, and harassment. . . . []Q The material sought is necessary in order to properly prepare my case and is material and relevant because it is my contention that Correctional Officers Linda Schulteis and Rose Walton did not follow policy and procedures, destroyed material evidence, and failed to follow search procedures as required under U.S.C. Title XV, tampering with evidence^] acting without probable cause on an unreliable and bogus confidential letter that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>destroyed by design. [(][] The materials sought may in fact contain complaints of a like nature made by other inmates and/or citizens against these officers. Such information would be used by the defense to locate and call witness to testify that these officers have a character trait, habit, and custom for engaging in illegal conduct or dishonest conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">On April 11, 2001, the custodian of records for the Department of Corrections filed opposition to the motion. The opposition urged, inter alia, that defendant\u2019s request was overbroad and not supported by good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">On April 17, 2001, the court ruled upon several defense requests, including the <em>Pitchess </em>motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At this juncture, defendant was representing himself. Counsel for the custodian of records argued: \u201c[I]t\u2019s [defendant\u2019s] contention that [Walton and Schulteis] did not follow policy and procedures, destroyed material evidence and failed to follow search procedures. That\u2019s from his declaration. But there\u2019s no evidence, no factual basis to determine that they ever had any dealings with the evidence and that they participated in the search. Therefore, there could not be good cause for obtaining their personnel records.\u201d Defendant responded: \u201cWhether [Schulteis] is dishonest, whether this person has some ulterior motive to destroy the note, I believe that it was improper and I believe that it is an act. There are signs of dishonesty there and that was the purpose why the\u2014there is a need for <em>Pitchess </em>motion to determine the validity of this person\u2019s character, to determine whether there is bias or even to determine if [I] was set up.\u201d The court ruled: \u201cI don\u2019t think your application or your motion for <em>Pitchess </em>is sufficient and we\u2019re not going to get into that.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The matter was never formally revisited.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Defendant contends \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s denial of the Pitchess motion was an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As explained above in regard to our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>court\u2019s ruling on the informant motion, the certificate of probable cause is legally irrelevant to our review of this ruling. Since this appeal is authorized by Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m) and the <em>Pitchess </em>motion was intertwined with litigating the legality of the search, the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion is cognizable on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3) provides that a defendant seeking discovery of peace officer personnel records must include an \u201c[a]ffidavit[] showing good cause for the discovery or disclosure sought, setting forth the materiality thereof to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation . . . .\u201d \u201cA showing of \u2018good cause\u2019 requires defendant to demonstrate the relevance of the requested information by providing a \u2018specific factual scenario\u2019 which establishes a \u2018plausible factual foundation\u2019 for the allegations of officer misconduct committed in connection with defendant. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(California Highway Patrol v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1010, 1020 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 379].) Absent such a showing, an officer\u2019s personnel records are not relevant to any issue in the case. <em>(Ibid.) </em>A trial court\u2019s ruling on a <em>Pitchess </em>motion is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>(City of San Jose v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1145 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 624].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In this case, the trial court in essence found no good cause for the requested discovery and therefore never required the custodian of records to produce the personnel records for an in camera review. That decision was not an abuse of discretion. For one thing, neither Schulteis nor Walton was involved in the attempted visual body cavity search that ultimately led to the discovery of the heroin. The involved officers were Bennett and Becker; in particular, Becker was the individual who retrieved the heroin balloons from the floor after defendant dropped them there. For another thing, defendant\u2019s declaration merely made general allegations of misconduct against Schulteis and Walton without alleging any facts that provided reason to believe the misconduct had occurred. Consequently, defendant failed to establish a \u201cspecific factual scenario\u201d establishing a \u201cplausible factual foundation\u201d for allegations of misconduct by Schulteis or Walton that would justify discovery of their personnel records. (Compare <em>People v. Hustead </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 410, 415-418 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 875] [good cause for <em>Pitchess </em>discovery was established when the defendant, who was charged with evading arrest while in a motor vehicle, alleged the arresting officer had made false statements in his police report about the defendant\u2019s driving], and <em>People v.

MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">1. <em>Violation of the Fourth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Defendant first contends \u201cthat while prison authorities may conduct an unclothed search for no reason, or for a good reason, they cannot conduct one as they did here for a bad reason.\u201d He argues the search was conducted for a \u201cbad reason\u201d because it \u201cwas based on unreliable, unverifiable letters that lacked any indicia of trustworthiness or firsthand knowledge\u201d and that were improperly destroyed by prison officials. The contention misframes the issue and, in any event, lacks merit. The dispositive issue is whether given the notes received by prison officials, a visual body cavity search<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of defendant, an individual incarcerated in state prison, would have violated the constitutional prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. We conclude it would not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Two decisions from the United States Supreme Court have addressed prison searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The first decision is <em>Bell v. Wolfish </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 520 [60 L.Ed.2d 447, 99 S.Ct. 1861]. At issue was the constitutionality of a visual body cavity search conducted any time a prisoner had concluded a visit with an outsider. In particular, the question was whether such searches could be conducted absent probable cause. Prison officials contended the visual cavity searches were necessary to deter and detect smuggling into the prison of drugs, weapons, and other contraband. In determining the issue, the court wrote: \u201cThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. <em>Courts must consider the scope of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. </em>[Citations.] A detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence. <em>And inmate attempts to secrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are documented in this record . . . and in other cases. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 559, italics added.) The court concluded that \u201c[balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates,\u201d the searches could be conducted \u201con less than probable cause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 560.) The court did not state what was required, other than to hold that \u201c[t]he searches must be conducted in a reasonable manner.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The second decision is <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 517 [82 L.Ed.2d 393, 104 S.Ct. 3194], There the question was whether random searches could be conducted of prisoners\u2019 cells without any particularized suspicion contraband was being concealed. The court upheld that procedure, finding a prisoner had no legitimate expectation of privacy within the cell. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 526-530.) The court observed random searches of cells were \u201cthe most effective weapon of the prison administrator in the constant fight against the proliferation of knives and guns, illicit drugs, and other contraband.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 528.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Two decisions from our state\u2019s Courts of Appeal have upheld body cavity searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 326 [216 Cal.Rptr. 195], two officers separately received information that marijuana was being brought into an honor farm. A decision was made for medical staff to conduct a full body cavity search of a group of 40 to 44 inmates when they returned to the honor farm from that day\u2019s work furlough. A search of the defendant\u2019s rectum performed by a doctor using an acceptable medical procedure disclosed marijuana. The Court of Appeal upheld the constitutionality of the search. Beginning with the premise that the \u201cprotections afforded by the Fourth Amendment to persons not incarcerated generally are not applied in the same manner to persons held in lawful detention by the government\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 329), the court found the search to be reasonable. The information the officers received constituted \u201cadequate justification to conduct the search\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 332), given that the honor farm inmates were away from the facility in an unsupervised setting. The search was performed by a licensed physician using proper procedures. And the government had an undisputed right to stop the flow of contraband into a custodial facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In <em>People v. Pifer </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 956 [265 Cal.Rptr. 237], a group of prisoners was transported from one high-risk prison to another high-risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>prison. At the incoming prison, all of the new prisoners were X-rayed as part of a routine procedure, without any particularized suspicion that any of them possessed contraband. The X-ray performed on the defendant showed a foreign object in his rectal cavity. He was confronted with the X-ray and directed to remove the object. He complied. The object was a hypodermic syringe. On appeal, defendant contended the X-ray search violated the Fourth Amendment because there was neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion he had contraband concealed on or in his person. The Court of Appeal found the search reasonable and therefore lawful. The prison had a legitimate institutional need to take reasonable steps to prevent contraband from being introduced. It is common knowledge inmates secrete contraband in their body cavities so that a lesser search of their person, clothes, or personal belongings would not have revealed the contraband. And the X-ray search, conducted by a specialized technician, was not harmful or uncomfortable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 961-962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Although no California appellate court has determined the constitutionality of a visual body cavity search, several federal Courts of Appeals have addressed the issue. Each has upheld the constitutionality of a policy that required a visual body cavity search or strip search after certain activities such as a visit to the law library, infirmary, or exercise room or an encounter with an outsider <em>irrespective of whether the prison officials entertained a reasonable suspicion the prisoners had concealed contraband on their persons. </em>Given the legitimate penological need to prevent drugs and weapons from being introduced into or transported throughout a prison and the relative lack of intrusiveness involved in the search, the policies met the constitutional requirement of reasonableness even without any specific evidence linking a prisoner to possession of contraband. (See, e.g., <em>Goff v. Nix </em>(8th Cir. 1986) 803 F.2d 358, 368-371 [upholding policy to conduct visual body cavity search of inmates after returning from visits or exercise to prevent introduction of contraband or weapon]; <em>Campbell v. Miller </em>(7th Cir. 1986) 787 F.2d 217, 228 [upholding policy to conduct visual body cavity search before and after visit to prison library]; <em>Arruda v. Fair </em>(1st Cir. 1983) 710 F.2d 886, 886-888 [upholding policy to strip search all inmates in special maximum security unit who go to prison law library, infirmary, and receive visitors].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">From all of the above precedents, we distill the following principles. A prison has a compelling and uncontroverted interest in preventing the introduction into or the transporting throughout the prison of contraband and in maintaining order in the institution. A prisoner has a very limited reasonable expectation of privacy in regard to a search of his person. There is no requirement that a search be supported by either probable cause or reasonable suspicion; instead the relevant inquiry is whether under all of the circumstances the search was reasonable. And the determination of reasonableness depends, as it does in any Fourth Amendment case, on the specific facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>presented. In particular, a court \u201cmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\u201d <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, supra, </em>441 U.S. 520, 559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Applying those principles to this case, we conclude the intended visual body cavity search of defendant was reasonable and therefore constitutional. The search was to be conducted only after prison officials received two anonymous notes stating defendant was selling drugs in the prison, the second of which specifically stated defendant had the drugs on his person. Such notes were often sent by rival drug dealers, a circumstance corroborated in this case by the fact the second note contained a veiled threat that unless the tip was acted upon, there would be violence. Given the prison\u2019s uncontested right to find and destroy drugs as well as its obligation to avoid potentially volatile situations, the information from the notes constituted more than a sufficient and legitimate justification for the search. Contrary to what defendant urges, the fact the notes could not form the basis of an internal disciplinary action because they were anonymous and not from reliable sources is not dispositive. As set forth above, case law makes clear a prison search is not subject to a calculus of probable cause or reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Furthermore, the search of defendant was carried out in a reasonable manner that protected his sense of personal dignity. He was escorted to a private area\u2014the medical clinic\u2014in which he was asked to disrobe. Two male officers observed him. The search of his rectal cavity was to be limited to a visual inspection; defendant was requested only to bend over and cough to facilitate observation. Neither officer attempted to touch defendant\u2019s anus or insert his fingers or any other object into his rectum.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In sum, the intended visual body cavity search was reasonable. The trial court properly denied the motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">2. <em>Violation of Prison Guidelines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Defendant makes a passing argument that \u201c[pjrison officials failed to comply with CDC regulations requiring the completion of certain forms and preserving the [two] letters [from the anonymous informant(s)] thereby violating [his] Fourth Amendment and due process rights.\u201d Without citation to any authority, he implies this purported violation requires suppression of the heroin balloons. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The prison regulations to which defendant refers only require preservation of an informant\u2019s note and preparation of an internal prison form (form 1030) when an informant\u2019s note will be the basis of a disciplinary action against the prisoner. Here, as explained by the testimony of the prison officials, the notes could not and did not form the basis of any disciplinary action because they were anonymous. Contrary to what defendant suggests, the disciplinary action taken against him after the search was not the result of the notes; instead it directly flowed from the discovery of the heroin on his person and his assault on Officer Bennett. Consequently, there was no violation of prison regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In any event, even if there had been such a violation\u2014a finding we do not make\u2014that conclusion would not assist defendant. The electorate\u2019s enactment in 1982 of Proposition 8 eliminated, inter alia, judicially created remedies for violations of administrative provisions unless the federal Constitution requires the exclusion of the evidence obtained as a result of those violations. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 886-887 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pifer, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 956, 962-963; and <em>People v. West, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d 326, 330-331 [216 Cal.Rptr. 195].) Defendant has failed to show how violation of these prison regulations so implicates federal constitutional rights that a violation should result in the exclusion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">3. <em>Violation of the Eighth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Defendant\u2019s briefs make passing references to the Eighth Amendment as if to suggest that its provisions were violated in this case and that said violation requires suppression of the evidence. The argument is unavailing for three separate reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The first is that it was not raised below so that defendant is precluded from raising it for the first time on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pifer, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 956, 963 [cert. den. <em>Pifer v. California </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 938 [112 L.Ed.2d 307, 111 S.Ct. 342].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The second is that \u201cfor such a claim to succeed, [defendant] must show eliberate indifference to serious medical needs rising to a level of unnecessary and wanton pain. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Pifer, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 963.) There is no evidence to support such a claim in the present action. As explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>earlier, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the prison officials only intended to perform a visual body cavity search. (See fn. 11, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The third is that even if defendant had presented \u201csufficient facts to support a violation of the Eighth Amendment, this would entitle [him only] to sue prison authorities for a civil rights violation pursuant to 42 United States Code section 1983, not to a suppression of evidence obtained as a result of such a search.
