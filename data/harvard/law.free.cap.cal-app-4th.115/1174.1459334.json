J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALnW\">Norrell Corporation, a temporary employment agency,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> placed Laura M. Mathieu with its client Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation. Mathieu\u2019s former boyfriend, Richard Fluck, was also employed by Gulf-stream. Once Mathieu began working at Gulfstream, Fluck taunted and harassed her and made it difficult for Mathieu to complete assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">After Mathieu\u2019s position at Gulfstream was terminated, she brought suit against Fluck, Gulfstream and Norrell for sexual harassment and sexual discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, Government Code section 12900 et seq. (FEHA)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and against Gulfstream and Norrell for unlawful retaliation, common law wrongful termination and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Following Mathieu\u2019s settlement of her claims against Gulfstream and Fluck, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Norrell. Because triable issues of fact exist with respect to Mathieu\u2019s retaliation claim, we reverse the judgment. However, we conclude summary adjudication of her claims against Norrell for sexual harassment, sexual discrimination, wrongful termination and punitive damages was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">1. <em>Mathieu\u2019s Employment with Norrell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">Norrell places employees in temporary and long-term assignments at its clients\u2019 work sites. Gulfstream, like Norrell\u2019s other clients, retained the sole authority to hire and fire employees placed with it by Norrell, and also set the salary and determined raises to be given those employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Mathieu contacted Norrell and began accepting temporary employment through its Carson office in July 1998. As part of the hiring process she read and signed an application that provided her employment was at will. Her contact at Norrell was Susan Dunn, a customer service manager whose duties included interviewing employees and placing them with Norrell clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">2. <em>Mathieu\u2019s Placement at Gulfstream and Her Problems with Richard Fluck</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Dunn offered Mathieu a position at Gulfstream in August 1998. Mathieu accepted the placement even though she was aware that Fluck, a former lover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>with whom she had parted on very bad terms, was also employed by Gulfstream. Although Fluck did not work in the same department as Mathieu, the two crossed paths from time to time. According to Mathieu, Fluck began a campaign of harassment against her; including glaring, shouting and sneering at her, failing to return work-related emails and paperwork, purposefully bumping into her in the hallway, calling her names and ostentatiously turning his back when he saw her. Mathieu complained about this treatment both to her supervisor at Gulfstream and to Gulfstream\u2019s human resources department. The only action taken was to tell Fluck and Mathieu to stay away from one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Although Mathieu was required to report any problems at the Gulfstream workplace to Norrell, she waited six months, until February 12, 1999, to tell Dunn about her difficulties with Fluck. At that time Mathieu told Dunn by telephone that she had been having problems with her former boyfriend, who was being rude and \u201cslandering her to others.\u201d Dunn documented the telephone call in Mathieu\u2019s computerized personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">On February 15, 1999, Dunn contacted Gulfstream human resources representative Jody Cornelius to inquire about the situation between Mathieu and Fluck. Cornelius told Dunn that Fluck had been advised to stop his improper behavior and that Mathieu had not complained since the warning. Dunn contacted Mathieu the next day and told her that Fluck had been admonished to stop his rude behavior. Dunn asked Mathieu to let her know immediately if any further problems arose. Mathieu told Dunn there had been no further problems and things had calmed down. Dunn contacted Mathieu again on March 3, 1999, to inquire about the situation with Fluck. Mathieu repeated that everything had calmed down. After February 12, 1999, Mathieu did not complain to anyone about Pluck\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">3. <em>Mathieu\u2019s Release from Gulfstream</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">On March 8, 1999, Gulfstream human resources representative Rhonda London informed Dunn that Mathieu was being released from her assignment as a cost-containment measure. During a visit to Norrell\u2019s office the same day, Mathieu told Dunn she believed she was being released because of her complaints about Fluck. Dunn responded that Gulfstream had explained the layoff was due to budget cuts and assured Mathieu that Norrell would look for another position for her. Dunn contacted London and relayed Mathieu\u2019s concern that she had been terminated because of the situation with Fluck. London reiterated that Mathieu\u2019s layoff was economic and told Dunn that, although she had no personal knowledge of the situation with Fluck, she had not heard anything to indicate that situation was related to Mathieu\u2019s job loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>Dunn offered Mathieu a new short-term position shortly after the layoff. Mathieu, however, opted to take a position with a different temporary agency. Mathieu never worked for Norrell again.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">4. <em>The Lawsuit and Norrell\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">After obtaining a right-to-sue letter from the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), Mathieu filed suit against Fluck, Gulfstream and Norrell on March 22, 2001. The complaint alleged causes of action for sexual harassment and sexual discrimination against Fluck and the corporate defendants and for retaliation, wrongful termination in violation of public policy and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing against Gulfstream and Norrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Norrell moved for summary judgment on February 11, 2002.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After two hearings and two detailed written tentative rulings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court granted summary judgment based on its determination there were no material issues of fact in dispute as to four of the eight issues raised in the motion and summary judgment/summary adjudication was therefore proper as to those issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Noticed Issue 5: \u201cAll of Plaintiff\u2019s claims fail to present a triable issue of material fact because Defendant did not know or should have known that the client\u2019s decision was discriminatory and because Defendant took the appropriate corrective measures within its control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Noticed Issue 6: \u201cThe third cause of action for wrongful termination fails to present a triable issue of material fact because it is barred by the statute of limitations and/or because Plaintiff cannot establish a violation of any statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Noticed Issue 7: \u201cThe fourth cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing fails to present a triable issue of material fact because Plaintiff has not pled an enforceable contract and/or because Plaintiff cannot rebut the presumption of at-will employment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>Noticed Issue 8: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claims for punitive damages fail to present a triable issue of material fact because her supervisor was not an officer, director or managing agent of Defendant and/or because her supervisor did not act with the requisite malice or oppression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Judgment was entered in favor of Norrell on April 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">(1) We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and decide independently whether the facts not subject to triable dispute warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law. <em>(Intel Corp. v. Hamidi </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1342, 1348 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 32, 71 P.3d 296]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">1. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment Based on Norrell\u2019s Noticed Issue 5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">The trial court correctly concluded Norrell responded appropriately to Mathieu\u2019s initial claims of sexual harassment. However, the court erred in finding no triable issues of fact as to her claim for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">a. <em>Both Norrell and Gulfstream May Be Considered Mathieu\u2019s Employer for Purposes of Potential Liability for Sexual Harassment and Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">The nature and extent of Norrell\u2019s responsibility to protect its employee Mathieu from sexual harassment by Gulfstream employees may depend on whether Gulfstream is viewed simply as Norrell\u2019s client or, in addition, is considered to be Mathieu\u2019s \u201cspecial employer.\u201d An employer\u2019s liability under FEHA for hostile environment sexual harassment committed by customers or clients prior to the effective date of the 2003 amendment to section 12940, subdivision (j) (Stats. 2003, ch. 671, \u00a7 1) is uncertain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, if</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>sexual harassment is perpetrated by a coworker, an employer is liable if it fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action when reasonably made aware of the conduct. (\u00a7 12940, subd. (j)(l); <em>Carrisales </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1132, 1136-1137 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 988 P.2d 1083].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">In the context of an individual who is employed by a temporary agency and assigned to work on the premises of the agency\u2019s client, we believe the purpose of FEHA to safeguard an employee\u2019s right to hold employment without experiencing discrimination is best served by applying the traditional labor law doctrine of \u201cdual employers,\u201d holding both the agency and the client are employers and considering harassment by an employee of the client coworker harassment rather than harassment by a third party. <em>(Kowalski v. Shell Oil Co. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 168, 174 [151 Cal.Rptr. 671, 588 P.2d 811] [\u201cThe possibility of dual employment is well recognized in the case law. \u2018Where an employer sends an employee to do work for another person, and both have the right to exercise certain powers of control over the employee, that employee may be held to have two employers\u2014his original or \u201cgeneral\u201d employer and a second, the \u201cspecial\u201d employer.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d]; <em>Riley v. Southwest Marine, Inc. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1242, 1247-1248 [250 Cal.Rptr. 718] <em>(Riley) </em>[\u201cwhen an employer lends an employee to another employer and relinquishes to the borrowing employer all right of control over the employee\u2019s activities\u201d a two-employer situation is created].)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In <em>Riley, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d 1242, the plaintiff was retained by Manpower, Inc., a \u201clabor broker,\u201d which sent Riley to work at Southwest Marine as a general laborer. Southwest Marine provided all the training, equipment and supervision. Manpower, like Norrell in this case, \u201cdealt only with payroll matters, issuing Riley a check on submission of time cards and taking care of withholding social security, federal and state taxes, and paying premiums for unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation and [other] insurance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1246.) Riley was injured on the job. He filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim and later brought a tort suit against Southwest Marine, contending \u201che was not a Southwest Marine employee and therefore was not limited to a remedy in the nature of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1247.) The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Southwest Marine; the Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that, although the existence of a dual employment relationship is generally a question of fact, the undisputed evidence in <em>Riley </em>established such a relationship as a matter of law because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>Riley was under Southwest Marine\u2019s direct supervision and control at the time of his injury. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">In the present case, as in <em>Riley, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d 1242, both the employment agency and the client company had the right to exercise certain powers of control over the employee. It is undisputed that Mathieu was paid by Norrell and that she was required to report to Norrell if, for example, she were to miss a day of work. Accordingly, like the labor broker in <em>Riley, </em>Norrell is properly considered Mathieu\u2019s \u201cgeneral\u201d employer and Gulfstream her \u201cspecial\u201d employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">\u201cIf general and special employment exist, \u2018the injured [worker] can look to both employers for [workers\u2019] compensation benefits. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kowalski v. Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 175.) We see no reason not to permit an employee injured by violations of FEHA laws to likewise look to both employers for redress. Applying this doctrine promotes the purpose of FEHA, which is to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. (See <em>Romano v. Rockwell Internat, Inc. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 493 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114] [\u201cThe FEHA itself requires that we interpret its terms liberally to accomplish the stated legislative purpose\u201d]; <em>Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1998) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 624 [262 Cal.Rptr. 842] [provisions of FEHA are to be construed liberally to achieve its purpose of preventing and eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace].) To hold otherwise would allow Norrell and other temporary employment agencies to send their employees into hostile and discriminatory workplaces and to ignore complaints of harassment without fear of liability. By contrast, the purposes of FEHA are promoted if both the staffing agency and its client are treated as the employer, and employees of the client entity are treated as coworkers of employees of the staffing agency, within the meaning of FEHA. <em>(Carrisales v. Department of Corrections, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">b. <em>The Undisputed Facts Establish Norrell Was Not Aware of the Alleged Harassment Until It Had Ceased</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">An employer is not liable for nonsupervisor, coworker harassment if it takes prompt, reasonable and efficacious remedial action. (\u00a7 12940, subd. (j)(l) [harassment of an employee or applicant by an employee other than an agent or supervisor shall be unlawful if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have known of this conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action]; <em>Carrisales </em>v. <em>Department of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number><em>Corrections, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1135; <em>Ellison </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 924 F.2d 872, 882 [employer not liable if it takes remedial actions \u201creasonably calculated to end the harassment\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">It is undisputed that Mathieu did not complain to Norrell about her alleged harassment by Pluck for six months. It is also undisputed that, after Dunn investigated the complaint and contacted Mathieu to report the results of that investigation, Mathieu told Dunn that things had \u201ccalmed down\u201d and made no further complaints to anyone. Dunn was also told by Gulfstream that the situation had been resolved. Under those circumstances, the trial court correctly concluded, based on the undisputed facts, that Norrell acted reasonably with respect to Mathieu\u2019s initial complaint of sexual harassment. (See, e.g., <em>Swenson v. Potter </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 271 F.3d 1184, 1193 [\u201cThe most significant immediate measure an employer can take in response to a sexual harassment complaint is to launch a prompt investigation to determine whether the complaint is justified. An investigation is a key step in the employer\u2019s response.\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 1196 [\u201ca good faith investigation of alleged harassment may satisfy the \u2018prompt and adequate\u2019 response standard, even if the investigation turns up no evidence of harassment\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">c. <em>Triable Issues of Fact Exist as to Mathieu\u2019s Claim for Unlawful Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Even though Norrell established it took appropriate corrective measures in response to Mathieu\u2019s initial (and belated) complaint of hostile work environment sexual harassment, that finding does not exonerate Norrell from potential liability with respect to Mathieu\u2019s claim Norrell retaliated against her because of her complaints about Fluck in violation of section 12940, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show she engaged in a protected activity, she was thereafter subjected to adverse employment action by her employer and there was a causal link between the two. <em>(Soldinger v. Northwest Airlines, Inc. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 345, 367 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 747]; <em>Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. 614.) Disputed issues of fact preclude summary adjudication on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">After she was terminated by Gulfstream, Mathieu informed Dunn she believed Gulfstream\u2019s decision had been motivated by her earlier complaints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>about Fluck. Dunn spoke with London at Gulfstream, who told her \u201cshe had not been involved in the situation with Plaintiff\u2019s ex-boyfriend ... it was never mentioned in the context of the decision to release Plaintiff from her assignment.\u201d Despite the fact that London admittedly had no firsthand knowledge as to \u201cthe situation with [Mathieu\u2019s] ex-boyfriend,\u201d and despite the fact that other Gulfstream employees had told Mathieu they believed she was terminated because of her problems with Fluck, Dunn did not pursue the matter further, nor did she exercise her prerogative to recommend that Gulfstream retain Mathieu.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">After the assignment with Gulfstream ended, Norrell continued to contact Mathieu about potential placements for a short time. However, it is disputed whether Norrell agreed to reassign her to a comparable position. Mathieu testified she received only two or three more telephone calls from Norrell after her termination from Gulfstream and was not given the opportunity to work in a position similar to the one she had at Gulfstream. As the trial court concluded in denying summary adjudication as to noticed issue 4,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this evidence creates triable issues as to whether Norrell engaged in retaliation of its own by failing to attempt to place Mathieu in a comparable position elsewhere after her discharge by Gulfstream. (See <em>Akers </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1455 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 602] [\u201cWe agree with those federal courts that have held an adverse employment action is not limited to \u2018ultimate\u2019 employment acts, such as a specific hiring, firing, demotion, or failure to promote decision. The legislative purpose underlying FEHA\u2019s prohibition against retaliation is to prevent employers from deterring employees from asserting good faith discrimination complaints, and the use of intermediate retaliatory actions may certainly have this effect. But we also agree with the <em>Thomas </em>[v. Department of Corrections (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 507 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 770] court\u2019s observation that to be actionable, the retaliation must result in a substantial adverse change in the terms and conditions of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. . . . While the Legislature was understandably concerned with the chilling effect of employer retaliatory actions and mandated that FEHA provisions be interpreted broadly to prevent unlawful discrimination, it could not have intended to provide employees a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>remedy for any possible slight resulting from the filing of a discrimination complaint.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Norrell contends it cannot be liable for retaliation because Mathieu never \u201cindicated that she believed Pluck\u2019s behavior to be sexual harassment.\u201d However, Mathieu presented evidence she told Dunn \u201ceverything\u201d about Pluck\u2019s conduct and that \u201csuch treatment, being directed to her as a women, constitutes sexual harassment.\u201d The undisputed facts establish Mathieu complained of the following behavior: (1) Pluck glaring at her; (2) Pluck failing to return Mathieu\u2019s emails, which were essential to the completion of her job duties; (3) Pluck shouting at her and hindering the performance of her duties when she inquired about work-related matters; (4) Pluck turning his back on her when he saw her; (5) Pluck sneering at her; (6) Pluck bumping his shoulder into her in the halls or whispering into someone\u2019s ear when she was near; (7) Pluck shouting at her that he was busy, \u201cget away\u201d and \u201cwhat the hell do I have to sign that for?\u201d when she approached him; (8) Pluck failing to return paperwork that was essential for Mathieu to complete her job duties; (9) Pluck yelling at her \u201cpsycho,\u201d \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cget out\u201d; and (10) Pluck shouting \u201clet\u2019s walk past the stick,\u201d calling her \u201cAlly McBeal\u201d and commenting that he did not understand how he could ever have been attracted to her. To be sure, all but the last one or two items on Mathieu\u2019s list of complaints bear a stronger resemblance to junior high school-style expressions of personal animus than to harassment on the basis of sex.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, resolving all conflicting inferences in favor of Mathieu, as we must <em>(Binder </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 540]), we conclude a triable issue of fact exists as to whether Norrell reasonably understood Mathieu\u2019s complaints to raise an issue of sexual harassment and thus constituted \u201cprotected activity\u201d within the meaning of FEHA. (See also <em>Katz v. Chevron Corp. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1352, 1365 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 681] [\u201cdoubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the opposing party\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>In sum, a finder of fact could reasonably conclude Mathieu engaged in protected activity (complaining to her supervisor and to Gulfstream\u2019s human resources department about hostile work environment sexual harassment by Fluck) and was thereafter subjected to adverse employment action not only by Gulfstream but also by Norrell. Mathieu\u2019s additional evidence that Dunn failed adequately to investigate or attempt to correct the alleged retaliation by Gulfstream is certainly sufficient at this stage to raise an inference of a causal connection between her protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>(Caldwell v. Paramount Unified School Dist. </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 189, 203 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 448] [employer\u2019s burden on summary judgment directed to claim of retaliation to present admissible evidence either that one or more of plaintiff\u2019s prima facie elements is lacking or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors]; see also <em>Clark v.

Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>we find triable issues of fact with respect to retaliation, but not with respect to the initial harassment, on remand the trial court should enter an order summarily adjudicating Mathieu\u2019s claims for sexual harassment and proceed with Mathieu\u2019s claim of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">2. <em>The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Adjudication as to Mathieu\u2019s Common Law Claim for Wrongful Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The third cause of action in Mathieu\u2019s complaint purports to state a common law claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Mathieu does not dispute that she filed her complaint more than one year after her assignment at Gulfstream was terminated, which was beyond the applicable one-year statute of limitations. (Former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 340, subd. (3).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> She argues, however, that the limitations period was tolled while she was pursuing her administrative claim with DFEH.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Mathieu\u2019s tolling argument is not supported by any reported California case and is inconsistent with Supreme Court decisions holding that a common law cause of action for discharge in violation of public policy is, in effect, an independent alternative to a FEHA administrative claim and subsequent cause of action under the act. <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 86 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373] [although an employee must exhaust the administrative remedy made available by the FEHA before bringing a cause of action under the FEHA; exhaustion is not required before filing a civil action for damages alleging nonstatutory tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy against sex discrimination and sexual harassment in employment]; <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 905 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157] [applying <em>Rojo </em>to claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy against age discrimination].) \u201cAn employee, of course, may elect to waive the statutory cause of action and remedies, and proceed directly to court on the common law claims [citation]; alternatively, the employee may pursue both the administrative and the judicial avenues, either sequentially [citations] or simultaneously, in the latter case amending his or her complaint to join the FEHA cause of action once the Department has issued the right-to-sue letter [citation].\u201d <em>(Rojo, </em>at p. 88.) As the court explained in <em>Rojo, </em>the putative plaintiff is not in any way disadvantaged by having to file his or her nonstatutory claims before receiving a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH and, therefore, there is no basis for recognizing equitable tolling in this situation. (Accord, <em>Burmeister v. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. </em>(N.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 1999, No. C 99-00081CRB) 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2230 [1999 WL 11890, p. 2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>Mathieu relies on <em>Downs v. Department of Water &amp; Power </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1100 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 590], in which the Court of Appeal held that a plaintiff who had filed a statutory FEHA claim more than one year after receiving a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH, but within 90 days of receiving a right-to-sue letter from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), was entitled to equitable tolling of the FEHA one-year limitations period. The basis for this ruling, however, is that \u201cwhen a charge of discrimination is timely filed concurrently with the EEOC and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (\u2018DFEH\u2019), the DFEH defers investigation of the complaint to the EEOC. [Therefore] the limitations period to bring an FEHA action would be tolled until the plaintiff receives a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC.\u201d <em>(Burmeister </em>v. <em>Automatic Data Processing, Inc., supra, </em>1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2230 at p. 2.) Recognizing equitable tolling in the context of concurrent state and federal administrative proceedings preceding a statutory claim under the FEHA, however, is far different from permitting a plaintiff to delay filing a common law tort action because an alternative administrative process has not yet been completed. We decline to extend the ruling of <em>Downs </em>to the current situation, as to which its rationale is simply inapplicable. Summary adjudication was properly granted as to Mathieu\u2019s wrongful termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">3. <em>The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Adjudication as to Mathieu\u2019s Claim for Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Pursuant to Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (a), punitive damages may be awarded if the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty of fraud, oppression or malice. Under Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b), an employer is not liable for punitive damages for the acts of one of its employees unless the employer had advance notice of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others, or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct. In either case, punitive damages are not available unless the evidence to support such damages is \u201c \u2018 \u201cso clear as to leave no substantial doubt\u201d; \u201csufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Mock v. Michigan Millers Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 306, 332-333 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 594].)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">At the hearing on Norrell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Mathieu\u2019s counsel conceded that Dunn\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of oppression, fraud or malice. He argued instead that Norrell\u2019s corporate failure to maintain and enforce a policy against sexual harassment was so wrongful as to give rise to punitive damages. The trial court rejected that argument, stating it \u201cdeclines to create new punitive damages liability without legislative history or case authority justifying such an expansion in the law.\u201d The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>additionally observed the evidence does not support Mathieu\u2019s assertion that Norrell did not have a policy against sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We agree with the trial court. No evidence suggests that Dunn, even if she were an officer, director or managing agent of Norrell, engaged in \u201c[c]onduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294, subd. (c)(1) [defining \u201cmalice\u201d]), \u201cdespicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person\u2019s rights\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294, subd. (c)(2) [defining \u201coppression\u201d]) or \u201cconduct which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched, or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.\u201d (BAJI No. 14.71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Moreover, even if we were to accept Mathieu\u2019s legally unsupported contention that an employer\u2019s failure to have a policy against sexual harassment could constitute oppression, fraud or malice, we agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that Mathieu presented no evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence, that Norrell (as opposed to Gulfstream) did not have a sexual harassment policy or that it refused to provide her with a copy of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">The judgment is reversed. On remand, the trial court shall (1) enter an order of summary adjudication as to Mathieu\u2019s claims for hostile work environment sexual harassment; (2) enter an order of summary adjudication as to Mathieu\u2019s third cause of action for wrongful termination; (3) enter an order of summary adjudication as Mathieu\u2019s claim for punitive damages; (4) enter an order of summary adjudication as to Mathieu\u2019s claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (5) conduct further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
