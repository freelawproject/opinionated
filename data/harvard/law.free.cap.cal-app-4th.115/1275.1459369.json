We conclude the trial court should grant a requested extension unless the request is contested and the judge determines the protected party does <em>not </em>entertain a <em>\u201creasonable </em>apprehension\u201d of future abusive conduct. (As the relevant statute makes clear, it is unnecessary, however, to find any abuse has occurred since issuance of the initial protective order.) Because the trial court granted the renewal in this contested case on the assumption petitioner was entitled to that order \u201cjust upon request,\u201d we reverse and remand for a reconsideration of the decision to grant a permanent extension of this protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">In 1994 respondent Rebecca Annamarie Ritchie and appellant Mark Konrad began dating. In 1995 they started living together and became engaged. The engagement lasted until early 1998. According to Ritchie\u2019s allegations in her initial 1999 protective order action, during the final stages of that engagement there were frequent arguments. Then on one occasion Konrad grabbed her arm and slammed the car door. Shortly thereafter, she moved out and told him not to contact her ever again. Over the next few months, however, he sent a barrage of e-mails and letters, telephoned her repeatedly at her office, and the like. He also repeatedly phoned and sent e-mails to Ritchie\u2019s father. This conduct allegedly forced Ritchie to resign and take a new position. But Konrad located her at the new job and renewed the phone calls and e-mails. He also filed two allegedly frivolous lawsuits in small claims court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">In early 1999, Ritchie\u2019s new employer wrote Konrad and told him to cease contacting Ritchie at work. Konrad responded by coming to that office and threatening the chief financial officer with a harassment lawsuit. About that time someone vandalized Ritchie\u2019s car when it was parked outside her office building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">Again according to the allegations in the original petition seeking the protective order, Konrad\u2019s actions caused her nightmares about violence, and she could not keep food down and lost eight pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>Finally, Ritchie petitioned the court for a protective order. On May 7, 1999, the court issued a domestic violence restraining order against Konrad with a duration of three years. After hearing evidence from both parties, the trial court explained the reason for the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">\u201cThe case, I mean, I really didn\u2019t need the evidence\u2014well, I guess it was of some help, but a relationship breaks up, plaintiff leaves, she wants to be left alone, she doesn\u2019t tell the other side where she\u2019s at, and then the attempt is made by the other side; that is, by the defendant, who wants to contact her, starts going to areas that he knows, place of work, relatives, all that kind of stuff. When those seem to be closing down, then there is an attempted use of economics, power. It doesn\u2019t work but it was certainly used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">\u201cThis is clearly a situation where she doesn\u2019t want contact. I think these acts alone; that is, the repeated act of contact, is sufficient for a harassment order. Indeed, this is the very type of case that the Legislature heard evidence on when they enacted the harassment section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">\u201cI will grant the restraining order. Standard restraint on personal conduct. Stay 300 yards away from the plaintiff\u2019s residence, place of work, and the residence and place of work of the protected person named in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I have any evidence on damages, so that is denied without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">\u201cThere is also no evidence on fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">During the following three years Konrad made no attempt to contact Ritchie. Both of them married other people and Ritchie moved with her new husband to Henderson, Nevada, near Las Vegas, while Konrad remained in the Los Angeles area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">On May 16, 2002, Ritchie filed a \u201crequest\u201d that the three-year restraining order be made permanent, pursuant to California Family Code section 6345.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the hearing on Ritchie\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d the trial court began by noting \u201cthe renewal statute doesn\u2019t give a criteria .... It doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s automatic. The issue is what kind of burden it puts on the other side. The only burden I see is the firearm one.\u201d [This referred to the fact a protective order of this nature prohibits the restrained party from owning, possessing, etc. a firearm of any kind.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">Then the court asked the parties, \u201cWhat criteria should I use?\u201d Konrad\u2019s counsel tendered two factors based on some Missouri appellate cases. Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>cases hold a protective order cannot be renewed without a finding of an \u201cimminent danger of abuse\u201d and a finding whether \u201cthe circumstances [are] the same or [they are] different. Those are the factors that you weigh.\u201d After rejecting the Missouri cases as based on a different statute, the court observed, \u201cIn other words, nobody\u2014no one\u2019s got a good defined series of factors I should be looking at to renew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">After hearing Ritchie\u2019s counsel respond to the same question with a mere rehearsal of Konrad\u2019s former abusive acts, the court commented, \u201cThat\u2019s not telling me what factors I should be using as to whether to exercise discretion. Obviously one is detriment to the restrained side. I said the only detriment he can point to is the firearms order and that can be done by striking that . . . order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Counsel for the two parties then argued for several minutes. Konrad\u2019s counsel first urged Ritchie had failed to produce evidence her subjective concerns had any reasonable basis. He further argued the circumstances had changed in ways that dramatically reduced the danger of renewed abusive conduct. Ritchie\u2019s counsel, in turn, emphasized section 6345 said nothing about requiring a showing of \u201cimminent danger\u201d and anyway \u201cthe imminent danger is, if it\u2019s lifted he\u2019ll go back to doing the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">Finally, the court interrupted: \u201cCounsel, I\u2019m gonna\u2014the way I think I\u2019ve got to read this statute is that I think you\u2019re entitled to have the renewal unless there is some reason blocking you, and the only detriment that I see is the firearm restriction, which I\u2019m going to vacate, and I\u2019m going to continue the order on a permanent basis. I\u2019ve given you the basis for it. If you want to take it up, it\u2019s there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">Moments later, Konrad\u2019s counsel started to request a clarification: \u201cSo the sole reason you give for extending it\u2014\u201d To which the court replied: \u201cI think they\u2019re entitled to it <em>just upon request.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">Konrad took the trial judge up on his invitation and filed an appeal in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">In 1995 the Legislature amended section 6345. The previous version did not authorize permanent orders except upon stipulation of both parties and required a motion or stipulation to extend an order for any fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>period beyond three years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1995 amendment gave the trial court discretion to extend the common protective orders (such as issued in this case) an additional three years or even permanently upon \u201crequest\u201d of a single party, subject to termination or modification pursuant to a later stipulation by both parties or a motion filed by one party. The amended code section also specifically authorized such an extension \u201cwithout a showing of any further abuse since the issuance of the original order.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">In this case, Ritchie filed a \u201crequest\u201d the trial court make the previous three-year order permanent and the court complied, although it purported to strike the firearm restriction which had prevented Konrad from owning or possessing any firearm. Konrad objects due process requires the protected party accompany its \u201crequest\u201d with evidence demonstrating an \u201cimminent and present danger of <em>physical </em>abuse\u201d unless the protective order is extended or submit proof the conditions necessitating the original order had <em>not </em>changed. In this case, Konrad argues, Ritchie failed to make such a showing and thus the trial court was not authorized to grant her request for an extension of the protective order. Furthermore, he contends the trial court\u2019s effort to lift the main burden the extended order imposed on him\u2014the firearms restriction\u2014 was ineffectual. Consequently, at a minimum, the \u201crequest\u201d should be remanded to the trial court so that court can reweigh Konrad\u2019s continuing burden against the continuing value of a permanent protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">We ultimately conclude we are compelled to reverse the order renewing the protective order and remand for reconsideration of Ritchie\u2019s \u201crequest.\u201d As explained below, because the restrained party appeared and challenged the requested extension the trial court erred when it issued the renewal order based solely on Ritchie\u2019s subjective desire the protective order be extended. Instead the court should have considered evidence tendered by both sides and determined whether Ritchie\u2019s expressed fear of future abuse was genuine and also reasonable. Furthermore, as independent and sufficient grounds for reversal, we conclude the court lacked statutory authority to eliminate the firearm restriction and remand for the judge to reweigh the risks and burdens of renewal with the firearm restriction intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>I. <em>RENEWAL OF A DOMESTIC RELATIONS PROTECTIVE ORDER REQUIRES A FINDING THERE IS A \u201cREASONABLE APPREHENSION OF FUTURE ABUSE\u201d IF THE INITIAL ORDER EXPIRES.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Konrad raises what are necessarily issues of first impression in California, because at this point no published California appellate court opinion has interpreted any part of section 6345. Consequently, we begin with the statutory text. Section 6345 reads in pertinent part: \u201c(a) <em>In the discretion of the court, </em>the personal conduct, stay-away, and residence exclusion orders contained in a court order issued after notice and a hearing under this article may have a duration of not more than three years, subject to termination or modification by further order of the court either on written stipulation filed with the court or on the motion of a party. These orders <em>may </em>be renewed, upon the <em>request of a party, </em>either for three years or permanently, <em>without a showing of any further abuse </em>since the issuance of the original order, subject to termination or modification by further order of the court either on written stipulation filed with the court or on the motion of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">\u201c(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the duration of any orders, other than the protective orders described in subdivision (a), that are also contained in a court order issued after notice and a hearing under this article, including, but not limited to, orders for custody, visitation, support, and disposition of property, shall be governed by the law relating to those specific subjects.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">From the trial court\u2019s remarks at the hearing on Ritchie\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d for a permanent extension of the protective order it is apparent the court considered Ritchie was entitled to such an extension without a showing of any kind. The court evidently read the statute to mean a party is <em>entitled </em>to an extension of the original order\u2014even a permanent extension\u2014if he or she files a request for this relief. Indeed as the exchanges quoted above from the hearing reveal, when Konrad\u2019s counsel asked the basis of the trial court\u2019s extension order, the judge replied: \u201cI think they\u2019re entitled to it <em>just upon request.\u201d </em>Konrad\u2019s counsel then sought to restate his understanding of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of section 6345, subdivision(a). \u201cThey are entitled to it upon request and the burden is on the responding party to show it\u2019s onerous\u2014\u201d To which the court responded. \u201cNo. They have <em>the burden of making the request. </em>They have done that. I find the only detriment on your part is the potential firearms restriction and I am striking this provision from the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>In this court\u2019s view, a protected party such as Ms. Ritchie indeed would be entitled to a renewal of the protective order merely upon request, if that request were not contested by the restrained party. In that instance, both the protected party and the court are entitled to assume the restrained party has a good reason for not objecting. It could be because of indifference to a continuance of the protective order. Or it could result from a realization there are no grounds to resist that continuation. In any event, section 6345 allows the restrained party to move for termination of the order at any time after it is renewed. Hence, he (or she) can file such a motion if the failure to contest the requested renewal was a mistake\u2014or if the reason for not resisting should disappear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">(3) On the other hand, if the restrained party does contest the renewal, as Konrad did here, we conclude the protected party is not entitled to a renewal merely because she (or he) desires one. Section 6345 does not provide the trial court <em>shall </em>automatically renew the existing protective order if the protected party <em>requests. </em>By its terms, section 6345 only states the trial court <em>may </em>do so in the proper exercise of its discretion. In this court\u2019s view, that exercise of discretion requires an inquiry beyond whether the protected party requested a renewal and entertains a subjective desire the protective order continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">True, section 6345 makes it unnecessary for the protected party to introduce or the court to consider actual acts of abuse the restrained party committed after the original order went into effect. It would be anomalous to require the protected party to prove further abuse occurred in order to justify renewal of that original order. If this were the standard, the protected party would have to demonstrate the initial order had proved ineffectual in halting the restrained party\u2019s abusive conduct just to obtain an extension of that ineffectual order. Indeed the fact a protective order has proved effective is a good reason for seeking its renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">But this does not suggest the trial court need make no finding beyond the petitioning party\u2019s subjective desire to have the existing protective order extended\u2014in this case for a lifetime. As Konrad points out, a protective order imposes costs and penalties on the restrained party\u2014the stigma (which may have practical consequences for employment and elsewhere in life) and, for those with reasons to own or use firearms in their prof\u00e9ssion or for protection or just for sport, there is the automatic firearm relinquishment requirement to be discussed in part II of this opinion. The fact a judge found enough grounds to grant a protective order three years earlier does not necessarily mean sufficient grounds remain to renew that order for another three years\u2014or as in this instance, permanently\u2014merely because the protected party files a \u201crequest\u201d and expresses her subjective desire the court issue such an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>But what showing should be required before a trial court can extend an existing protective order? Konrad urges this court to adopt the test announced by appellate courts in Missouri. \u201cTo obtain a <em>renewal </em>of a full order of protection, the petitioner has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the expiration of the full order <em>would place the petitioner in an imminent and present danger of abuse. </em>No new acts need be alleged. A renewal of a fiill order of protection <em>can be based upon the fact that the circumstances which formed the basis for the initial order continue to exist.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">A. <em>The Rationale of the Missouri \u201cImminent and Present Danger of Abuse\u201d Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Similar to section 6345, the Missouri statute specifically authorizes a court to renew an initial protective order, but fails to specifically define the showing required to justify that renewal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Also, similar to section 6345, the Missouri statute provides, \u201ca finding by the court of a subsequent act of abuse is not required for a renewal order of protection.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The same statute, however, does define what the trial court must find in order to issue the initial protective order. \u201c[I]f the petitioner has proved the allegation of abuse or stalking by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall issue a full order of protection [for a period of 180 days to one year].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (The Missouri statute also differs in limiting an extension to a maximum period of one year.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">In 1986, a Missouri appellate court had occasion to interpret the renewal provisions of the above protective order statute in an unusual context. The question in <em>Capps v. Capps (Capps)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was whether the renewal motion was a new \u201ccivil action\u201d entitling the husband to demand a different judge for the hearing. In concluding a renewal proceeding was only a continuation of the original action seeking a protective order, the court relied on the legislative history behind that state\u2019s \u201cAdult Abuse Act,\u201d of which the protective order proceedings are a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">\u201cThe legislature intended the Adult Abuse Act to provide protection from further acts of abuse. A means toward that end is the renewal of a Full Order of Protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>\u201cGiven the fundamental purpose of the Adult Abuse Act, the <em>prevention of further acts of abuse, </em>we conclude that the legislature intended that a renewal of a Full Order of Protection be granted to a petitioner who proves by a preponderance of the <em>evidence that the expiration of the Full Order will place petitioner in an immediate and present danger of abuse. </em>No new acts of abuse need to be alleged for a renewal, [ft] . . . [ft]</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">\u201cThus, we conclude that a renewal proceeding is not a civil action for purposes of a change of judge . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">The <em>Capps </em>court thus used the legislative purpose behind the overall abuse statute to fill in the missing term in the renewal provision of the protective order statute\u2014the proof required to justify renewing an existing order. Because the purpose of the act is to prevent future acts of abuse, the court reasoned, evidence must demonstrate an \u201cimmediate and present danger\u201d future abuse indeed will occur unless the court renews the initial protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Two years later, in <em>Bandelier v. </em>Bandelier,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> another Missouri appellate court reiterated the <em>Capps </em>criteria and reversed the renewal of a protective order. It did so based on the court\u2019s finding that the protected party produced insufficient evidence to satisfy the standard for renewal of such an order. \u201cThe sole testimony to which Mrs. Bandelier points as evidence of an immediate and present danger of abuse is her statement that Mr. Bandelier had been in her home \u2018several times\u2019 since the issuance of the original order. Although Mr. Bandelier\u2019s actions, two of which are admitted by him, violate the original order . . . , Mrs. Bandelier\u2019s bare statement does not meet the preponderance of the evidence test required to support a renewal order.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">Missouri courts continue to apply the <em>Capps </em>formula. But is its rationale\u2014 and especially its requirement of an \u201cimminent and present danger\u201d the restrained party will commit future acts of abuse\u2014an appropriate standard for California?</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>B. <em>The Appropriate Standard Requires Evidence of a \u201cReasonable Apprehension of Future Abuse\u201d Before Ordering Renewal of a Protective Order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">The basic approach the <em>Capps </em>court used to derive Missouri\u2019s criteria for renewals of protective orders appears sound\u2014and applicable to our interpretation of section 6345. The overall purpose of our \u201cdomestic violence\u201d legislation is the same as Missouri\u2019s \u201cadult abuse\u201d laws\u2014to prevent future acts of abuse. The renewal of existing protective orders is a part of that scheme and shares that overall legislative purpose. Consequently, in contested cases, a court is only justified in ordering an extension of such an order where it finds to do so will advance the legislative purpose of preventing future abuse. This means it must find evidence there is some reasonable risk, at least, such abuse will occur sometime in the future if the protective order is not renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The California Legislature\u2019s specific provision to the effect the protected party need not produce \u201ca showing of any further abuse since the issuance of the original order\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is identical to the similar provision in the Missouri statute. By its terms, this provision does not necessarily excuse the requesting party from making a showing of some kind\u2014and certainly fails to relieve the trial court of the responsibility to determine in contested cases whether renewal indeed will further the statutory purpose of preventing future abuse. Instead, unless the restrained party expressly accedes to an extension or fails to challenge the protected party\u2019s request, this portion of section 6345 carries a negative pregnant: the court should consider whether other facts\u2014past or present\u2014justify a renewal of the protective order. That is, if section 6345 were intended to eliminate the need for any showing and any findings relevant to whether renewal would prevent future abuse, the Legislature would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">The legislative history of section 6345 tends to reinforce the view a contested extension requires an inquiry into the probability future abuse will occur unless the court renews the protective order. As explained in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary legislative memorandum accompanying the original bill out of which the 1995 amendment emerged: \u201cThe length of the order should be based upon the <em>seriousness of the </em>facts and the <em>probability of repeat violence </em>to the victim and his or her family.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>What appears questionable\u2014and certainly not inevitable\u2014in the test the <em>Capps </em>court announced is the high standard it set\u2014a requirement the trial court find an <em>\u201cimminent and present </em>danger\u201d the restrained party will commit future acts of abuse unless the protective order is renewed. This standard is not inherent in the legislative purpose of preventing future acts of abuse. It seems doubtful the California Legislature was only interested in preventing abuse that is \u201cimminent and present\u201d in the sense it would occur immediately or shortly after the existing protective order expired. A more likely purpose is the prevention of abuse where the court finds the protected party has a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d abuse will occur at some time in the future if the protective order is allowed to expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">This \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d language is the formula the California Legislature chose when it installed an objective test where a court bases its <em>initial </em>protective order on the prospective protected party\u2019s fear of future abuse.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is not enough this party entertain a subjective fear the party to be restrained will commit abusive acts in the future. The \u201capprehension\u201d those acts will occur must be \u201creasonable.\u201d That is, the court must find the probability of future abuse is sufficient that a reasonable woman (or man, if the protected party is a male) in the same circumstances would have a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d such abuse will occur unless the court issues a protective order. This same formulation appears appropriate when a trial court considers a contested request for an extension of the initial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">At least one state has adopted a lower standard than Missouri, similar to this \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d test, governing the decision whether to extend an initial protective order. In Ohio, the court can issue an order renewing a protective order if it finds a preponderance of the evidence supports a finding a petitioner or a petitioner\u2019s family or household members are simply <em>in danger </em>of being the victims of domestic violence. In <em>Woolum v. Woolum,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court held each application for renewal of a protective order must be considered on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis and that sometimes the past abuse giving rise to the initial order will be sufficient in itself to support a finding there is enough \u201cdanger\u201d of future abuse should that order expire to justify an extension.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the case before it, however, the court found the restrained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>party also had exhibited behavior during the time the initial order was in effect that buttressed the risk of future abuse.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">The requirement the party seeking the order entertain a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of future abuse also is consistent with a case\"\"from Utah. The Utah law authorizes a court to grant a permanent protective .order if the judge finds \u201cthere is a substantial likelihood of abuse or domestic violence.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In a case decided in 2001, <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bayles </em><footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a divorced and remarried woman sought a permanent protective order against her first husband. She alleged a pattern of physical and emotional abuse during their 27-year marriage and several incidents since then where the ex-husband stalked her and her new husband. In a two-to-one decision a Utah appellate court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision granting the protective order. The court interpreted the statutory test, a \u201csubstantial likelihood of abuse or domestic violence\u201d as equating to \u201ca present fear of future abuse.\u201d It then emphasized this \u201cpresent fear\u201d must be \u201creasonable and real.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">As the <em>Bailey </em>court explained, \u201c[I]n both her petition and during her testimony, [the wife] clearly indicated to the trial court that she experienced a constant fear of [her ex-husband]. . . . Based on [the wife\u2019s] testimony, the trial court correctly concluded in its memorandum decision that [her] emotional distress was <em>reasonable. </em>[I] . . . [W]e conclude that [the ex-husband\u2019s] conduct\u2014repeatedly following [the wife], following [the wife\u2019s new husband], repeatedly calling [the wife\u2019s] home and workplace, coupled with the evidence of past abuse\u2014was sufficient for the trial court to conclude that [the wife\u2019s] fear was <em>both reasonable and </em>real.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Notably, our research has not discovered any state which allows a trial court to extend or renew a domestic violence protective order\u2014without the express or implied consent of the restrained party\u2014based solely on the protected party\u2019s mere desire for such an extension or her (or his) <em>subjective </em>fear or apprehension future abuse will occur should the existing order expire. Nor, for reasons explained earlier, do we conclude the California Legislature has done so in section 6345. Like California, several states authorize such extensions or renewals, usually of much shorter duration than California, without requiring evidence the restrained party violated the existing order by committing a new act of abuse. But this does not mean other evidence bearing on the need for a continued protective order is unnecessary or irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>We conclude that in California, as in the rest of the country, an objective test must be satisfied before a protective order is renewed in contested cases. From the language of California statutes and the legislative history, we have drawn the following formula (limited, however, to cases where the restrained party appears and challenges the requested renewal of the existing order). A trial court should renew the protective order, if, and only if, it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected party entertains a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of future abuse. So there should be no misunderstanding, this does not mean the court must find it is more likely than not future abuse will occur if the protective order is not renewed. It only means the evidence demonstrates it is more probable than not there is a sufficient risk of future abuse to find the protected party\u2019s apprehension is genuine and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">C. <em>Factors the Trial Court May Consider in Determining Whether the \u201cReasonable Apprehension\u201d Test Is Satisfied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Evaluating whether the requesting party has a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of future abuse when considering whether to renew an existing protective order poses a somewhat different problem than deciding whether to issue the original order. For one thing, there is that existing order and the factual predicate for its issuance\u2014typically prior acts or at least threats of abuse, perhaps some psychological tests or similar evidence of the restrained party\u2019s predisposition to inflict abuse, and the like. The existence of the order itself often will be less telling than the facts supporting its issuance. Consequently, the trial judge ordinarily should consider the evidence and findings on which that initial order was based in appraising the risk of future abuse should the existing order expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">On the other hand, the trial court should not permit the restrained party to challenge the truth of the evidence and findings underlying the initial order, as Konrad seeks to do in this case. This would contradict principles of collateral estoppel and undercut the policies supporting those principles. But this does not mean the trial court should be prohibited from looking behind the order itself when evaluating whether that order, often three years old, should be extended another three years or even, as here, permanently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The restrictions contained in two orders may read precisely the same. Yet one may rest on a half-dozen violent acts against the protected party and a psychological evaluation the restrained party is a lifelong sociopath, while the other was based on a single threat issued in an angry moment during a painful divorce. Because of an amendment in 1998, protective orders can be issued because of persistent unwanted phone calls or letters\u2014which fall into the same category as \u201cmolesting, attacking, striking, stalking, threatening, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>sexually assaulting, battering, [or] harassing\u201d the protected party.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> That pattern of unwanted phone calls or letters may support the same set of prohibitions in the initial protective order as one predicated on a series of violent beatings. So the protective order itself often fails to disclose even the species of the conduct on which it is based\u2014to say nothing of the degree or timing of that conduct or the risk it will be repeated in the absence of a renewed protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">All of which is to say the mere existence of a protective order, typically issued several years earlier, seldom if ever will provide <em>conclusive </em>evidence the requesting party entertains a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of future abuse of any kind should that order expire. But the existence of the initial order certainly is relevant and the underlying findings and facts supporting that order often will be enough in themselves to provide the necessary proof to satisfy that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">Also potentially relevant are any significant changes in the circumstances surrounding the events justifying the initial protective order. For instance, have the restrained and protected parties moved on with their lives so far that the opportunity and likelihood of future abuse has diminished to the degree they no longer support a renewal of the order? Or have there been no significant changes or even perhaps changes that enhance the opportunity and possibility of future abuse?</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">The other side of the equation\u2014the \u201cburdens\u201d the protective order imposes on the restrained party\u2014may or may not be a relevant factor in the trial court\u2019s consideration of a contested request for renewal of a protective order. Certainly those burdens would never justify denial of a renewed protective order where the \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d is of future acts of <em>physical violence. </em>It is true those \u201cburdens\u201d on the restrained party can be very real. There often will be some social stigma attached while a person is subject to a protective order. Existing employers may frown on an employee who is subject to such an order and prospective employers almost surely will. Thus the restrained party may lose out on a promotion or a job. The continued existence of such an order likewise may, fairly or unfairly, interfere with the restrained party\u2019s social life. Furthermore, where children are involved, a protective order designed to prohibit access to an abused spouse may have the collateral effect of limiting the restrained party\u2019s access to his (or her) children even when they are not potential targets of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>Once again, however, the physical security of the protected party trumps all of these burdens the original or renewed protective order may impose on the restrained party. Thus, where the protected party has a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of future <em>physical </em>abuse if the current protective order expires, that order should be renewed despite any burdens this inflicts on the restrained party. The Legislature has left little doubt about this balancing of risks and burdens in its domestic violence legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">The burdens the restrained party suffers from a renewed\u2014and especially a permanent\u2014protective order may become relevant, however, where the existing order focuses not on the threat of physical violence, but lesser forms of abuse \u2014unwanted telephone calls or mail, for example. Where the worst \u201cdanger\" the protected party must fear is a few unwanted calls or letters or e-mail messages, the court may have to weigh the seriousness as well as the degree of the risk against the significance of the burdens the restrained party will experience if subjected to a continuing protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">D. <em>On This Appellate Record It Is Not Possible for This Court to Determine Whether the Trial Court Would Have Renewed This Order Had It Applied the \u201cReasonable Apprehension of Future Abuse \u2019\u2019 Test.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">In some cases it might be possible for an appellate court to conclude the trial court\u2019s error in failing to apply the \u201creasonable apprehension of future abuse\u201d test represents \u201charmless error.\u201d The evidence and findings supporting the original protective order may have demonstrated the restrained party\u2019s prior violent behavior and predisposition to violence conclusively established that party posed a continuing risk warranting a permanent or at least lengthy extension of the initial order. Here, however, the findings supporting the trial court\u2019s original order, some three years before the hearing on the requested renewal, fall far short of a conclusive showing this order should be extended into the indefinite future. Nothing in the record properly before this court establishes Ritchie produced evidence of, or the trial court found, that Konrad had committed serious or even significant acts of violence against Ritchie or made significant threats to do same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">Perhaps recognizing the initial order was predicated on Konrad\u2019s largely nonviolent although admittedly objectionable conduct toward Ritchie, respondent\u2019s brief emphasizes the 1998 amendments expanded the grounds for issuing protective orders. Those additional grounds include \u201cstalking, . . . harassing, telephoning, . . . destroying personal property, contacting, either directly or indirectly by mail or otherwise, coming within a specified distance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>of, or disturbing the peace of the other party, . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> From the fragments of evidence in the record revealing what the trial court considered at the first hearing, it appears most if not all of the conduct the trial court used to justify the initial 1999 protective order fell into the nonviolent categories this 1998 amendment added. Furthermore, the evidence and findings we have before us from that 1999 hearing are insufficient to establish conclusively Ritchie could entertain a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d Konrad will even repeat these lesser, nonviolent forms of abuse should the protective order expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">On the other hand, there was evidence tendered at the renewal hearing suggesting the circumstances had changed rather dramatically over the three years between the two hearings. It is conceivable those changed circumstances might reduce the probability of future acts of either violent or nonviolent conduct against Ritchie or her family members. At the time the court issued the initial protective order Ritchie and Konrad had rather recently terminated a four-year relationship and engagement. At that time, they were both living in the Los Angeles area. Three years later they were both married to other people, and Ritchie had moved to Henderson, Nevada, nearly 300 miles away from Konrad\u2019s home. Because the trial court considered Ritchie was entitled to a renewal of the initial order \u201cupon request\u201d it did not even consider this evidence of changed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Accordingly, for these reasons, we are compelled to reverse for a further hearing on Ritchie\u2019s requested renewal of the protective order. The purpose is to allow the trial court to apply the proper test and determine whether Ritchie\u2019s expressed fear of significant ffiture abuse is reasonable and thus sufficient to warrant a permanent (or lengthy) extension of the original protective order. This court expresses no view as to the appropriate outcome of the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">II. <em>THE TRIAL CO URT LACKED THE STATUTORY A UTHORITY TO REMOVE THE \u201cFIREARM RESTRICTION\u201d AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ALSO MUST DECIDE WHETHER THAT FACTOR WILL AFFECT THE EXERCISE OF ITS DISCRETION IN GRANTING OR DENYING THE REQUESTED RENEWAL OF THE EXISTING PROTECTIVE ORDER.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">While the trial court here failed to evaluate whether Ritchie entertained a \u201creasonable apprehension of future abuse,\u201d it did balance what it perceived to be the protected party\u2019s right to renewal of the order against the burdens that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>renewal imposed on the restrained party. In doing so, it applied the typical balancing approach used to decide whether to issue a regular injunction\u2014the harm to the moving party if the injunction is not issued versus the harm to the other party if the injunction <em>is </em>issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The court focused on the firearm restriction as the sole significant burden Konrad would experience if it renewed the protective order. Nothing in the record suggests whether the trial court would have exercised its discretion to deny the requested renewal had it considered Konrad would remain subject to the firearm prohibition once the protective order was extended. That is because, as mentioned earlier, the trial court struck the \u201cfirearm restriction\u201d from the order. It is entirely possible the court would have granted the requested renewal even if the judge realized the firearm' restriction would remain in place despite its action deleting that provision from the face of the order. But on this record it is impossible to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">It is apparent, however, the current statutory framework denied the trial court the authority to effectively delete the firearm restriction. Section 6389, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cA person subject to a protective order, as defined in Section 6218, <em>shall not </em>own, possess, purchase, or receive a firearm while that protective order is in effect.\u201d Section 6218,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> in turn, defines a protective order as one enjoining specific acts of abuse (such as contacting, molesting, or striking)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and/or excluding a person from a dwelling<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and/or enjoining other behavior the court determines is necessary to effectuate (the other two types of order).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Nothing in 6389, subdivision (a) or elsewhere<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> suggests the court is empowered to disable or modify the firearm prohibition section 6389, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>subdivision (a) <em>automatically </em>activates when a court imposes or renews any of the enumerated forms of protective orders. Ritchie argues differently in supplemental briefing this court requested on the firearm restriction issue. But her position is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">In her supplemental brief, Ritchie points to a single sentence at the end of section 6389, subdivision (f) and urges this language allows a trial judge to modify or strike a firearm restriction. The sentence reads: \u201cNothing in this section [i.e., section 6389] shall limit a respondent\u2019s right under existing law to petition the court at a later date for modification of the order.\u201d The sentences which precede the sentence Ritchie quoted supply the necessary context and read as follows: \u201cThe <em>restraining order </em>requiring a person to relinquish a firearm pursuant to subdivision (c) <em>shall state on its face </em>that the respondent is prohibited from owning, possessing, purchasing, or receiving a firearm <em>while the protective order is in effect </em>and that the firearm <em>shall be relinquished </em>to the local law enforcement agency for that jurisdiction or sold to a licensed gun dealer, and that proof of surrender or sale <em>shall be filed </em>with the court within a specified period of receipt of the order. The order <em>shall also state </em>on its face the expiration date for relinquishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">This series of sentences is followed by the sentence on which Ritchie relies. In context, however, that sentence refers to modifications of the underlying protective order, including for example terminating or shortening the term of that order. Because the existence and term of the firearm restriction is linked directly to the existence and term of the underlying protective order, a modification in the latter will automatically lengthen or shorten the term of the former. The quoted sentence merely makes it clear nothing in the firearm restriction law\u2014including for example the required statement the relinquishment shall expire on a certain date\u2014can impair a party\u2019s entitlement to \u201cpetition the court at a later date for modification of the [restraining] order [that required relinquishment].\u201d But the latter sentence cannot be read to permit the court to strike the firearm restriction or modify it in any way at variance with the mandatory provisions of section 6389.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">This court\u2019s view is reinforced as the context is expanded further to embrace the entire section 6389. That lengthy code provision is laced with provisions mandating surrender of firearms for the full term of any protective order. None of these sections hint the trial court possesses any discretion to avoid imposing these mandatory requirements or to provide any relief at any time during the duration of the underlying protective order. For example, section 6389, subdivision (b) orders the Judicial Council to include a \u201cnotice on all forms requesting a protective order that, ... the respondent <em>shall be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number><em>ordered to relinquish </em>possession ... of any firearms. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Section 6389, subdivision (c) then instructs the trial court what it must do if the restrained party is present in the courtroom. In that event, the court <em>\u201cshall order . . . </em>[that party] to relinquish any firearm in that person\u2019s immediate possession. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Section 6389, subdivision (g) provides the \u201crestraining order requiring a person to relinquish a firearm . . . <em>shall prohibit </em>the person from possessing or controlling any firearm for the duration of the order.\u201d This same subdivision then sets forth the procedures for returning any such firearm \u201cwithin five days after the expiration of the relinquishment order, . . .\u201d The firearm is <em>not </em>to be returned, however, if \u201canother successive restraining order is used against the respondent. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">The only grant of discretion appears in section 6389, subdivision (h). It is limited to a special class of restrained parties, those who use a firearm as a necessary part of their employment. Even then the trial court\u2019s discretion is sharply circumscribed. The court must first find the \u201cparticular firearm is necessary as a condition of continued employment and that the current employer is unable to reassign the respondent to another position where a firearm is unnecessary.\u201d Having made that finding, the trial court must issue an order mandating \u201cthe firearm shall be in the physical possession of the respondent only during scheduled work hours and during travel to and from his or her place of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">It is inconsistent with this extraordinarily narrow grant of discretion even when a restrained party uses a firearm as an essential part of his or her job to read into that single sentence at the end of section 6389, subdivision (f) an unfettered grant of power to trial courts allowing them to strike a firearm restriction entirely for any party it wants and for any reason it wants. It likewise is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the current version of section 6389\u2014to entirely remove the trial court\u2019s discretion and mandate relinquishment of firearms whenever a protective order is issued. \u201cCalifornia is one of only six states to enact this type of legislation. Most importantly, [it] eliminates the requirement that the petitioner prove a likelihood that a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>will be used or threatened to be used in future acts of violence. ... In other words, when someone is subject to a protective order ... he automatically \u2018shall not own, possess, purchase, or receive a firearm while that protective order is in effect.\u2019 ... By removing judges\u2019 case-by-case determinations, this change allows for a more uniform application of the law. ... the court no longer has the discretion to decide the length of time for which the person must give up his weapons\u2014the time period is equal to the duration of the order(s).\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Some might quarrel with this inevitable and irrevocable pairing of protec- \u2022 five orders and firearm restrictions. But it is not difficult to understand how it came to pass. If a person represents a substantial threat to inflict physical harm on another person, it appears reasonable to disarm the former, at least to take away the weapons most capable of causing death or death-threatening injury, e.g., firearms.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The logical connection has become less clear, however, with recent amendments allowing protective orders based primarily on nonviolent conduct, such as a pattern of unwanted and obnoxious communications (e-mails, telephone calls, letters, etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">As defined when the Legislature enacted the present version of section 6389 in 1995, a court could issue protective orders only where it was shown the restrained party had engaged in conduct calculated \u201cintentionally or recklessly to cause or attempt to cause <em>bodily injury, </em>or <em>sexual assault, </em>or to place a person in reasonable apprehension of <em>imminent serious bodily injury </em>to that person or to another.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In 1998, however, as mentioned earlier in this opinion<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the Legislature amended the statutory scheme to expand the definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d and \u201cabuse\u201d to embrace nonviolent but harassing conduct. As a result, a trial court now can impose a protective order not only because of prior or threatened bodily injury, but also where the restrained party has only been \u201cstalking, . . . harassing, telephoning, including, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>but not limited to, annoying telephone calls as described in [Penal Code] Section 653m, [<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>] destroying personal property, contacting, either directly or indirectly by mail or otherwise, coming within a specified distance of, or disturbing the peace of the other party . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>As a consequence of these 1998 amendments, intended or otherwise, a firearms restriction becomes mandatory even when a trial court imposes a protective order based solely on the restrained party placing annoying telephone calls or sending unwanted e-mails, letters, or the like. It is true this sort of nonviolent behavior in some circumstance can \u201cplace [the other person] in <em>reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily </em>injury.\u201d But a trial court no longer need make such a finding in order to issue a protective order. It is sufficient the evidence demonstrate one or the other of these nonviolent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">That a person who only makes annoying telephone calls or the like\u2014with no indication he or she poses a reasonable threat, of physical violence\u2014 should be subject to an automatic firearms restriction is not an obvious proposition. Yet under the present statutory framework, this is the inevitable result of a protective order issued on this basis. And it is for the Legislature, not this court, to revisit the wisdom of this consequence of the 1998 amendments it superimposed on the previous framework which linked the restrained party\u2019s potential for violent acts and that party\u2019s possession of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">What is not clear in this case is whether the trial court would have renewed the protective order had it realized its attempt to strike the firearms restriction was a futile gesture. For this purpose, we assume the court had been correct in concluding it had no responsibility to determine whether Konrad posed a reasonable threat to repeat his offending conduct when the existing protective order expired. Nonetheless, at the same time, the court expressly recognized it desired to weigh the risk the protected party faced if the court denied the requested renewal against the burdens that renewal would impose on the restrained party. The trial court ordered the renewal only after believing it had entirely eliminated what it deemed the entire \u201cburden\u201d side of the equation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">This court can only speculate whether the trial court here would have renewed this protective order had it recognized the present statutory framework made it impossible for it to strike the firearm restriction. Konrad claimed he had legitimate reasons for wanting to at least possess and use, if not own firearms. In particular, he presented evidence his in-laws are avid hunters and outdoorsmen, and thus the firearm restriction interfered with his ability to participate fully with his new family and their activities. So there was significant evidence available supporting the conclusion the renewal of the order would impose a real, not just theoretical, burden on Konrad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">On the other side of the equation, Ritchie did not even attempt to present any evidence Konrad should be denied access to firearms because there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>threat to shoot her. Indeed the trial court obviously concluded that was such a remote or non-existent threat it readily struck the firearm restriction, thus permitting Konrad to own, possess and use any firearm. And significantly, Ritchie did not object in the trial court when the judge eliminated the existing firearm restriction. Instead in her initial briefing and in a supplemental brief, Ritchie has vigorously supported the trial court\u2019s authority and decision to strike that provision. So it is more than apparent Ritchie does not consider Konrad a threat to use a gun to inflict serious bodily harm on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">For these reasons, and as a second independent and sufficient grounds for reversing this judgment, we remand for the trial court to reconsider its renewal of the protective order with the understanding a renewal of that order will carry with it a continuation of the firearm restriction for so long as the renewed order remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">The judgment is reversed and remanded with instructions the trial court reconsider petitioner\u2019s request the restraining order be renewed. In doing so, it should apply the \u201creasonable apprehension of future abuse\u201d standard discussed in this opinion and also consider the effect of the court\u2019s inability to eliminate the firearm restriction while a protective order remains in place. This court expresses no views as to the appropriate outcome of the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of its original decision.
