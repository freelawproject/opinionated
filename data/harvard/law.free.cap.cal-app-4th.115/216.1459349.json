The issue presented in this case is whether the immediate presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>requirement of a robbery charge is satisfied where the defendant, after stealing property belonging to the victim but not from the victim\u2019s presence, is confronted by the victim as he is attempting to carry the property to a place of temporary safety and uses forcible resistance to keep the property. We conclude that the immediate presence requirement is met under such circumstances and thus deny the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition challenging the superior court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss the robbery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On August 27, 2002, Jose Higareda went into the public restroom at La Jolla Cove to change into his swimming trunks. He went into one of the restroom\u2019s enclosed stalls and hung his pants, which contained his wallet (with more than $200 in cash), cellular telephone and keys, on a hook inside the stall door. As Higareda was changing, Miller walked into the restroom and entered the stall directly across from Higareda\u2019s. There was no one else in the restroom at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">After Higareda finished putting on his swimming trunks, he walked out of the restroom, inadvertently leaving his pants hanging inside the stall. After taking a few steps outside the restroom, Higareda realized his mistake and went back into the restroom. He checked the stall where he had left his pants and, after discovering the pants missing, began looking under the doors of the other stalls to try to locate them. Higareda heard the sound of someone opening Velcro coming from the stall directly across from the one where he had left his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Because his wallet had a Velcro fastener, Higareda became suspicious, entered a stall adjacent to the one Miller was in and looked over the top into Miller\u2019s stall. Miller, who appeared to be shielding something from Higareda\u2019s view, inquired what Higareda was doing. Higareda responded that someone had taken his belongings and Miller told him to report the situation to a lifeguard. Higareda waited outside Miller\u2019s stall for 15 to 20 minutes, expecting that Miller would come out. During that time, Miller repeatedly asked other persons who entered the restroom for toilet paper, but did not leave the stall.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Ultimately, Higareda\u2019s friend, Dennis O\u2019Brien, entered the restroom looking for Higareda. Higareda told O\u2019Brien that someone had taken his belongings and that he believed Miller had them. O\u2019Brien knocked on the door of Miller\u2019s stall, demanding that Miller \u201cgive . . . the stuff back.\u201d Miller told O\u2019Brien to leave him \u201cthe T alone,\u201d but Higareda continued to demand that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Miller return his property. After additional exchanges, O\u2019Brien announced that he was going to get a lifeguard, although, at Higareda\u2019s request, he did not leave the restroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Five to 10 seconds later, Miller came out of his stall and attempted to leave the restroom, saying \u201c[l]et me out of here.\u201d Higareda and O\u2019Brien blocked Miller from leaving and yelled for someone to get a lifeguard. Miller charged at the men, trying to push and shove his way out of the restroom. After a great deal of scuffling, O\u2019Brien placed Miller in a headlock and Higareda demanded to see what Miller had in his pockets. Miller gave Higareda his wallet, which Higareda held until lifeguards arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Police arrested Miller at the scene and found $241 in cash in his wallet, which did not fasten with Velcro, and 2.43 grams of methamphetamine in his shorts pocket. O\u2019Brien told the officers that he found Higareda\u2019s pants and empty wallet underneath a tremendous mound of toilet paper in the stall Miller had occupied. Officers suspected that Miller was under the influence of a controlled substance at the time of his arrest; Miller subsequently tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The district attorney charged Miller with one count each of robbery and possession of a controlled substance. At an April 3, 2003 preliminary hearing on the charges against Miller, O\u2019Brien and two police officers testified. (Although Higareda did not testify at the preliminary hearing, one of the officers testified about Higareda\u2019s statements concerning the incident. The officer\u2019s testimony was admissible pursuant to section 872, subdivision (b).) The magistrate held Miller to answer both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Miller filed a section 995 motion to dismiss the robbery charge against him on the ground that the evidence did not establish that he took property from Higareda\u2019s person or immediate presence. The superior court concluded that, in accordance with <em>People </em>v. <em>Estes </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 23, 27 [194 Cal.Rptr. 909] <em>(Estes), </em>Miller\u2019s resistance to Higareda\u2019s attempt to regain the property was sufficient to establish the immediate presence requirement and that the evidence thus supported the robbery charge against Miller. Based on its findings, the court denied Miller\u2019s section 995 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Miller filed the instant petition for writ of prohibition, challenging the denial order and reasserting his argument that because there is no evidence showing the property was taken from Higareda\u2019s person or immediate presence, the evidence admitted at his preliminary hearing is insufficient to support the robbery charge against him. We issued an order to show cause why the relief should not be granted and stayed further proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In ruling on a motion to dismiss made pursuant to section 995, the superior court sits as a reviewing court of the magistrate\u2019s determination that the evidence is sufficient to hold the defendant over for trial. In this situation, the magistrate is the trier of fact and the superior court has no power to judge credibility, resolve conflicts, weigh evidence or draw its own factual inferences, but instead must draw every legitimate inference in favor of the information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laiwa </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 711, 718 [195 Cal.Rptr. 503, 669 P.2d 1278]; <em>People v. Hall </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 992, 996 [92 Cal.Rptr. 304, 479 P.2d 664].) Where the defendant seeks review by appeal or writ in this court, we review the magistrate\u2019s determination rather than that of the superior court. <em>(People v. Laiwa, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 718.) The essential question for our consideration is whether as a matter of law the evidence is sufficient to support the information, i.e., that the evidence establishes \u201csome rational ground for assuming the possibility that an offense has been committed and the accused is guilty of it.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Jurado) </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1226 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 242, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Slaughter </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 629, 637 [200 Cal.Rptr. 448, 677 P.2d 854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">2. <em>Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">As noted above, a \u201crobbery\u201d is \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d (\u00a7 211.) The crime is essentially a theft with two aggravating factors, that is, a taking (1) from victim\u2019s person or immediate presence, and (2) accomplished by the use of force or fear. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marquez </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1308 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 758]; see <em>People v. Avery </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 49, 53, fn. 4 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 403, 38 P.3d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u201cThe taking element of robbery itself has two necessary elements, gaining possession of the victim\u2019s property and asporting or carrying away the loot.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1158, 1165 [282 Cal.Rptr. 450, 811 P.2d 742] <em>(Cooper).) </em>\u201cImmediate presence\u201d is spatially, not temporally, descriptive and thus \u201crefer[s] to the area <em>from which </em>the property is taken, not <em>how far </em>it is taken\u201d or for what duration. <em>(Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1166.) \u201c \u2018A thing is in the [immediate] presence of a person, in respect to robbery, which is so within his reach, inspection, observation or control, that he could, if not overcome by violence or prevented by fear, retain his possession of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 626-627 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376], quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Homer </em>(1920) 235 Mass. 526, 533 [127 N.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>517].) The \u201cimmediate presence\u201d component focuses on whether the stolen property was located in an area in which the victim could have expected to take effective steps to retain control over his property. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 956 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183].) Traditionally, the \u201cimmediate presence\u201d requirement has been described as relating to the \u201cgaining possession\u201d element of the taking rather than the \u201ccarrying away\u201d element of a robbery charge. <em>(Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">To support a robbery charge, the taking must also be accomplished by force or fear. <em>(Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1165, fn. 8.) Circumstances otherwise constituting a mere theft will establish a robbery where the perpetrator peacefully acquires the victim\u2019s property, but then uses force to retain or escape with it. For example, in <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366] <em>(Anderson), </em>the California Supreme Court held that the defendant was properly convicted of robbery based on evidence that he examined a rifle and ammunition at a pawnshop under the guise of being interested in purchasing the items and while the pawnshop clerk was totaling the purchase price, he loaded the rifle and pointed it at the clerk to facilitate his escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The <em>Anderson </em>court stated \u201c[i]n this state, it is settled that a robbery is not completed at the moment the robber obtains possession of the stolen property and that the crime of robbery includes the element of asportation, the robber\u2019s escape with the loot being considered as important in the commission of the crime as gaining possession of the property. [Citations.] [][] Accordingly, if one who has stolen property from the person of another uses force or fear in removing, or attempting to remove, the property from the owner\u2019s immediate presence, ... the crime of robbery has been committed.\u201d <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 638, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The <em>Anderson </em>court cited with approval <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 383 [19 Cal.Rptr. 839], in which the defendant had a gas station attendant pump gasoline into his car and then confronted the attendant with a rifle, refusing to pay for the gas. There, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction based on the taking of the gasoline, upholding the jury\u2019s implicit finding that the defendant took the gasoline from the immediate presence of the attendant by means of force or fear. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 384-387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Although these cases address the peaceful acquisition of property from the immediate presence of the victim, with force or fear arising only in an effort to carry the property away, subsequent authority establishes that the victim\u2019s presence after the taking is in progress is sufficient to establish the immediate presence element of a robbery charge. In <em>Estes, supra, </em>147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Cal.App.3d 23), a department store security guard saw the defendant shoplifting items of clothing inside the store and attempted to stop the defendant, who had left the store without paying for the items. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 26.) The defendant pulled out a knife, swung it at the security guard and threatened to kill the guard. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The <em>Estes </em>court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the merchandise was not taken from the security guard\u2019s immediate presence, stating \u201c[t]he evidence established] that [the defendant] forcibly resisted the security guard\u2019s efforts to retake the property and used that force to remove the items from the guard\u2019s immediate presence. <em>By preventing the guard from regaining control over the merchandise, </em>[the] defendant is held to have taken the property as if the guard had actual possession of the goods in the first instance.\u201d <em>(Estes, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 27, italics added.) The <em>Estes </em>court also observed that a \u201c[defendant's guilt is not to be weighed at each step of the robbery as it unfolds. The events constituting the crime of robbery, although they may extend over large distances and take some time to complete, are linked by a single-mindedness of purpose. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">p. 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Miller and the dissent suggest that because the security guard in <em>Estes </em>observed the thief taking clothing from the store, the immediate presence element was otherwise satisfied in accordance with the standard set forth in <em>People v. Hayes, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pages 626-627 (to wit, that \u201c[a] thing is in the [immediate] presence of a person, in respect to robbery, which is so within his reach, inspection, observation or control, that he could, if not overcome by violence or prevented by fear, retain his possession of it\u201d) and that the above-quoted language in <em>Estes </em>was merely dicta. We disagree. Although the <em>Estes </em>court <em>could have </em>found that the immediate presence element was satisfied based on the security guard\u2019s observation of the theft, the fact remains that it did not do so. Rather the court concluded that, as the use of force or fear only in carrying the stolen property away was sufficient to support a robbery charge, the victim\u2019s immediate presence during the asportation of the property was likewise sufficient. Courts and practitioners have widely accepted this analysis, such that robberies in which the victim only comes upon the defendant after the latter has gained possession of the stolen property are commonly referred to as <em>\u201cEstes </em>robberies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Miller argues and the dissent agrees that to the extent <em>Estes </em>concludes the element of \u201cimmediate presence\u201d can be satisfied by a victim\u2019s presence during a defendant\u2019s asporting or carrying away of property, the California Supreme Court subsequently overruled it on that issue in <em>Cooper. </em>However, although <em>Cooper </em>described the immediate presence element of a robbery charge as relating to the \u201cgaining possession\u201d element of the taking rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>than the \u201ccarrying away\u201d element <em>(Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1166), the opinion did not overrule or disapprove of <em>Estes </em>in any respect, but rather cited <em>Estes </em>with approval. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1165 &amp; fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Although the dissent credits us with \u201ccompleting] the transmogrification of the crime of robbery,\u201d in light of the widespread acceptance of the analysis of <em>Estes </em>and the fact that the California Supreme Court has not criticized or overruled <em>Estes </em>in the 20 years since that decision issued, we do not believe that our opinion expresses a change in the law, but instead reflects the current state of the law on the issue of what is sufficient to establish the immediate presence element of a robbery charge. We conclude from these authorities that, although the immediate presence and force or fear elements of robbery originally had to be satisfied at the time of the gaining possession aspect of a taking, the law has long since allowed these elements to be supplied after the defendant has initially gained possession of the victim\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Pursuant to the long-standing principles announced in <em>Estes, </em>Miller\u2019s use of force to retain the property after Higareda confronted him while he was attempting to get away with Higareda\u2019s money was sufficient to support the assertion of a robbery charge against him. In such circumstances, Higareda could reasonably \u201chave expected to take effective steps to retain control over his property\u201d and thus the immediate presence requirement is satisfied. <em>(People v. Frye, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 956; see also <em>People v. Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273] [holding that a reasonable trier of fact might find a taking of the victim\u2019s car from his immediate presence because it might infer that, absent the use of force or fear, the victim could have taken effective steps to prevent his three assailants from stealing his car, although the victim and the assailants were a quarter of a mile away at the time of the assault]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Pham </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 61, 64-68 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 636] [holding that the jury properly convicted the defendant of robbery based on evidence that the victim confronted him as he was getting ready to flee with items taken from the victim\u2019s car and chased him, after which he dropped the items and started to physically attack the victim].)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the preliminary hearing evidence is sufficient to support the existence of a taking from Higareda\u2019s immediate presence and thus the trial court did not err in denying Miller\u2019s section 995 motion to dismiss the robbery charge against Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The petition for a writ of prohibition is denied.

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1158, 1165 [282 Cal.Rptr. 450, 811 P.2d 742].) However, <em>Cooper </em>further stated: \u201cAlthough the \u2018immediate presence\u2019 language comes directly from section 211, this language does not pertain to the <em>duration </em>of robbery. . . . Taking from the \u2018person\u2019 and from the \u2018immediate presence\u2019 [in section 211] are alternatives. These terms are spatially, rather than temporally, descriptive. They refer to the area <em>from which </em>the property is taken, not <em>how far </em>it is taken. [Citations.] Put another way, these limitations on the scope of the robbery statute relate to the \u2018gaining possession\u2019 component of the taking as distinct from the \u2018carrying away\u2019 component.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1166.) In <em>People v. Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376], the Supreme Court adopted the following definition of \u201cimmediate presence:\u201d \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a] thing is in the [immediate] presence of a person, in respect to robbery, which is so within his reach, inspection, observation or control, that he could, if not overcome by violence or prevented by fear, retain his possession of it.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Commonwealth v. Homer </em>(1920) 235 Mass. 526, 533 [127 N.E. 517]; [citations].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 626-627.) \u201cImmediate presence\u201d means at least an area within which the victim could reasonably be expected to exercise some physical control over his or her property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 627; <em>People v. Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 440 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273].) Under the Supreme Court decisions in <em>Cooper, Hayes </em>and <em>Webster, </em>a necessary element of a section 211 robbery is the victim\u2019s presence in a location in which he or she could reasonably expect some physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>control of the personal property at the time the perpetrator gained possession of the property. In this case, Higareda was not in that location; he was outside the public restroom at the time Miller gained possession of Higareda\u2019s trousers and the items contained in those trousers. An element of the charged robbery, as described by the Supreme Court, is absent in this case. Miller may have been guilty of burglary, assault, theft or other criminal offenses, but he was not guilty of robbery. (See <em>Hayes, </em>at p. 627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The majority opinion agrees that Miller did not gain possession of Higareda\u2019s personal property from either his person or from his immediate possession. It also concludes that Miller retained possession of Higareda\u2019s personal property in his immediate presence during the asportation phase of the incident, and that retention of the personal property during the asportation phase of the incident satisfied the taking \u201cfrom the person or immediate presence\u201d element of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that the victim\u2019s presence during the asportation phase of the incident is sufficient to satisfy the elements of robbery is directly in conflict with language of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Cooper. </em>It seeks to obviate that conflict by describing the Supreme Court cases as representing the \u201ctraditional\u201d view of robbery (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 221), which has evolved into a new and different rule creating a new and different offense known as an <em>\u201cEstes </em>robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The majority opinion\u2019s reference to an <em>\u201cEstes </em>robbery\u201d emanates from <em>People v. Estes </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 23 [194 Cal.Rptr. 909]. The <em>Estes </em>court stated: \u201cDefendant further alleges that the merchandise was not taken from the \u2018immediate presence\u2019 of the security guard. The evidence established that appellant [forcibly] resisted the security guard\u2019s efforts to retake the property and used that force to remove the items from the guard\u2019s immediate presence. By preventing the guard from regaining control over the merchandise, defendant is held to have taken the property as if the guard had actual possession of the goods in the first instance. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366].)\u201d <em>(People v. Estes, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 27.) In <em>Estes, </em>a security guard observed the defendant shoplifting items inside a store and then attempted to stop him about five feet outside the store as he left without paying for those items. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 26.) The defendant pulled out a knife, swung it at the security guard, and threatened to kill him. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The language from <em>Estes </em>quoted <em>ante </em>is effectively dicta because the guard was present and observed the defendant gain possession of the property; the defendant in <em>Estes </em>gained possession of the property in the guard\u2019s immediate presence under the <em>Hayes </em>test and <em>Estes </em>is factually inapposite to this case. The court in <em>Estes </em>unnecessarily stated the element of \u201cimmediate presence\u201d was satisfied retroactively by the defendant\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>force during the asportation phase of the incident <em>after </em>he gained possession of the property. To the extent <em>Estes </em>stated the element of immediate presence can be satisfied by a victim\u2019s presence during a defendant\u2019s asporting or carrying away of property, it is inconsistent with <em>Cooper, </em>which concluded immediate presence applies only to the gaining possession component and <em>not </em>to the asporting or carrying away component. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1166.) <em>Estes </em>does not establish the immediate presence element was satisfied in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, <em>Estes, </em>under its facts, established only that the force or fear element of robbery could be satisfied if present during the asportation phase of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The majority opinion notes that <em>Estes </em>was decided before <em>Cooper </em>and that <em>Cooper </em>cites <em>Estes </em>without disapproval. However, <em>Cooper\u2019s </em>reference to <em>Estes </em>was in the context of the duration of the asportation element of robbery. <em>Cooper </em>referenced <em>Estes </em>by footnote after the statement \u201casportation is not confined to a fixed point in time.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1165.) The footnote stated: \u201cThis reasoning is consistent with a long line of Court of Appeal cases, left undisturbed by this court, holding that mere theft becomes robbery if the perpetrator, having gained possession of the property without use of force or fear, resorts to force or fear while carrying away the loot. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Estes </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 23, 27-28 [194 Cal.Rptr. 909]; <em>People v. Kent </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 207, 213 [178 Cal.Rptr. 28]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perhab </em>[(1949)] 92 Cal.App.2d 430, 434-436 [206 P.2d 1133].) In order to support a robbery conviction, the taking, either the gaining possession or the carrying away, must be accomplished by force or fear. . . .\u201d <em>(Cooper, supra, </em>at p. 1165, fn. 8.) The approval by <em>Cooper </em>of <em>Estes </em>was limited to the temporal aspect of the force or fear element of robbery and confirmed the holding of <em>Estes, </em>but not its dicta, that the force or fear element of robbery may be supplied by conduct during the <em>asportation </em>phase of the incident even if not present at the <em>gaining possession </em>phase of the incident. That is an <em>Estes </em>robbery. <em>Cooper </em>gave no approval to the language of <em>Estes, </em>which was unnecessary to its decision, that the immediate presence element of robbery could be satisfied during the asportation phase of the incident although not present at the gaining possession phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>I do not agree with the majority opinion that the crime of robbery has evolved into a retention rather than a taking crime and, because bound by my understanding of <em>Cooper </em>and <em>Hayes, </em>I conclude the preliminary hearing evidence does not support a reasonable inference that the property was on Higareda\u2019s person or in his immediate presence at the time Miller gained possession of it. The trial court therefore erred by denying Miller\u2019s section 995 motion to dismiss the robbery charge against him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Jurado) </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1226 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 242].) I would let a peremptory writ of prohibition issue restraining the San Diego County Superior Court from taking further action on the robbery charge against petitioner, other than to dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 17, 2004. Kennard, J., Werdegar, J., and Brown, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\"> <em>Estes\u2019s </em>citation to <em>People v. Anderson, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d 633 does not persuade me to reach a different conclusion. <em>Anderson </em>stated: \u201c[I]f one who has stolen property from the person of another uses force or fear in removing, or attempting to remove, the property from the owner\u2019s immediate presence . . . , the crime of robbery has been committed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 638.) Because <em>Anderson </em>deals with the element of force or fear and not the element of taking from the victim\u2019s immediate presence, it does not provide support for <em>Estes\u2019s </em>apparent conclusion that the immediate presence element can be satisfied during the asporting or carrying away of property. Based on the same reasoning, <em>People </em>v. <em>Kent </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 207 [178 Cal.Rptr. 28], also cited by <em>Estes, </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
