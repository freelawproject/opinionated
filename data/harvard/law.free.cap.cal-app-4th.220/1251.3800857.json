J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMn\">Defendant Douglas Harold Doyle was previously convicted of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (driving under the influence (DUI) manslaughter). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a).) The conviction in this case was for another DUI offense. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (b).) His current DUI was elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony because of the prior DUI manslaughter (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23550.5, subd. (b)), and he was sentenced under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law to 25 years to life in state prison with the prior DUI manslaughter as one of his strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">On appeal, defendant contends that it was illegal to use the prior DUI manslaughter conviction both to elevate the current DUI to a felony and to serve as a strike. To the contrary, the statutory scheme authorizes both uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">Defendant also contends that use of the prior DUI manslaughter conviction both to elevate the current DUI to a felony and to serve as a strike violates equal protection guarantees because the statute elevating the current DUI to a felony as a result of the DUI manslaughter does not also elevate a current DUI to a felony if the offender, instead, has a prior conviction for second degree murder while driving intoxicated. This argument is unpersuasive because DUI offenders with prior DUI manslaughter convictions and those with prior second degree murder convictions are not similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">Because neither these nor any other of defendant\u2019s arguments has merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Under the influence of valium, cocaine, and alcohol, defendant nonetheless got behind the wheel of his van in December 1987. Going southbound on Highway 89, defendant sped around a blind curve in the oncoming lane to pass cars in his own lane. He hit an oncoming car head on, killing the driver of the oncoming car. As a result, in 1988, he pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">The 1988 DUI manslaughter conviction was not defendant\u2019s first brush with the law, and it would not be his last. Most seriously, defendant was convicted of spousal abuse in 1996 and assault with a deadly weapon in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">In August 2008, defendant again drove drunk on Highway 89, this time northbound, and again he passed on a blind curve. Fortunately, defendant did not cause another collision, and, again fortunately, a sheriff\u2019s deputy saw the unsafe driving and stopped defendant. After observing that defendant was drunk, the deputy arrested defendant for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">The district attorney charged defendant by information with felony DUI, with a prior DUI manslaughter. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 23152, subds. (a) &amp; (b), 23550.5, subd. (b).) The district attorney also alleged that defendant had two prior strike convictions (the 1988 DUI manslaughter conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5) and the 2007 assault with a deadly weapon conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245)) and had four prior prison terms (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">Defendant pleaded guilty to felony DUI,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with a prior DUI manslaughter. He also admitted the prior serious felony convictions and prison terms. He did so with the understanding that this exposed him to a potential sentence of 29 years to life under the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">The trial court considered and denied a Romero<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion to strike one or both of the prior serious felony convictions. The court sentenced defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>under the Three Strikes law to state prison for an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. It stayed the prior prison term enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">\n<em>Use of Prior DUI Manslaughter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"pAbU\">A DUI\u2014violation of Vehicle Code section 23152\u2014is normally a misdemeanor. However, if the defendant has a prior DUI manslaughter conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5), the DUI may be charged as a felony, as was the case here. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23550.5; <em>People v. Baez </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 197, 199 [83 Cal.Rptr.3d 895].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Defendant contends that his prior DUI manslaughter conviction cannot be used twice to (1) elevate his current DUI to a felony and (2) impose Three Strikes sentencing. To the contrary, the applicable statutes and precedents allow both uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">We look first to the legislative intent and discern no indication that the Legislature intended to preclude the use of a prior DUI manslaughter both to elevate a DUI to a felony and to serve as a strike. We then turn to defendant\u2019s arguments for limiting such use and find them unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">A. <em>Legislative Intent and Case Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">The fundamental goal of statutory construction is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. We begin with the ordinary and usual meaning of the language the Legislature used, and we do not alter that meaning if it is clear. We resort to extrinsic aids to understand the Legislature\u2019s intent only if the Legislature\u2019s language can reasonably be interpreted more than one way. <em>(People v. Cornett </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 837, 274 P.3d 456].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">Applying these fundamental canons of statutory constmction, we examine the applicable statutes to determine whether they evince any legislative intent to preclude the use of a prior DUI manslaughter both to elevate a DUI to a felony and to serve as a strike.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We discern no such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>In 1994, the Three Strikes law was enacted by both the Legislature and the voters in nearly identical form. (Stats. 1994, ch. 12, \u00a7 1, p. 71, eff. Mar. 7, 1994; Prop. 184, eff. Nov. 9, 1994.) Under this law, a person who commits a felony and has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies is sentenced to a longer state prison term. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (b).) The term for such a person with one prior serious or violent felony is twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony. The term for such a person with two or more prior serious or violent felonies, as applicable to this case, is an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">There is no dispute in this case that defendant\u2019s 1988 DUI manslaughter conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a)) and 2007 assault with a deadly weapon conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245) were for serious or violent felonies under the Three Strikes law. Defendant admitted the district attorney\u2019s allegation that they were strikes under the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">In 1997, the Legislature enacted a statute making it a felony or misdemeanor (a \u201cwobbler\u201d) if a person committed a DUI with a prior DUI manslaughter. (Stats. 1997, ch. 901, \u00a7 6, p. 6488.) That statute became Vehicle Code section 23550.5 in 1999. (Stats. 1998, ch. 118, \u00a7 84, pp. 772, 784.) Subdivision (b) of Vehicle Code section 23550.5 states: \u201cEach person who, having previously been convicted of a violation of subdivision (a) of Section 191.5 of the Penal Code [(DUI manslaughter)], ... is subsequently convicted of a violation of [Vehicle Code] Section 23152 [(DUI)] ... is guilty of a public offense punishable by imprisonment in the state prison [(a felony)] or confinement in a county jail for not more than one year [(a misdemeanor)] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">In this case, the district attorney prosecuted the current DUI offense as a felony under Vehicle Code section 23550.5, subdivision (b), and defendant pleaded guilty to that charge. Therefore, he was convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">At sentencing, the trial court applied the Three Strikes law to defendant\u2019s felony sentencing, which is required under Penal Code section 667, subdivision (e). The introductory language of that subdivision states that the Three Strikes sentencing scheme applies \u201cin addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (e).) Because defendant was convicted of a felony and had two prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>serious or violent felony convictions, the trial court sentenced him to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">This was a faithful application of the ordinary and usual meaning of the applicable statutes. Nothing in the language of the statutes evinces a legislative intent to impose the Three Strikes law differently. To the contrary, the Three Strikes law is meant \u201cto ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of . . . serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (b).) Accordingly, we must uphold the sentence imposed unless defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal establish that the sentence was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Before turning to defendant\u2019s arguments, however, we discuss the case most similar to the circumstances of this case. That case is <em>People </em>v. <em>White Eagle </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1511 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 749] <em>(White Eagle). </em>In <em>White Eagle, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to petty theft with a prior robbery and admitted the prior robbery conviction, which is a serious or violent felony under the Three Strikes law. (48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1515.) Normally, petty theft is a misdemeanor, but the prior robbery conviction made the petty theft conviction a wobbler. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 666, subd. (a).) Applying the Three Strikes law because of the defendant\u2019s prior robbery conviction, the trial court treated the petty theft as a felony and sentenced the defendant to six years in state prison, which is double the aggravated term. <em>(White Eagle, supra, </em>at p. 1515; see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 666, subd. (a), 667, subd. (e)(1), 1170, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">On appeal, the <em>White Eagle </em>court considered \u201cwhether the same 1981 robbery conviction can be used: (1) to convert the current offense to a felony under [Penal Code] section 666 [and] (2) to invoke the punishment provisions of [Penal Code] section 667, subdivision (e)(1) . . . .\u201d <em>(White Eagle, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1516.) The court concluded that the prior conviction could be used for both. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1517-1518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">The <em>White Eagle </em>court reasoned: \u201cThe drafters of the Three Strikes law have clearly provided that its punishment provisions apply \u2018in addition to any other <em>enhancement or punishment provisions </em>which may apply.\u2019 ([Pen. Code,] \u00a7 667, subd. (e), italics added.) Applying the sentencing provisions of the Three Strikes law to the term of imprisonment provided by [Penal Code] section 666 is not only consistent with the stated legislative and initiative goals of ensuring longer prison sentences and greater punishment for repeat offenders, it is provided for by the express terms of the statute. ([Pen. Code,] \u00a7 667, subd. (b).)\u201d <em>(White Eagle, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\"><em>White Eagle </em>is on all fours with this case concerning using a prior conviction both to elevate the current offense to a felony and to serve as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>strike under the Three Strikes law. Despite this obvious similarity of <em>White Eagle </em>to this case, however, defendant did not cite or discuss <em>White Eagle </em>in his opening brief. In his reply brief, he claims that <em>White Eagle </em>is distinguishable based on the cases cited in his opening brief. Although we note that, by ignoring <em>White Eagle </em>until his reply brief, defendant effectively prevented the Attorney General from submitting a brief concerning defendant\u2019s arguments that <em>White Eagle </em>is distinguishable, we exercise our discretion to consider defendant\u2019s arguments. (See <em>Jameson v. Desta </em>(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 672, 674, fa. 1 [101 Cal.Rptr.3d 345] [appellate court may exercise discretion to consider points not raised in opening brief].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">While <em>White Eagle </em>is similar to this case because the same prior conviction was used both to elevate the current offense to a felony and to impose Three Strikes sentencing, another case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232] <em>{Coronado), </em>is also similar to this case, but for a different reason. It determined that the Legislature intended to allow use of prior DUI convictions both to elevate the current offense to a felony and to impose prior prison term enhancements under Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b), for prison terms served as a result of the prior DUI convictions. The court said: \u201cWe hold here that the use of a prior conviction and resulting prison term for elevation and enhancement purposes is consistent with the <em>legislative </em>intent. . . .\u201d (12 Cal.4th at p. 149, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Considered together, <em>White Eagle </em>and <em>Coronado </em>support application of the Legislature\u2019s express intent to impose Three Strikes sentencing in this case \u201cin addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (e)), \u201cto ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of . . . serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">Finally, defendant urges that, to avoid serious constitutional questions, we must adopt an interpretation of the relevant statutes prohibiting the use of the prior DUI manslaughter both to elevate the current offense to a felony and to serve as a strike. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Engram </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 1131, 1161 [116 Cal.Rptr.3d 762, 240 P.3d 237].) Elsewhere in his brief, defendant makes arguments that the sentence is cruel and unusual and violates double jeopardy. Therefore, he reasons, those questions can be avoided with his preferred interpretation of the statutes. This line of argument is without merit because (1) despite defendant\u2019s constitutional claims, there is no serious question concerning the constitutionality of defendant\u2019s sentence and (2) his preferred interpretation is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s express intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Defendant makes four arguments, relying on four cases, that the Legislature could not use the prior DUI manslaughter both to elevate the current offense to a felony and to serve as a strike. The four cases are (1) <em>People </em>v. <em>Briceno </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 451 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 418, 99 P.3d 1007] <em>(Briceno)-, </em>(2) <em>In re Shull </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 745 [146 P.2d 417] <em>(Shull), </em>superseded by statute on another issue as stated in <em>People v. Read </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 900, 904 [191 Cal.Rptr. 305]; (3) <em>People v. Jones </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 857 P.2d 1163] <em>(Jones)-, </em>and (4) <em>People v. Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580] <em>(Ireland).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">1. <em>Briceno</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Relying on <em>Briceno, </em>defendant contends that the trial court engaged in \u201c \u2018impermissible bootstrapping.\u2019 \u201d We conclude <em>that, </em>because defendant is not in this regard arguing a constitutional limitation on the Legislature\u2019s power, what the statutes allow is permissible if the Legislature intended to permit it. Here, as we have stated, the Legislature intended to allow use of the prior DUI manslaughter both to elevate the offense to a felony and to serve as a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">In <em>Briceno, </em>a jury convicted the defendant of four counts of robbery and found true the allegation that the robberies were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. The court found true two prior serious felony convictions and sentenced the defendant under the Three Strikes law. <em>(Briceno, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at pp. 456-457.) As relevant here, the Supreme Court in <em>Briceno </em>considered the relationship of (1) Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(28), which turns any <em>prior </em>felony conviction into a serious felony conviction for the purpose of the Three Strikes law if the prior offense was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, and (2) Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(A), which provides for a sentence enhancement for a <em>current </em>felony, other than a serious or violent felony. The Court of Appeal had problems defining this relationship because it believed both provisions applied to the <em>prior </em>felony conviction. The Supreme Court, however, focusing on legislative intent (in that case, voters\u2019 intent because it was an initiative) (34 Cal.4th at p. 459), found that there is no conflict because Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(28) applies to <em>prior </em>convictions and Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(A) applies to <em>current </em>offenses. (34 Cal.4th at pp. 464-465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">Having resolved the issue by determining the voters\u2019 intent, the <em>Briceno </em>court added: \u201cNot only does this interpretation give meaning to [Penal Code] section 186.22[, subdivision] (b)(1)(A), (B), and (C), it also avoids the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>impermissible bootstrapping that would occur if any felony that is gang related is also deemed serious in the current proceeding. Specifically, while it is proper to define any felony committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang as a serious felony under [Penal Code] section 1192.7 [, subdivision] (c)(28), it is improper to use the <em>same </em>gang-related conduct <em>again </em>to obtain an additional five-year sentence under [Penal Code] section 186.22[, subdivision] (b)(1)(B).\u201d <em>(Briceno, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 465, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Defendant relies on this \u201cimpermissible bootstrapping\u201d language to argue that, here, the prior DUI manslaughter conviction cannot be used both to elevate the current offense to a felony and to serve as a strike. The argument is without merit because the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cimpermissible bootstrapping\u201d language referred to a manifest voter intent not to allow such use. The court stated: \u201c[Although [Penal Code] section 1192.7[, subdivision] (c)(28) turns any prior gang-related felony offense into a strike if a defendant reoffends, nothing in Proposition 21 or in its stated purposes suggests an intention of the voters to bootstrap, in the same proceeding, any felony offense committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang into a [Penal Code] section 186.22[, subdivision] (b)(1)(B) [(serious felony)] offense \u2018as a means of applying a double dose of harsher punishment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Briceno, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 465.) In other words, bootstrapping was not permissible because the voters did not intend to permit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">As we have noted, the statutes involved in this case do not evince a legislative intent to preclude use of a prior DUI manslaughter both to elevate the offense to a felony and to serve as a strike. Therefore, the \u201cimpermissible bootstrapping\u201d language of <em>Briceno </em>is wholly inapplicable. Indeed, there is no abstract antibootstrapping principle. Instead, it is a matter of legislative intent. If the Legislature intended to allow it, it is allowed. The <em>Briceno </em>court did not resort to any constitutional principle limiting the power of the Legislature in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">2. <em>Shull</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Likewise, the second case relied on by defendant involved a question of legislative intent. In <em>Shull, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the Legislature intended to add a five-year enhancement for use of a pistol to a sentence of 10 years for assault with a pistol. <em>(Shull, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d at pp. 747-749.) It concluded: \u201cWe do not believe . . . that the Legislature intended that [the pistol-use enhancement] should be applied where the felony of which the person stands convicted is that of assault with a pistol. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 749.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>The <em>Shull </em>court determined that the Legislature did not intend to add the sentencing enhancement for pistol use to the sentence for assault with a pistol. It said: \u201cBriefly, the Legislature has fixed the punishment for an assault where a deadly weapon is used, a particular crime, and it is not to be supposed that for the same offense without any additional factor existing the added punishment should be imposed.\u201d <em>(Shull, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d at p. 751.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">While the Legislature may have implicitly intended not to impose the gun-use enhancement when the defendant was convicted of assault with a pistol, as stated in <em>Shull, </em>the Legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the Three Strikes law is explicit. It requires application of the Three Strikes law \u201cin addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (e).) Therefore, the <em>Shull </em>court\u2019s opinion as to the Legislature\u2019s implicit intent there has no bearing on this case, in which the Legislature\u2019s intent is stated in the statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 666, 671-672 [102 Cal.Rptr. 776, 498 P.2d 1024] [noting that, since <em>Shull, </em>the Legislature has left no doubt concerning additional punishment when use of a weapon is also an element of the offense].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">3. <em>Jones</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">In <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court determined that, under the statutes then effective, the Legislature did not intend to impose two cumulative enhancements for the same prior kidnapping conviction. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 1149-1152.) Again, <em>Jones </em>dealt with legislative intent, which we have already discussed with respect to the statutes applicable to this case. Furthermore, <em>White Eagle, </em>which defendant ignored in his opening brief, found <em>Jones </em>distinguishable because of the clear intent expressed in the Three Strikes law to impose Three Strikes sentencing in addition to other punishment provisions. <em>(White Eagle, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1517-1518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">4. <em>Ireland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Finally, defendant relies on <em>Ireland </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent application of <em>Ireland\u2019s </em>second degree felony-murder merger doctrine in <em>People </em>v. <em>Chun </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425] <em>(Chun). </em>In <em>Ireland, </em>the court held that assault \u201cmerges\u201d with homicide so that assault cannot be the underlying felony used to support second degree felony murder. <em>(Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at pp. 539-540.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">Defendant quotes this excerpt from <em>Ireland-. </em>\u201cTo allow such use of the felony-murder rule would effectively preclude the jury from considering the issue of malice aforethought in all cases wherein homicide has been committed as a result of a felonious assault\u2014a category which includes the great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>majority of all homicides. This kind of bootstrapping finds support neither in logic nor in law. We therefore hold that a second degree felony-murder instruction may not properly be given when it is based upon a felony which is an integral part of the homicide and which the evidence produced by the prosecution shows to be an offense included in fact within the offense charged.\u201d <em>(Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at p. 539, italics &amp; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">While this may sound like an abstract antibootstrapping principle unhinged from the Legislature\u2019s intent, the majority in <em>Chun </em>held that the merger rule is consistent with the <em>purpose </em>of the second degree felony-murder rule, which the court took great pains to establish is a statutory rule. <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at pp. 1183-1188 [second degree felony murder is statutory], 1198-1200 [merger doctrine is consistent with purpose of second degree felony murder].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">As the merger rule is so specific to the homicide doctrines discussed in <em>Ireland </em>and <em>Chun, </em>there can be no persuasive argument that the merger rule applies here. Trying to make an argument, defendant merely states that <em>Ireland </em>prohibits \u201cbootstrapping,\u201d but his statement has no persuasive effect on our interpretation of the statutes applicable to this case, which are dissimilar to substantive homicide doctrines. Therefore, <em>Ireland </em>does not support defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">Defendant contends that the Three Strikes sentence violates his equal protection rights under the federal and state Constitutions. He argues that the Legislature\u2019s scheme for elevating DUI offenses to felonies with potential Three Strikes sentencing because of the offender\u2019s prior DUI manslaughter conviction fails constitutional scrutiny because other DUI offenders with more egregious prior crimes (such as murder) are convicted only of misdemeanors for their current DUI offenses and are not subject to Three Strikes sentencing. The contention is without merit because DUI offenders with prior DUI manslaughter convictions are not similarly situated with DUI offenders who have prior convictions other than for DUI manslaughter. Based on this equal protection argument, defendant also claims the different treatment violates his due process rights and right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. These separate claims are both without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">A. <em>Not Similarly Situated</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">Equal protection under the state and federal Constitutions requires that persons similarly situated must receive like treatment under the law. <em>(In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number><em>Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 531 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549].) Therefore, \u201c[t]he first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 530, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">While defendant mentions several hypothetical prior convictions for unrelated crimes (such as rape, child molestation, and robbery), he focuses on comparing punishment when a defendant has a prior conviction for a drunk driving second degree murder and, as here, another defendant has a prior conviction for a DUI manslaughter. Following his lead, we focus on that comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">A DUI manslaughter is committed when a drunk driver, without malice, kills someone. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a).) The punishment for the offense is four, six, or 10 years in state prison. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (c)(1).) If the intoxicated killer drove while aware of the risk to life and consciously disregarded that risk, then the killer committed second degree murder (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279] <em>(Watson)), </em>a <em>Watson </em>murder. Punishment for second degree murder is 15 years to life in state prison. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190, subd. (a).) DUI manslaughter is not a lesser included offense of a <em>Watson </em>murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 983, 990-992 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 16 P.3d 118].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Defendant ignores this significant difference in sentencing between a determinate term for DUI manslaughter and an indeterminate term\u2014a life sentence\u2014for a <em>Watson </em>murder. Instead, he cites only the differences in how prior convictions for these crimes are treated. He notes that, because he has a prior DUI manslaughter conviction, his current DUI is elevated to a felony DUI and subjects him to Three Strikes sentencing. In comparison, a DUI offender with a prior <em>Watson </em>murder is guilty of a misdemeanor only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">We recognize that the two schemes are very different. A <em>Watson </em>murder is punished much more severely upon conviction, but does not result in felony status or a longer sentence if the offender commits a later DUI. On the other hand, a DUI manslaughter is punished with a shorter determinate sentence, but can be used to impose much longer incarceration if the offender later commits a DUI. As we explain, this different treatment is the result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>rational legislative choices rather than being unconstitutional disparate treatment because DUI offenders with a prior DUI manslaughter conviction are not similarly situated with DUI offenders with a prior <em>Watson </em>murder conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Generally, offenders who commit different crimes are not similarly situated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Macias </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 465, 472-473 [187 Cal.Rptr. 100].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697], the Supreme Court rejected an equal protection challenge to the felony-murder rule simply by observing that premeditated first degree murder and felony murder are \u201cnot the \u2018same\u2019 crime[].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476, fn. 23; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 797, 803-804 [204 Cal.Rptr. 234].) Therefore, a DUI offender with a prior DUI manslaughter conviction is not similarly situated with a DUI offender with a prior <em>Watson </em>murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">But there may be times when the general rule does not apply, when offenders who commit different crimes <em>are </em>similarly situated. <em>(People v. Hofsheier </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1185, 1199-1200 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 821, 129 P.3d 29] <em>(Hofsheier).) </em>The <em>Hofsheier </em>court held that offenders who commit different crimes are similarly situated for equal protection analysis when the crimes are not sufficiently different to justify different treatment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">In <em>Hofsheier, </em>the court considered mandatory sex offender registration. State law required adults convicted of voluntary <em>oral copulation </em>with a minor 16 years or older to register for life as a sex offender; however, state law did not require adults convicted of voluntary <em>sexual intercourse </em>with a minor 16 years or older to register unless the trial court exercised its discretion to require registration. <em>(Hofsheier, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1198.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">The <em>Hofsheier </em>court held that the general rule (offenders who commit different crimes are not similarly situated) cannot be an absolute rule \u201cbecause the decision of the Legislature to distinguish between similar criminal acts is itself a decision subject to equal protection scrutiny.\u201d <em>(Hofsheier, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1199, fn. omitted.) The equal protection clause \u201c \u2018imposes a requirement of some rationality in the nature of the class singled out.\u2019 [Citations.] Otherwise, the state could arbitrarily discriminate between similarly situated persons simply by classifying their conduct under different criminal statutes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>Turning to its own facts, the <em>Hofsheier </em>court declared: \u201cThe only difference between the two offenses is the nature of the sexual act. Thus, persons convicted of oral copulation with minors and persons convicted of sexual intercourse with minors \u2018are sufficiently similar to merit application of some level of scrutiny to determine whether distinctions between the two groups justify the unequal treatment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hofsheier, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">While the Supreme Court has not provided a bright-line rule for when those committing different crimes must be treated similarly, there can be no doubt that those who are convicted of a manslaughter can be treated differently from murderers. Specifically, DUI manslaughter and a <em>Watson </em>murder are not sufficiently similar to require similar treatment. A DUI manslaughter is committed by causing a death, without malice, while driving under the influence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a).) A <em>Watson </em>murder, on the other hand, requires implied malice. <em>(Watson, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 290.) Implied malice has both physical and mental components, \u201cthe physical component being \u2018 \u201cthe performance of \u2018an act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life,\u2019 \u201d \u2019 and the mental component being \u2018 \u201cthe requirement that the defendant \u2018knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and . . . acts with a conscious disregard for life.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cravens </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 500, 508 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 40, 267 P.3d 1113].) The critical difference between a DUI manslaughter and a <em>Watson </em>murder is the mental component: malice or conscious disregard for the life of another. A <em>Watson </em>murder, therefore, is more morally blameworthy than DUI manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">\u201cThe appropriate measure for punishment is individual culpability. [Citation.] It is the prerogative of the Legislature, and the electorate by initiative, to recognize degrees of culpability and penalize accordingly. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 804, fin. omitted.) And \u201c[t]he fact that the Legislature has not included a small class of almost similarly situated persons in the disfavored class does not invalidate the legislation as to the disfavored class. There is no requirement that the Legislature penalize all culpable conduct or precisely structure penal sanctions so that all degrees of culpability are omnisciently placed in their proper place in some continuum of penalties.\u201d <em>(In re Sims </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 309, 314, fn. 1 [172 Cal.Rptr. 608].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Therefore, because a DUI manslaughter and a <em>Watson </em>murder are so different as to culpability, the Legislature\u2019s different treatment of DUI offenders with prior convictions for DUI manslaughter or a <em>Watson </em>murder is permissible under the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">Defendant argues that the disparate treatment does not pass constitutional muster because, in his view, a person convicted of DUI manslaughter is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>treated more harshly than a person convicted of a <em>Watson </em>murder, even though the <em>Watson </em>murder is more blameworthy morally. He bases his view completely on the later effect of convictions for DUI manslaughter and a <em>Watson </em>murder when the offender commits a new DUI. However, this view can be sustained only if one ignores the difference in original sentencing for offenders convicted of DUI manslaughter (a determinate term of no more than 10 years (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (c)(1)), plus up to three years of parole (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3000, subd. (b)(2)) and a <em>Watson </em>murder (an indeterminate term of up to life (Pen. Code, 190, subd. (a)), plus parole for life after release (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3000.1, subd. (a)(1)). This difference can be attributed simply to the Legislature\u2019s determination to punish murderers more harshly up front and to be more lenient with those convicted of manslaughter, while providing for harsher punishment for those convicted of manslaughter if they later commit a crime that shows they have not reformed. There is \u201c \u2018some rationality\u2019 \u201d in this distinction. <em>(Hofsheier, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1199.) Therefore, for equal protection analysis, DUI offenders with a prior DUI manslaughter conviction are not similarly situated with DUI offenders with a prior <em>Watson </em>murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">Having determined that defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive as to the first prong of equal protection analysis, we need not consider the second prong\u2014whether governmental interests justify disparate treatment\u2014because there is no requirement that persons in different circumstances must be treated as if their situations were similar. (See <em>Hofsheier, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">B. <em>Due Process and Cruel and Unusual Punishment Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">Again ignoring the significant difference in original sentencing of an offender convicted of a <em>Watson </em>murder (15 years to life) and DUI manslaughter (four, six, or 10 years), defendant claims that the later use of the DUI manslaughter conviction to elevate a DUI to a felony and to impose Three Strikes sentencing violates (1) his right not to be subjected to cruel or unusual punishment and (2) his substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">1. <em>Cruel or Unusual Punishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Punishing a lesser included offense more severely than the greater offense is unusual punishment under the state Constitution. <em>(People v. Schueren </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 553, 560-561 [111 Cal.Rptr. 129, 516 P.2d 833].) This principle, however, does not help defendant for two reasons: (1) DUI manslaughter is not a lesser included offense of a <em>Watson </em>murder <em>(People v. Sanchez, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 990-992) and (2) a <em>Watson </em>murder carries a more severe sentence, along with lifetime parole, which could be violated for committing a misdemeanor DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>2. <em>Substantive Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Finally, defendant asserts that the treatment of prior DUI manslaughter convictions, as compared to prior <em>Watson </em>murder convictions, is arbitrary and therefore violates his substantive due process rights. We need not consider the authorities defendant cites in support of this proposition because its premise fails: as we explained, there is \u201csome rationality\u201d in the way the law treats those who commit DUI manslaughters, as opposed to those who commit <em>Watson </em>murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">III-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">Mauro, J., and Murray, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 21, 2013, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 11, 2014, S215116.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-12\"><em> </em>More specifically, defendant pleaded guilty to driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent or more.
