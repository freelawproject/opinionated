(mother), appeal from the trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the County of Orange, its social services agency (SSA), and several of SSA\u2019s social workers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs complain the trial court erred in concluding public employee immunity (Gov. Code, \u00a7 820.2) barred their claims arising from SSA\u2019s decision to remove 10-year-old C.C. from mother\u2019s care and place him with father, only to return C.C. to his mother when he fared poorly in father\u2019s care. As we explain, plaintiffs\u2019 claims for reversal have no merit, and we therefore affirm the judgment. In the published portion of the opinion, we explain that social workers do not ordinarily bear liability for a juvenile court\u2019s erroneous delegation of authority and that the scope of Government Code section 820.21\u2019s malice exception to social workers\u2019 general immunity from lawsuits is limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-12\">Mother and father married in 1998, the year C.C. was bom, but rarely resided together and divorced in 2000 when C.C. was almost two years old. According to mother, she received primary physical custody of C.C. After a four-year period of contentious battles with father, marked by multiple interventions by SSA social workers amidst mother\u2019s declining mental health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>the family court ordered an Evidence Code section 730 study in which the evaluator concluded mother suffered from cognitive impairments and poor boundaries that affected her ability to safely parent C.C. The family court agreed and vested father with exclusive legal and physical custody in June 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Four years later in October 2008, when C.C. was almost 10 years old, father was arrested on charges of attempted rape for furnishing his live-in maid with ice cream containing benzodiazepine, a powerful sleeping medication. The charges also included illegal firearm possession by a felon. According to mother, she and C.C. had both tested positive for benzodiazepine at the time of his birth though she was not taking any sleeping medication. She also pegged her mental and emotional decline to one or more encounters with father in 2001 and earlier in which she now believed he had drugged and raped her. She had unsuccessfully sought a restraining order against him in 2001. The prosecutor in the current criminal action involving the maid added charges against father for rape using drugs and rape of an unconscious person based on mother\u2019s allegations dating to a March 2001 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">Meanwhile, SSA had detained C.C. at Orangewood Children\u2019s Home when father was arrested. The police interviewed mother at or near the time of father\u2019s arrest, but did not release C.C. to her care because she was not entitled to custody under the family court\u2019s order and, moreover, the officer and a police-affiliated victim advocate observed \u201ccurrent indicators that the mother might not be considered fit to parent at this time.\u201d For example, mother \u201cappeared delusional, with delusions of persecution and religious affiliation,\u201d she \u201creported to have seen ghosts,\u201d and the officer \u201calso questioned the mother\u2019s ability to make appropriate choices\u201d given she stayed with father more than three years despite claiming she was \u201crepeatedly raped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">SSA also interviewed mother. She explained to a social worker she was conscious during and tolerated father\u2019s sex acts against her because \u201c \u2018no one believed me,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018he convinced me,\u2019 \u201d and because she previously had been abused and neglected, including by her father. Mother diagnosed herself \u201cas suffering from PTSD [(posttraumatic stress disorder)], with an \u2018ongoing affect.\u2019 \u201d The ghosts she had seen on her property had \u201cbeen recorded and verified as authentic.\u201d She now supported herself \u201cthrough playing cards,\u201d stated she kept a \u201cvery stable and clean home,\u201d and according to the social worker\u2019s report, \u201cmother repeatedly argue[d] these points over and over again, insisting she is a capable parent and that her son should immediately be placed with her.\u201d When the worker \u201csuggested that a more recent psychological evaluation might be necessary to assess this very issue, the mother appeared very resistant to the process.\u201d SSA did not immediately place C.C. with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>Instead, the dependency court at C.C.\u2019s detention hearing in October 2008 ordered monitored visitation for mother and father at SSA\u2019s offices. The court vested SSA with discretion to \u201clift/reinstate monitor ... for mother and father\u201d and to liberalize parental visitation. Mother subsequently provided SSA with a mental health evaluation prepared by a nurse practitioner associated with a psychiatrist. The nurse practitioner disagreed with a previous bipolar disorder diagnosis for mother, explaining she \u201cdid not note any delusional thinking, paranoia, psychotic processes, tangential thinking, or memory impairment,\u201d nor any need for medication. The nurse concluded mother \u201cdoes not appear to have any symptomology that would interfere with her role as a mother or for the care of her son.\u201d Mother\u2019s court-appointed therapist and her personal counselor similarly agreed the court should return C.C. to her care on grounds that mother had never abused him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Visits SSA arranged for C.C. with his maternal grandfather in Laguna Beach had gone well, but the grandfather could not care for C.C. alone because of his age and ill health. Mother, however, agreed to move in with her father, and SSA concluded that a \u201ccombined household like this,\u201d which included the grandfather\u2019s live-in housekeeper, would \u201cbe safe[] for the child and would provide more supervision in the home.\u201d SSA recommended the home placement under a Conditional Release to Intensive Supervision Program (CRISP) agreement that mother signed, which included 15 specific conditions mother assented to in the release. The conditions included the following: \u201cI will continue to attend therapy twice a week,\u201d \u201cI will facilitate visits between the child and his father and will not speak negatively of the father in the child\u2019s presence,\u201d \u201cI understand [the] frequency of visits will be determined by the CRISP worker,\u201d and \u201cI shall obey any reasonable directions of my CRISP [w]orker regarding the care of the child in my custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">The dependency court endorsed the CRISP agreement at a January 2009 hearing, and further ordered the \u201cchild may be redetained if it <em>appears </em>[the] terms and conditions of the CRISP release agreement are violated or [the] child is at risk\u201d (italics added) and that \u201c[a]ll prior orders . . . remained] in full force and effect.\u201d SSA placed C.C. with mother in grandfather\u2019s home on January 8, 2009. According to SSA, mother had difficulty from the outset abiding by the terms of the agreement, including the requirement to attend counseling therapy twice a week and to refrain from speaking negatively of father in front of the child, who complained to his therapist that mother pressured him to join in her criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">Meanwhile, according to SSA, father\u2019s visits were positive and the agency considered dispensing with a monitor. Mother opposed allowing father unmonitored visitation, but had not attended the hearing. According to SSA social worker Jennifer Marks, when she telephoned mother to advise her what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>occurred and that SSA planned to allow unmonitored visitation with father, mother refused to cooperate. Marks explained her refusal put her in violation of the CRISP agreement and C.C. would be redetained, but mother remained steadfast. According to mother, she did not expressly refuse to transport C.C. to any future visits with father, and instead simply voiced her concern about unmonitored visitation and asked Marks to contact mother\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">C.C. happened to be on a monitored visit with father and, after hanging up with mother, Marks arranged for C.C. to be redetained and placed in father\u2019s care without a monitor. She then telephoned mother to notify her she need not pick up C.C. from the monitored visit at father\u2019s home that day. After several continuances into May 2009, the dependency court ratified SSA\u2019s decision to redetain C.C. and place him with father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">C.C. remained in father\u2019s care for approximately 13 months until, in March 2010, SSA redetained him and filed a supplemental dependency petition on grounds of general neglect, educational neglect, and concerns father exposed C.C. to pornographic magazines, videos, and violent computer games. Father had not complied with his case plan requirement to ensure C.C.\u2019s attendance at school; C.C. also often fell asleep in class, did not turn in his homework, and mother and C.C.\u2019s previous therapist reported he appeared preoccupied with sexual and violent themes. SSA immediately placed C.C. in mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">Father pleaded guilty in November 2010 to one count of poisoning his maid with benzodiazepine and a felon-in-possession firearm charge, and the juvenile court closed the dependency proceedings with exit orders awarding mother sole physical and legal custody of C.C., with monitored visitation for father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">Mother filed this civil action in January 2011 on her behalf and on behalf of C.C. as her minor child, alleging SSA and its social workers violated their civil rights. Specifically, the complaint alleged three \u201cCounts\u201d against defendants: (1) <em>\u201cMonell </em>Related Claims\u201d; (2) \u201cViolation of State Civil Rights\u201d under Civil Code sections 43, 49, 51, and 52.1; and (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>Defendants moved in June 2012 for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The trial court granted summary judgment. The court explained that, based on the dependency court\u2019s orders vesting discretion with SSA over C.C.\u2019s placement and visitation, with express authorization to redetain him under the CRISP release, \u201c[t]he acts or omissions complained of appear to be within defendants\u2019 granted authority.\u201d The court held that under the immunity afforded social workers in Government Code section 820.2, \u201cit is irrelevant whether defendants were correct in their decisions or even whether they abused their discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">The court observed, \u201cThe [summary judgment] opposition essentially summarizes father\u2019s shortcomings and explains why the government was wrong to take custody from [mother],\u201d but \u201c[i]t does not even address the issue of immunity\u2014the heart of defendants\u2019 motion\u2014until page 24, wherein plaintiffs briefly argue immunities do not apply here because defendants acted with malice.\u201d The court noted, however, that \u201cplaintiffs fail to cite, in their papers, any evidence supporting a possible finding of malice on the part of any of the defendants.\u201d The court acknowledged that at the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \u201cadvanced the theory that social worker Marks maliciously terminated the CRISP release to [m]other and changed custody to [fjather to \u2018punish\u2019 [m]other because she had the temerity to challenge the social worker\u2019s decision to grant unmonitored visits.\u201d But the court observed that the arguments of counsel are not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">The court found no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 invocation of seminal dependency civil rights cases like <em>Santosky v. Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745 [71 L.Ed.2d 599, 102 S.Ct. 1388]. The court explained: \u201cAlthough not clear, in citing these cases [] plaintiffs appear to argue defendants lacked authority to take custody away from [mother]. But none of the cases cited support this contention here and plaintiffs ignore that the Juvenile Court expressly granted such authority to the defendants. And to the extent plaintiffs argue the court had no authority to do so, such was not a theory pled in the [c]omplaint, which frames a summary judgment motion.\u201d The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">A. <em>General Summary Judgment Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">Facts are the lifeblood of summary judgment proceedings because absent a factual dispute, trial is unnecessary. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] <em>(Aguilar) </em>[\u201cThe purpose of the law of summary judgment is to . . . cut through the parties\u2019 pleadings ... to determine whether . . . trial is in fact necessary . . . .\u201d].) We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. \u201cIn practical effect, we assume the role of a trial court and apply the same rules and standards which govern a trial court\u2019s determination of a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>(Zavala </em>v. <em>Arce </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 915, 925 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 571].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">A motion for summary judgment should be granted if the submitted papers show that \u201cthere is no triable issue as to any material fact,\u201d and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) A defendant meets her burden of showing a cause of action has no merit if she shows that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established, \u201cor that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">If the moving party carries that burden, she \u201ccauses a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.\u201d <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 850.) A triable issue of material fact exists \u201c \u2018if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, a party \u2018cannot avoid summary judgment by asserting facts based on mere speculation and conjecture, but instead must produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dollinger DeAnza Associates </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. </em>(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1144-1145 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 596] <em>(Dollinger).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">B. <em>Plaintiffs Forfeit Their Appellate Challenge to the Summary Judgment Ruling</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>C. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims Also Fail on the Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Plaintiffs claim their \u201ccivil case boils down, in large part, to the reason(s) for why the Department of Social Services removed C.C. from his mother\u2019s care on February 10, 2009.\u201d (Original boldface.) They dispute Marks\u2019s explanation the placement failed because mother violated the CRISP agreement\u2019s express terms, including CRISP condition 9(b): \u201cI will continue to attend therapy twice a week\u201d and CRISP condition 9(d): \u201cI will facilitate visits between the child and his father . . . .\u201d Plaintiffs claim instead that SSA removed C.C. simply \u201cout of arrogance, and to punish [mother] when [she] asserted a contrary position [regarding paternal visits]\u201d and \u201cfor financial reasons, due to department cutbacks\u201d precluding a monitor for father\u2019s visits. Plaintiffs assert: \u201cThe reasons for the removal of C.C. from [mother]\u2019s legitimate custody is at issue and needs to be decided by the trier of fact in the civil case.\u201d We disagree. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument for reversal fails for at least four reasons. First, they provided no evidence the true reasons SSA removed C.C. stemmed from arrogance, to punish mother, or due to budgetary constraints, as plaintiffs claim. Plaintiffs do not indicate where in their separate statement they specified any facts supporting these contentions. As the trial court observed, plaintiffs \u201cdid not submit a Separate Statement of their own proffered facts; they only provide a response to defendants\u2019 81 proffered facts.\u201d It appears plaintiffs simply concluded SSA acted with arrogance, a punitive intent, or for misplaced financial reasons. But it is not enough in opposing summary judgment to surmise reasons or make unfounded allegations: \u201ca party \u2018cannot avoid summary judgment by asserting facts based on mere speculation and conjecture, but instead must produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dollinger, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1144-1145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Second, only material factual disputes bear any relevance: \u201cno amount of factual conflict upon other aspects of the case will preclude summary judgment.\u201d <em>(Shively v. Dye Creek Cattle Co. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1620, 1627 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 238].) Plaintiffs do not explain how SSA\u2019s asserted arrogance, punitive intent, or minimal access to county coffers has anything to do with their causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">Specifically, plaintiffs filed suit for alleged hate crimes (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1), violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51), child abduction (Civ. Code, \u00a7 49), \u201cinjury to . . . personal relations\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 43), unexplained <em>\u201cMonell </em>Related Causes of Action,\u201d and intentional infliction of emotional distress. But they cite no authority and make no attempt to explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>how SSA\u2019s actions in the dependency context provide a basis for any of their wide-ranging causes of action. (See <em>In re La Shonda B. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 593, 599 [157 Cal.Rptr. 280] [dependency proceeding by nature \u201cis brought on behalf of the child, not to punish the parents\u201d]; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(B) [appellant must support each point by reasoned argument \u201cand, if possible, by citation of authority\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Third, mother overlooks that her core complaint about C.C.\u2019s removal from her care rests with the dependency court, not SSA. The court, in the final analysis, makes the decision at the detention hearing (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7315, 319) whether, a child will remain out of parental custody and again at the disposition hearing whether the detention will continue, where the child will be placed, and on what conditions (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 358, 361). Here, the court at the detention hearing in the dependency proceedings placed C.C. with SSA, authorized SSA to release C.C. to his parents or other \u201csuitable adult as deemed appropriate,\u201d and vested SSA with discretion to \u201clift/reinstate monitor ... for mother <em>and father once </em>released!\u201d and to liberalize parental visitation. (Italics added.) Then, at the dispositional hearing, the dependency court ratified C.C.\u2019s temporary placement with mother under the terms she agreed to in the CRISP release, and authorized SSA to redetain him \u201cif it <em>appears </em>[the] terms and conditions ... are violated or [the] child is at risk.\u201d (Italics added.) The court at the disposition hearing also expressly noted, \u201c[a]ll prior orders to remain in full force and effect,\u201d thereby continuing SSA\u2019s authority to modify C.C.\u2019s placement and determine whether visitation required a monitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Mother suggests on appeal that the trial court improperly delegated its authority in these important matters to SSA, including the authority to end the CRISP placement and place C.C. with father. But mother offered no challenge in the dependency proceedings to the trial court\u2019s delegation, and doing so now does not aid her in this civil lawsuit <em>against SSA. </em>In particular, mother does not argue and provided no evidence below that SSA did anything to wrongfully obtain or coax from the court authority over the CRISP placement. It would be difficult to conceive such evidence, since as a practical matter someone besides the court must have the ability to quickly redetain a child from a placement if necessary, particularly an intensive CRISP placement. In any event, the key consideration pertinent to this appeal is that nothing implicates SSA and its social workers in plaintiffs\u2019 belated complaint about the court\u2019s allegedly improper delegation of placement authority. Presumably plaintiffs did not sue the dependency court because of judicial immunity. (See, e.g., <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Drapkin </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 843, 851 [271 Cal.Rptr. 893] [\u201cThe concept of judicial immunity is long-standing and absolute . . . .\u201d].) But that does not furnish a basis to sue SSA or its social workers acting under delegated judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>Fourth and related, although social workers are not judicial officers entitled to judicial immunity, the trial court properly determined defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the immunity that shields discretionary decisions by public employees. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 820.2.) Government Code section 820.2 provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission [that] was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under this provision, social workers are entitled to immunity for their child removal and placement decisions in dependency proceedings. <em>(Jacqueline T. </em>v. <em>Alameda County Child Protective Services </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 456, 466 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 157] <em>(Jacqueline T.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">The immunity applies even to \u201clousy\u201d decisions in which the worker abuses his or her discretion, including decisions based on \u201cwoefully inadequate information.\u201d <em>(Ortega v. Sacramento County Dept, of Health &amp; Human Services </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 713, 725, 728, 733 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 390] [social worker returned child to father, who promptly stabbed the child in the heart and lungs].) Consequently, the factual questions plaintiffs raise regarding <em>why </em>SSA removed C.C. from mother\u2019s care do not preclude summary judgment because they are irrelevant. Simply put, even assuming arguendo SSA abused its discretion by acting in an arrogant or punitive manner or with undue consideration for monitoring costs, the immunity provided in Government Code section 820.2 expressly applies \u201cwhether or not such discretion is abused.\u201d Section 820.2 specifies no exception for malice. The same wide discretion applies even if Marks or other SSA social workers were grossly incorrect in concluding mother violated the CRISP agreement. As the <em>Ortega </em>court explained, \u201c \u2018[Cjlaims of <em>improper </em>evaluation cannot divest a discretionary policy decision of its immunity.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Ortega, supra, </em>161 Cal.App.4th at p. 733; accord, <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Montoya </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 972, 984-985 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 842, 897 P.2d 1320].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">Plaintiffs see in another code provision, Government Code section 820.21, an exception dissolving immunity for social workers whenever their discretionary decisions result in harm that plaintiffs insist was \u201ccreated with intent and malice.\u201d Plaintiffs argue SSA\u2019s allegedly punitive intent in wrongly finding CRISP violations established the requisite malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>Plaintiffs read Government Code section 820.21 too broadly. It is not a blanket exception for every conceivable act that may be done with malice. By its terms, the immunity exception in section 820.21 is limited to specific instances of misconduct, including perjury. It provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of the law, the civil immunity of juvenile court social workers, child protection workers, and other public employees authorized to initiate or conduct [child welfare] investigations or proceedings . . . shall not extend <em>to any of the following, </em>if committed with malice: [|] (1) Perjury, [f] (2) Fabrication of evidence, [f] (3) Failure to disclose known exculpatory evidence. [][] (4) Obtaining testimony by duress . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 820.21, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">The Legislature has not listed the malicious removal of a child as an act that would revoke a social worker\u2019s immunity. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 820.21, subd. (a).) The omission may arise from the fact that removal is ultimately the juvenile court\u2019s decision, and a social worker\u2019s interim actions are only temporary, pending ratification or rejection by the court. The listed actions vitiating immunity\u2014perjury, fabrication of evidence, hiding exculpatory evidence, and poisoning testimony with duress\u2014all share a common trait of subverting the juvenile court\u2019s ability to decide the removal question fairly. In any event, we may not judge the Legislature\u2019s wisdom in including some malicious acts.in section 820.21, and omitting others. <em>(In re Marriage of Tavares </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 620, 628 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 39] [\u201cThe Legislature declares state public policy, not the courts.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Plaintiffs did not assert SSA workers committed perjury, fabricated evidence produced for a decision maker, or committed similar misconduct to end the CRISP placement and remove C.C. from mother\u2019s care. Rather, as discussed, mother in the CRISP agreement committed any initial decision to end the placement to SSA\u2019s discretion. SSA and its social workers therefore served as the initial decision makers in removing C.C. from his CRISP placement, and it makes little sense to suggest SSA committed perjury or fabricated evidence in its own removal decisionmaking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">And there is no evidence SSA hid any evidence when the dependency court later reviewed and ratified SSA\u2019s removal and new placement decision. Rather, SSA and mother produced all pertinent evidence according to their respective burdens of proof and production, sufficient for the court to make a fully informed decision ratifying SSA\u2019s actions. Plaintiffs do not assert the trial court lacked any information to make its decision. (See <em>Watson v. County of Santa Clara </em>(N.D.Cal., May 20, 2010, C-06-04029 RMW) 2010 WL 2077171, p. *9 [summary judgment proper where plaintiff failed to produce evidence defendants committed perjury or other specified acts invalidating immunity in Gov. Code, \u00a7 820.21].) In any event, plaintiffs also failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>oppose summary judgment with evidence of Marks\u2019s punitive intent or malice in removing C.C. \u201c[Substantial responsive evidence\u201d is required and they produced none. <em>(Songster v. Paetkau </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 163 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] [\u201cmere speculation ... is insufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Plaintiffs appear to assert they were not required to produce any evidence beyond the bare fact SSA removed C.C. from mother\u2019s care because committing that authority to SSA\u2019s discretion \u201camounted to per se violations of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional and civil rights.\u201d (Boldface &amp; capitalization omitted.) Plaintiffs invoke <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>455 U.S. 745, noting there the high court \u201cclearly established the constitutional protection[] of familial bonds and the right to due process when those bonds are threatened by the government.\u201d Specifically, plaintiffs assert that vesting SSA with authority to end the CRISP placement \u201cillegally usurped judicial authority.\u201d Plaintiffs apparently view this delegation as a per se due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">Plaintiffs, however, did not assert this theory in the dependency proceedings, nor in their complaint in this civil action, nor do they provide page citations to suggest they made this argument in opposition to summary judgment. Notably, plaintiffs declined in the dependency proceedings to seek immediate judicial review of SSA\u2019s removal decision or otherwise to modify (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 388) SSA\u2019s CRISP authority. Plaintiffs also omitted in their civil complaint any mention of the trial court\u2019s assertedly improper delegation, and a plaintiff may not oppose summary judgment with a new unpleaded legal theory. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Hewlett-Packard Corp. </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1108, 1132 [228 Cal.Rptr. 591].) \u201cThe principles of \u2018theory of the trial\u2019 apply to . . . summary judgment motions\u201d <em>(North Coast Business Park v. Nielsen Construction Co. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22, 29 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 104]), and therefore \u201c \u2018[a] party is not permitted to change his position and adopt a new and different theory on appeal\u2019 \u201d <em>{ibid.). </em>\u201c \u2018To permit him to do so would not only be unfair to the trial court, but manifestly unjust to the opposing party.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Instead, the pleadings define the issues to be considered on a motion for summary judgment <em>(Lockhart </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 289, 303 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 62]), and plaintiffs did not allege improper delegation in their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">In any event, plaintiffs\u2019 bid for reversal fails on the merits because the dependency court is the true target for their core claim of wrongful delegation and, as noted, the court is absolutely immune. Furthermore, <em>Santosky </em>is inapposite because here mother did not have a preexisting custodial right with which SSA or the dependency court allegedly interfered in a manner violating due process. Rather, she had lost custody in the family court proceedings before the dependency case arose, and therefore gained only provisional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>custody of C.C. by the terms of the CRISP release, to which she agreed. Having agreed to the terms, including SSA\u2019s right to redetain C.C. \u201cif it <em>appears </em>[the] terms and conditions ... are violated or [the] child is at risk\u201d (italics added), there is no conceivable merit to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of a per se constitutional violation. Simply put, no reasonable trier of fact could decide the matter in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and the trial court therefore properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">The judgment is affirmed.
