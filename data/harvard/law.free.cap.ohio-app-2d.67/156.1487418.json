Defendant failed to make any appearance in the case, and plaintiff was granted a default judgment. Defendant filed a motion to vacate the default judgment against him. Defendant\u2019s motion was granted. The judgment was vacated, and an answer was filed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Defendant\u2019s attorney served notice upon plaintiff that he intended to take plaintiff\u2019s deposition. Plaintiff did not appear at the stated time and place for the deposition. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action based upon plaintiff\u2019s failure to appear. Plaintiff contested defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court treated defendant\u2019s motion as a motion to compel discovery, instead of a motion to dismiss, and ordered plaintiff to allow defendant to take plaintiff\u2019s deposition. The court, however, sent the parties a notice which stated that the court had ruled on defendant\u2019s motion for <em>dismissal </em>and that the motion was granted. Plaintiff assumed that the case had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Defendant notified plaintiff again of his intent to depose plaintiff. Plaintiff, believing that the case had been dismissed, disregarded the notice. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action based upon Civ. R. 37(D) (failure to appear for the deposition). Plaintiff, now aware that the case was still pending, opposed the motion. Plaintiff informed the trial court of the misunderstanding and argued that the case should not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The trial court dismissed the action. Plaintiff appeals, submitting four assignments of error. These errors will be treated together, as they raise only one issue: Whether the trial court erred in dismissing the case due to plaintiff\u2019s failure to appear at the second scheduled deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Civ. R. 37(D) gives the court the authority to dismiss a case when a party has failed to appear at a deposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>tion, Civ. R. 37(B)(2)(c) grants the court power to dismiss when a party has failed to comply with a discovery order of the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the instant case, either section could apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">A sanction imposed by the court as a result of a party\u2019s failure to abide by the discovery rules is within the discretion of the court and will generally not be reversed on appeal unless it affirmatively appears from the record that the court abused its discretion and that the sanction is not just. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Hester </em>(1972), 32 Ohio App. 2d 121, affirmed (1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In <em>Ward, </em>the appellant had failed to comply with an order of the court compelling discovery. The court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Civ. R. 37(B)(2). On appeal, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in imposing the sanctions, since the appellant had failed to offer any timely explanation for its failure to comply with the discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The instant case is readily distinguishable from <em>Ward. </em>Plaintiff, herein, timely filed a motion in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Plaintiff, a layman representing himself, informed the court of his reasons for not appearing at the second deposition. Plaintiff stated that he had received the notice informing him that the case was already dismissed (and he attached a copy of the notice to his motion). The initial fault was on the part of the court, for it caused an improper notice to be sent to plaintiff. In our view, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff in this case to rely on the accuracy of this notice without checking further with the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Dismissal is a drastic remedy. Some federal courts, in construing Fed. R. Civ. P. 37,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> have held that dismissal should be used as a discovery sanction only in extreme cases. See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Aluminum Co. of America </em>(C.A. 5, 1977), 564 F. 2d 1171, 1172. Federal courts have generally required a finding of willfulness, bad faith or fault in order to dismiss a case when a party fails to abide by a discovery order. See <em>In re Professional Hockey Antitrust Litigation </em>(C.A. 3, 1976), 531 F. 2d 1188, 1193, reversed on other grounds <em>in National Hockey League </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc. </em>(1976), 427 U. S. 639, rehearing denied (1976), 429 U. S. 874. We concur with this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">In the instant case, the drastic remedy of dismissal was not warranted. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the plaintiff willfully failed to comply with the discovery order or that he acted in bad faith. Furthermore, the record indicates that plaintiff was not at fault. If fault is to be found, it was in the court\u2019s notice that the case had been dismissed when, in fact, it had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">A trial court should consider the alternative sanctions available when a party fails to properly abide by the discovery rules. <em>Griffin, supra, </em>at pages 1172-73. The trial court, having been informed of the circumstances, could have ordered plaintiff to appear for a deposition at a stated date, or it could have stayed the proceedings until defendant deposed plaintiff. See Civ. R. 37(B)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The trial court abused its discretion in dismissing this c\u00e1se pursuant to Civ. R. 37. The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County is, therefore, reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-8\">Krenzler, P.
