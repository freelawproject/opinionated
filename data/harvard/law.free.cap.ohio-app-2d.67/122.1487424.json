Appellee answered, denying appellant\u2019s allegations, and counterclaimed, alleging that the action was retaliatory because appellee had complained about various housing violations. On April 10, 1978, the jury rendered a verdict in appellee\u2019s favor for $200. Subsequently, the court awarded appellee an additional $800 as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">Although the record on appeal contains no transcript of the trial proceedings, the parties have filed an Agreed Statement as the record on appeal under App. R. 9(D). That statement reveals that appellant timely objected to the jury charge because it did not contain an instruction \u201cas to the granting of attorney\u2019s fees should the jury ultimately determine that the defendant-appellee was entitled to damages,\u201d and that this objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">Appellant has assigned three errors for this court\u2019s review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-15\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in failing to charge the jury with respect to the law allowing it to consider the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees should it have found that the defendant-appellee was entitled to actual damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201cII. The trial court erred in making an award of defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, on its own consideration, after having refused to submit such question to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">\u201cHI. The trial court erred in overruling the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Appellant argues these assignments of error together in her brief, and we therefore address them as a single assignment of error. Cf. App. R. 12(A). The sole issue presented for our review is whether, under R. C. 5321.02, the entitlement to and amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded for retaliatory conduct is a question for the court or for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">R. C. 5321.02 is part of the Ohio Landlords and Tenants Act, R. C. Chapter 5321, which significantly changed both the substantive and procedural provisions of former Ohio law. See <em>Laster </em>v. <em>Bowman </em>(1977), 52 Ohio App. 2d 379. Included in the Act are provisions permitting the court to award attorneys\u2019 fees to a party who succeeds in vindicating a right protected by the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The award of attorneys\u2019 fees serves two purposes. First, it acts as an additional sanction against a person who violates the more important provisions of the Act. Secondly, it serves as encouragement to the private bar to provide representation to tenants who normally could not afford to hire an attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">In the present case, the limited question presented is whether the award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the above provisions is a determination for the jury or for the court. Appellant relies heavily upon <em>Dyche Real Estate Fund </em>v. <em>Graves </em>(1978), 55 Ohio App. 2d 153. In that case, the court held that the question of attorneys\u2019 fees must be submitted to the jury and is not a matter for the trial court\u2019s consideration. The court based this holding on the following two factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u201cIt is the intent of this section [R. C. 5321.04(B)] to award the recovery of attorney fees to a tenant where he has proven actual damages arising out of the acts of a landlord. The award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of attorney fees pursuant to this statute is in effect a part of the damages awarded to the tenant for the proving of the landlord\u2019s proscribed acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u201cThis court has previously held, in the unreported case of <em>Coachlight Enterprises </em>v. <em>Donald Price, </em>No. 77AP-570, decided December 1,1977, a landlord-tenant case, the issue of attorney fees is one to be submitted to the jury, and the determination of such fees, within the context of this statute, is not a matter for the trial court\u2019s consideration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at page 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We respectfully disagree with this conclusion, and therefore, with the holding of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. First, the case of <em>Coachlight Enterprises </em>v. <em>Price, supra </em>(Fra. Co. Ct. of Appeals No. 77AP-570, December 1, 1977, unreported), simply assumed that the determination of attorneys\u2019 fees was an issue for the jury, but, offered no legal authority or other discussion to support this assumption. Secondly, we believe that the court\u2019s conclusion that the statute (R. C. 5321.04 [B]) intended to award attorneys\u2019 fees <em>as damages </em>is simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Traditionally, when a statute authorizes the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, it does so by allowing the fees to be taxed as costs. See, <em>e.g., </em>R. C. 163.21, 309.13 and 733.61. See, also, <em>Sorin </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 177; <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Cotner </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St. 2d 17; <em>State, ex rel. Michaels, </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 599, 607.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Interestingly, in <em>Sorin </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>at page 180, the court cited R. C. 1313.51 as a statute which provides \u201cfor the recovery of attorney fees, <em>as part of the costs </em>of litigation\u201d (emphasis added), despite the fact that R. C. 1313.51 does not specify how the award of fees is to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We find a similar approach to be appropriate here. The statutory language regarding damages and fees provides for an award of \u201cactual damages <em>together with </em>reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d (emphasis added), R. C. 5321.02. In our view, had the legislature intended attorneys\u2019 fees to be considered a part of the awardable damages, the statute would read \u201cactual damages <em>including </em>reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d The present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>language necessitates a conclusion that attorneys\u2019 fees are not awardable as <em>damages. </em>Submission of the fee question to the jury would produce a cumbersome and awkward procedure. Not only would the attorney be required to testify as to the time spent, but he would also have to demonstrate that the time spent and the hourly rate charged were reasonable. Proof of \u201creasonability\u201d may be complex; DR 2-106 (B) of the Code of Professional Responsibility lists eight factors to be considered in evaluating an attorney\u2019s fee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">\u201c(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u201c(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201c(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201c(4) The amount involved and the results obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">\u201c(5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201c(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">\u201c(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">\u201c(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">While a court may be quite familiar with the application of these considerations, a jury of lay persons would be unfamiliar with them; and, consequently, the submission to the jury of this question would consume significant additional time from both the attorneys and the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is difficult to imagine that the legislature intended to impose such a burden on the state\u2019s municipal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">We, therefore, conclude that the legislature intended that any attorney\u2019s fees awarded by a court under R. C. 5321.02 are to be taxed as costs. Thus, the entitlement to and amount of those fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Cassaro </em>v. <em>Cassaro </em>(1976), 50 Ohio App. 2d 368, 373-374; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Swanson </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App. 2d 85, 90. In the present case, because appellant has not demonstrated that the court abused its discretion, the court\u2019s award must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Cleveland Heights Municipal Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-6\">Krenzler, P. J., and Day, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\"> The Act permits attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded to the tenant for a landlord\u2019s retaliatory conduct (R. C. 5321.02), abuse of access (R. C. 5321.04), self-help evictions (R. C. 5321.15), and the wrongful withholding of security deposits (R. C. 5321.16). The landlord may recover attorneys\u2019 fees for the tenant\u2019s breach of a statutory duty (R. C. 5321.05) and for the tenant\u2019s abuse of rent withholding (R. C. 5321.09).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"> This provision is fundamental to the strength of the Landlords and Tenants Act because it insures that those persons who are less affluent will be able to protect their rights even when they lack the funds to retain an attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> This same procedure is followed under federal laws which award attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing party. See, <em>e.g., </em>Section 552(a)(4)(E), Title 5, U.S. Code (Freedom of Information'Act); Section 1640(a)(3), Title 15, U. S. Code (Truth in Lending Act); Section 2000a-3(b), Title 42, U. S. Code (Civil Rights Act of 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b139-14\"> A requirement that the reasonableness of the fee be submitted to the jury raises the spectre of presentation of expert witnesses regarding reasonable hourly rates, the cross-examination of the attorney concerning his experience, ability and the amount of time involved in preparation, and of complex and lengthy jury instructions, all taking <em>* </em>place in a municipal court amid its heavily crowded docket.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b140-7\">Krenzler, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGe\">concurring. I concur in the judgment of affirmance and agree that attorneys\u2019 fees are determined by the trial court and not the jury. Further, a party seeking attorneys\u2019 fees has the burden of demonstrating the reasonable value of such services. <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Swanson </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App. 2d 85. While the determination of the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees is within the discretion of the trial court, there must be some evidence before the court to justify the award. Before an appellate court can affirm the award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees by a trial court, the record, whether in the form of affidavits and/or other documentary material submitted to the trial court, or in the form of a transcript of an oral hearing, must support the court\u2019s determination. <em>Watters </em>v. <em>Love, Admr. </em>(1965), 1 Ohio App. 2d 571. See also the Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2-106(B), which sets forth the guidelines to determine the reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The time spent by an attorney and a reasonable rate to be charged for that time are important factors to be considered by the court. But fees may not always be awarded <em>only </em>on the basis of time and an hourly charge. The trial court may disagree with the attorney as to the amount of time reasonably required to perform the particular service. The court will give the evidence such weight as is warranted under all the facts and circumstances in a given case. The court\u2019s determination should be based upon the actual value of the necessary service. See <em>Hlavin </em>v. <em>W. E. Plechaty Co. </em>(1971), 28 Ohio App. 2d 43.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
