He sought a determination that he was entitled to recover damages for bodily injuries from defendant-appellant, Nationwide Insurance Company (defendant or \u201cNationwide\u201d), under the uninsured motorist clause of his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">The case was submitted to the court upon the pleadings, \u201cStipulation of Facts\u201d and briefs. The relevant stipulations may be summarized:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">(1) Plaintiff was the owner of an automobile policy issued by Nationwide which was in full force and effect on the date in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>question and which provided uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $12,500 per person and $25,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">(2) On October 22,1971, plaintiff, while a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by Raymond G. Toth, was involved in a motor vehicle accident with Gary E. Smith, an uninsured motorist. The parties agreed that plaintiff sustained \u201csubstantial injuries\u201d which exceeded the sum of $12,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">(3) Plaintiff made claim for his injuries against Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, which insured Raymond G. Toth. That policy provided for uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $12,500 for each person and $25,000 for each accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">(4) Plaintiff, without the participation or consent of Nationwide, settled his claim against Ohio Casualty Insurance Company for $6,250 (or 50 per cent of the uninsured motorist coverage) \u201cdue to the existence of questions of negligence and liability of uninsured motorist, Gary E. Smith\u201d and expressly reserved all rights he had against Nationwide to collect under the uninsured motorist provisions of his Nationwide policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">On December 28, 1978, the trial court, in a memorandum opinion, found in favor of plaintiff and ordered that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201c[T]he Arbitrator determine the full amount of damages sustained by Louis Repasy, and then deduct therefrom the amount of the previous recovery, Six Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($6,250.00). Said difference is the contractual obligation of Nationwide Insurance Company up to the policy limit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Defendant filed an appeal. It raises two assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both raise substantially the same issue and are disposed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Defendant contends plaintiff is precluded from presenting a claim against it under the uninsured motorist provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the policy. Defendant asserts this is so because plaintiff settled his claim with Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, the primary insurer, for less than the full amount of uninsured motorist coverage. Defendant relies upon the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions of its policy to sustain its position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The issue raised in the instant appeal was impliedly resolved by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Curran </em>v. <em>State Automobile Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 33 \u2014 a case construing an identical clause. In <em>Curran, </em>the issue was whether an insurer could disclaim liability on an uninsured motorist claim by virtue of the \u201cother insurance\u201d provision of the policy. In concluding an insurer could not disclaim such liability, the court stated, at pages 38-39:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201cR. C. 3937.18 itself indicates that uninsured motorist coverage is \u2018for the protection of <em>persons insured </em>thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles***.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cGiven this express statutory purpose, we are of the opinion that the uninsured motorist statute should be construed liberally in order to effectuate the legislative purpose that coverage be provided to persons injured through the acts of uninsured motorists. To permit an insurer, who provides uninsured motorist coverage, to avoid liability by an \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause in cases where other insurance is available to his insured would thwart that legislative intent. We therefore join those jurisdictions which have declined to give effect to \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u201cThus, where an insurer provides uninsured motorist protection, as required by R. C. 3937.18, it may not avoid indemnification of its insured under that coverage by including in the insurance contract an \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause, which, if applied, would relieve the insurer from liability in cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>cumstances where the insured has other similar insurance available to him from which he could be indemnified.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">The fact that Curran settled her claim with the primary insurer made no difference. While it is true that in <em>Curran </em>the insurance due under the primary insurer\u2019s uninsured motorist clause had been exhausted,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s adjuration to \u201cconstrue liberally\u201d requires that <em>Curran </em>not be distinguished by superfine demarcations. Thus, where the insured \u201chas not been indemnified to the full extent of his injury, he is entitled to recover under his own insurance coverage\u201d, <em>Curran, supra, </em>at 39, even when the primary insurance has not been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-8\">Krupansky, P.
