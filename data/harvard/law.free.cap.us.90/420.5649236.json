A., in 1812, made a deed to V. conveying to him valuable estates, Y. by a separate instrument, agreeing that if A. would, within live years, pay to him a certain sum ($14,500), he would convey to A.\u2019s children, then infants, a part of this estate, and convey also to them a part of certain other estates. Soon afterwards Y. acknowledged that A. had paid to him a large part ($11,600) of the money to be paid.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"A95\">On proceedings in equity many years afterwards, in the Circuit Court of the United States, the children, now become.of age, prayed for\u2014</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"AtF\">1st. A cancellation of the deed by A., as having been fraudulently procured by Y.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b428-11\">2d. That if this would not be decreed, then, on payment by the children of the balance with interest, for a specific performance by V. of his contract to convey the two parts of the estates which he had agreed to convey, if $14,500 were paid in five years.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b428-12\">3d. If the court would make neither of these decrees, then that it would decree that Y. should refund with interest the $11,600 purchase-money that had been paid to him.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b428-13\">The Circuit Court in 1853 refused to decree a cancellation of A.\u2019s deed, refused also to decree that Y. should specifically perform his agreement to convey ; but as to the return of the $11,600 purchase-money paid, the court said that it could not pass on that matter, proper parties not being before the court, and made no decree about it. Proper parties came in, and after hearing, the court refused to order a return of the purchase* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>money, and, finally, A.D. 1872, dismissed the bill by A.\u2019s children. <em>Held, </em>That no \u201cfinal decree\u201d in the sense of the statute which authorized appeals from the Circuit Court to this court in the case of final decrees in equity was made in 1853, nor indeed before 1872; and that the decree then entered brought up the whole case; that is to say, brought up the question of paneellation, the question of specific performance, and the question of return of purchasb-money.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b429-6\">2. \"Where the transactions out of which a case now before the court arose, occurred sixty-five years ago \u2014 litigation about them having been going on all the while \u2014 and the particular one before the court was begun thirty-five years ago, the court declared it to be high time that the case was ended, and that the court was not inclined to add to its length of years by looking after matters of mere form (objections of which were apparently now first made), in order to avoid substance.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b429-8\">3. In a court of conscience deliberate concealment is equivalent to deliberate falsehood. When a living man speaks in such a court to enforce a dead man\u2019s contract with himself against parties who he knows are ignorant of the facts, he must be frank in his statements, unless he is willing to take the risk of presumptions against him.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b429-10\">4. Accordingly where a party who has never been in possession comes into equity to enforce a deed for valuable estates made twenty-five years before, by the parents (now dead) of the persons now proceeded against, and which persons, when the deed was executed were young infants, has his bill answered by them, they stating that they were very young when the transactions relied on occurred, and that they had no personal knowledge about them, denying generally the allegations of the bill, suggesting many grounds for serious doubt as to their truth, and demanding of the claimant full and express proof of the fairness of the deeds, and of the full payment of the alleged considerations thereof, and of the circumstances of the execution of the deeds, it behooves the complainant, so far as he possibly can, to give such information, and if he shelter himself behind the mere execution of the deeds themselves, saying in his pleadings that he \u201c cannot suppose that it will be necessary for him to allege or prove the payment of the consideration acknowledged in solemn form by the parties to the said deeds until the fairness of the transaction and fulness of consideration is impugned by proof,\u2019\u2019 the court will hold that he has come before it with hands not clean, if in the progress of the case, and as things are developed, it turns out that he had agreed to reeonvey part of the property, with other pronerty, upon payment of a certain sum, and that he has acknowledged payment of a part of the sum, though he have agreed to convey only in case the sum were all paid within a certain time, and though he now aver, that in point of fact, the acknowledgment was made on a supposition that the person to whom it was paid would pa}\u2019 certain debts, which he failed to pay, &amp;c. And the court will accordingly order the deed to him to be cancelled, and will not help him to obtain payment of even such minor claims as perhaps he really and justly had.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b430-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Appeal from the Circuit Court for the Western District of Virginia. The case was thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">William King, of Abingdon, a village of Washington County, in the southwest corner of Virginia \u2014 a man possessed of valuable brine springs, at Saltvilie, close by it, and of other large estate \u2014 died in 1808 childless, leaving a wife and eight brothers and sisters; among the brothers one named Samuel, and among the sisters one named Hannah, married to John Allen. He left also a nephew, William King, Jr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">By his will he devised the bulk of his estate, valued at about $500,000, to his nephew (the said William King, Jr.), on a condition which, as things turned out, proved impossible. The fact of the impossibility of the condition led at once to litigation, and in 1830 and 1836, the will in two different suits was the subject of construction in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">It was held in the first suit,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020that the whole estate was devised to William King, Jr. (the nephew), subject to the life estate of the widow, but as it belonged to a court of chancery to determine whether he took the estate to his own use or in trust for the heirs of the testator, that question was left undecided. Accordingly, a bill in chancery was filed to test that question, and. in that case, the second one, this court decided that he did take in trust for the heirs.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-9\">Samuel King, and Mrs. Haunah Allen, the wdfe of John Allen, thus each became entitled to an eighth part of the estate. Samuel King lived at Somerset, a place in Pulaski County, in the southeast corner of Kentucky; Allen and his wife at Saltvilie. The two places were, perhaps, two hundred miles apart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-10\">Independently of any general interest acquired as just-mentioned by Samuel King in his brother William\u2019s estate, the brother by his will had made a special provision for him thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-11\">\u201cI leave to the said Samuel, in ease of personal application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the manager at Saltville, or to my executors at Abingdon, on the 1st day of January annually, $150.

He was in the habit of constantly drinking.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-15\">This Samuel King, as the testimony further \u00e1howed, was not only intemperate but was always <em>considered </em>very poor. One witness, Mr. Fox, of Somerset, clerk of the County Court of Pulaski, Kentucky, thus testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-16\">\u201cTo the best of my recollection he was at all times in a manner destitute of any property or credit. I well recollect that he applied to me as often as three times to borrow the sum of $5, each time, as he said,' to defray his expenses to Abingdon, Yii\u2019ginia, where he was going to draw his legacy coming to him from the estate.of his brother William King, which sums I lent him, he promising to refund the amounts upon his return, which, however, he never refunded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-17\">Mr. Benjamin Estill, a lawyer, long resident in Abingdon, Virginia, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-18\">\u201c He was believed to be totally insolvent for three years before his death, which event took place in 1812. I have seen him several times in Abingdon applying for his annuity, and understood that he came on foot from Somerset in Kentucky, where he lived.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Besides being poor and given to drinking spirituous liquor in excess, there was testimony about him thus, and there was no testimony to contradict it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">One witness said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">\u201c I always considered him as a very wild and visionary man, incapable of making bargains to any amount, when he had been drinking, and especially when there was any intricacy in the transaction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">Another said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">\u201c I never saw him at any time in a condition when he could contract or trade to any advantage to himself or his family.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-10\">Additional witnesses confirmed this account of him; one saying:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-11\">\u201c I never saw him after the death of his brother, that I thought him- capable of transacting business of any kind. He ought to have had a guardian, and if he had been in the North would have had one.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-12\">We havq mentioned that one of the heirs of William King, of Abingdon, was his sister Hannah, married to John Allen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-13\">Allen\u2019s character was thus testified to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-14\">One witness said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-15\">\u201cJohn Allen\u2019s general character as to correctness of dealing in money matters was bad. I am not able to say whether Samuel King was an easy subject for fraud. But Allen\u2019s general character was such that he would take advantage of any man if an opportunity offered, and he would do it so smoothly that the person imposed on would consider him-a friend.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-16\">A second one said further:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-17\">\u201cI was well acquainted with John Allen, and knew no good of him. I thought him capable of committing frauds of any enormity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-18\">In addition to these two persons, connected, as we have said, by marriage with one another, and by their common right to participate in the large estate of William King, there appeared a third person, a principal actor in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>troversies, the subject of this report. His name was John Vint, and he was entitled \u201c of Washington City in the District of Columbia.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\">Vint was an Englishman, who came to the United States in 1800. His relation to the parties connected with this suit begins about the year 1810, when he is found in intimate relations with Allen; but the mode of origin of his said relation was nowhere distinctly shown, nor with any detail. His name was connected, in the present case, with large transactions. How far property was traced with distinctness as being really his, so as to enable him to purchase in the way, as it will be seen in the sequel, that he alleged he truly did purchase in this case, will appear by the testimony which follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-7\">One witness said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\">\u201cI never saw him till he and John Allen came to purchase a negro girl I owned. I knew nothing of his pecuniary condition. I was acquainted with Allen before. I sold them the girl. They never paid me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\">Another witness, one Bussell, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-10\">\u201cIn November, 1810, Mr. Vint had a store in the house of Mr. John Allen, and had there a considerable quantity of goods, which were said to be Vint\u2019s; but I do not recollect that I ever heard either Allen or Vint say that they belonged to Vint. I was frequently at the store. The shelves were pretty well filled with a good display. I heard it spoken of about that time, that Vint had sold out to Allen. Previous to that time Allen was frequently embarrassed, but as respects the condition of property I am not informed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-11\">A third witness, Francis Smith, an attorney at law, who had married the widow of William King in 1811, but who testified that he had no interest whatever in the result of the suit, confirmed the view of these two witnesses:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-12\">\u201cPrevious to September 5th, 1812, there were placed in my hands for collection lai'ge claims on Allen. I know that he was hard pressed long before in his pecuniary affairs, and that he was never able to purchase and pay $11,600 for any property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>He had nothing, and was able to purchase nothing. About this time I frequentty saw both Allen and Tint. They were sometimes in jail and sometimes out. I thought both of them without property or means.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">A fourth witness, one Stout, however, testified in rather an opposite way. He said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\">\u201c I recollect the sale by John Allen to John Vint of his interest in the estate of William King, for the sum of about $18,000. I understood from John Allen that at the time of the sale he owed to him, Vint, a small sum, about $2000, and that the balance of the purchase-money was paid by Vint in goods, which Allen afterwards told me he had received. I farther know of my own knowledge that Allen did receive a great many goods from Vint.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\">However, as stated, <em>infra </em>(see p. 438), by Yint himself, this sum of $18,000 was not a true consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-9\">We now return to Samuel King, already mentioned as intemperate, poor, and visionary. We have stated that he lived in Kentucky and was obliged to come in the beginning of each year, in person, to Saltville or Abingdon, to give his personal receipt for the $150 left to him by his brother\u2019s will. He came for the last time in January, 1812, when he claimed payment for two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-10\">A witness, resident at Abingdon, thus testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-11\">\u201cWhen he came to Abingdon, he came to Allen\u2019s; Allen kept a public house. He came there drunk, riding a little chunk of a pony, and dressed in a common dress. He was almost always drunk during the time that he was there. When he got to Abingdon he was asked by Allen\u2019s family how he had paid his expenses from Kentucky, and whether he had put up at private houses or at taverns? He said that he had put up at any place that he could get in at, and told the persons with whom he put up that he would pay them on his return; for that he would get this year two years\u2019 payment. Allen told him that he could get but one, for that he had not come for the last year\u2019s payment at the right time, and that under the terms of the will it was gone. Allen\u2019s family told me that he was a poor man; and Mrs. Allen, his sister, told him in my presence to return to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>his family, for that they would suffer in his absence. I thought him to be deranged from intemperance, and this opinion was entertained by the family of Allen generally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">Having got payment for either one or for two years, King set off on his pony to go back to his home, in Kentucky. He arrived at the house of a man named Pridemore, about sixty miles from Abingdon, to stay all night, and <em>\u201c </em>while there,\u201d according to the language of a person who saw him, appeared \u201c during the evening to be very uneasy, going frequently to the door in a state of alarm, and saying that he feared a man by the name of John Allen, and other persons who were following him from Abingdon, and that he would be assassinated.\u201d In the morning his hat and boots, pocketbook and saddle-bags were in his room, but he himself could not be found, and was never again seen or heard of. For some time grave suspicions of murder rested both upon Pridemore and upon Allen. But it dually rather appeared that King had gone out of the house in the middle of the night under the influence of <em>mania a pot\u00fc, </em>and wandering through the forests thereabouts had fallen into a rapid stream, swollen by recent rains, and was lost among the gorges of the mountains which rise in that region. The whole matter, however, remained much a mystery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">His pony, saddle-bags, pocket-book, hat, and boots were sent back to his brother-in-law, Allen, by whose wife the saddle-bags and pocket-book were opened and examined. They contained papers but no money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-8\">The unfortunate man himself left, at the time of his death, three children, aged respectively about one, three, and five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-9\">Allen died not long after, also leaving several children, all young.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-10\">We come now more particularly to certain facts of this \u2022 case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-11\">It seemed plain enough that on the 16th of November, 1810, Allen and wife executed a deed by which, for the <em>professed </em>\u201c consideration of $18,901.27, current money, to them in hand paid,\u201d they conveyed to Vint all the right and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>terest which the said Allen, in right of his wife, and also which his said wife had in the estate of the said William King, that is to say one-eighth part of that estate; and also \u2022a certain fifth part of the eighth of the estate which came to Samuel King as one of the heirs, which fifth the deed recited that the said Samuel had conveyed to Allen, who was to reserve it as a compensation to counsel, for services in the suits already mentioned at the beginning of the report of this case (page 422), brought to establish in effect an intestacy, and the rights of the heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">This deed had apparently been witnessed on the day of its date, November 16th, 1810, in the ordinary way, by three witnesses; but was not then acknowledged, proved, or recorded. On the 27th of April, 1812, fifteen months after the date of its execution, and as was specified on it, \u201c at the request of Allen,\u201d its execution was attested <em>de novo </em>by two other witnesses. On the 7th of May following, it was proved for record in the way required by the laws of Virginia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-7\">The scrivener who drew the deed testified that he drew it carefully; the transaction being large; but that he knew nothing about the true consideration of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-8\">It seemed further, plain enough, that on the 1st of January, 1811, Samuel King had executed a deed by which, for the <em>professed </em>\u201c consideration of the sum of $10,000 to them in hand paid,\u201d he and <em>his wife </em>had transferred to this same Vint four-fifths of their interest in the estate of William King, brother of the said Samuel; the remaining fifth having, as the deed declared, been conveyed' by them to Allen, in the way already mentioned, as compensation to counsel, in attending to the suits to establish the rights of the heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-9\">The wife\u2019s execution of this deed, as it was produced, was by a mark. The execution of this deed was not witnessed, nor did the deed itself state where it had been executed, that is to say, whether in Virginia (at Abingdon or Saltville), where Allen lived, or at Somerset, in Kentucky, where King and his wife, the grantors, lived. But it appeared that on the 29th of January, 1811, that is to say twenty-eight days after the day stated in the instrument as the date of its exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>cution, the instrument had been acknowledged by King and his wife in Somerset, Kentucky, where King and his wife lived, and by <em>King </em>then given to the recorder there for record, and afterward by the recorder returned to <em>King; </em>Vint not anywhere appearing in this transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">Pulaski County, in Kentucky, in which State the lands conveyed by this deed did not lie, was not the proper place for the recoi\u2019d of the deed of King and wife to Vint. The deed was not proved in Washington County, Virginia, where the lauds did lie, till the 25th of September, 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-7\">With this statement by way of prosccenium, we will now state the pleadings and further developments in the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-8\">In January, A.D. 1825, during the pendency of the litigation in some of its forms, about the estate of the original owner of it, William King, -who, as we have already said, died in 1808, a bill was filed in the Circuit Court of the United States by some of the heirs to obtain a partition of the lauds not incumbered by the widow\u2019s life estate, and on the 25th of April, 1836, after the last of the decisions in this court, an order was entered appointing commissioners to make this partition. These commissioners afterwards made a report, and, among other things, assigned to the children and heirs of Samuel King, and the children and heirs of Hannah Allen, the wife of John Allen, one-fourth the property divided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-9\">On the 24th of September, 1838, 4Vint filed an original bill against the heirs of Samuel King and the heirs of Allen and wife, in which he set forth substantially that each had become owners of one-eighth of the estate of William King, of Abingdon, and then alleged that he was the owner in fee of their interest in the estate. He stated that his title to the Allen interest and one-fifth of the King interest was obtained by the already mentioned deed from Allen aud wife, dated November 16th, 1810, in which, for the consideration of $18,901.27, they conveyed the same to him ; and that his title to four-fifths of the King interest was by the already-mentioned deed from King and wife, dated January 1st, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>1811, in consideration of $10,000, executed and recorded in Kentucky. Of both these deeds, their tests, probates, &amp;c., he appended copies to his bill. But he appended nothing else; nor did he state or intimate in the bill, or by anything appended to it, that the transactions were in reality in the least other or different than what a reader would infer from reading the two instruments themselves. He stated rather, on the contrary, that he did not desire a suspension of the proceedings in partition any further than was necessary to protect his rights, and <em>that he was willing to accept the lands set off to the heirs as and for his share. </em>And the prayer of the bill was to the effect that he might be substituted for these heirs in the partition proceedings, <em>and that whatever was assigned to them might be adjudged to him.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-6\">In September, 1839, all the defendants answered the bill, and in substance stated that they were very young when the transactions referred to occurred, and that they had no personal knowledge as to the matters in controversy. They denied generally all the allegations in the bill adverse to their interests, and suggesting many serious grounds of suspicion against the validity of the claim of Vint, demanded from him full and express proof of all the material averments of his bill, and especially for proof <em>of the fairness of the deeds, and of the full payment of the consideration thereof, and of-the circumstances of the execution of the deeds and the alleged payments. </em>The death of the widow of William King, the original owner, was also suggested, and the heirs of Samuel King stated that they had conveyed their interest to a certain Findlay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-7\">On the 19th of September, 1839, Vint filed his supplemental bill, making Findlay a part}7, and also alleging the death of the widow, and asserting his right to the interest of Samuel King and Hannah and John Allen in the property devised to her for life and assigned to her for dower. In this supplemental bill he stated as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-8\">\u201cYour orator cannot suppose that it will be necessary for him to allege or prove the payment of the consideration, acknowledged in solemn form by the parties to said deeds, until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>fairness of the transaction and fulness of consideration are impugned by proof; but your orator asserts the payment of a full and fair consideration for their interests, which wero then wholly contingent. Indeed, your orator was reduced from affluence to poverty by this very consideration paid for said interests. The deed from Allen and wife was duly admitted to record in tho Circuit Court for Washington County, Virginia, on the '7th day of May, 1812, and the deed from Samuel King was duly admitted to record in the County Court of Pulaski County, Kentucky, where said Samuel King resided, on the 29th day of January, 1811, and on the 25th day of September, 1837, upon proof of the genuineness of said King\u2019s signature, the said deed was admitted to record in the County Court of Washington County, Virginia. . . . Tour orator did not deem it necessary to prosecute his claim by suits until the suits should be determined in which the question was made whether William King, son of James King, took under the will of William King as devisee of his real estate, or whether it descended and passed to his heirs at law. It was, moreover, useless, and would have been premature to have asserted your orator\u2019s claim in the salt works and dower property until the life estate should be determined. Your orator is advised that he has been guilty of no laches from lapse of time, since he is in full time for the partition, which has not yet been made of any part of the estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">To this supplemental bill Findlay answered, setting up his title under the conveyance from the heirs of Samuel King, and insisting upon several defences not now material to be stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">After the filing of the supplemental bill much testimony was taken. On the 7th of February, 1840, Francis Smith, who married the widow of William King, the original owner, gave his deposition, and in it furnished a copy of a contract, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-8\"><em>\u201c </em>This agreement, entei\u2019ed into this 6th of Apx\u2019il, in the year of our Lord 1812, between John Allen, of the county of Washington, in the State of Vii\u2019ginia, of the one pax-t, and John Vint, of the city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, of the other part, witnesses that the said John Vint, for and in consideration of the sum of $14,450, to be paid by the said John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Allen in the manner hereinafter .mentioned, the said John Vint doth covenant and agree to transfer, make over, and convey to the <em>children </em>which the said John Allen now has and to such other <em>children </em>as he may have with his present wife Hannah, one-half of all the interest which he, the said John Vint, may have in the estate of William King, deceased, by a conveyance from John Allen and Hannah, his wife, bearing date the 16th of November, 1810, and also by another conveyance from Samuel King and his wife, bearing date the first day of January, 1811, reference thereto being had will more fully appear.

This affidavit was annexed to Smith\u2019s deposition, and, in the part material to this ease, was thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">\u201cThis day came John Tint before me, John Gibson, a justice of the peace for Washington County, Virginia, and made oath, that on the 16th November, 1810, he purchased <em>from John Allen </em>all his interest in the estate of William King, deceased, and after that purchased from <em>said Allen all the interest of Samuel King in said estate, </em>for which he was to have given, and did give, said Allen credit on a debt due from him to this affiant for $10,000; but that said Allen then stating that he wished the receipt executed by this affiant to be for a larger sum than the sum really given in order to promote his credit to the northward by the largeness of the payment he was making his creditors, this affiant agreed thereto, and executed his receipt for about $8000 more than the sum he was to give. Thus the business stood until April, 1812, when this affiant entered into another contract with said Allen in writing of that date, by which contract he sold and agreed to convey to the children of John Allen, by his wife Hannah, one-half of all his interest in William King\u2019s estate upon the payment by John Allen to this affiant of $14,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">\u2022\u2018.\u2018John Vint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">\u201c Subscribed and sworn to before me this 5th September, 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">\u201cJohn Gibson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-10\">Other testimony was from time to time taken in the cause, and finally, in December, 1842, the beirs of Hannah and John Allen filed their cross-bill, in which they stated, that since the filing of their answers they had learned other facts most material in their character, and having an important bearing upon their rights and interests. They averred that these facts, \u201cthough necessarily well known to complainant (Vint), since he was an actor, and is the only surviving actor in the transaction, he has thought fit, from motives which cannot easily be misunderstood, to suppress.\u201d After referring to their extreme youth at the time the transactions occurred, and other circumstances likely to prevent their becoming acquainted with the facts, they set forth the foregoing contract and receipt, which had then recently been discovered in their search after the truth of the case. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>then charged that the failure of Vint to bring these matters to the knowledge of the court was such a fraud on them as must deprive him of the aid of a court of conscience in the premises, and claimed that under the circumstances of this case the payment of the balance of the purchase-money due upon the contract should be presumed. They prayed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">1st. For a cancellation of the deed from Allen and wife to Vint; or,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-7\">2d. If that could not be granted, a specific performance of the contract; or,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-8\">3d. A return of the purchase-money shown by the receipt to have been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-9\">To this cross-bill Vint answered in September, 1843. He denied all charges of fraud and improper suppression of truth, and then said: -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-10\">\u201cThe respondent fairly purchased and paid for the interest of John Allen and Hannah, his wife, and of Samuel King, in the estate of William King, deceased, and by deeds duly executed the said parties regularly conveyed their interest to him. For these deeds reference is here made to the exhibits filed by this respondent to his original bill. Some time after these purchases and the execution of said conveyances, it is true that this respondent did make with John Allen the contract of the 6th of April, 1812 (given, supra, pp. 431-2), but Allen did not pay him the purchase-money within five-years, or at any time, and having failed to do so,' the contract became void. He admits the execution of the receipt, and alleges that beyond this there could fee no pretence of any payment. He denies that ho received all the money mentioned in that. He recollects distinctly that as part of the sum embraced in the receipt, a draft on John Jelf for $2333 was included, and that it was protested and never.paid. A part of the sum also was made up of debts of Vint, which Allen assumed to pay for him but never did pay.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-11\">He then said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-12\">\u201cThe contract on which the $11,600 aforesaid purports to -have been paid and the receipt for that sum, were not retained by this respondent in his hands, as the complainants would seem to indicate., but were handed over to John Allen; and as the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Allen and his heirs are interested in the said papers, this respondent supposed that they would take care of them, and at all times have them at their command. This respondent has certainly never had the said papers under his control, and this having been the case, it seems extraordinary to him that the complainants should gravely charge him with improperly concealing contracts and papers which they must have known were never in his possession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">On the 17th of April, 1844, Findlay filed his cross-bill against Vint, in which he asked that the deed from Samuel King to Vint might be set aside for fraud. In this bill he charged that the deed was obtained by the fraudulent combination of Vint and John Allen to divest King of his interest in the estate, and stated that proof had already been made in the case that Vint had said lie purchased this interest from Allen. He then stated that the actual consideration for the deed was $6000, payable in ten equal annual instalments, for each of which a note was given. That none of these notes had been paid, and that Vint had nine of them in his possession. He charged that they were unfairly obtained by Vint, and probably in consequence of his dealings and combination with Allen. He called for an answer under oath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-7\">To this cross-bill Vint filed an answer on the 8th of April, 1845, in which he adopted as part of it the answer which he had before filed to the cross-bill of Allen\u2019s heirs. He denied that the deed to him was obtained by fraud. He said that he could not undertake to say with certainty whether or not John Allen exerted any material agency in bringing about the sale by King, but denied all fraudulent combination for that purpose. He admitted that no money had been paid by him to King, and that the consideration was as stated in the cross-bill, and he appended copies of the ten notes. All of them were payable in negroes, in Abingdon, at cash price. The three first falling due were payable to King, <em>or his order. </em>The others to the <em>children of King by </em>Palsey, <em>his wife. </em>The execution of all was witnessed by John Allen. A receipt as follows was produced and made part of his answer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\"January 1st, 1811.

Now, let it be understood, that I am to forward to John Allen, of Abingdon, said conveyance to said Vint, all my right and title to said estate, legally and completely done by me and my wife, or else said notes, in number, ten, amounting to $6000, payable by instalments, as the said notes will show, all of them and each of them to bo void and of no effect if the conveyance is not forwarded in three months.

He theu said that Allen procured from Kiug nine of the ten notes and delivered them to him, and that the amount of these notes was included in the receipt for $11,600, stated on p. 432, as part pay of the contract between himself and Allen, of the 6th of April, 1812; and that he received the notes in good faith from Allen, supposing that Allen had obtained them fairly from King. <em>The notes were yet unindorsed by any one.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-10\">One of them \u2014 one of the three payable to King, and the one that first fell due \u2014 was assigned by indorsement made on it by Kiug, and dated January 2d, 1811, to Allen, and by him to one Sheffey, who had been counsel for the heirs in their suits about the property of William King.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-11\">He appended to his answer three exhibits intended to show the state of accounts between him and Allen, April 6th, 1812.

But they are specially adverted to in the argument of counsel for the defendants \u2014 the heirs of Mrs. Allen \u2014 who relied not only on the leading facts of the ease but on the details of it, which, as they conceived, explain and heighten the effect of the leading facts.

The bill, then, is an application on the part of Vint to a court of equity, to say whether he or the heirs of Samuel King and Hannah Allen had the better title to the real estate assigned to the said King and Allen in another suit. Vint was not and had not been in possession; his claim was not recognized as valid, but rejected as invalid by all the persons with whom he pretended to be tenant in common. Now, a bill which does not ask partition \u2014 which says it has been made in another suit \u2014 which asks the court to decide a question of right to a particular parcel of land \u2014 which prays that possession be given of what is held adversely by others \u2014 is in fact an actibn of ejectment and not a bill for partition. That must relate to an undivided estate, and must ask that the interests of each be separated from the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">II. <em>But concede that jurisdiction exists, the decree below was wrong.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">1. <em>All Vini\u2019s bills should have been dismissed for laches.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">He obtained from King and wife their deed in January, 1811, and the deed from Allen and wife in April, 1812, but he did not institute this suit until September, 1838. In the meantime a suit was pending for the construction of the will of William King, upon which depended the value of the shares conveyed by these two deeds. He did not make himself a party to these suits, claiming the shares of Samuel King and Hannah Allen, but he remained passive and silent until Hannah Allen and Samuel King, and every living party to these transactions was dead but himself; and then, for the first time, asserts his claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-10\">2.

The deed of King conveying his eighth, has been decreed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>fraudulent and null; and from this decree Vint\u2019s representative makes no appeal. The fraud of Vint as to that part, therefore, stands confessed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">Our allegation, however, is that the two deeds, and the contract of April 6th, 1812, to reconvey on payment of $14,450, and the receipt of April 7th, 1812, for $11,600 <em>[supra, </em>page 432), form parts of one transaction, and that the deed from Kiug having been decreed to have been obtained by fraud, the other deed and papers fall as fraudulent also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">On this account only do we advert to the now effete and worthless deed from King and wife to Vint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asf\">Our allegation further is that Vint asserting a large, and probably grossly excessive claim ($10,000) on Allen, for the sale of store-goods to him, and Allen being insolvent or nearly so, and meaning to put his own life estate in his wife\u2019s eighth of her brother\u2019s property beyond the reach of creditors other than Vint, these two persons \u2014 Vint and Allen\u2014 entered into a fraudulent conspiracy by which,</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">1st. Vint should get, through Allen\u2019s efforts, King\u2019s eighth, and cancel the debt of $10,000 which he alleged that Allen owed him, and by which,</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-10\">2d. Allen\u2019s life estate, under the devise of a provision for his children, should be withdrawn from his creditors other than Vint; and by which,</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-11\">3d. Under the same device the interest of Mrs. Allen, the owner in fee \u2014 an interest which neither Vint nor any other creditors of Allen could touch \u2014 should pass to Vint as security for the payment of a balance due to him by Allen on other accounts, and shown by the exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3, <em>supra, </em>pp. 437-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-12\">We assert that the deed of King to Vint, dated January 1st, 1811, was procured by <em>Allen'\u2019s </em>influence; that it was executed at Allen\u2019s house in Abingdon; that Vint\u2019s notes for $6000, the consideration for it were left with Allen, until the deed should be taken by King to Kentucky, be executed and acknowledged there by Mrs. King, and be returned to Allen; that Allen kept Vint\u2019s notes till January 1st, 1812, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>that he then gave them to King; that King had them in his saddlebags when he was murdered or disappeared soon after-wards; that Allen then became repossessed of them and surrendered them, all except one (against which Vint was subsequently indemnified, in the way mentioned in Exhibit No. 2, supra, p. 437), to Vint, and that Vint thereupon can-celled his claim on Allen for store-goods; Vint thus getting King\u2019s eighth of the estate of the original owner, his brother, for nothing but his (Vint\u2019s) surrender of a claim of $10,000 on Allen, a man quite insolvent; a claim, therefore, which was good for npthing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">Now to prove our position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">The deed from King and wife to Vint bears date January 1st, 1811, on which day King was doubtless at Abingdon to get his annuity. All Vint\u2019s notes, the consideration for the deed, are witnessed by Allen, who resided there, but who is not shown to have ever been in Kentucky. One is transferred to Allen on the next day, January 2d, 1811. The deed is not witnessed, because it purported to be by King and <em>his wife, </em>and the wife was not there to execute it. It was acknowledged by King aud his wife in Kentucky on the 29th of January, 1811, when obviously King had just returned home; and by <em>King </em>was then given to the recorder for record, and by the recorder after record returned to <em>King; </em>Vint nowhere appearing to have had possession or control of the instrument at all. King in his receipt <em>(supra, </em>p. 436) promises to forward the deed when \u201clegally and completely done\u201d by him and his wife, to Allen; and Vint in his affidavit given to Francis Smith <em>(supra, </em>p. 433) says in terms, that \u201c he purchased from <em>Allen </em>all the interest of Samuel King, for which he was to have given and did give said <em>Allen </em>credit on a debt due this affiant (Vint) for $10,000.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-8\">It is apparent, therefore, that Allen was the person who brought this conveyance and so-called sale about; that he did it by means of a deed made directly from King and wife to Vint, executed under pi'etence that King w7as about to get Viut's notes for $6000, which notes were doubtless left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>in Allen\u2019s hands under a promise that they should become King\u2019s when the deed should come back or be brought back from Kentucky properly executed by the wife, and properly acknowledged; it havings however, been understood between Allen and Vint, that Allen would indemnify Vint against any liability on these notes, and that the true consideration was the surrender of the claim of $10,000 on Allen for store-goods sold in 1810 or thereabouts. There was no risk in this to Vint, for if he ever should be made to pay the notes, be had acquired an estate far above the amount of them; while as to his claim of $10,000 on Allen it remained where it was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-6\">But the understanding between Vint and Allen <em>was </em>carried out. Vint did in a subsequent transaction with him, and where he paid really nothing for them, get back from Allen all the notes but one, and against that one he was indemnified, as appears by the Exhibit No. 2, <em>supra, </em>p. 487.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-7\">It may indeed be that, the <em>original </em>purpose as to King was but to get his one-eighth of an estate worth $500,000, for the grossly inadequate consideration of the ten notes payable through a term of ten years in negroes, and that the moi\u2019e shocking scheme which' in April, 1812, was actually accomplished, was not devised until after Alleix had got repossessed of Vint\u2019s notes after King\u2019s death. The exact time when the fx\u2019aud actually perpetrated was concocted is not important.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-8\">We assert now further, that Allen after King\u2019s death became possessed of these nine notes of Vint by fx\u2019aud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-9\">Our theoi\u2019y is that the notes of Vint never left Allen\u2019s hands till January, 1812. It is not likely that Allen would have parted with the notes before the deed came back fi\u2019om Kentucky. Possibly the deed never did come back till King came back himself on the 1st of January, 1812, to get his annuity, and that he then bx\u2019ouglit it back himself If King had received the notes prior to leaving Abingdon for his homfe in 1812, his family would have had them. He would not have brought them back to Abingdon January 1st, 1812. But the notes are found April 7th, 1812, in Allen\u2019s posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>sion. How did Allen have them then ? There is but one way of accounting for his possession of them. King, we know, disappeared \u2014 was murdered or destroyed himself\u2014 just after leaving Allen\u2019s house, in the beginning of 1812. Whether Allen murdered him or whether he destroyed himself will never be known with certainty, until that dreadful day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. But this we know now \u2014 that King\u2019s last utterances were that he \u201c was afraid of a man named John Allen and other persons who were pursuing him.\u201d And if drink had made him mad it does not follow that in his idea there was not a truth \u201cthat often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-6\">But whether Allen murdered King or not, we know that King\u2019s saddlebags, containing papers, were sent, not. to his own family in Kentucky, to whom they ought to have been sent, but to Allen\u2019s family at Abingdon. What papers were these ? As King is shown to have possessed no other property than Vint\u2019s notes, and as these notes never came to the possession of King\u2019s family, and as <em>on </em>the 7th of April, 1812, they are found in Allen\u2019s possession, the presumption is violent that the papers were nine of Yint\u2019s notes given for the purchase of King\u2019s eighth. The tenth one Allen had already by King\u2019s indorsement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">We now come to the 6th <em>of </em>April, 1812, and more particularly to the Allen eighth. Possessed of these notes of Vint, in the spring of 1812, and King\u2019s deed to Vint having been duly executed and acknowledged, Allen is ready to carry out with Vint a full scheme; whether one devised originally to the full extent in whieh it was now executed, or in that full extent now first conceived and carried out, is unimportant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">And here it is to be noted that the deed of Allen and wife to Vint, though executed November 16th, 1810, does not appear to have left Allen\u2019s possession at that time. It was not acknowledged at that time, nor then recorded. On the contrary, on the 27th of April, 1812, eighteen mouths after its execution, two new witnesses attest it at the request of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Allen; </em>and it is not proved for record until the 7th of May, 1812.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">At this time Allen was not indebted to Vint except in a small amount shown by the Exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Vint admits in his affidavit made for Francis Smith, that his claim of $10,000 had been paid by Allen\u2019s sale to him of King\u2019s eighth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">The parties, therefore, except as to a small debt from Allen to Vint, as shown by Exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3, were unindebted to each other; each with one-eighth of the original estate, but Allen holding in his own hands a deed by which he convoyed his and his wife\u2019s eighth to Vint. Tlie parties were confederates, and dependent on each other. Each knew the fraud of the other. They now fell upon this device. Allen delivers to Vint the deed from himself and wife, conveying their interest to Vint, <em>in consideration whereof </em>Vint executes the contract of the 6th of April, 1812, by which Vint agrees to convey to the children of John Allen and Hannah his wife \u201c one-half of all the interest which he, the said John Vint, may have in the estate of William King, deceased, by a conveyance from John Allen and Hannah his wife, bearing date the 16th day of.November, 1810; and also by another conveyance from Samuel King and wife, bearing date the 1st day of January, 1811.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">Vint did not stipulate to reconvey to Allen\u2019s children the same interest that had been conveyed to him by Allen and wife. If he had done so, the fraud would be apparent upon the face of the two papers. But as this contract bore date two years subsequent to the date of the deeds, it had the appearance of a new. contract, one distinct from that of the deeds; and as this appearance would be strengthened by the conveyance of a different interest, they fell upon the device of conveying to the children a moiety of each of the interests conveyed to Vint by each of the two deeds. They sought to strengthen further this appearance of fairness by the nominal consideration of this contract. It will be observed that the consideration to be paid Vint by Allen is $14,450.63, which is precisely the half of the two sums men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tioned in the two deeds as their respective considerations.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The contract contained a clause that there should be a forfeiture of the contract if this sum was not paid in five years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-6\">If the arrangement bad stopped here Allen would not have got anything. Before he could have demanded the reconveyance, he would have had to pay $14,450.68, the estimated value of the interest. It would have been better for him, instead of doing this, to have permitted his life-interest to be taken by his creditors; since the fee simple \u25a0would have still remained to his children through their mother. It became necessary then to resort to another device to relieve Allen of this dilemma; and the device resorted to was this. Vint on the 7th of April, 1812 \u2014 one day after the date of the contract \u2014 gives a receipt to Allen for nearly the whole amount of the nominal consideration; acknowledging the receipt of $11,600, in part pay of the contract entered into on the preceding 6th, and declaring it to be on account of the estate of William King, deceased, and for the benefit of John Allen\u2019s heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-7\">It is admitted by Vint that the amount of nine of the notes given by him to King and now surrendered by Allen, was included in the $11,600, and that he supposed that Allen came by them honestly. That .this is false is plain. The notes were uuindorsed by any one. As to those payable to King\u2019s children, as the children were infants, they could be assigned only by order of court. When Vint received the notes he must have known them to have been stolen. Allen was the thief and Vint was the receiver of the goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-8\">But. to resume our history. After deducting the amount of the receipt from the nominal consideration expressed in this contract, there then remained a balance due from Allen, which he would have to pay before he could demand a conveyance from Vint of the interest stipulated for in the contract of 6th of April, 1812. The reason why the receipt did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>not cover the whole nominal consideration, but left this balance due, is explained by the circumstance that Allen was indebted to Vint on other transactions, which amounted to nearly this balance, and which were produced by Vint on that day in an account rendered, and dated the 6th of April, 1812, the date of this contract, wdth the interest calculated on the several items down to that day, which amount was acknowledged by Allen to be due. See the Exhibit No. 1, supra, p. 487. The amount due on this account added to the amount due on another account settled between the same parties, amounted to about $2600 (as appears by the Exhibit No. 3, <em>supra, </em>pp. 437-8), leaving a difference between this sum and the balance due as aforesaid on the nominal consideration of the contract of 6th April, 1812, of about $250. This difference was made by Vint, doubtless, with the intention to cover the interest that would accrue on the sum actually due between this day and the time when he would receive enough from William King\u2019s estate to pay it. By thus retaining this balance on the nominal consideration of this contract, it furnished Vint security for the amount really due him from Allen on these other transactions, and forced Allen to pay it before he or his children could get anything from the estate of William King under the contract of 6th April, 1812. This debt of Allen to Vint is again acknowledged by Allen on the 20th June, 1812, in Exhibit No. 2, <em>supra, </em>p. 437, and a lien given on his interest in William King\u2019s estate. He then had no interest except that secured by the contract of 6th April, 1812.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\">The case establishes, we submit, the following conclusions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-7\">That the deed of Allen and wife was not delivered to Vint until the contracto!\u2019 the 6th of April, 1812, and the receipt dated on the next day, were signed and delivered by Vint to Allen, and Allen delivered to Vint the notes which Vint had given to King; that the interchange of these papers was contemporaneous, and consequently that the said contract and receipt and the delivery of said bonds constitute the real consideration of the deed from Allen and wife to Vint; the consideration consisting in part of King\u2019s interest, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>cured by the combined fraud of Vint and Allen, which renders the deed from Allen and wife to Vint fraudulent and void. The extent to which this iuterest of King formed a part of the consideration, is not to be measured by the moneyed value of that interest at the time. It was the controlling inducement which led to the delivery of Allen\u2019s deed and the execution and delivery by Vint of this contract and receipt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">That no moneyed consideration passed between two such men as Allen and Vint is palpable, and is admitted by Vint in his answers to the cross-bills, though in his original bill he avers that the deed from Allen and wife was \u201c for the consideration of $18,901.27,\u201d and the deed from King and wife was \u201c for the consideration of $10,000.\u201d He thus proves his own averments to be false. Vint has, in fact, offered no explanation as to the true consideration of that deed, but has contented himself with a vague and general averment in his answer, that he fairly paid for the interest of John Allen and Hannah his wife; and this averment is made in response to special and searching interrogatories, calling on him to state the true consideration of this deed. This evasive answer, this ominous silence, should condemn the whole transaction, and stamp it with the fraud charged in the cross-bill, and not explained by a party cognizant of every circumstance, and the only party to these transactions then alive, and alone able to give the explanations called for. This, in a court of equity, is an admission of the fraud charged. To this should be added the facts that he suppressed the contract of the 6th of April, 1812, and the receipt of the 7th of that month, and claimed the whole of these two interests in his original and supplemental bills; and that every living party to these transactions, except Vint, was dead, when he filed his bill, twenty-seven years after the transactions occurred, asserting claim under the deed from Allen and wife and King and wife.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-7\"><em>Messrs. H. H. Wells and L. H. </em>Chandler, <em>contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\">I. <em>As to jurisdiction. </em>Vint\u2019s title at the outset depended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>upon the construction of a trust exclusively within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. The relief which he asked was a partition and a restraining order or injunction against the assignment of any portion of this estate to the heirs-at-law of King and Allen. The established rule is that it is not enough that the party has a possible remedy at law, or even a convenient remedy, but that to divest the equitable jurisdiction of the court, the legal remedy must be an adequate one, and it must be as convenient as the remedy that a court of equity affords.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In fact, as Vint\u2019s title was but equitable \u2014the legal estate having been decided by this court to have been in the nephew<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> \u2014 he could not have maintained ejectment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\">In addition, the case does not stand upon the original and supplemental bill, but the defendants have filed cross-bills, impeaching for alleged fraud the conveyances under which the complainant claims. The complainant has answered. Issues peculiarly appropriate for chancery have thus been raised by the families of Samuel King and Mrs. Allen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-7\">II. <em>Assurrting that jurisdiction to review </em>exists, <em>how much of the case beloio is to be reviewed? </em>No part, we suppose, but that relating to the purchase-inoney paid upon the contract of April 6th, 1812; the question whether it was paid. The decree made in 1853 was final. It decreed that the deed from Allen and wife to Vint, dated November 16th, 1810, was valid; that the deed from King and wife to Vint, dated January 1st, 1811, was void, and denied the prayer of the cross-bills for specific performance of the contract between Alien and Vint dated April 6th, 1812. Those were the only questions which the pleadings, as they then stood, did, or could in fact raise. No other question touched in any manner the title to the property, nor has any question since been presented affecting that title. In short, the decree of 1853 decided the right of property in contest, and no appeal having been taken from that decree for nineteen years, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>court is now without jurisdiction to review it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The complainant was entitled to have that decree immediately carried into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-6\">III. If, however, the decree of 1853 was not final, and the same, so far as respects the Allen part, is now subject to review, we say that there was no error in the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">1. There were no unexplained <em>laches.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-8\">Until the determination of the question, whether Samuel King and Hannah Allen took any estate under the will of their brother, there was no necessity, nor any propriety, in fact, in Vint\u2019s instituting a suit to recover the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-9\">In the ascertainment of that question there was no delay, because a suit was pending and not decided, in this court, until 1830. Vint did not make himself a party to that suit, and could not, because it was an action of ejectment to recover possession of a definite portion of the estate which had not been apportioned or divided, and in which Vint had no right to any particular part; nor was there any necessity that he should do so, because the suit being between parties from whom Vint, Allen, aiid Kjng\u2019s beirs alike claimed title, they were all privies, and would be bound by the judgment of the court therein. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-10\">2. As <em>to merits. </em>The whole of the opposite case rests on the assumption that King was at Abingdou January 1st, 1811, under Allen\u2019s influence, and that Allen by fraud \u00e1nd duress coerced him to make the deed to Vint. But\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-11\">1st. When King came, in 1812, to claim his annuity, he claimed annuity for two years; one due January 1st, 1811, and the other due now, January 1st, 1812; and Allen told him that under his brother\u2019s will be could not get the one for January 1st, 1811, because he had not then claimed it. The fact that he did not claim it on the 1st of January, 1811, tends to show that he was not at Abingdon at that date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-12\">2d. The deed made January 1st, 1812, is by Samuel King and <em>his toife. </em>It is not shown nor alleged that she then or ever left her home in Kentucky.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The case of the opposite side assumes, in addition, an enormous scheme of fraud. When such a scheme is relied on \u2014 a gigantic scheme, involving an immense mechanism, carried on by two parties through two or three years \u2014 plain proof should be made, at least of the leading facts. Such proof is not made. Because such a scheme is imaginable by an active fancy and is actually imagined by the opposite counsel, it does not follow that Vint and Allen imagined it, still less that they earned it out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-6\">Reliance is placed in the argument of opposite counsel upon the fact that Vint \u201csuppressed\u201d \u2014 that is to say, that he did not produce and set forth in his bill \u2014 the contract of the 6th of April, 1812, and the receipt of the 7th, and that he claimed the whole of the two-eighths.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-7\">The argument assumes that those two papers not only were really, but also that they were known and felt by Vint to be, at the time that he filed his bill, still operative and obligatory papers; assumes, in other words, that he meant in filing his hill to commit a fraud. But is not that a matter to be proved? By the fijrms of the contract the rights of Allen\u2019s children under it ceased, unless the contract on their side was carried out within five years; that is to say, unless it was carried out by the year 1817. Was it, in truth, A.D. 1838 an obligatory paper? The question raised one of the nicest points in scientific equity; that is to say, how far time is of the essence of a contract? The general rule is that a party who comes into equity to enforce a contract must not have been guilty of laches, and that on the contrary he must have shown himself \u201c ready, desirous, prompt, and eager.\u201d There was raised, in addition, and independent of the matter of time, the difficult question of mutual and dependent covenants; and how far the failure of Jelf to pay his note for $2333, which had been received at the time as cash, and how far the failure of Allen to pay certain debts of Vint\u2019s which he had promised to pay for him, reduced the receipt of April 7th to nothing. These things, according to Vint\u2019s answer to the cross-bill of Allen\u2019s heirs, largely made ,up the receipt. Was Allen, in filing a bill A.D. 1838, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>plainly and necessarily bound to know and to feel that the paper still bound him ? If he was not, he was not bound to say anything about it. A pleader is expected to state his own case, and to state it as strongly as he can. He is uot bound to anticipate all objections to it and then to show those objections to be unfounded. Suppose that in fact the contract did not, owing to lapse of time, bind him when he filed his bill. What would have been thought of a bill which, after setting out the deed toYint, then added: \u201cIt is true indeed that there was a contract? &amp;c.. . . and, after setting out the contract <em>in extenso, </em>then went on to show perhaps <em>in extension, </em>for each severally, a hundred and one reasons why it had no longer any force? Who ever heard of such pleading, either at law or in equity ? It would have been in plain violation of the fundamental rules of pleading; rules as ancient as the common law itself,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2021\u2020and taught in elementary text-books.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> When treating \u201c Of the Principal Rules of Pleading,\u201d Serjeant Stephen gives one thus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-6\">\u201c3. <em>It is not necessary to state matter which would come more properly from the other side.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-7\">And, commenting on it, says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-8\">\u201c The meaning is, that it is not necessary to anticipate the answer of the adversary; which, according to Hale, C. J., is Mike leaping before one comes to the stile.\u2019<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> It is sufficient that each pleading should in itself contain a good <em>prima facie </em>case, without reference to possible objections not yet urged.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-9\">The transactions to be passed on are very ancient, complicated, and obscure. Matters may have got mixed up. The consideration of one deed may have been mistaken for that of another. Vint\u2019s notes were perhaps not the consideration for the deed from King. Proofs cannot be given as of recent things. It is plain, however, that Yint did have property in 1810; a large assortment of store goods. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>witnesses, Bussell and Stout, both prove this by their testimony, supra, pp. 425-6. Allen was reported to have bought these goods. No doubt he did. It is plain, too, that they had other transactions. The exhibits, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, <em>supra, </em>pp. 437-8, show this. Suppose that Vint was at one time in jail. Does that prove that he may not have previously had control over a large amount of goods and sold them to Allen ? He may have been imprisoned for the price of those very goods. And how does the fact that Allen was in jail with him bear on the case? it being confessed that Allen owned a life estate in his wife\u2019s eighth of her brother\u2019s estate, and that she owned the fee, and both having conveyed to Vint ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-6\">Even if Vint had wanted candor in not stating the fact of the contract and receipt, of April 6th and 7th, how does that show that the deed of the 6th was without consideration ?</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-12\"> Finlay and Mitchell v.

The appellees claim that it is confined to an examination of the question of the return of the purchase-money paid upon the contract of April 6th, 1812, while the appellants insist that the appeal reaches back and includes the decree of September 24th, 1853, so far as it relates to that part of the case in which they are interested. All agree that our inquiries are limited to the Allen title. The King title was disposed of adversely to the appellees in 1853, and they have not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">In 1853 the court determined that it would not decree a cancellation of the Allen deed, and would not order a specific performance by Vint of his contract. This determination it caused to be recorded, but at the same time declared that it could not then make a final disposition of the whole cause, because it did not have before it all the parties necessary for that purpose. In 1872, wheu the cause was ready for final hearing, the court accepted this recorded opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>as settling the rights of the parties, so far as it went, and then proceeded to consider the question which had not been determined. Upon this hearing that question was decided against the complainants in the cross-bill, and then a final decree was entered denying the relief asked by the defendants. This ended the case in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Cases cannot be brought to this court upon appeal in parcels. We must have the whole of a case or none. The court below must settle all the merits before we can accept jurisdiction. Appeals will lie, as has been frequently held, when nothiug remains to be done except to enforce and give effect to what has been decreed, but until all the rights of the parties have been fiually passed upon and settled this cannot be the condition of a cause. Nothing must be left below when an appeal is taken but to execute the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">That was not the condition of this case in 1853. An appeal then would have left the question of the return of the purchase-money undetermined. The rights of the parties as presented by the pleadings were not all settled. The powers of the court belowT were not all exhausted. If the remaining question had been settled in accordance with the prayer of the cross-bill the present appellants might have been satisfied and the appeal saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the decree of 1853 w\u2019as not final so far as it respects the Allen title, and that the appeal brings up the whole of that part of the case for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">It is first insisted by the appellants that a court of equity has no jurisdiction of the case, and that for this reason the bill should now be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">So far as we can discover from the record, this objection is raisetd here for the first time. The transactions out of which this case arises occurred sixty-five years ago, or thereabouts. The estate of William King has been the subject of litigation in some form or other during all that time. This particular, suit was commenced thirty-six years ago and more. It is high time it was ended. At any rate, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>are uot inclined to add to its length of years by looking after mere form in order to avoid substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">This brings us to the case upon its facts. The record is voluminous, but to our minds the controlling facts are few. In a court of conscience deliberate concealment is equivalent to deliberate falsehood. 'x When a living man speaks in such a court to enforce a dead man\u2019s contract with himself against parties who he knows are ignorant of the facts, he must be frank in his statements, unless he is willing to take the risk of presumptions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In this case Vint waited until both Allen and his wife were dead before he attempted in any manner to assert his claim. This he had the legal right to do. His laches is not a bar, but it is still a fact, and when it is remembered that some of the parties he is now pursuing were not born until after his rights, if any he has, accrued, this silent fact has all the effect of positive statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The rights of Samuel King\u2019s heirs are not before us for adjudication, but the facts upon which their rights depend cannot easily be separated from those we must consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Allen and Vint seem to have been almost inseparable when the transactions we are to pass upon occurred. King was a man of intemperate habits. His brother, William King, from whom the property in controversy came, made provision in his will for the payment to him of the sura of $150 annually, so long as he lived, in ease he applied for it personally to the manager of the salt-works at Saltville, or the executor of the will at Abingdon, on the first day of January in each year. His personal receipt was required, and the payment for the year was to be forfeited if not called for on the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">He lived in Kentucky, and Allen and Vint at Abingdon. His contract to sell to Vint bears- date January 1st, 1811. That was the day he was required to be at Saltville or Abingdon to receive his annuity. The contract was witnessed by Allen and wife, and the notes given for the purchase-money, all bearing that date, were witnessed by Allen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The note first falling due was assigned by him to Allen on the 2d of January, 1811, the day after its date. From these admitted facts the conclusion is irresistible that King was in Virginia when the contract was made, and that Allen must have been cognizant of it, if not active in bringing it about.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In January, 1812, King W\u2019as again at Abingdon. While there he staid at Allen\u2019s house. In the month of February, or the forepart of March, he started for his home iu Kentucky. He stopped for the night at a house about sixty miles from Abingdon, and was never afterwards seen. He left his saddle-bags at the house where he stopped, and these were afterwards taken to Allen\u2019s house and opened by Allen\u2019s wife. When opened they were found to contain his clothing and a pocket-book. In the pocket-book were papers, but no money.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The deed from the Allens to Vint bears date November 16th, 1810, and was executed by Mrs. Allen on that day. It was not proved for record until May 7th, 1812. Its execution appears first to have been attested by three witnesses, and then, on the 27th April, 1812, at the request of Allen, by two more. The presumption is, therefore, that it had not been delivered before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">On the 6th April, 1812, Vint made his contract for the conveyance to Allen\u2019s children of one-half of the property covered by the two deeds. On the next day Vint executed his receipt for the payment of $11,600, part of the purchase-money. Part of this payment consisted of nine out of the ten notes given by Vint for the purchase of the King interest. It cannot for a moment be doubted that Allen had no title to these notes, and that Vint knew it. So far as appears by the testimony none of them were indorsed when surrendered, and seven out of the nine were payable to the children of King. The disappearance of King caused much excitement at the time, and was extensively known. The persons at whose house he stopped for the night had been suspected of his murder. Allen was poor, and in the summer following he and Vint were in jail together for debt. In the face of all these circumstances it is impossible to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>lieve that Vint told the truth when in his answer to the cross-bill of Findlay he stated that he received the notes \u201c as he believed from one who had a right to their possession, and whose right to transfer them to him was unquestionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">As has been seen, Allen\u2019s deed could not have been delivered until after the 27th April, 1812. The presumption is, therefore, that payment for the property had not been made previous to that time. Allen was not a man to be trusted, even by Vint, with so large a payment as the nominal consideration required without a delivery of the deed. The deed had been drawn with great care, as the scrivener testifies, because the transaction was important. If the contract had been fully consummated in good faith at its date, there can scarcely be a doubt that the deed would have been at once perfected and proved for record. This, as we think, disposes of the theory that the property had been paid for by Vint with his stock of goods in 1810. Vint did not set up any such claim in any of his answers, and most assuredly he would have done so if it had been true. Besides that, no satisfactory testimony has been adduced in support of the claim. The only witnesses who testify upon the subject speak very indefinitely, and one of them makes some statements which are directly contradicted by well-established facts. In September, 1812, Vint himself stated, in an affidavit, \u201cthat on or about the 16th November, 1810, he purchased from Alien all his interest in the estate of William King, deceased, and after that, purchased from Allen all of the interest of Samuel King in said estate, for which he was to give and did give credit on a debt due from' him to affiant for $10,000.\u201d There is nothing here about a payment in goods, and besides, according to the affidavit, the King purchase entered as much into the credit as did that of the Allen interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">But still more important is the absolute refusal of Vint to disclose the facts in his answers when directly called upon to do so. It is true that'he need not make the statements unless he chose. The law under the form of pleadings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>this case did not compel him to be more specific, but it can raise presumptions against him if he is not. He may, if he pleases, rest his case upon the acknowledgment of payment expressed in his deeds, but if he does he must take the chances of being overcome by other facts and circumstances which repel the presumption arising from such evidence. In this case the circumstances are emphatic. He slept upon his rights for a quarter of a century; he waited for every actor in the premises except himself to die; in all the litigation affecting his interests he never appeared so long as there was one alive who could speak against him from actual knowledge of the facts, and during all the time he permitted his adversaries to assume and represent his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">But we are not inclined to pursue this inquiry further. To our-minds it is clear that in April, 1812, when the transactions upon which the rights of the parties depend, were completed, it was well understood by all that the original interest of Mrs. Allen in the estate of her brother had been in some form secured to her children. It is quite possible it may also have been understood that Vint was to have a lien upon it by way of security for the payment of some debt owing to him; but it is certain, as we think, that it wTas never intended he should hold it as owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">When, therefore, Vint came into court and asserted his absolute title as against the ignorant heirs of these deceased contracting parties, and wilfully concealed his contract for a reconveyance and the receipt which belonged to it, he came with unclean hands and must suffer the consequences. He does not excuse himself for this attempted fraud by pleading defect of memory, but claims boldly that he was not required to tell all he knew; that his duty was at an end when, selecting his own facts, he presented his own ease. It is true he had the right to select that way of coming into court, but having deliberately made his selection he ought not to be surprised if he finds that he is received with suspicion. Honesty of purpose prompts frankness of statement. Concealment is indicative of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">If Allen and Vint were the only parties interested in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>controversy the case would be different. They have been partners in fraud and neither can claim a preference over the other on account of honesty of purpose or fairness in dealing. But Allen\u2019s interest in the property was only that of a tenant for life. The real owner was his wife, and upon her death her children succeeded to her rights. It is the title of these children that Vint now attempts to defeat. By his own admissions in commencing his proceedings against them he concealed the truth. He thus in effect confesses that he relied to some extent for his success upon their ignorance. After years of groping in the dark, they were able to confront him with the facts and, as we think, to defeat the case he has attempted to make against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Decree reversed, and the cause-remanded with instructions to enter a decree dismissing the bill of the complainants and granting the prayer oe the cross-bill for a cancellation of the deed from Allen and wife to Vint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
