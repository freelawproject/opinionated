The court, having tried the cause without a jury, held the tax illegal and a recovery was had.

As to. wholesale dealers, the seventy-ninth section, as amended, enacted thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-16\">\u201c Wholesale dealers, whose annual sales do not exceed $50,000, shall pay $50; and if their annual sales exceed $50,000, for every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>additional \u00a71000 in excess of $50,000, they shall pay $1. . . .

It was shown \u2014 the testimony of the plaintiffs themselves showing this \u2014 that four manufacturing corporations, two of them having their factories at Nashua, New Hampshire, and chartered by that State, and two of them having their factories at Waltham and Clinton, in Massachusetts, and chartered by the latter State, and all manufacturing cotton goods, had the same general office in Boston, where they held their meetings, transacted their business, and kept their records, and where they kept a common clerk and a common treasurer. The latter was the chief executive officer, buying all the raw material and making the other purchases for the corporations, taking care of their finances, and under the respective boards (which consisted of substantially the same persons) managing and controlling the affairs of the several corporations, their agents and servants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">Between these corporations respectively and the plaintiffs, who were a mercantile firm, transacting business in Boston, under the name of Tucker &amp; Co., there were separate agreements, either in writing or by parol, that the plaintiffs should sell <em>all </em>the goods manufactured by each corporation, for a fixed percentage on the amount of sales, and the course of business of the plaintiffs under and in pursuance of these agreements was as follows, that is to say: The plaintiffs had a store in Boston, which they hired in their own names, and for which they paid the rent, with clerks, bookkeepers, and other servants whom they employed.and paid. In this store was a counting-room, in which their business was transacted, and chambers where samples of goods manufactured by the corporations were kept. No goods except sample-bales and packages were there kept, unless occasionally some goods which had been- mis-sent, or for some reason had not been accepted by a customer, found their way there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">The plaintiffs were known to be the agents of these corporations, to sell their goods, and they sold- only the goods of these corporations, and their course of business was as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>follows: They were kept informed daily of what was manufactured at the several mills, and made sales to purchasers as opportunity offered. They kept in their office a different set of books for each of the corporations, and when a sale of any of the goods of any of the corporations was effected, an entry of the fact was made in the books of that corporation, and they informed the manufacturing agent at the mill of such corporation (where all the goods were stored as they were manufactured) to send such goods to the purchaser. The goods were then packed at the mill, and directed to the purchaser, and forwarded to Boston by rail, where a truck-man, employed and paid by the plaintiffs, received them and delivered them to the purchaser, if in Boston, or at the steamboat landing or railroad station, if the goods were to be sent elsewhere. The freight by rail, from the mill to Boston, was paid by the plaintiffs, and was, with the expense of truckage, charged by them to the respective corporations. When sufficient time had elapsed after the sale for the delivery of the goods, the plaintiffs seut to the purchaser a bill of the goods in their own names, separate bills being rendered for the goods of each corporation, and not as agents, and in due course, when they were settled, receipted the bills in their own names, and not as agents. When the bills were paid in cash, the money was received by the plaintiffs and deposited in bank in their own names; and if on any given day money was received from sales of the goods of the different corporations, such money was mingled together and deposited by the plaintiffs in their own names. If the bills were settled by notes, the notes were made payable either to the order of the makers, and by them iudorsed, or to the order of the particular corporation whose goods were sold. The plaintiffs did not put their names upon any such notes, nor did they guarantee any of their sales. They delivered these notes from time to time to the treasurer, and from time to time paid him money, and every month settled their account with each corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">The plaintiffs had a branch house in New York, and an ageucy iu Philadelphia, and the sales in New York and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Philadelphia were reported to the Boston house, and deliveries and collections were made as to such sales in the same manner as in sales at the Boston house. Such sales were not included in their returns to the assessor at Boston, and no part of the taxes which this action was brought to recover was paid upon such sales at New York and Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">It was proved also that the several corporations had paid what is called the \u201c manufacturers\u2019 tax\u201d \u2014 a tax of five per cent. \u2014 upon all the goods that were sold by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">Upon this evidence adduced by the plaintiffs, the defendant moved for judgment on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-8\">1st. Admitting all that was attempted to be proved, it manifestly appeared that the plaiutiffs were wholesale dealers within the meaning of the law, and so liable to pay the tax collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-9\">2d. That the sales made by the plaintiffs were not sales made by the manufacturing corporations within the meaning of the law; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-10\">3d. If the sales were made by the plaiutiffs as agents of the manufacturing corporations, within the meaning of the law, they were not made at the place of manufacture, nor at the principal office or place of business of the corporations, but were made at the store of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-11\">The court overruled the motion and ordered judgment to be entered for the plaiutiffs for the full amount claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-12\">This judgment was of course to be reversed if, upon the evidence as disclosed, the defendants in error were either wholesale dealers or commercial brokers within the act. In the one case they could have recovered nothiug, in the other only one-half of what they did recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-13\">If on the contrary they were neither \u201c wholesale dealers,\u201d nor <em>\u201c </em>commercial brokers,\u201d within the act; or if the sales were sales made by the manufacturers at the place of production and at their principal office or place of business\u2014 no samples being kept there \u2014 the judgment would be to be affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Mr. JEL. D. </em>Hyde, <em>in support of the judgment below:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-6\">The judgment below should be affirmed. A corporation can only act through agents, and the defendants were the agents of the several corporations for selling their goods. That they were such agents appears from their course of dealing and from the admitted fact that \u201c there were separate agreements, either in writing or by parol, that the defendants should sell <em>all </em>the goods manufactured by each corporation for a fixed percentage on the amount of sales.\u201d The ownership or possession of the goods never passed from the several corporations to the defendants. The transactions of each corporation were kept on separate books; separate bills of the goods of each corporation when sold were rendered; all expenses of transportation were paid by the respective corporations; and all notes taken for the payment of goods sold were the property of each corporation, and were delivered to its treasurer. The defendants \u201cwere known to be the agents of these corporations to sell their goods.\u201d An action could have been maintained by or against the several corporations upon the contract of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">If the defendants were the agents of the respective corporations for selling their goods, were the goods sold at such a place that no tax could be assessed upon the sales? It is admitted that only samples were kept at the place of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-8\">The defendants sold <em>all </em>the goods of each corporation; none were sold at the place of production or manufacture. The only place where their goods were sold was the place where the defendants sold them. This place was, then, not only their principal office or place of business for selling, but it was their only office or place of business for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-9\">The purpose of a corporation in manufacturing goods is that it may sell them, and thereby make a profit. The goods are manufactured to sell, and, after they are manufactured, the principal business is to sell them. It is hardly fair to suppose that Congress intended to distinguish between the relative importance of the duties of the treasurer and selling agent of a corporation, but that the corporation having paid the \u201c manufacturers\u2019 tax,\u201d five per cent., upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>its production, should be allowed to sell its own goods, through its own agents, at the place of production, or at its office or principal place of business for selling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-6\">It may be argued that the defendants sold goods in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, and that it does not appear which of the three was the principal place, or at which place the largest amount was sold. But it can hardly be supposed that Congress intended that, if a corporation manufactured goods in Maine, it should not have a right to sell them through their own agents at a recognized place of business in each of these cities upon the same terms; and that if it had an office and agent for selling in Boston, it could not have an additional office and agent for selling in New York, without paying in the latter place a tax of one dollar per thousand upon all its sales. In the present case, the goods upon which the tax was collected were all sold in Boston, and all sales passed through the books of the Boston house, and their place of business was the principal one for sales.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-7\">It is asserted by the government that if the defendants were not required to pay the tax of one dollar per thousand on all sales made by them as wholesale dealers, they were liable to pay one-half of that amount as \u201c commercial brokers.\u201d This we admit, provided that they were not exempt as previously shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-8\">A wholesale dealer is a commission merchant who has possession of goods and sells them, one \u201c whose business it is for <em>himself </em>or on commission to sell or offer for sale any goods,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-9\">A commercial broker is one \u201c whose business it is, as the <em>\u25a0agent </em>of <em>others, </em>as a broker to negotiate sales or purchases of goods,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-10\">The defendants were never commission merchants; and if they were not the selling agents they were only brokers, negotiating sales for their principals, and should only have been taxed as such. The distinction between a \u201c wholesale dealer\u201d and a \u201ccommercial broker\u201d is as marked and distinct as it is between a commission merchant and a broker.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\n<em>Mr. G.

Congress evidently intended to tax as \u201cwholesale dealers\u201d as well those who sold goods as commission merchants as those who sold on their own account; always excepting manufacturers, selling at the place of manufacture, or by sample at their principal office and place of business. The intention is equally evident to tax as \u201ccommercial brokers\u201d those who, as brokers merely, negotiated sales or purchases for others, and not in their own names nor on their own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u00a5e are clearly of opinion that the evidence propounded by the plaintiffs showed that the sales were not the sales of the corporations made by the plaintiffs as mere agents, much less that they were made at the principal office or place of business of the corporations. The latter had an office and place of business of their own where their principal executive officer managed their executive and financial operations, and to which any persons having business with the corporations would naturally go. On the contrary, the store of the plaintiffs was their own store, hired and furnished by themselves. The clerks employed in it were their own clerks. All the expenses were paid by themselves. The business was carried on in their own names. The sales were made, and the bills made out, in their names. The money arising from the sales was paid to them and deposited to their account. They charged regular commissions on the sales. It is true they sold by sample, and did not keep the goods in their store; but that did not make the sales any less their own. Persons selling their own goods often do the same. But, though they did not keep the goods at their store, and though, as sales were made, the goods by their direction were put up at the mill and directed to the purchasers, yet they were sent to and received by the plaintiffs; who de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>livered them if the purchasers were in Boston, or shipped them if the purchasers resided elsewhere.. The goods passed through their hands before the purchaser received them. They came into their possession as soon as it was necessary to enable them to fulfil their contracts of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In our opinion, therefore, the plaintiffs were commission merchants, and chargeable as such with the tax in question as \u201cwholesale dealers.\u201d The difference between a factor or commission merchant and a broker is stated by all the books to be this: a factor may buy and sell in his own name, and he has the goods in his possession; while a broker, as such, cannot ordinarily buy or sell in his own name, and has no possession of the goods sold.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The plaintiffs made the sales themselves, in their own names, at their own store, and on commission, and had possession of the goods as soon as the sales were made, and delivered or shipped them to their customers. This course of business clearly constituted them commission merchants as contradistinguished from mere brokers or agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The fact that the corporations paid the manufacturing tax of five per cent, on the same goods is of no consequence at all in deciding the case. The tax in question was not imposed upon the corporations, but upon the commission merchants, as a tax on their business. It woqld even have been imposed on the corporations themselves if they had sold the goods in any other manner than as provided in the seventy-fourth section of the act, namely, at the place of manufacture, or, by sample, at their principal office and place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">We are of opinion, therefore, that upon the evidence adduced, the court ought to have given judgment for the defendant instead of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Judgment reversed, with directions to award</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">A VENIRE DE NOVO.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Mr. Justice FIELD dissented from the judgment, being of opinion that the plaintiffs were not wholesale dealers, either within the common acceptation of the terms or the meaning of the statute.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\"> See Story on Sales, <em>\u00a7 </em>91; Story on Agency, \u00a7 34; 2 Kent, 622, note; and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
