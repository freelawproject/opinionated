For this sum of $690.11 he brought suit against the United States in the Court of Claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-10\">The court awarded to him the amount claimed, and the United States appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-11\">\n<em>Mr. G. H. Williams, Attorney-General, and Mr. John Go-forth, Assistant Attorney-General, for the United States :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-12\">It was at his own request that Captain Williamson was relieved from duty, <em>i. e., </em>from command of a company in the Sixth Regiment of Infantry, and from that time up to December 31st, 1870, the date when he was mustered out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>service, be was absent from duty, ceasing to perform any military service or to actively exercise the functions or authority of an officer of the army of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-5\">He was absent from duty with leave, being neither sick nor wounded; whether he technically asked for a leave of absence <em>eo nomine, </em>or whether, within the spirit of the law, he elected to be placed on waiting orders. The act itself merely says, \u201c absent from duty with leave;\u201d absent \u2014 not necessarily by means of \u201c a leave of absence,\u201d so called, but absent from duty with leave, howsoever that absence from duty was accomplished, if according to law and the regulations. There can be but two classes of officers under this head: those who are actively performing military duties, <em>i. e., </em>in charge of some military business, and those from whom all functions of a military character are withheld by the operation pf absence from duty. Here there was an officer placed in command of a company of infantry \u2014 that is to sajq ordered to the performance of military service \u2014 who elected to- be placed on waiting orders, i. <em>e., </em>to be absent from all such duties, and he now demands the same pay and allowances when his request is acceded to that he would have been entitled to bad he been actually and actively on duty. The act of March 3d, 1863, says that in case of absence he shall receive \u201c but half of the pay and allowances prescribed by law, and no more,\u201d and, as he has received these, he has no further claim on the United States.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>Mr. II. M Paine, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b419-13\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 736.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-12\">15 Stat. at Large, 318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b422-7\">Mr. Justice HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"A5R5\">delivered the opinion of the court. The argument against the allowance of full pay is based upon the act of March 3d, .1863, which provides \u201c that any officer absent from duty with leave, except from sickness or wounds, shall during his absence, receive half of the pay and allowances prescribed by law, and no more.\u201d Captain Williamson, it is said, was, during the period in question, absent from duty with leave, being neither sick nor wounded, and hence, it is said, can receive but half-pay, however that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>absence might have been caused. This argument is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The distinction between the case of an officer \u201c absent from duty with leave\u201d and that of an officer ordered to proceed to a particular place and there \u201cto await orders, reporting thence by letter to the Adjutant-General of the Army and to these headquarters,\u201d is too plain to require much comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">While absent from duty \u201c with leave,\u201d the officer is at liberty to go where he will during the permitted absence, to employ his time as he pleases, and to surrender his leave if he chooses.- If he reports himself at the expiration of his leave, it is all that can be asked of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The obligations of an officer directed to proceed to a place specified, there to await orders, are quite different. It is his duty to go to that place and to remain at that place. He cannot go elsewhere; he cannot return until ordered. He is as much under orders, and can no more question the duty of obedience than if ordered to an ambush to lie in wait for the enemy, to march to the front by a particular direction, or to the rear by a specified time.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The authority to give leave of absence is committed by law to particular persons; the mode of making the application for leave is pointed out and the maximum of its duration is prescribed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A department commander can grant leave of absence for a period not exceeding sixty days. Applications for leave exceeding four months must be referred to the War Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The direction, on the other hand, to proceed to a particular place, there to await orders, how long to remain there, to attack, to retreat, or to do any other specified thing, belongs to the officer in charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">That the assignment was made at the request of the officer can make no difference. The pay is regulated by the position, and not by the manner or influence by which the position is acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Captain Williamson was ordered by the Adjutant-General of the Department of Missouri, by authority of the General of the Army, to proceed to his home and await orders, reporting thence by letter to the Adjutant-General of the Army, and to these headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The power to make this assignment was a portion of the executive authority, and was vested in the commander of the army. Captain Williamson was not only justified in obeying this order, but it was his duty to obey it. It was his duty to proceed at once to his home, there to remain, subject to orders to be communicated to him. He was expressly required by general order to make no application for special duty, but was informed that if his services were required a detail would be made without his application. He did proceed to his home and there remained waiting for orders until he was mustered out of the service. He was waiting orders, in pursuance of law, but was not absent from duty on leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">It is not in the power of the executive department, or any branch of it, to reduce the pay of an officer of the army. The regulation of the compensation of the officers of the army belongs to the legislative department of the government. Congress has fixed the pay of a captain of infantry at $165 per month. The deduction of one-half of the amount, when absent from duty on leave, is not applicable to the case of Captain Williamson. He is entitled to his full pay as a captain of infantry. The Court of Claims has done right, therefore, in giving its award in his favor for the amount withheld, and its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\"> Army Register, 1863, Article 21, adopted by the act of July 28th, 1866.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
