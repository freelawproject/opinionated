Sandusky appeared on the 5th September and, denying the allegations against him in the petition, demanded a trial by jury. This demand was afterwards withdrawn by his attorney, and, on the 30th January, 1872, he was in due form adjudged by the court a bankrupt. Afterwards an assignee, one J. G. English, was chosen and qualified, who proceeded with the settlement of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">On the 9th December, 1873, Sandusky served upon the bank a notice, entitling it, <em>11 In the matter of the petition of the First National Bank of Indianapolis </em>v. <em>Harvey Sandusky, in </em>bankruptcy,\u201d and giving to the bank notice that \u201c on the 10th of December, 1873, at 10 o\u2019clock a.m., before the Honorable S.

The assignee did not answer. Testimony was taken, and on the 12th June, 1874, after full hearing, the petition was dismissed. Sandusky then prayed an appeal to the Circuit Court, which was allowed, and on 25th June that court affirmed the judgment of the District Court. He then appealed to this court. It was this appeal which it was now moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-8\">\n<em>'Mr. William, Tod Otto, in support of his motion,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZM\">argued that the supervisory jurisdiction vested in the Circuit Court of the United States, by the first clause of the second section of the Bankrupt Act, had been fully considered by this court and its exemption from any appellate control determined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>several well-known eases; <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020that these cases decide that from a decree of the Circuit Court, rendered in exercising such jurisdiction, no appeal lies to this court; that such jurisdiction, by the terms of that clause, extends to \u201c all cases and questions arising under the act, except when special provision is otherwise made;\u201d and that no special provision is made for any appellate jurisdiction over the finding and decision of a District Court on a petition in involuntary bankruptcy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>Mr. J.

To authorize an appeal to this court from the judgment or decree of a Circuit Court reviewing the action of a District Court under its bankruptcy jurisdiction, the case must be one in which an appeal may be taken from the District to the Circuit Court; that is to say, it must be a case in equity arising under or authorized by the Bankrupt Act.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In our opinion this is not.such a case. A proceeding in bankruptcy from the time of its commencement, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>filing of a petition to obtain the benefit of the act, until the final settlement of the estate of the bankrupt, is but one suit. The District Court, for all the purposes of its bankruptcy jurisdiction, is always open. It has no separate terms. Its proceedings in any pending suit are, therefore, at all times open for re-examination upon application therefor in an appropriate form. Any order made in the progress of the cause may be subsequently set aside and vacated upon proper showing made, provided rights have not become vested.under it which will be disturbed by its vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Applications for such re-examination may be made by motion or petition, according to the circumstances of the case. Such a motion or petition will not have the effecf of a new suit, but of a proceeding in the old one.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In this case Sandusky had been adjudged a bankrupt in a suit to which he was a party. He desired to have that adjudication set aside, and accordingly filed his petition in the District Court for that purpose. This petition' was filed in the original cause. It was in no sense whatever a bill in equity to impeach the adjudication for fraud. It had none of the forms of such a bill. On the contrary, it had all the forms of a' petition for a rehearing in the original suit, and at the express request of Sandusky was filed as a petition in that suit. It thus became part of the proceedings in bankruptcy, from which it cannot be separated. No appeal could be taken from the whole proceeding, and consequently none can be taken from this as one of its parts. The only remedy provided for the correction of errors in such cases is to be found in the supervisory jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts under the provisions of the first clause of the second section of the Bankrupt Act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> From the decisions of the Circuit Court in the exercise of that jurisdiction no appeal lies to this court. It has been many times so decided.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"A-i\"> Revised Statutes, \u00a7 4980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> Revised Statutes, \u00a7 4976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> Morgan <em>v. </em>Thornhill, 11 Wallace, 65; Hall <em>v. </em>Allen, 12 Id. 454; Mead <em>v. </em>Thompson, 15 Id. 638; Marshall <em>v. </em>Knox, 16 Id. 555; Coit <em>v. </em>Robinson, 19 Id. 285; Stickney <em>v. </em>Wilt, <em>supra, </em>150.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
