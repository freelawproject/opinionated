There does not seem to be room for doubt that \u201c moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens\u201d \u2014 the term used in the act of Congress of 1868 and in the act of Pennsylvania of 1870 \u2014 means private investments other than in stocks or securities. It refers doubtless to loans upon bond and mortgage; loans upon collaterals whether real or personal, and to other loans made in the various modes in which individuals invest their capital upon interest other than in corporation stocks and public securities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-10\">But by the act of Pennsylvania of April 4th, 1868, this \u201cother moneyed capital in the hands of individuals\u201d residing in Cumberland County (in which is the borough of Carlisle), where this bank whose shares are taxed is located and where Hepburn resides, was not subject to taxation for school purposes. Does not, then, this National bank stock come directly within the express restriction of the act of Congress of February 10th, 1868? Did not the taxation made in this case unfairly and unjustly discriminate .against it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-11\"><em>2. </em>But if we are mistaken in this, we say next that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>assessment should have valued the stock at its par value, and not at a value above it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-5\">The tax assessed upon \u201cother moneyed capital in the hands of individuals'\u201d by the State of Pennsylvania is upon the par or nominal value of such capital. If money be at interest on bond or mortgage, at three, four, five, or six per cent, interest per annum, the tax of three mills on the dollar is the same in each case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-6\">Yet the securities would have quite different market values. <em>Coder is paribus, </em>the first three would be below par, the last at or perhaps above it. So, too, when the rate of interest is full, it is the same, too, whether the security be a first mortgage of the highest class \u2014 such as would sell in the market above par \u2014 or a second mortgage of inferior grade, which could not be sold but at a large discount. There is, in short, no provision in the laws of the State for any assessment of the market value of such securities. They are taken at the value indicated on their face and taxed accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-7\">In valuing these shares at fifty per cent, above par the tax is made fifty per cent, greater than on \u201c other moneyed capital in the hands of individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-8\">\n<em>Messrs.

It is certain that they cannot be taxed at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of the State. Such is the express provision of the act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">It is contended that the term \u201c moneyed capital,\u201d as here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>used, signifies money put out at interest, and that as such capital is not taxed upon more than its par or nominal value, the par value of these shares is their maximum taxable value.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We cannot concede that money at interest is the only moneyed capital included in that term as here used by Congress. The words are \u201c other moneyed capital.\u201d That certainly makes stock in these banks moneyed capital, and would seem to indicate that other investments in stocks and securities might be included in that descriptive term.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">But even if it were true that these shares can only be taxed as money at interest is, the result contended for would not necessarily follow. The money invested in a bank is not money put out at .interest. The money of the bank is so put out and the share of the shareholder represents his proportion of that money. What the amount of this share is, must, in some form, be ascertained in order to determine its taxable value. If the nominal or par value of the stock necessarily indicated this amount, there might be some propriety in making that the taxable value; but, as all know, such is not the case. The available moneyed capital belonging to a bank may be diminished by losses or increased by accumulated profits. Therefore some plan must be devised to ascertain what amount of money at interest is actually represented by a share of stock. The State of Pennsylvania has provided that this may be done by an official appraisement, taking care to prevent abuses by declaring that such appraisement shall not be higher than the current market value of the stock at the place where the bank is located, and by giving an appeal to the Auditor-General, who is authorized to inquire into the value and correct any errors that, may appear. There certainly is no apparent injustice in this. It is not the amount of money invested which is wanted for taxation, but the amount of moneyed capital which the investment represents for the time being.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">If the value set upon the share does not exceed this amount it will not be assessed at a greater rate than other money at interest. Other plans may be devised to aecom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>plish the same end, but it is sufficient for the purposes of this ease that this plan is not unreasonable. If a shareholder is not satisfied with the original appraisement, all he has to do is to appeal to the Auditor-General, make known to him the actual condition of the affitirs of the bank, and have the error if any exists corrected. Hepburn did not see fit to avail himself of this right which he had. He preferred to rest upon his supposed right, under the act of Congress, to limit the power of assessment to the par value. This right, we think, he did not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">It is next insisted that no municipal or school taxes could be assessed upon the shares of the First National Bank of Carlisle, a National bank located within the borough of Carlisle, because by the laws of Pennsylvania, as is claimed, other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens at that place is exempt from such taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In support of this claim it is shown that all mortgages, judgments, recognizances, and moneys owing upon articles of agreement for the sale of real estate are exempt from taxation in that borough except for State purposes. This is a partial exemption only. It was evidently intended to prevent a double burden by the taxation both of property and debts secured upon it. Necessarily there may be other moneyed capital in the locality than such as is exempt. If there is, moneyed capital, as such, is not exempt. Some part of it only is. It could not have been the intention of Congress to exempt bank shares from taxation because some moneyed capital was exempt. Certainly there is no presumption in favor of such an intention. To have effect it must be manifest. The affirmative of the proposition rests upon him who asserts it. In this case it has not been made to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
