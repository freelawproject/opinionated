In May 2000, Blackstone was sentenced to 290 months of incarceration under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, based in part on the court's conclusion that he had previously been convicted of crimes of violence.

We conclude, however, that the Supreme Court has not yet recognized the right asserted by Blackstone. The Supreme Court has not held that the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines are subject to this vagueness challenge. As a result, Blackstone's current motion is not timely under the statute. In reaching that conclusion, we agree with similar rulings by three other circuit courts that have considered this issue. We deny a similar challenge by Blackstone to a conviction and sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) for use of a firearm during a crime of violence because the Supreme Court has not recognized that right, either.

On May 8, 2000, the district court sentenced Blackstone to a total of 290 months of incarceration. That total consisted of two parts: 230 months for the two Hobbs Act convictions (specifically, two sentences each of 230 months to be served concurrently), and sixty months for the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) conviction, to be served consecutively to the Hobbs Act sentences. When Blackstone was sentenced, the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, not advisory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Booker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    543 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (holding that prior mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines had violated the Sixth Amendment and that the Guidelines were \"effectively advisory\" going forward).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In calculating the sentence, the district court concluded that Blackstone qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, also known as the career offender Guideline, because he had previously been convicted of two prior felony crimes of violence: second-degree robbery, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 211 ; and voluntary manslaughter, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 192(a). As a result, Blackstone's Guideline range for the two Hobbs Act convictions increased from 70 to 87 months to 210 to 240 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 230 months for those counts. The firearms conviction carried a mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), bringing the total to 290 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Blackstone appealed his sentence, but this court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That application was granted, and Blackstone filed his motion to vacate with the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Blackstone's motion presented two primary arguments. For one, he argued that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   also applies to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, in particular to the\n   residual clause of the definition of \"crime of violence\" within the career offender enhancement provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. Because his prior California convictions only qualified as crimes of violence based on the residual clause, he contended, his sentence for the Hobbs Act robbery convictions should be vacated and a new sentence imposed. In addition, he argued that the residual clause in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) is void for vagueness following\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , so his conviction and consecutive sentence for use of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence should be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court concluded that Blackstone's motion was timely because\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   applied retroactively on collateral review to the Sentencing Guidelines and to the firearms statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). But the district court denied Blackstone's motion on the merits. It held that, even after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Blackstone's prior California convictions for robbery and voluntary manslaughter are still crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The district court granted a certificate of appealability on that issue. The district court held that Blackstone's current Hobbs Act robbery convictions are for crimes of violence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and did not grant a certificate of appealability for that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Timeliness of the Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review the denial of Blackstone's motion de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We will take up Blackstone's two challenges separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Hobbs Act Robbery Sentences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to disputing Blackstone's arguments on the merits, the Government continues to argue that Blackstone's \u00a7 2255 motion is untimely. It contends that the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   have not authorized a motion by Blackstone at this point because those decisions pertained to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B), and that neither addressed whether\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   applies to other clauses providing for enhanced sentences based on convictions for crimes of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the statute of limitations applicable to a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging a federal conviction and sentence,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), a defendant has one year to file such a motion, measured from the latest of four possible dates. Two of those dates are relevant here. One is \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(f)(1). That was in 2001 for Blackstone, so the current motion is too late under that measure. The other is \"the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(f)(3). In other words, a right newly recognized by the Supreme Court may open the door to filing a \u00a7 2255 motion later in time. The question presented in this case is whether\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   have opened that door. We conclude that they have not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and Subsequent Supreme Court Decisions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that part of the definition of \"violent felony\" in the ACCA is void for vagueness.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That may permit an inference that the Court might reach a different result regarding a sentence imposed while the Guidelines were mandatory, such as Blackstone's, but that inference has not been recognized by the Court. To the contrary, a concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   explicitly described that question as an issue that remains open.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p890\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   903 n.4 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"The Court's adherence to the formalistic distinction between mandatory and advisory rules at least leaves open the question whether defendants sentenced to terms of imprisonment before [\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   ] ... may mount vagueness attacks on their sentences.
