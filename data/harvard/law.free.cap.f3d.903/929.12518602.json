At the time, Agent Noll was a Supervisory Special Agent for the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, and she was asked to assist in executing a search warrant as part of the investigation regarding Michael. Prior to executing the search warrant, agents learned that the Ioanes had registered weapons and that these weapons likely would be at their home. The search warrant authorized the IRS agents to search the Ioane residence for, among other things, records, computers, computer-related equipment, and computer storage devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 8, 2006, agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, including Agent Noll, arrived at the Ioane residence to conduct the search. Only Michael and Shelly were home at the time. The IRS agents informed Michael and Shelly that they could stay on the premises if they cooperated with the agents conducting the search. However, the agents informed the Ioanes that if they chose to leave to the premises, they would not be allowed to return. Both Ioanes stayed on the premises, and sat in the kitchen while the agents conducted the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At some point early in the search, Michael needed to use the bathroom. A male agent escorted Michael to the bathroom and conducted a quick search of the bathroom area-opening a couple of drawers and looking in the shower-before exiting and closing the door behind him. The male officer stood outside the closed bathroom door while Michael relieved himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Then, about a half an hour into the search, Shelly told the agents that she needed to use the bathroom. Agent Noll escorted Shelly to the bathroom, and when she stepped inside and started to close the door, Agent Noll told Shelly that she had to come inside, too. Shelly asked Agent Noll to wait outside, but Agent Noll resisted her plea. Agent Noll told Shelly to remove her clothing so that she could make sure Shelly did not have anything hidden on her person. When Shelly objected, Agent Noll explained that she needed to make sure Shelly did not hide or destroy anything, and that this was standard procedure. Shelly, who was wearing a long sundress, pulled up her dress so Agent Noll could see that she was not hiding anything. According to Shelly, Agent Noll\n   made Shelly hold up her dress while she relieved herself, using one hand to hold up her dress and the other to pull her underwear down. Agent Noll faced Shelly while Shelly used the bathroom, and when Shelly was finished, Agent Noll escorted her back to the kitchen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, Agent Noll claims that the district court erred when it determined that she is not entitled to qualified immunity from Shelly's invasion of bodily privacy claim. Agent Noll contends that her actions were objectively reasonable, and therefore did not violate Shelly's Fourth Amendment rights. Further, Agent Noll argues that even if her actions were not reasonable, the law was not so clearly established in 2006 that a reasonable officer in her position would have known that her actions were unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review a district court's legal conclusion that an official is not entitled to qualified immunity de novo.\n   <em>\n    Eng v.

According to the allegations in the complaint, the officers had insisted that it was necessary to take photos of the plaintiff for her case, and directed her to undress in a room of the police station despite the plaintiff's objections and insistence that she did not have bruises that required her to be photographed in the nude.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104757\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/324/450/#p452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104757\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/324/450/#p452\">\n    at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, the agents had monitored Shelly in the kitchen for approximately 30 minutes before Shelly asked to use the bathroom, and nowhere in the record does it reflect that the officers conducted a pat-down search of Shelly or Michael.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, Agent Noll asserts that other safety concerns justified monitoring Shelly while she used the bathroom because the bathroom was not secure, and Shelly could have gained access to the rest of the house through a second door in the bathroom, putting officers or herself at risk. However, by the time Shelly needed to use the bathroom, other agents already had checked the bathroom for weapons. Additionally, Agent Noll offers no explanation why watching Shelly use the bathroom was the only way to abate the risk that Shelly might flee, given that other officers might have been recruited to stand outside the bathroom's second door.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grummett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539650\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/779/491/#p492\">\n    779 F.2d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the prison had not violated inmates' rights when the prison had devised the least intrusive means to serve the state security interests).

In sum, the justifications Agent Noll offers for initiating the search weigh in favor of a determination of unreasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the search was conducted in the Ioane's home bathroom. The law recognizes heightened privacy interests in the home, which arguably makes this intrusion more egregious, especially when Shelly herself was not the subject of the search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kyllo v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   , we held that a male probation officer violated a female probationer's right to bodily privacy when the male probation officer observed the female probationer urinating in a bathroom stall during a urinalysis test.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519947\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1413/#p1415\">\n    967 F.2d at 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is, without doubt, the most factually analogous case cited by the majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   And yet, several factors indicate that Noll's conduct was not clearly proscribed by this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   . First, and most obviously, our ruling in\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   hinged on the fact that the probation officer was of the opposite sex, and all of the cases the\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   court cited involved observation by members of the opposite sex.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   court itself cited\n   <em>\n    York\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"[t]he desire to shield one's unclothed figured from view of strangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is impelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1415 n.5. Thus, it is unclear how\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   can be read to create a clearly established constitutional right to be free from naked observation by members of\n   <em>\n    the same sex\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, in concluding that the probation officer's conduct was not \"reasonable,\" the Court relied on the fact that his conduct violated department of corrections policies.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1416. Here, by contrast, Agent Noll's uncontradicted declaration establishes that her conduct comported with IRS policy. Again, at a minimum, this fact provides a basis to conclude that Agent Noll's mistake as to whether she was violating the right established by\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   did not occur in the context of the execution of a search warrant. The majority argues that this means Shelly likely had broader rights than the probationer in\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   . But that argument ignores the factual context relevant to determining whether\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   sufficiently defined the contours of the right at issue. In particular,\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   contains no discussion regarding how to weigh the\n   right to bodily privacy against the interests of officer safety or the preservation of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The majority dismisses many of these concerns without serious examination. Most notably, the majority asserts (in a footnote) that, although every bodily privacy case this circuit has decided involved cross-sex observation, \"gender was not central\" to the analysis in any of those cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 934 n.2. Thus, the majority concludes, \"[the fact t]hat Agent Noll and Shelly both are women does not change that Agent Noll violated Shelly's privacy rights.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Gender is not central?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It is impossible to square this conclusion with our precedent. Every bodily privacy case cited by the majority involved cross-sex observation and every case noted that the cross-sex nature of the observation was a significant part of the court's analysis. No case cited by the majority discusses whether same-sex observation is subject to the same sort of analysis or scrutiny. In fact, language from\n   <em>\n    York\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   -and the result from\n   <em>\n    Grummett\n   </em>\n   -strongly suggest that same-sex observations\n   <em>\n    are not\n   </em>\n   subject to the same sort of scrutiny as cross-sex observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The majority is likely correct that Agent Noll's actions were unreasonable, and Agent Noll may have violated Shelly's constitutional right to bodily privacy during the search. But the existence of a constitutional violation alone is insufficient to deny qualified immunity-we must find that the right at issue was \"clearly established.\" Our precedent at the time of the alleged violation in this case did not put the issue of whether same-sex observation violates the right to bodily privacy \"beyond debate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    al-Kidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    563 U.S. at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The majority could have used this case to clarify the law regarding the right to bodily privacy and announced that the right applied in both same-sex and cross-sex situations alike. Perhaps that is the correct result. But the majority cannot, in one fell swoop, both announce for the first time that the scope of the bodily privacy right includes same-sex observations and, at the same time, hold that the right was clearly established at the time of the violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Nonetheless, I concur in the majority's ultimate conclusion that the district court did not err in denying Agent Noll's motion for summary judgment.

Finally, the Court rejected the state's argument that such searches were necessary as part of drug enforcement because of the ease with which evidence of a drug crime could be concealed, passed from person to person, and disposed of.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 94-96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304934\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/85/#p91\">\n    100 S.Ct. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In short,\n   <em>\n    Ybarra\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that a search warrant for a particular premises does not give the officers executing the warrant the right to search individuals who are present, but who the officers do not have independent probable cause to search. Here, Shelly was not the subject of the investigation and the search warrant did not authorize a search of her person, only of the premises. As a result, under\n   <em>\n    Ybarra\n   </em>\n   , any search of Shelly needed to be supported by independent probable cause or, in the case of a weapons frisk, a reasonable belief that she was armed and dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Neither of those conditions was met in this case. Agent Noll had no individualized probable cause to search Shelly. Consequently, there was no basis to conduct an evidence search of Shelly's person. Additionally, Agent Noll likely lacked any reasonable belief that Shelly was armed and dangerous. Although Agent Noll knew there were firearms in the house, those firearms did not belong to Shelly and there was no other basis on which to conclude that Shelly was armed and dangerous. Regardless, even if Agent Noll had a reasonable basis to believe Shelly was armed and dangerous, her actions in this case plainly exceeded the limits of the sort of weapons pat-down authorized by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

On that basis, I would hold that the district court was correct to deny Agent Noll's motion for summary judgment. As a result, I CONCUR in the judgment of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    At summary judgment, plaintiffs included Shelly and her husband, Michael Ioane, Sr. Plaintiffs initially pursued several causes of action against the United States and the Federal agents who executed the search warrant on the Ioane residence. However, the only claims remaining at the summary judgment stage were for excessive force and invasion of bodily privacy in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. The Ioanes claimed that the Federal agents, including Agent Noll, used excessive force when the Federal agents pointed guns at the Ioanes' heads, and that Agent Noll invaded Shelly's bodily privacy when Agent Noll entered the bathroom with Shelly and monitored Shelly while she relieved herself. The district court granted summary judgment for Agent Noll on plaintiffs' excessive force claim, but denied Agent Noll summary judgment on Shelly's invasion of bodily privacy claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Although\n    <em>\n     York\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Grummett\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Sepulveda\n    </em>\n    all involved searches by members of the opposite sex, gender was not central to the conclusion of whether the intrusion at issue was unreasonable.
