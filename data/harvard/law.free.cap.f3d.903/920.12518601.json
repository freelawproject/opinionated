Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). In particular, we consider whether federal courts should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over a constitutional challenge to a state criminal statute while there are ongoing state court protection order proceedings arguably related to the challenge to the criminal statute. In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that abstention is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff-Appellant Richard Rynearson III was named as the respondent in a Washington state court protection order proceeding filed by someone who lived near Rynearson and who was the subject of multiple online postings by Rynearson. Based on allegations that Rynearson had stalked, cyberstalked, and harassed the person seeking the protection order, the state municipal court entered a temporary stalking protection order against Rynearson. While those proceedings were pending in state court, Rynearson filed an action in federal court which sought to enjoin enforcement of Washington's cyberstalking law and to obtain a declaratory judgment that the law is unconstitutional. The federal action named two defendants: the Attorney General of Washington, Robert Ferguson, and the Kitsap County Prosecuting Attorney, Tina R. Robinson, the Defendants-Appellees in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court dismissed Rynearson's complaint based on\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention. In\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases, the Supreme Court held that federal courts should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in exceptional circumstances when state proceedings are ongoing. Rynearson appeals the dismissal. Because we conclude that the state protection proceedings do not present the exceptional circumstances that warrant abstention, we reverse the district court's dismissal of Rynearson's complaint and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rynearson, who sometimes uses the name Richard Lee, regularly posts online about civil liberties issues. In his words, he has \"tried to raise awareness of the erosion of civil liberties, and the expansion of executive power, related to the war on terror.\" He began that effort while serving in the Air Force. Upon retiring from the service, Rynearson moved to Bainbridge Island, Washington, in 2016. He had already become interested in the role of Bainbridge Island in the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Even before moving there, he began to follow the work of the Bainbridge Island Japanese-American Exclusion Memorial. Clarence Moriwaki, a private citizen, was the volunteer founder of the memorial and a member of its board. In November 2016, Rynearson became Facebook friends with Moriwaki.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rynearson believed that a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 (\"the NDAA\") would permit indefinite detention of American citizens. Through regular posts on public Facebook pages, Rynearson began to criticize Moriwaki and other local leaders who failed to vocally condemn the NDAA. In January and February 2017, Rynearson posted numerous comments on Facebook and sent text messages to Moriwaki criticizing him for failing to express disapproval of public officials who supported the NDAA. Moriwaki told Rynearson that he felt harassed and asked Rynearson to stop communicating with him and posting about him. Moriwaki lived approximately 300 feet from Rynearson's residence. Despite Moriwaki's request, Rynearson continued posting his critical comments on Moriwaki's Facebook page. Moriwaki then blocked Rynearson from posting on his Facebook page. Rynearson responded by creating a Facebook group initially called \"Clarence Moriwaki of Bainbridge Island,\" where he posted memes criticizing Moriwaki. Rynearson ultimately renamed the page \"Not Clarence Moriwaki of Bainbridge Island.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2017, Moriwaki sought and obtained from the Bainbridge Island Municipal Court a temporary stalking protection order against Rynearson. This order compelled Rynearson to \"remove public webpages/Facebook page with [Moriwaki's] name\" and prohibited him from, among other things, having any contact with Moriwaki, keeping Moriwaki under surveillance, going within 100 feet of Moriwaki's residence or workplace, and attending events at which Moriwaki was present. In June 2017, in response to an inquiry by Rynearson's attorney, the state prosecutor said that he was not planning to file criminal charges against Rynearson at that time in the hope that Rynearson would comply with the protection order but that the prosecutor would revisit that decision if he received any future referrals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 10, 2017, Rynearson filed a response in the municipal court opposing Moriwaki's petition for a permanent protection order. In this response, Rynearson included a challenge to the constitutionality of Washington's cyberstalking statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.61.260\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9.61.260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b). In relevant part, the statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) A person is guilty of cyberstalking if he or she, with intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass any other person, and under circumstances not constituting telephone h a r a s s m e n t, m a k e s a n e l e c t r o n i c communication to such other person or a third party: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) Anonymously or repeatedly whether or not conversation occurs ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wash. Rev. Code. \u00a7 9.61.260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 17, 2017, the municipal court granted Moriwaki a permanent protection order against Rynearson. The court concluded that Moriwaki had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Rynearson had stalked, cyberstalked, and unlawfully harassed him. The court rejected Rynearson's claim that his actions were protected by the First Amendment. The permanent protection order prohibited Rynearson from coming within 300 feet of Moriwaki's residence or workplace, forbade him from attending public events with Moriwaki, and prohibited Rynearson \"from creating or maintaining internet websites, Facebook pages, blogs, forums, or other online entities that use the name or personal identifying information of [Moriwaki] in the title or domain name. [Rynearson] may not use the photograph of [Moriwaki] to create memes, posters, or other online uses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rynearson appealed the protection order. In January 2018 the Kitsap County Superior Court vacated the permanent protection order on the grounds that Rynearson's speech was protected by the First\n   Amendment. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the cyberstalking statute. Moriwaki did not appeal this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the meantime, while the permanent protection order proceeding was pending before the municipal court, Rynearson initiated the current federal action by filing his complaint in the district court challenging the constitutionality of Washington's cyberstalking statute under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complaint was filed on July 11, 2017, one day after Rynearson filed his opposition to the protection order in the municipal court and six days before that court held a hearing and issued the permanent protection order. In the federal action Rynearson sought a permanent injunction enjoining defendants from enforcing the statute and a declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motion on the ground that the federal court should abstain under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   .

Both the Supreme Court and our court have repeatedly emphasized, however, that\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    abstention is \"an extraordinary and narrow exception to the general rule that federal courts have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\"\n    <em>\n     Potrero Hills\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834511\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/876/\">\n     657 F.3d at 882\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    With that directive in mind, we have developed a five-prong test to determine when\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    abstention should apply to a civil case. Specifically, \"\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    abstention is appropriate only when the state proceedings: (1) are ongoing, (2) are quasi-criminal enforcement actions or involve a state's interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts, (3) implicate an important state interest, and (4) allow litigants to raise federal challenges.\"\n    <em>\n     ReadyLink\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056083\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/754/#p758\">\n     754 F.3d at 759\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . If these four threshold elements are established, we then consider a fifth prong: (5) \"whether the federal action would have the practical effect of enjoining the state proceedings and whether an exception to\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    applies.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056083\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/754/#p758\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Each of these requirements must be \"strictly met.\"\n    <em>\n     AmerisourceBergen Corp. v.

The law does not require state authorities to conduct any investigation or file charges or a complaint in connection with an application for a protection order, and state actors are not party to the protection proceedings. Indeed, the stalking protection order statute specifically provides that a petitioner is not required to report the stalking conduct to the police to obtain a protection order.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207.92.100\">\n     Wash.

Although conduct in violation of that statute can be (and was, in Rynearson's case) a partial basis for issuing a protection order, the criminal statute's constitutionality does not bear on the validity of the state's protection orders or the procedures by which the state courts issue or enforce them.

That is not true. It would have been true that success in Rynearson's federal suit would have prevented state prosecutors from prosecuting Rynearson specifically for the crime of cyberstalking (which they ultimately decided not to do, anyway). But there is no basis to conclude that Rynearson's federal suit would have prevented the municipal court from granting Moriwaki a permanent protection order or prevented the state prosecutors from prosecuting Rynearson if he had violated the protection order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Even if the cyberstalking statute were declared unconstitutional in federal court, the protection order was not based solely on the crime of cyberstalking. The stalking protection order statute clearly provides that the crime of stalking and other forms of \"stalking conduct\" can be the basis for a protection order; cyberstalking is not required.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207.92.020\">\n     Wash.

In Rynearson's case, the municipal court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Rynearson had committed both stalking and unlawful harassment in addition to cyberstalking. Therefore, the declaratory judgment and injunction that Rynearson sought in the federal proceedings would not have prevented the municipal court from issuing a stalking protection order against Rynearson.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Nor would Rynearson's federal suit have blocked the state's ability to prosecute Rynearson had he violated the protection order. The stalking protection orders issued by the municipal court and the cyberstalking statute covered different conduct. The cyberstalking statute criminalizes repeated or anonymous electronic communications made \"with intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.61.260\">\n     Wash.

The protection orders issued by the municipal court, on the other hand, prohibited Rynearson from, among other things, attending events with Moriwaki, contacting Moriwaki, and creating websites that used Moriwaki's name. Rynearson could have engaged in conduct prohibited by the orders but not criminalized under the challenged cyberstalking statute. Even if the state were enjoined from enforcing the criminal cyberstalking law, Rynearson could have been charged with violating the protection order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Moreover, even if the federal action did cast doubt on the validity of the terms of the stalking protection order, Rynearson still would not be able to use any federal determination about the cyberstalking statute's constitutionality as a defense in a contempt proceeding. A party cannot use a challenge to the validity of a court order as a defense in a proceeding for violation of that order under Washington law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Seattle v.
