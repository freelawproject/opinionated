Americans for Prosperity Foundation (the Foundation) and Thomas More Law Center (the Law Center) qualify as tax-exempt charitable organizations under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). They challenge the Attorney General of California's collection of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 Schedule B, which contains the names and addresses of their relatively few largest contributors. The Attorney General uses the information solely to prevent charitable fraud, and the information is not to be made public except in very limited circumstances. The plaintiffs argue the state's disclosure requirement impermissibly burdens their First Amendment right to free association by deterring individuals from making contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court held that the Schedule B requirement violates the First Amendment as applied to the Foundation and Law Center and permanently enjoined the Attorney General from demanding the plaintiffs' Schedule B forms. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we vacate the injunctions, reverse the judgments and remand for entry of judgment in the Attorney General's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We hold that the California Attorney General's Schedule B requirement, which obligates charities to submit the very information they already file each year with the IRS, survives exacting scrutiny as applied to the plaintiffs because it is substantially related to an important state interest in policing charitable fraud. Even assuming arguendo that the plaintiffs' contributors would face substantial harassment if Schedule B information became public, the strength of the state's interest in collecting Schedule B information reflects the actual burden on First Amendment rights because the information is collected solely for nonpublic use, and the risk of inadvertent public disclosure is slight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   California's Supervision of Trustees and Charitable Trusts Act requires the Attorney General to maintain a registry of charitable corporations (the Registry) and authorizes him to obtain \"whatever information, copies of instruments, reports, and records are needed for the establishment and maintenance of the [Registry].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012584\">\n    Cal.

Code Regs. tit. 11, \u00a7 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the outset of this litigation, the Attorney General maintained an informal policy treating Schedule B as a confidential document not available for public inspection on the Registry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Americans for Prosperity Found. v.

In 2016, the Attorney General codified that policy, adopting a regulation that makes Schedule B information confidential and exempts it from public inspection except in a judicial or administrative proceeding or in response to a search warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2011%2C%20%C2%A7%20310\">\n    Cal.

It operates alongside Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) organization focused on direct issue advocacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Charities like the Foundation and the Law Center are overseen by the Charitable Trusts Section of the California Department of Justice, which houses the Registry and a separate investigative and legal enforcement unit (the Investigative Unit). The Registry Unit processes annual registration\n   renewals and maintains both the public-facing website of registered charities and the confidential database used for enforcement. The Investigative Unit analyzes complaints of unlawful charity activity and conducts audits and investigations based on those complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Beginning in 2010, the Registry Unit ramped up its efforts to enforce charities' Schedule B obligations, sending thousands of deficiency letters to charities that had not complied with the Schedule B requirement. Since 2001, both the Law Center and the Foundation had either filed redacted versions of the Schedule B or not filed it with the Attorney General at all. Each plaintiff had, however, annually filed a complete Schedule B with the IRS. In 2012, the Registry Unit informed the Law Center it was deficient in submitting Schedule B information. In 2013, it informed the Foundation of the same deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In response to the Attorney General's demands, the Law Center and the Foundation separately filed suit, alleging that the Schedule B requirement unconstitutionally burdens their First Amendment right to free association by deterring individuals from financially supporting them. The district court granted both plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction, concluding they had raised serious questions going to the merits of their cases and demonstrated that the balance of hardships tipped in their favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Americans for Prosperity Found. v.

The information in a Schedule B also permits detection of schemes such as the intentional overstatement of the value of noncash donations in order to justify excessive salaries or perquisites for its own executives. Collecting donor information on a regular basis from all organizations facilitates investigative efficiency, and can help the Charities Bureau to obtain a complete picture of the charities' operations and flag suspicious activity simply by using information already available to the IRS. Because fraud is often revealed not by a single smoking gun but by a pattern of suspicious behavior, disclosure of the Schedule B can be essential to New York's interest in detecting fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515955\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/374/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations, citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

The district court credited these arguments, concluding that Schedule B information is not \"necessary\" to the Attorney General's investigations because: the Registry, whose sole job it is to collect and maintain complete registration information, does not actively review Schedule B forms as they come in; Schedule Bs have not been used to trigger investigations; and the Attorney General can obtain a Schedule B through subpoenas and audits when a case-specific need arises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Americans for Prosperity Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134088\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/182/1049/\">\n    182 F.Supp.3d at 1053-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We addressed these same arguments, of course, in\n   <em>\n    Center for Competitive Politics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180376\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1307/#p1317\">\n    784 F.3d at 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where we expressly rejected the proposition that the Schedule B requirement is insufficiently tailored because the state could achieve its enforcement goals through use of its subpoena power or audit letters.

She testified that her office would want \"to look at [the] Schedule B ... the moment we thought there might be an issue with the charity.\" \"[I]f we subpoenaed it or sent a letter to the charity, that would tip them off to our investigation, which would allow them potentially to dissipate more assets or hide assets or destroy documents, which certainly happened several times; or it just allows more damage to be done to [the] charity if we don't have the whole document at the outset.\" Rather than having \"to wait extra days,\" she wanted to \"take the action that needs to be taken as quickly as possible.\" She explained that her office relied on Schedule Bs to \"tell us whether or not there was an illegal activity occurring.\" Where such activity was found, she would \"go into court immediately and ... request a [temporary restraining order] from the court to freeze assets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Johns' successor, Tania Ibanez, testified similarly that \"getting a Schedule B through a[n] audit letter is not the best use of my limited resources.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Because it's time-consuming, and you are tipping the charity off that they are about to be audited. And it's been my experience when the charity knows or when the charity gets the audit letter, it's not the best way of obtaining records. We have been confronted in situations where the charity will fabricate records. Charities have given us incomplete records, nonresponsive records. Charities have destroyed records, and\n   charities have engaged in other dilatory tactics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Sonja Berndt, a deputy attorney general in the Charitable Trusts Section, confirmed that attempting to obtain Schedule Bs through the auditing process would entail substantial delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The district court's other conclusions are equally flawed. Although the state may not routinely use Schedule B information\n   <em>\n    as it comes in\n   </em>\n   , the Attorney General offered ample evidence of the ways his office uses Schedule B information in investigating charities that are alleged to have violated California law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205227\">\n    Cal.

Code \u00a7\u00a7 5227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5233, 5236 (providing examples of the role the Attorney General plays in investigating nonprofit organizations that violate California law). Current and former members of the Charitable Trusts Section, for example, testified that they found the Schedule B particularly useful in several investigations over the past few years, and provided examples. They were able to use Schedule B information to trace money used for improper purposes in connection with a charity serving animals after Hurricane Katrina; to identify a charity's founder as its principal contributor, indicating he was using the research charity as a pass-through; to identify self-dealing in that same charity; to track a for-profit corporation's use of a non-profit organization as an improper vessel for gain; and to investigate a cancer charity's gift-in-kind fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In sum, the record demonstrates that the state has a strong interest in the collection of Schedule B information from regulated charities. We agree with the Second Circuit that the disclosure requirement \"clearly further[s]\" the state's \"important government interests\" in \"preventing fraud and self-dealing in charities ... by making it easier to police for such fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Schneiderman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515955\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/374/#p381\">\n    882 F.3d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The district court reached a different conclusion, but it did so by applying an erroneous legal standard. The district court required the Attorney General to demonstrate that collection of Schedule B information was \"necessary,\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas More Law Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206781090\">\n    2016 WL 6781090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, that it was no \"more burdensome than necessary\" and that the state could not achieve its ends \"by more narrowly tailored means,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. Because it was \"possible for the Attorney General to monitor charitable organizations without Schedule B,\" the court concluded the requirement is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The \"more burdensome than necessary\" test the district court applied, however, is indistinguishable from the narrow tailoring and least-restrictive-means tests that we have repeatedly held do not apply here. The district court's application of this standard, therefore, constituted legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because the district court applied an erroneous legal standard, it consistently framed the legal inquiry as whether it was\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   \"that the Attorney General could accomplish her goals without the Schedule B.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Under the substantial relation test, however, the state was not required to show that it could accomplish its goals\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   by collecting Schedule B information. The state instead properly and persuasively relied on evidence to show that the up-front collection of Schedule B information improves the efficiency and efficacy of the Attorney General's important\n   regulatory efforts. Even if the Attorney General can achieve his goals through other means, nothing in the substantial relation test requires him to forgo the most efficient and effective means of doing so, at least not absent a showing of a significant burden on First Amendment rights. As Steven Bauman, a supervising investigative auditor for the Charitable Trusts Section testified, \"We could complete our investigations if you took away many of the tools that we have. We just wouldn't be as effective or as efficient.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Because the strict necessity test the district court applied is not the law, the district court's analysis does not alter our conclusion that the state has a strong interest in the collection of Schedule B information from regulated charities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Second, they argue disclosure to the Attorney General will subject their contributors to threats, harassment and reprisals. We consider these contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Evidence That Disclosure Will Deter Contributors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We begin by considering whether disclosure will deter contributors. We first consider evidence presented by the Foundation. We then consider evidence presented by the Law Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Christopher Joseph Fink, the Foundation's chief operating officer, testified that prospective contributors' \"number one concern is about being disclosed.\" He testified that \"they are afraid to have their information in the hands of state government or a federal government or in the hands of the public.\" He testified that business owners \"are afraid if they are associated with our foundation or with Americans for Prosperity, their businesses would be targeted or audited from the state government.\" Teresa Oelke, the Foundation's vice president of state operations, described two individuals who, she believed, stopped supporting the Foundation in light of actual or feared retaliation by the IRS. One contributor \"did business with the Government,\" and he and his business associates \"did not feel like they could take on the risk of continuing to give to us.\" Another contributor allegedly stopped giving \"because he, his business partner and their business had experienced seven different reviews from government agencies, including individual IRS audits, both personally and their businesses, and their family was not willing to continue enduring the emotional, financial, time stress and the stress that it placed on their business.\" Oelke testified that, on average, the Foundation and Americans for Prosperity combined lose \"roughly three donors a year\" due to \"their concern that they are going to be disclosed and the threats that they believe that being disclosed lays to either their business, their families or just their employees.\" Paul Schervish, an emeritus professor of sociology, testified that, in his opinion, disclosure to the California Attorney General would chill contributions to the Foundation, although he conceded that he had not actually spoken to any of the Foundation's contributors. Foundation President Tim Phillips testified that contributors see the California Attorney General's office as \"a powerful partisan office.\" The Foundation also points to evidence that, in its view, shows that some California officials harbor a negative attitude toward Charles and David Koch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Law Center introduced a letter from a contributor who chose to make a $25 contribution anonymously out of fear that ISIS would break into the Law Center's office, obtain a list of contributors and target them. Schervish, the sociology professor, opined that the Law Center's \"disclosure of Schedule B to the registry would chill contributions.\" He acknowledged, however, that he had not spoken with any of the Law Center's existing or prospective contributors, and he could not point to any contributor who had reduced or eliminated his or her support for the Law Center due to the fear of disclosure - a common weakness in the Law Center's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For example, Thomas Monaghan, the Law Center's co-founder and most well-known contributor, testified that he is not\n   aware of any Law Center contributor who was \"harassed in some way because they made a donation.\" Despite being included \"at the top of a list ... of the most antigay persons in the country\" (allegedly because of his financial support for the Law Center), he remains \"perfectly willing\" to be listed on the Law Center's website as \"one of the people who helped to establish\" the Law Center. Similarly, the Law Center's president testified that he has never had a conversation with a potential contributor who was unwilling to contribute to the Law Center because of the public controversy surrounding the Law Center or its disclosure requirements. For years, moreover, the Law Center has\n   <em>\n    over\n   </em>\n   -disclosed contributor information on Schedule Bs filed with the IRS. Although by law the Law Center is required to disclose only those contributors furnishing 2 percent or more of the organization's receipts (about five to seven contributors a year), it has instead chosen to disclose all contributors providing $5,000 or more in financial support (about 23 to 60 contributors a year). This voluntary over-disclosure tends to undermine the Law Center's contention that Schedule B disclosure meaningfully deters contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Considered as a whole, the plaintiffs' evidence shows that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   individuals who have or would support the plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be deterred from contributing if the plaintiffs are required to submit their Schedule Bs to the Attorney General. The evidence, however, shows at most a modest impact on contributions. Ultimately, neither plaintiff has identified a single individual whose willingness to contribute hinges on whether Schedule B information will be disclosed to the California Attorney General. Although there may be a small group of contributors who are comfortable with disclosure to the IRS, but who would not be comfortable with disclosure to the Attorney General, the evidence does not show that this group exists or, if it does, its magnitude. As the Second Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   While we think it plausible that some donors will find it intolerable for law enforcement officials to know where they have made donations, we see no reason to believe that this risk of speech chilling is more than that which comes with any disclosure regulation. In fact, all entities to which these requirements apply already comply with the federal law mandating that they submit the selfsame information to the IRS. Appellants offer nothing to suggest that their donors should more reasonably fear having their identities known to New York's Attorney General than known to the IRS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Schneiderman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515955\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/374/#p381\">\n    882 F.3d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The mere possibility that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   contributors\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   choose to withhold their support does not establish a substantial burden on First Amendment rights.

Evidence That Disclosure to the Attorney General Will Subject Contributors to Threats, Harassment and Reprisals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Alternatively, the plaintiffs seek to establish a First Amendment burden by showing that, if they are required to disclose their Schedule B information to the Attorney General, there is \"a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of personal information will subject [their contributors] to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455279,3644367\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/186/\">\n    561 U.S. at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455279,3644367\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/186/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). This inquiry necessarily entails two questions: (1) what is the risk of public disclosure; and (2), if public disclosure does occur, what is the likelihood that contributors will be subjected to threats, harassment or reprisals? We consider these questions in reverse order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Likelihood of Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The first question, then, is whether the plaintiffs have shown that contributors are likely to be subjected to threats, harassment or reprisals if Schedule B information were to become public. We again consider the Foundation's evidence first, followed by the Law Center's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Foundation's evidence undeniably shows that some individuals publicly associated with the Foundation have been subjected to threats, harassment or economic reprisals. Lucas Hilgemann, the Foundation's chief executive officer, testified that he was harassed and targeted, and his\n   personal information posted online, in connection with his work surrounding union \"right to work\" issues in Wisconsin. Charles and David Koch have received death threats, and Christopher Fink, the Foundation's chief operating officer, has received death threats for publicly contributing to the Foundation through his family's private foundation. Art Pope, a member of the Foundation's board of directors, and a contributor through his family foundation, testified that he received a death threat and has been harassed by \"a series of articles\" that falsely accuse him of \"funding global warming deni[al].\" His businesses have been boycotted, although we hesitate to attribute those boycotts to Pope's association with the Foundation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In some cases, moreover, the Foundation's actual or perceived contributors may have faced economic reprisals or other forms of harassment. Teresa Oelke, for instance, cited\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   a donor whose business was targeted by an association, a reputable association in that state. A letter was sent to all the school boards in that state encouraging [them] to discontinue awarding this individual's business contracts because of his assumed association with Americans for Prosperity and Americans for Prosperity Foundation. ... That individual reduced his contributions in half, so from $500,000 annually to 250,000 based on the pressure from his board that remains in place today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Hilgemann, the Foundation's CEO, suggested that during the \"right to work\" campaign in Wisconsin in 2012, an opposition group \"pulled together a list of suspected donors to the Foundation because of their interactions with groups like ours in the past that had been publicized. [Opponents] boycotted their businesses. They made personal and private threats against them, their families and their business and their employees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Law Center, too, has presented some evidence to suggest individuals associated with the Law Center have experienced harassment, although it is less clear to what extent it results solely from that association. The Law Center, for instance, points to: a smattering of critical letters, phone calls and emails it has received over the years; the incident in which Monaghan\n   was placed on a list of \"the most antigay persons in the country\" after the Law Center became involved in a controversial lawsuit; and threats and harassment its clients, such as Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, have received based on their controversial public activities. As noted, however, Monaghan could not recall any situation in which a contributor to the Law Center was harassed, or expressed concerns about being harassed, on account of having contributed to the Law Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On the one hand, this evidence plainly shows at least the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiffs' Schedule B contributors would face threats, harassment or reprisals if their information were to become public. Such harassment, however, is not a foregone conclusion. In 2013, after acquiring copies of the Foundation's 2001 and 2003 Schedule B filings, the National Journal published an article publicly identifying many of the Foundation's largest contributors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, as the plaintiffs contend, public disclosure of Schedule B information would subject their contributors to widespread retaliation, we would expect the Foundation to present evidence to show that, following the National Journal's unauthorized Schedule B disclosure, its contributors were harassed or threatened. No such evidence, however, has been presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Ultimately, we need not decide whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of Schedule B information would subject their contributors to a constitutionally significant level of threats, harassment or reprisals if their Schedule B information were to become public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455279,3644367\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/186/\">\n    561 U.S. at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455279,3644367\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/186/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we explain next, we are not persuaded that there exists a reasonable probability that the plaintiffs' Schedule B information will become public as a result of disclosure to the Attorney General. Thus, the plaintiffs have not established a reasonable probability of retaliation from compliance with the Attorney General's disclosure requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Risk of Public Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The parties agree that, as a legal matter, public disclosure of Schedule B information is prohibited. California law allows for public inspection of charitable trust records, with the following exception:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Donor information exempt from public inspection pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 6104(d)(3)(A) shall be maintained as confidential by the Attorney General and shall not be disclosed except as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (1) In a court or administrative proceeding brought pursuant to the Attorney General's charitable trust enforcement responsibilities; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (2) In response to a search warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2011%2C%20%C2%A7%20310\">\n    Cal. Code Regs. tit. 11, \u00a7 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs argue, however, that their Schedule\n   B information may become public because the Attorney General has a poor track record of shielding the information from the public view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   We agree that, in the past, the Attorney General's office has not maintained Schedule B information as securely as it should have, and we agree with the plaintiffs that this history raises a serious concern. The state's past confidentiality lapses are of two varieties: first, human error when Registry staff miscoded Schedule B forms during uploading; and second, a software vulnerability that failed to block access to the Foundation's expert, James McClave, as he probed the Registry's servers for flaws during this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We are less concerned with the latter lapse. McClave discovered that by manipulating the hexadecimal ending of the URL corresponding to each file on the Registry website, he could access a file that was confidential and did not correspond to a clickable link on the website. That is, although documents were deemed \"confidential,\" that meant only that they were not\n   <em>\n    visible\n   </em>\n   to the public; it did not mean they were not still housed on the public-facing Registry website. By altering the single digit at the end of the URL, McClave was able to access, one at a time, all 350,000 of the Registry's confidential documents. This lapse was a singularity, stemming from an issue with the Attorney General's third-party security vendor. When it was brought to the Attorney General's attention during trial, the vulnerability was quickly remedied. There is no evidence to suggest that this type of error is likely to recur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We are more concerned with human error. As part of an iterative search on the public-facing website of the Registry, McClave found approximately 1800 confidential Schedule Bs that had been misclassified as public over several years. The Attorney General promptly removed them from public access, but some had remained on the website since 2012, when the Registry began loading its documents to servers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Much of this error can be traced to the large amount of paper the Registry Unit processes around the same time each year. The Registry Unit receives over 60,000 registration renewals annually, and 90 percent are filed in hard copy. It processes each by hand before using temporary workers and student workers to scan them into an electronic record system. The volume and tediousness of the work seems to have resulted in some staff occasionally mismarking confidential Schedule Bs as public and then uploading them to the public-facing site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Recognizing the serious need to protect confidentiality, however, the Registry Unit has implemented stronger protocols to prevent human error. It has implemented \"procedural quality checks ... to sample work as it [is] being performed\" and to ensure it is \"in accordance with procedures on handling documents and [indexing them] prior to uploading.\" It has further implemented a system of text-searching batch uploads before they are scanned to the Registry site to ensure none contains Schedule B keywords. At the time of trial in 2016, the Registry Unit had halted batch uploads altogether in favor of loading each document individually, as it was refining the text-search system. After forms are loaded to the Registry, the Charitable Trusts Section runs an automated weekly script to identify and remove any documents that it had inadvertently misclassified as public. There is also no dispute that the Registry Unit immediately removes any information that an organization identifies as having been misclassified for public access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Nothing is perfectly secure on the internet in 2018, and the Attorney General's\n   data are no exception, but this factor alone does not establish a significant risk of public disclosure. As the Second Circuit recently explained, \"[a]ny form of disclosure-based regulation - indeed, any regulation at all - comes with some risk of abuse. This background risk does not alone present constitutional problems.\"\n   <em>\n    Schneiderman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515955\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/374/#p381\">\n    882 F.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Although the plaintiffs have shown the state could afford to test its own systems with more regularity, they have not shown its cybersecurity protocols are deficient or substandard as compared to either the industry or the IRS, which maintains the same confidential information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the Second Circuit that \"there is always a risk somebody in the Attorney General's office will let confidential information slip notwithstanding an express prohibition.

In light of the changes the Attorney General has adopted since those breaches occurred, however, the evidence does not support the inference that the Attorney General is likely to inadvertently disclose either the Law Center's or the Foundation's Schedule B in the future. The risk of inadvertent disclosure of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Schedule B information in the future is small, and the risk of inadvertent disclosure of\n   <em>\n    the plaintiffs'\n   </em>\n   Schedule B information in particular is smaller still.

Evid. 401(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    \"In\n    <em>\n     NAACP\n    </em>\n    , the Court was presented ... with 'an uncontroverted showing that on past occasions revelation of the identity of its rank-and-file members has exposed those members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, [and] threat of physical coercion,' and it was well known at the time that civil rights activists in Alabama and elsewhere had been beaten and/or killed.\"\n    <em>\n     Schneiderman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515955\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/374/#p381\">\n     882 F.3d at 385\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (second alteration in original) (quoting\n    <em>\n     NAACP\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163673\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/449/#p462\">\n     357 U.S. at 462\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163673\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/449/#p462\">\n     78 S.Ct. 1163\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Pope says his business, Variety Wholesalers, was boycotted in part because of his affiliation with the Foundation. But Pope was the state budget director of North Carolina and is publicly associated with a large number of organizations and candidates. Despite publicly contributing to the Foundation since 2004, and to the Foundation's predecessor since 1993, he did not receive threats or negative attention until 2010, in connection with his involvement in the North Carolina elections. This same problem plagues much of the plaintiffs' evidence. In many instances, the evidence of harassment pertains to individuals who are publicly identified with a number of controversial activities or organizations, making it difficult to assess the extent to which the alleged harassment was caused by a connection to the Foundation or the Law Center in particular. Most of the individuals who have experienced harassment, moreover, have been more than mere contributors, again making it difficult to isolate the risk of harassment solely from being a large contributor. The plaintiffs have presented little evidence bearing on whether harassment has occurred, or is likely to occur, simply because an individual or entity provided a large financial contribution to the Foundation or the Law Center.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Like much of the plaintiffs' evidence, the harassment allegations recounted by Oelke and Hilgemann are conclusory rather than detailed.

Because this constitutes a mixed question of law and fact, however, we review the question de novo.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Cherrett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266695,12269879\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1060/\">\n     873 F.3d 1060\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1066 (9th Cir. 2017).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The plaintiffs suggest California's regulations are not as protective as federal regulations because federal law imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of information on tax returns.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207213\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7213\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Nonetheless, we take seriously the concerns raised here by the plaintiffs and amici, and we encourage all interested parties to work cooperatively to ensure that Schedule B information in the hands of the Attorney General remains confidential.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
