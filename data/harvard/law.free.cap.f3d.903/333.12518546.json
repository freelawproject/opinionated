From 1910 until 1986, Greenlease Holding Co. (\"Greenlease\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a subsidiary of the Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (\"Ampco\"), owned the site and operated railcar manufacturing facilities there. Trinity Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Industries Railcar Co. (together referred to as \"Trinity\"), acquired the site from Greenlease in 1986 and continued to manufacture railcars there until 2000. An investigation by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania into Trinity's waste disposal activities resulted in a criminal prosecution and eventual plea-bargained consent decree which required, in relevant part, that Trinity remediate the contaminated land. That effort cost Trinity nearly $9 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal arises out of the District Court's determination that, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , (\"CERCLA\"), and Pennsylvania's Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act, 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 6020.101\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., (\"HSCA\"), Trinity is entitled to contribution from Greenlease for remediation costs. After eight years of litigation, and having sorted through a century of historical records, the District Court allocated 62% of the total cleanup costs to Greenlease and the remainder to Trinity. The parties filed cross-appeals challenging a number of the District Court's rulings, including its ultimate allocation of cleanup costs. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court's pre-trial rulings on dispositive motions; we will vacate its cost allocation determination; and we will remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The site in question, known by the parties as the \"North Plant,\" is a tract of land that was used as a manufacturing site by a succession of companies. Greenlease and Trinity also, at different times, operated facilities on a nearby tract of land called the \"South Plant,\" though that property does not figure prominently in this appeal. Over time, the footprint of the North Plant grew from eleven to thirty-four acres. That industrial development, as well as the many years of manufacturing activity that occurred there, resulted in multiple releases of hazardous materials -primarily lead-into the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The North Plant - 1898 to 1986\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From at least 1898 until sometime before Greenlease's acquisition of the North Plant in 1910, Shelby Steel Tube Company owned and operated a steel tube factory on eleven acres of land that is now part of the North Plant. Over the course of its ownership, Shelby Steel deposited historic fill as it was constructing its manufacturing facilities. According to the District Court, \"[h]istoric fill is 'a soil mixed with various non-native materials, including construction demolition debris, concrete, asphalt, or it could be industrial materials such as slag or ash.' \" (App. at 186.) Unfortunately, historic fill often contains lead and other contaminants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Greenlease began its manufacturing activities at the North Plant soon after acquiring the property. Between 1911 and 1922, it significantly expanded the North Plant to support its growing business of building and repairing railcars. During that expansion, Greenlease used historic fill in the foundations supporting the new structures and rail lines. Operations at the North Plant included two shops to paint the railcars, and Greenlease used a variety of toxic chemicals and lead paint during the painting process, without doing anything meaningful to collect or contain the runoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relationship Between Greenlease and Ampco\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1983, Ampco acquired Greenlease,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but their relationship predated that acquisition. They had had three overlapping board members since 1979 and continued to do so until 1986. Other than those three shared board members and one shared officer, no other persons were employees of both Ampco and Greenlease. Greenlease employees alone \"were responsible for all day-to-day operations at the North Plant, including any waste disposal, waste handling,\n   painting, abrasive blasting, welding, and fabrication operations.\" (App. at 81-82.) Those employees coordinated disposal with outside contractors and communicated with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (\"PADEP\") on environmental matters. Indeed, Ampco \"did not employ any engineers or persons with technical experience in manufacturing that could make decisions for [Greenlease] with respect to environmental compliance or waste management.\" (App. at 82.) Instead, \"Ampco employed only a professional staff, such as accountants, actuaries, and lawyers[.]\" (App. at 82.) Ampco did provide Greenlease with advice regarding the laws and regulations related to Greenlease's waste generation, and Ampco monitored that waste generation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The cooperation between parent and subsidiary was complete enough that Greenlease adopted a resolution declaring that any action taken by Ampco that it \"may think necessary and desirable to take on behalf of [Greenlease] shall be deemed to be the action of [Greenlease's Board].\" (App. at 72 (citation omitted).) Ampco also asserted the right to approve Greenlease's expenditures that exceeded a certain amount, though Greenlease was solely responsible for placing and paying any purchase orders. In addition, Ampco provided certain services to Greenlease to minimize costs, including overseeing a single retirement plan and providing centralized financial planning and master insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Trinity's Acquisition of the North Plant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 1986, Ampco authorized the Greenlease board of directors to sell the North Plant to Trinity. The Purchase and Sale Agreement between Trinity and Greenlease (the \"Agreement\") included a clause declaring that Greenlease \"makes no representation or warranty regarding compliance with the Environmental Protection Act, any other environmental laws or regulations or any hazardous waste laws or regulations (collectively, 'Environmental Laws').\" (App. at 199.) Mutual indemnification provisions specific to environmental liabilities provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Greenlease] agrees to indemnify and hold harmless [Trinity] against Damages arising out of or related to violations of Environmental Laws, which were caused by [Greenlease] or its predecessors in title to the assets at the [North Plant] on or prior to the date of Closing. [Trinity] agrees to indemnify and hold harmless [Greenlease] against Damages arising out of or related to violations of Environmental Laws, which are caused by [Trinity] or its successors in title to the assets at the [North Plant] after the date of the Closing. It is the intention of the parties that liability under this Section for any condition that is caused by the acts of [Greenlease] or its predecessors in title to the assets prior to the date of the Closing and by the acts of [Trinity] or its successors in title to the assets after the date of Closing shall be allocated between the parties in a just manner taking into account degree of fault, period of violation and other relevant factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (App. at 61 (some alterations in original).) Those indemnities were stated to be effective for only three years after the closing of the property sale. The Agreement further provided that Trinity \"has not assumed, and expressly denies assumption hereby of, any other liability, obligation or commitment of [Greenlease] other than as set forth above or otherwise expressly set forth herein.\" (App. at 60-61 (alteration in original).) Finally, a \"[n]on-waiver of [r]emedies\" clause in the Agreement provided that \"[t]he rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which\n   the parties hereto may otherwise have at law or in equity.\" (App. at 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following the 1986 sale of the North Plant to Trinity, Greenlease continued to exist only as a \"shell holding company without any [employees,] business activities, for profit activities, or other commercial undertakings[.]\" (App. at 89.) Its assets decreased at the end of each year following the sale of the North Plant, from about $51 million in 1987 to $658,594 in 1990. In the third and fourth years following the sale of the North Plant to Trinity, Greenlease issued dividends to Ampco, leaving Greenlease with only a $250,000 reserve for liabilities. At that time, Greenlease had no known liabilities beyond the reserve. The executive vice president and chief administrative officer for Ampco, who was also an officer and director of Greenlease, stated that it was common for dividends to be made from a subsidiary to Ampco after an indemnification period ended. An environmental reserve was placed on Greenlease's books when Trinity sued Greenlease and Ampco.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The North Plant - 1987 to 2004\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After purchasing the North Plant, Trinity continued the manufacture of railcars there. In one of the paint shops, it installed concrete floors and used tar paper to capture paint drippage. Beginning in late 1987, it implemented a policy preventing the use of metal-containing paints at the North Plant. In 1994, Trinity removed the second paint shop, excavated the old dirt floors, and dumped the soil onto a field at the South Plant. Trinity then erected a new paint shop at the North Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Six years later, in 2000, Trinity ceased the North Plant operations. It sold the property in 2004 to a third-party (the \"Buyer\"). In connection with that sale, Trinity did not conduct an environmental assessment to determine whether the soil was contaminated, and it prohibited the Buyer from performing such testing without its consent. The Buyer demolished almost all of the existing buildings at the North Plant to sell the scrap steel for profit. Trinity maintains that, at some point, the Buyer dumped onto the North Plant property hazardous chemicals and waste that had been produced by the demolition of the North Plant buildings, exacerbating the pre-existing environmental harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Commonwealth's Investigation and the Consent Decree\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2004, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and PADEP began an investigation into allegations that Trinity had improperly disposed of hazardous waste at the North Plant. The Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint against Trinity in 2006, raising three felony counts and eight misdemeanor counts related to the illegal handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Trinity entered into a plea agreement with the Commonwealth that required the repayment of investigative costs, payment of a fine, contribution to a nonprofit organization, and, pursuant to a consent decree authorized by PADEP (the \"Consent Decree\"), the remediation of environmental contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Consent Decree stated that further investigation of the North Plant was \"necessary to fully identify the nature and extent of the release of hazardous substances at and/or potentially migrating from the North Plant ... and to determine the Response Actions necessary to remediate the hazardous substances at and/or potentially migrating from [the North] Plant.\" (App. at 513.) The cleanup was governed by Pennsylvania's Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act, 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 6026.101\n   <em>\n    et\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    seq.\n   </em>\n   , commonly known as \"Act 2,\" and the associated investigation was not limited to the time during which Trinity owned and operated the North Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Trinity was on a short leash. It was ordered to get approval from PADEP before it took any \"significant step\" pertaining to the property, and it was required to submit to PADEP \"an investigation work plan, a supplemental investigation work plan, a notice of intent to remediate, a remedial investigation report, a proposed cleanup work plan, a supplemental cleanup work plan, and a final report.\" (App. at 213-14.) Those additional mandates increased the difficulty and expense of the remediation project. The remediation efforts were also affected by the fact that \"[t]he North Plant was a 'high profile, high visibility location' \" and is bordered by residential communities on three sides. (App. at 218 (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   PADEP approved Trinity's remedial investigation work plan in 2007. Trinity later sent Greenlease a pre-suit notice describing the contamination and its legal position that Greenlease had contributed to the pollution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Trinity's Cleanup of the North Plant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To perform the necessary cleanup, Trinity had to buy back the North Plant. It then selected Golder Associates, Inc. (\"Golder\") to perform, direct, and supervise the cleanup operations. PADEP approved that selection. Trinity did not employ a competitive bidding process to select Golder because it had been impressed by Golder's cleanup operations at several other sites and because the Consent Decree's deadlines created an urgency to get a remediation consultant in place as soon as possible. Trinity and Golder agreed to an \"open billing\" process that provided Golder would be paid only for the work it ultimately needed to perform. (App. at 218-19.) Billing was on a \"cost plus 10 percent\" basis, which gave Golder a ten percent markup on the expenses it incurred. (App. at 219.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Golder's cleanup efforts required it to first identify areas of the property that were of concern. It analyzed available historical information concerning construction and manufacturing activities that had taken place at the North Plant. It then conducted soil sampling to further identify areas requiring remediation. Golder ultimately divided the North Plant into twenty impact areas that required remediation. Thirteen of the twenty impact areas were primarily contaminated by lead. The remaining impact areas were primarily contaminated by volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds and a variety of other hazardous substances. Major remediation activities included excavating contaminated soil, refilling excavated areas with clean material, chemically treating contaminated soil, transporting excavated soil to appropriate landfills, and placing asphalt caps over parts of the North Plant. In total, Golder disposed of approximately 39,000 tons of soil off-site and capped about 15,000 tons of soil with asphalt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Those efforts cost nearly $9,000,000 and made the property usable again. Parts of the North Plant with asphalt caps are suitable for use as a parking lot. Other areas are suitable for industrial or commercial use. There is ongoing work at the North Plant to ensure that the safety mechanisms created as part of the environmental remediation continue to function.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Invoking federal and state laws, Trinity filed a complaint against Greenlease and\n   Ampco in 2008 to defray the North Plant remediation costs. More specifically, Trinity sought cost recovery under CERCLA pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cost recovery under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), and contribution under CERCLA pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) and 9613(f)(3)(B). It also brought cost recovery and contribution claims under the HSCA, as well as state common law claims for contribution and negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pre-Trial Motions and Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Trinity's claims against Ampco were premised on Ampco's alleged direct or derivative liability for Greenlease's conduct at the North Plant. Upon cross motions for summary judgment on that issue, the District Court concluded that Ampco was not directly or derivatively liable for pollution at the North Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Greenlease also moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Trinity's claims were barred by the indemnification provisions of their Agreement. It claimed that once the mutual indemnities expired, neither party was entitled to seek compensation from the other. The District Court rejected that argument, ruling that the existence and expiration of the indemnification provisions did not prevent Trinity from seeking other remedies available at law or in equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Greenlease and Trinity later filed cross motions for summary judgment on Trinity's CERCLA, RCRA, HSCA, and common law claims. The District Court granted partial summary judgment for Trinity, holding as a matter of law that Greenlease was a potentially responsible person under CERCLA and the HSCA. It also granted Greenlease's cross-motion in part, granting it summary judgment on all of Trinity's claims other than those for contribution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(B) and 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 6020.705(c)(2). The litigation proceeded to a bench trial to determine the equitable allocation of cleanup costs between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Prior to trial, Trinity tried to recoup costs associated with its cleanup of the South Plant, but the District Court concluded that Trinity was not entitled to those costs because Greenlease had never owned or operated that property or disposed of any hazardous waste at the South Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Parties' Cost Allocation Proposals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Trinity's and Greenlease's experts each provided the District Court with a proposal for the equitable allocation of cleanup costs between the parties. Trinity's expert, Joseph B. Gormley, Jr., relied on available historical information to identify three sources of contamination at the North Plant: volatile chemicals used in manufacturing operations; general dispersions caused by painting; and historic fill used for construction. He then employed that same historical information to assign each party a percentage of responsibility for the contamination found within each impact area. Next, Gormley analyzed the major remediation activities and associated costs required to clean up each impact area. To arrive at a total cost allocation for the major remediation activities, he multiplied the percentage of responsibility for each specific impact area by the major remediation activity costs in that specific area and added those results together. That produced an overall percentage allocation. Gormley applied that same overall percentage to general project costs not tied to any specific impact area. Ultimately, he allocated 99% of the costs to Greenlease and 1% to Trinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Not surprisingly, Greenlease's expert, Steven Gerritsen, proposed a very different\n   cost allocation. He concluded that most of the lead present at the North Plant was caused by the use of historic fill rather than Greenlease's operations at the facility. He calculated that Greenlease was responsible for depositing fill on only 2.8 acres of the thirty-four acre North Plant. He opined that the rest of the fill predated Greenlease's purchase of the property and was thus not Greenlease's responsibility. Gerritsen also suggested that much of Golder's work was unreasonable and unnecessary and thus that Trinity had spent more money than it should have to perform the cleanup. Gerritsen ultimately concluded that Greenlease should be allocated only 12-13% of the cleanup costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The District Court's Cost Allocation Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In an admirably thorough opinion, the District Court endeavored to make sense of the extensive record, including the competing expert contentions. It first concluded that Greenlease was not responsible for any of the contamination attributable to Shelby Steel or any other non-party because Trinity had failed to show that those parties were \"unknown, insolvent, or otherwise immune from suit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. at 351.) The Court, however, rejected Greenlease's contention that Golder incurred unreasonable or excessive costs when performing its cleanup at the North Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To assign each party a percentage of responsibility for the contamination within each impact area, the District Court relied heavily on historic maps and schematics of the North Plant. For many impact areas, the Court agreed with Greenlease that the lead contamination could be attributed solely to Shelby Steel's use of historic fill, and therefore should not be a source of liability for Greenlease. For other impact areas, the Court found that Greenlease was responsible for the deposit of historic fill, or was solely responsible for the use of volatile chemicals, and that Greenlease should thus bear full responsibility for the pollution. For the remaining impact areas, the District Court split responsibility between the parties based on the number of years that each had owned the property or on various other considerations such as known use of a specific chemical contaminant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After determining the percentages of responsibility within each impact area, the District Court considered the major remediation activities that took place in each impact area to determine an overall allocation of cost. Though it purported to follow Gormley's methodology, the Court departed from it in an important respect: Gormley's methodology accounted for the fact that different remediation activities cost different amounts of money, whereas the District Court's methodology did not. To arrive at its cost allocation, the Court multiplied the percentage of responsibility it attributed to Greenlease by the square footage or cubic yardage involved in each remediation activity. The District Court then added the results and divided by the total square footage and cubic yardage for all remediation activities at the North Plant to arrive at the overall cost allocation percentage. By those calculations, it concluded that Greenlease was responsible for 83% of the total costs, while Trinity was responsible for 17%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The District Court then considered a variety of equitable factors to ensure the fairness of the overall cost allocation. It ultimately reduced Greenlease's percentage of responsibility, based on three equitable factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, it found that at least a portion of Trinity's remediation costs were attributable to the actions of the third-party Buyer and, in particular, the Buyer's decision to demolish buildings at the North Plant. The Court said that Trinity failed to \"specify the amount of response costs it incurred to remediate the waste left at the North Plant by [the Buyer].\" (App. at 380.) Therefore, \"there [was] an equitable need to reduce Greenlease's percentage of responsibility for response costs to reflect an amount attributable to [the Buyer].\" (App. at 380.) Accordingly, the Court reduced Greenlease's responsibility by 6%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, it concluded that the existence of the indemnification provisions demonstrated the parties' intent to shift liability, so it further reduced Greenlease's share of responsibility by 5%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, it recognized that the property value of the North Plant had increased as a result of remediation since the land was now suitable for some commercial or industrial uses. The Court concluded that an additional 10% reduction in Greenlease's responsibility was appropriate to account for that increased market value that would inhere to Trinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After accounting for those equitable deductions, the District Court determined that Greenlease was responsible for 62% of \"all response costs incurred by ... Trinity ... for the cleanup at the North Plant[.]\" (App. at 388-89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Those interpretive rules lead us to conclude that the Agreement at issue reserved Trinity's right to seek contribution from Greenlease for environmental cleanup costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Agreement's indemnification provisions stated, in relevant part, that each party indemnified the other for any \"[d]amages arising out of or related to violations of Environmental Laws\" and that liability for any such violations would be \"allocated between the [parties] in a just manner taking into account degree of fault, period of violation and other relevant factors.\" (App. at 599-600.) It is true that the mutual indemnification expired after three years. The Agreement did not, however, contain language expressing the parties' intent that Trinity would assume all of Greenlease's obligations and liabilities after that three-year period. Rather, the Agreement contained explicit \"non-assumption of liabilities\" and \"non-waiver of remedies\" clauses. The \"non-assumption of liabilities\" clause provided that Trinity \"has not assumed, and expressly denies assumption hereby of, any other liability, obligation or commitment of [Greenlease] other than as set forth above or otherwise expressly set forth herein.\" (App. at 567.) It is reading far too much into the words \"any\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   liability\" to think they meant that the prominent risk of environmental liability was the one thing the parties meant for Trinity to be stuck with. Moreover, the \"non-waiver of remedies\" clause plainly provided that \"[t]he rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties hereto may otherwise have at law or in equity.\" (App. at 612-13.) The express language of the contract, therefore, provides both that Trinity did not assume any of Greenlease's liabilities or obligations following the three-year mutual indemnification period, and that Trinity did not waive its statutory rights under CERCLA and the HSCA to seek contribution from Greenlease. In short, while the contractual right to indemnification ended, all other rights remained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Greenlease's three primary arguments to the contrary do not persuade us. First, Greenlease argues that the indemnification provision should control our interpretation of the entire Agreement because it is more specific than the \"non-waiver of remedies\" clause. That reasoning, however, puts too high a premium on specificity. Yes, the contractual indemnity is specific. But the non-assumption of liabilities and non-waiver of remedies provisions are plain enough for us to discern the intent of the parties, and that intent was to preserve non-contractual rights. Besides, there is a sense in which the indemnification language is not more specific than the other relevant provisions: it does not address the parties' liabilities after the first three years following the sale. The \"non-assumption of liabilities\" and \"non-waiver of remedies\" clauses do. They are not time limited and therefore\n   can be understood as specifically addressing the time period after the expiration of the contractual indemnities. We will not construe the indemnification provision to cover time periods that, by the plain language of the contract, it does not cover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobs Constructors, Inc. v. NPS Energy Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483559\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/365/#p373\">\n    264 F.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"[B]ecause the nature and purpose of any indemnity agreement involves the shifting and voluntary assumption of legal obligations, they are to be narrowly construed.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, Greenlease argues that allowing Trinity to seek contribution against it pursuant to the \"non-waiver of remedies\" clause \"renders the environmental indemnity provision meaningless[.]\" (Green. Opening Br. at 36.) But that argument again ignores the critical fact that the parties, by agreeing to the three-year mutual indemnification provision, granted to each other certain contractual rights separate and distinct from any statutory, legal, or equitable rights or remedies. The \"non-waiver of remedies\" clause is perfectly clear in that regard, reserving to both parties \"any rights or remedies which the parties ... may otherwise have at law or in equity.\" (App. at 613.) As the District Court concluded, the contractual remedies created by the indemnification provision were, by the terms of the Agreement, \"cumulative\" and not \"exclusive\" of the remedies available at law or in equity. (App. at 66, 613.) Greenlease could have bargained for a provision in the Agreement whereby Trinity would have assumed all of Greenlease's obligations and liabilities following the expiration of the three-year indemnification provision. But it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Third, Greenlease relies on\n   <em>\n    Keywell Corporation v.

There are, though, important differences between the contract at issue in\n   <em>\n    Keywell\n   </em>\n   and the Agreement here that are sufficient to make that case inapposite. The corporate plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Keywell\n   </em>\n   sought to recover CERCLA cleanup costs from two individual defendants, who had been officers of the corporation that sold the relevant piece of land to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n    at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The purchase agreement for the land included a two-year indemnification provision guaranteeing to hold the plaintiff harmless for any damages arising out of \"any breach of warranty or representation\" by the selling entity \"or its management stockholders\" and for \"any liabilities or obligations of [s]eller\" not explicitly listed in the purchase agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n    at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff then entered into a separate thirty-year indemnification agreement with the corporate seller that guaranteed to hold the plaintiff harmless for any damages that \"arose or existed\" prior to the purchase agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, that thirty-year indemnification agreement stated that only the corporate entity would be held to the longer indemnification period, not its individual officers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, prior to seeking to recover CERCLA cleanup costs from the individual defendants, the plaintiff had entered into yet another contract, this last one \"unconditionally releas[ing]\" the corporate entity's former \"Management Group,\" which included the individual defendants, from any claims the plaintiff might have had under the purchase agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On that set of facts, the Second Circuit held that the plaintiff could not recover CERCLA cleanup costs from the individual defendants because the relevant contractual documents unequivocally expressed the parties' intent to shift any and all liability away from the individual officers of the corporate entity after\n   the initial two-year indemnification period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522776\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/159/\">\n    at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In contrast, the Agreement between Trinity and Greenlease does not demonstrate an unequivocal intent to shift liability away from Greenlease after the three-year contractual indemnification period expired. On the contrary, rather than releasing Greenlease from liability, the Agreement states that Trinity did not assume any of Greenlease's liabilities or obligations, unless otherwise expressly provided by the Agreement. Greenlease's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Keywell\n   </em>\n   is therefore misplaced, and we will affirm the denial of its motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Costs Trinity Incurred Were Necessary and Reasonable.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Greenlease next argues that the District Court impermissibly allocated to it costs that Trinity unnecessarily incurred by failing to impose cost controls on the remediation work at the North Plant.

The District Court's detailed factual findings make clear that there was a nexus between the costs Trinity incurred and its effort to investigate and remediate the contamination at the North Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The cleanup activities at the North Plant were guided by the Consent Decree's requirement that those efforts be undertaken pursuant to the dictates of Pennsylvania's Act 2. That statute requires that remediation activities meet one of three standards: a background standard comparing contaminated areas to unaffected areas; a uniform statewide health standard set by a state agency, which differs depending on whether the site is meant for residential or commercial use; or a site-specific standard \"based on a site-specific risk assessment so that any substantial present or probable future risk to human health and the environment is eliminated or reduced\" so that the site could be utilized in accordance with its \"present or currently planned future use[.]\" (App. at 212 (citing 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 6026.301(a) ).) Trinity used the statewide health standard to determine which areas required \"some type of response action\" and then used the site-specific standard to guide the actual \"soil cleanup.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. at 223.) It did not use the background standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   During the investigation phase of Trinity's cleanup activities, its consultant Golder used soil sampling to determine the areas of concern requiring remediation. That necessitated the establishment of a \"standard action level,\" which is the numerical threshold for determining when soil is contaminated to an extent requiring treatment. For example, to determine whether areas contaminated by lead -the primary contaminant of concern-required treatment, Golder originally selected a standard action level of 1000 milligrams of lead per kilogram of soil. That was not a random choice. It selected that standard because it had observed that, at a threshold level of 1500 mg/kg, some soil samples passed toxicity testing, while others failed. At the more exacting 1000 mg/kg level, Golder was confident that it would catch all of the soil requiring remediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But Golder was also cost conscious on that point. The selection of an accurate standard was important because failure to adequately remove all of the contaminated soil would require Golder to put in place more costly hazardous waste caps that could leave the land unusable. It initially chose the 1000 mg/kg standard for the reasons just noted, but when, during the cleanup process, it discovered that a significant amount of soil exceeded the 1000 mg/kg standard yet could still safely remain in place because it was going to \"be capped anyway as part of the approved remedy\" (App. at 234), it conducted a \"site characterization study\" to determine whether there was a more appropriate standard action level (App. at 234-35). Golder settled on a 2500 parts per million\n   standard that was approved by PADEP. The record accordingly establishes an appropriate cost sensitivity and a nexus between Golder's (and hence Trinity's) investigative efforts and the purpose of remedying environmental harms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The same is true with regard to the activities Golder undertook to remediate the contaminated areas. It used three primary response actions: first, simply consolidating contaminated soil and placing an asphalt cap atop that soil; second, excavating and chemically treating contaminated soil to render it nonhazardous and then placing an asphalt cap over the remediated area; and third, transporting contaminated soil to an appropriate landfill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Golder's soil excavation efforts allowed it to use simple asphalt caps to cover the excavated areas, as opposed to what are called Subtitle C caps. Subtitle C of RCRA regulates the precise manner in which a hazardous waste cap is put in place and maintained. Installing and maintaining a cap in compliance with Subtitle C is more difficult, complex, and expensive than installing and maintaining a simple asphalt cap. The District Court found that use of a Subtitle C cap would have made the North Plant site look like a \"landfill,\" would not have been \"consistent with the residential character of Greenville,\" (App. at 241), and would have rendered much of the North Plant unusable for any purpose. Those factual findings reinforce that Golder's activities had the required nexus to the stated purpose of remedying environmental harms. The response costs Trinity incurred were therefore necessary under CERCLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Although Greenlease is correct that \"[t]he cleanup at the North Plant was more difficult, inclusive, and expensive because it was done pursuant to the consent order and with oversight by ... PADEP,\" (App. at 225), we do not agree that those extra costs were consequently unnecessary. The Consent Decree required compliance with state environmental standards. To ensure that those statutory requirements were met, Trinity and Golder had to get PADEP's approval for each step of the cleanup. The costs incurred to comply with the Consent Decree were thus aimed directly at satisfying state environmental standards and are appropriately classified as \"necessary to the containment and cleanup of hazardous releases.\"\n   <em>\n    Redland Soccer Club, Inc. v.

Greenlease does not point to any specific activity that was not \"necessary.\" Rather, it complains that Trinity incurred excessive costs because the Consent Decree lacked meaningful cost control mechanisms, because Trinity hired Golder without competitive bidding, and because Trinity agreed to a \"cost-plus\" billing arrangement with Golder. Those arguments fare poorly precisely because they do not address necessity, as that concept is applied in the context of CERCLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Greenlease's arguments fall flat in light of the District Court's factual findings that we have already recounted in some detail. Greenlease does not point to any record evidence demonstrating how any of those facts resulted in unreasonably excessive spending. In contrast, as the\n   Court found, Trinity and Golder worked together \"to try to control costs or pay only reasonable costs,\" (App. at 218), and worked with PADEP \"to reduce the amount of work [Trinity] had to do to comply with the\" Consent Decree (App. at 225). The District Court credited expert testimony that the billing methods used by Trinity \"contributed to the cost efficiency of the response work at the North Plant\" and \"prevented Golder from up-charging [Trinity.]\" (App. at 219-20.) Greenlease has given us no sound reason to disagree with that assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We will therefore affirm the District Court's determination that Trinity's response costs were necessary and reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The District Court Erred in Allocating Costs Between Trinity and Greenlease.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Greenlease argues that the District Court used a purely speculative methodology, different from the methodology proposed by Trinity's expert witness Gormley to allocate costs between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, the criticism is that the District Court relied on \"volumes and surface areas ... as a proxy for the costs Trinity incurred at each impact area[.]\" (Green. Opening Br. at 22.) Greenlease contends that that methodology was arbitrary because it failed to account for the reality that different units of measure are not interchangeable and because volumetric data cannot reliably serve as a proxy for costs when some remediation activities cost more than others. According to Greenlease, the District Court was forced to resort to a methodology based on volumetric data alone because Trinity failed to present sufficient evidence documenting how much it cost to undertake each of the major remediation activities within each impact area. Greenlease's position is thus that the District Court's cost allocation methodology cannot stand, given the Court's failure to include actual costs in its analysis. We agree that the Court materially deviated from the methodology presented by Gormley and so arrived at a speculative cost allocation methodology that must be corrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   CERCLA provides PRPs with a right to contribution for remediation expenses.\n   <em>\n    Atl.

Each of the parties staked out extreme positions on cost allocation, with Trinity's expert Gormley opining that Greenlease should be held responsible for 99% of all cleanup costs and Greenlease's expert opining that, despite Greenlease's 76 years of building and manufacturing activity at the North Plant, Trinity should be held responsible for nearly 90% of all cleanup costs. The record became even more difficult to sort out when, on direct examination, Gormley gave testimony that was unclear at best and departed from the methodology contained in his expert report. Although we commend the District Court's painstaking effort to analyze nearly a century of building and manufacturing activity by multiple parties to allocate costs equitably between Greenlease and Trinity, the attempt to untangle the evidentiary knot presented by the parties fell short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Before addressing the District Court's cost allocation methodology, we begin with the methodology that Gormley proposed in his expert report and explained somewhat at trial. Gormley's report presented a six-step approach to allocating costs. First, using \"historical information and investigation findings,\" Gormley assigned a percentage of responsibility to each party for contamination in each area of concern, (D.I. 285-2 at 10), and he applied those percentages to the impact areas within each area of concern. He documented that step in Tables 4-1 and 6-2. Second, he calculated the quantity of material in each impact area that was subject to specific major remediation activities. That step was documented in Table 6-2. Third, he multiplied the estimated quantities of material used for (or remediated by) major remediation activities by each party's percentage of responsibility for contaminating each impact area. Fourth, he summed results from step three to develop Trinity's and Greenlease's respective responsibility percentages \"for each major remediation activity[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fifth, he multiplied the percentage of responsibility for each major remediation activity by the cost of each such activity to determine how to allocate the costs for each. Finally, Gormley totaled how much in costs each party was responsible for across all major remediation activities \"to calculate a total percent cost allocation for the major remediation activities.\" (D.I. 285-2 at 10.) Steps five and six were documented in Table 7-1. The report opined that the final percentage calculated at step six could be used to allocate the \"general construction costs\" (i.e., costs that were incurred on a project-wide basis that were not tied to a specific impact area) between both parties. Gormley's expert report presented his methodology as a single analysis with multiple steps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Gormley's testimony at trial, however, muddied his otherwise straightforward methodology. At trial, he described his methodology as a \"three-stage process.\" (D.I. 340 at 108.) Stage 1, termed the \"AOC-by-AOC percentage allocation,\" involved\n   creating a percentage allocation specific to each area of concern; stage 2, termed the \"IA-by-IA percentage allocation,\" involved creating a percentage allocation for each impact area; and stage 3, termed \"major remediation allocation,\" involved creating a specific allocation for each major remediation activity. (D.I. 340 at 108-11.) Trinity's counsel, in a perhaps confusingly worded set of questions, asked if each stage was meant \"to be mutually exclusive\" of the other stages, (D.I. 340 at 111), by which he appears to have been asking if each \"stage\" was a separate and distinct methodology that could be used to allocate costs, as opposed to steps in a single methodology. In a truly confusing answer, Gormley stated that the three stages \"weren't supposed to be mutually exclusive,\" and he went on to testify that \"[t]he first [stage] could be taken on its own,\" but that the second and third stages built on the first stage. (D.I. 340 at 111.) He ultimately agreed with Trinity's counsel, however, that each of his three stages \"could be used by someone who was trying to develop their own logical or fair means to allocate responsibility for the contamination at the North Plant[.]\" (D.I. 340 at 111.) Gormley's testimony departed from his expert report in a crucial way - his report made clear that each step in the methodology built on those that came before it, and that they were not independent means to come up with a cost allocation. His testimony, however, was less than clear as to whether the \"stages\" of his methodology were each independent analytical means to allocate costs or steps that built on one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Led by the unclear testimony, the District Court chose Gormley's \"stage 3\" - divorced from the analytical foundations for that stage in the earlier steps of Gormley's analysis - to guide its cost allocation analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   That at least appears to have been the Court's approach because it titled its allocation analysis, \"Overall Allocation of Responsibility based upon Major Remediation Activity\"; it stated that it \"determined an overall allocation based upon the extent of each major remediation activity in each [impact area]\"; it explicitly listed the major remediation activities it \"considered ... in its calculation\"; and it cited Table 7-1 - the table corresponding to Gormley's stage 3 - when reaching its allocation determination. (App. at 375-77.) The District Court, however, materially deviated from Gormley's suggested major remediation activity allocation methodology by focusing only on the quantity of material involved in all major remediation activities, without distinguishing between activities and without regard to cost. That was despite Gormley's testimony confirming \"that a central feature of the analysis ... reflected in [Table] 7-1 is [the] notion of the ... costs[.]\" (D.I. 341 at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The District Court's allocation methodology proceeded in four steps. First, it made its own factual determinations regarding the percentage of responsibility each party bore for contamination in each specific impact area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, it totaled, for each\n   impact area, the quantity of material used or remediated by major remediation activities. The Court's analysis did not differentiate between remediation activities. For example, it treated placing asphalt caps and placing topsoil as functionally the same for its cost allocation analysis despite the fact that those two activities' costs vary significantly. Third, it multiplied, on an impact area-specific basis, each party's percentage of responsibility for contamination with the total quantity of material used or remediated. Fourth, it used the resulting numbers to determine the percentage of material, in total, for which each party was responsible. That calculation led the Court to attribute to Greenlease 83% of responsibility for the contamination of the North Plant and to Trinity 17%. The Court, citing Gormley's testimony and expert report, used those percentages to allocate \"all response costs ..., including responsibility investigation, removal and remedial past costs incurred through February 2015, for general construction costs, ... and future construction costs for ongoing operations and maintenance work.\" (App. at 377 (emphasis omitted).) Those percentages, however, were too speculative for two reasons. First, the Court's methodology failed to differentiate between different remediation activities and their varied costs, and, second, the methodology, as applied, treated data measured in square feet as equivalent to data measured in cubic yards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Although the District Court's reliance on volumetric data as the key factor in allocating response costs is not without support in our case law, its use here was flawed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Agere Systems, Inc. v. Advanced Environmental Technology Corporation\n   </em>\n   , we endorsed a volumetric-centered approach to allocating CERCLA costs because, in that case, \"volume allocation likely reflect[ed] the dollar amounts\" at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3921351\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/204/#p216\">\n    602 F.3d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We clarify here that such a volumetric-centered approach is only appropriate where the evidence supports a finding that one standardized volumetric unit correlates with a standardized per unit measure of cost. That may often be the case when a CERCLA cleanup involves only one impact area, or when a cleanup involves one primary major remediation activity. But when, as here, an environmental cleanup involves many impact areas and remediation activities with varying costs, a volumetric-centered approach that fails to account for cost differences will very likely lead to an allocation that is inequitable because it is divorced from the record evidence and analytically unsound. When, as a hypothetical example, 100 units of material that costs $1 per unit to remediate are treated the same as 100 units of material that costs $10 per unit to remediate, the analysis will be hard to justify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   That kind of error occurred here and was compounded when the District Court treated conceptually distinct units of measurement as equal. It added together data measured in square feet - a unit of surface area - with data measured in cubic yards - a unit of volume. Performing such a calculation was, as Greenlease contends, like comparing \"apples to oranges.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Green.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Opening Br. at 53.) Without pure speculation as to the depths at issue for the square footage measurements, or record evidence establishing those depths, it would not have been possible for the District Court to equate cubic yards to square feet. The Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law do not reflect any such analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Those problematic deviations from Gormley's methodology compel us to conclude that there was an abuse of discretion and that we must vacate the District Court's judgment as to the allocation of costs between Greenlease and Trinity. If the District Court was persuaded by Gormley's analytical approach, then, on remand, it should adhere to the cost allocation methodology he set forth in his expert report - a methodology that both experts relied upon in coming to their respective cost allocation estimates. That methodology will require the Court to conduct a separate cost allocation analysis for each major remediation activity. Much of the information needed for that is readily available in the record, but additional fact-finding by the District Court may be needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To apply Gormley's methodology properly, the District Court must use volumetric and cost data specific to the remediation activities. For every major remediation activity, then, the Court should calculate how much of that activity each party was responsible for. It can then apply that percentage breakdown to the total cost of that specific activity at the North Plant. Once it assigns each party a cost allocation for every major remediation activity, the Court will be able to add the parties' respective shares of costs together. From those totals, the Court can calculate the overall percentages to use in determining an equitable allocation of costs between Greenlease and Trinity. The District Court remains free to exercise its discretion to adjust those percentages, subject to the guidance provided herein. It is also free to reopen the record, should it determine that it is necessary to do so to carry out the kind of analysis we have described.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Trinity's Cross-Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Trinity raises three primary issues in its cross-appeal. First, it appeals the District Court's factual determination of responsibility for the lead contamination at the North Plant. We will affirm because we cannot say that the Court abused its discretion, given the evidentiary record before it. Second, Trinity challenges the District Court's decision to grant Greenlease equitable deductions to account for the Agreement's indemnification provisions and for the purported increase in value of the North Plant following the cleanup. We agree that the District Court erred in the manner in which it applied those equitable\n   deductions. We emphasize, however, that the District Court is free on remand to apply equitable deductions in accordance with the principles discussed in this opinion. Third, Trinity appeals the District Court's determination that Ampco is not liable for the conduct of Greenlease. We will affirm on that point because Trinity cannot demonstrate that Ampco is either directly or derivatively liable for Greenlease's conduct at the North Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The District Court's Allocation of Responsibility for Lead Contamination was Not an Abuse of Discretion.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Trinity challenges the District Court's determination that Greenlease's painting operations did not contribute to lead contamination requiring remediation. It contends that it is undisputed that Greenlease's painting operations at the North Plant resulted in lead runoff seeping into the ground. We review an allocation of CERCLA damages for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Agere Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3921351\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/204/#p216\">\n    602 F.3d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given the evidence and expert testimony in the record supporting the District Court's determination, we do not agree that there was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The District Court did not, as Trinity suggests, \"disregard the co-contributing effects of Greenlease's lead paint releases.\" (Trinity Opening Br. at 64.) Rather, as the Court explained, it found that the historic fill utilized at the North Plant by various parties over the years was \"the source of the lead contamination\n   <em>\n    that required remediation\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (App. at 402.) In other words, the District Court found that any contamination by lead paint alone would not have resulted in contamination requiring remediation. The Court then incorporated \"the overall percentage of responsibility for the lead contamination\n   <em>\n    that required remediation\n   </em>\n   \" in its equitable cost allocation analysis. (App. at 402.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The District Court's finding that historic fill and not lead paint was the source of the contamination requiring remediation was adequately supported by Greenlease's expert Gerritsen. He supported his conclusion by studying soil samples and observing no correlation between painting operations and lead contamination. In particular, Greenlease's expert observed that lead exceeding PADEP standards was consistently present in historic fill rather than native soil. That Trinity's expert reached a different conclusion - without conducting an analysis of soil samples - is of no import. The District Court was entitled to believe Greenlease's expert analysis, as it had adequate support to be admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We agree, and so too does Greenlease, which acknowledges that the District Court's \"percentage reductions were completely arbitrary and speculative.\" (Green. Opening Br. at 24.) The District Court abused its discretion when it applied the 5% equitable deduction because it erroneously interpreted our precedent.

It was only a nuanced application of state contract law that prevented the parties' mutual intent from being enforced as a matter of law. Therefore, in that case, equity demanded that the district court give significant consideration to the parties' shared intent. Here, in contrast, the District Court's findings make clear that there was no mutual intent, as expressed by the written agreement or by the actions of both parties, to shift CERCLA liability following the sale of the North Plant. It was, at most, only Greenlease's subjective intent to shed all CERCLA liability following the expiration of the three-year indemnification period. A party's subjective intent to avoid liability, which contradicts the agreement at issue, should not be given significant consideration when equitably allocating environmental cleanup costs. Because it appears that the District Court here mistook\n   <em>\n    Beazer\n   </em>\n   to permit Greenlease's subjective intent to be given substantial weight, its 5% equitable deduction in favor of Greenlease was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Nothing we have said here should be interpreted as altering the principle set out in\n   <em>\n    Beazer\n   </em>\n   that, as a matter of equity, trial courts can take into consideration \"the intent of the parties ...

But when the intent resulting in the equitable deduction is not shared by both parties and appears contrary to provisions of the contract, a district court must explain why, as a matter of equity, it is nevertheless appropriate to award an equitable deduction. Because we view the District Court as having misapplied\n   <em>\n    Beazer\n   </em>\n   , we remand for it to take a fresh look at whether it is appropriate, on the record before the Court, to award Greenlease an equitable deduction premised on the contractual indemnification provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    The 10% Property Value Increase Deduction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The District Court concluded that a 10% equitable deduction in favor of Greenlease was appropriate because the North Plant's value had increased since the remediation work transformed the site from being unsuitable for any productive purpose to being usable as a site for some commercial or industrial purposes. Although we agree with the District Court's identification of the increased value of a remediated site as an appropriate equitable factor to consider when allocating cleanup costs, we cannot agree with its application of that principle here because the record did not contain any evidence concerning the fair market value of the North Plant, either before or after the remediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   If a landowner successfully seeks contribution from others for environmental cleanup costs, that owner should likely be required to share the benefits of any increase in value brought about by the cleanup.

It advances two closely related theories to support its position that Ampco is legally responsible for Greenlease's conduct at the North Plant. First, Trinity contends that Ampco is directly liable because it qualifies under CERCLA as an \"operator\" of the North Plant. Second, it asserts that, under a veil-piercing theory, Ampco is derivatively liable for Greenlease's operation of the North Plant.

Its primary arguments for piercing the corporate veil are that \"Greenlease became undercapitalized when Ampco siphoned off Greenlease's assets,\" that \"Ampco and Greenlease's interactions exceeded norms that characterize parent/subsidiary relationships,\" (Trinity Opening Br. at 74), that the equities tilt in its favor under Pennsylvania's alter-ego test, and that public policy favors holding Ampco responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   a. Greenlease Was Not Undercapitalized and Ampco Did Not Siphon Funds From Greenlease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Trinity argues that Greenlease's issuing to Ampco some $50 million dollars in dividends in the years following the sale of the North Plant, leaving only $250,000 in reserve for liabilities, favors piercing the corporate veil. But \"the inquiry into corporate capitalization is most relevant for the inference it provides into whether the corporation was established to defraud its creditors or [an]other improper purpose\n   such as avoiding the risks known to be attendant to a type of business.\"\n   <em>\n    Lutyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113228\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/188/#p194\">\n    332 F.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no basis in the record to suggest that Greenlease was undercapitalized while operating the North Plant. Instead, Trinity suggests only that Greenlease lacked funds after Greenlease's operations of the North Plant had effectively stopped. That is of \"little relevancy to determining whether piercing the corporate veil [is] justified here.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113228\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/188/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   There is also no evidence that Greenlease issued dividends to Ampco with awareness of its liability to Trinity or to escape subsequent liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zubik v.

As the District Court noted, \"it would be unreasonable for Ampco to leave Greenlease's earnings from the sale of the North Plant in an account when at the time the dividends were issued Greenlease was a nonoperating company with no known liabilities.\" (App. 91 (emphasis removed).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   b. Greenlease and Ampco's Relationship Was a Typical Parent-Subsidiary Relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Trinity emphasizes that there was significant overlap between the boards of Ampco and Greenlease and argues that Ampco dominated Greenlease to an unusual extent. But \"duplication of some or all of the directors or executive officers\" is not fatal to maintaining legally distinct corporate forms.\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p67\">\n    524 U.S. at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p67\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Greenlease ran the North Plant and hired all of the employees on the ground. Although Ampco was required to approve large decisions, Greenlease generally functioned with autonomy on decisions concerning manufacturing, environmental compliance, and disposal of waste. We have already said and now repeat that the District Court rightly determined that the record simply does not support Trinity's position that Greenlease's relationship with Ampco was materially different than a normal parent-subsidiary relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   c. Trinity Cannot Pierce the Corporate Veil Under Pennsylvania Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Trinity argues that the District Court erred by disregarding the \"equitable underpinnings\" of Pennsylvania's alter-ego framework. (Trinity Reply Br. at 6.) It maintains that Pennsylvania disregards the legal fiction of separate corporate entities \"whenever justice or public policy demand[s]\" it. (Trinity Reply Br. at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ashley v. Ashley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1749632\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/482/228/\">\n    482 Pa. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1749632\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/482/228/\">\n    393 A.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641 (1978).) According to Trinity, permitting Ampco to reap the benefits of the over $50 million in dividends from Greenlease without being held accountable for Greenlease's conduct is an injustice. But Trinity overlooks that Pennsylvania requires a plaintiff seeking to pierce the corporate veil to make \"a threshold showing that the controlled corporation acted robot- or puppet-like in mechanical response\" to the controlling shareholder's demands.\n   <em>\n    E.

To permit Trinity to pierce the corporate veil in this instance, in the face of all the objective criteria favoring Ampco, would, in essence, result in rendering useless Ampco's legitimate use of the corporate form when setting up Greenlease as a subsidiary. The record is devoid of evidence that Ampco misused separate corporate entities for some nefarious purpose. To pierce the corporate veil would thus fly in the face of Pennsylvania's \"strong presumption ... against piercing the corporate veil.\"\n   <em>\n    Lumax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"461484,11335101\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/669/893/\">\n    669 A.2d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   d. Public Policy Considerations Do Not Favor Trinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Finally, Trinity argues that the District Court failed to consider public policy justifications for piercing the corporate veil to ensure that the \"polluter pays.\" (Trinity Opening Br. at 74.) As discussed above, however, both federal and Pennsylvania law favor maintaining the legal fiction of separate corporate entities. Because the evidence does not suggest that there was fraud or an attempt to use a corporate fa\u00e7ade as an alter ego, public policy first favors upholding the integrity of the corporate form. Trinity has not presented any public policy consideration sufficiently compelling to overcome the strong presumption against veil piercing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

While Gormley agreed that \"someone who was trying to develop their own logical or fair means to allocate responsibility\" could incorporate any one of his stages into an allocation methodology, (D.I. 340 at 111), he never testified that someone could separate out one stage, and then use that stage's allocation methodology alone to allocate all cleanup costs for remediating contamination at the North Plant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    We find no error in the Court's underlying factual findings with regard to the contamination in each specific impact area.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Although we determine that the District Court erred in utilizing the cost allocation methodology that it did, the Court's use of volumetric data and a focus on major remediation activity as a means to determine the allocation of response costs was reasonable and within the Court's discretion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    \"Cubic measures and square measures represent fundamentally different things.

Second, our precedent is clear, as a matter of federal common law in this Circuit, that \"[b]ecause alter ego is akin to and has elements of fraud theory, ... it ... must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Lutyk\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113228\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/188/#p194\">\n     332 F.3d at 192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted). Trinity has not presented any compelling argument to revisit that longstanding proposition. Third, we do not need to address the standard of proof we think Pennsylvania applies to its alter-ego analysis because, whether we apply a preponderance of the evidence standard or a clear and convincing evidence standard to the state law analysis, our ultimate conclusion is the same-no reasonable fact-finder could justify piercing the corporate veil on this record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
