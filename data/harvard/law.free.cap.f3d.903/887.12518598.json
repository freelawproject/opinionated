He contends we should reverse because (1) he did not have an interpreter in his native tongue, Zapotecan, at his plea hearing and did not fully understand the proceedings, and (2) the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sessions v. Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), and recent case law from this Circuit undermine the basis for his indictment. His second argument provides a plausible ground for dismissal of the indictment and serves as a \"fair and just reason\" for permitting withdrawal of the plea here. We therefore decline to address his first argument. We vacate the district court's order and remand with instructions to permit Garcia-Lopez to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Garcia-Lopez is a native of Oaxaca, Mexico, and is a member of an indigenous minority group from that area known as the Zapotecs. He grew up speaking Zapotecan at home but learned Spanish for a\n   few years in elementary school. Garcia-Lopez claims that he has \"a very limited understanding of Spanish\" and that he does \"not speak enough ... to be an advocate for [himself].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Conduct Underlying the Federal Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Garcia-Lopez entered the United States at San Ysidro, California, in June 2001. He worked for many years in the United States until he was arrested in 2010 for robbery pursuant to California Penal Code \u00a7 211 (\"California robbery\") and battery pursuant to California Penal Code \u00a7 242. The battery charge was dismissed due to plea negotiations and Garcia-Lopez pled guilty to the robbery charge with the help of a Spanish interpreter. Garcia-Lopez received 36 months of formal probation and served a year in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") then placed him in expedited removal proceedings based on his conviction for an \"aggravated felony\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii), as further defined in 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It essentially determined that California robbery constituted a \"crime of violence\" pursuant to \u00a7 16, and because Garcia-Lopez served at least a year in jail for the offense, it also constituted an \"aggravated felony\" under \u00a7 1101, rendering him deportable under \u00a7 1227. He was deported on April 15, 2011. Garcia-Lopez returned to the United States shortly thereafter and was removed again on April 28, 2011, pursuant to the April 15 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Federal Indictment and Related Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Garcia-Lopez entered the United States a third time, and federal authorities found him in Los Angeles County on February 14, 2014. On May 16, 2014, Garcia-Lopez was charged with violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(2) for allegedly returning to the United States after having been deported in April 2011 and after having been convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\" Garcia-Lopez pled guilty to the single-count indictment, but later sought to withdraw his plea on grounds that he did not have a Zapotecan interpreter at his plea hearing and that his due process rights were violated pursuant to our then-recent decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/\">\n    771 F.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014). He also sought to dismiss the indictment based on\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   and filed a motion pursuant to \u00a7 1326(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a lengthy hearing, the district court denied Garcia-Lopez's Motion to Withdraw his Guilty Plea and therefore declined to consider his Motion to Dismiss the Indictment (\"Motion to Dismiss\"). Based on its review of the record, the district court found\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   inapplicable and further found Garcia-Lopez spoke Spanish well enough to understand his plea proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 4, 2015, Garcia-Lopez was sentenced to 30 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Garcia-Lopez is currently on supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[W]e review a district court's denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

According to the removal order, Garcia-Lopez's conviction for California robbery was a \"crime of violence\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and because Garcia-Lopez served at least a year in jail for the offense, it also constituted an \"aggravated felony\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , rendering him deportable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Garcia-Lopez did not raise in the court below the argument that California robbery does not constitute a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 16. He raised the issue for the first time on appeal and premised his argument on\n   <em>\n    Dimaya v.

Finally, the error would seriously undermine the fairness of the judicial proceedings.

The Government's Arguments Concerning the Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Government contends the Motion to Dismiss is meritless.

Like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Aguilera-Rios\n   </em>\n   , Garcia-Lopez \"would have had no reason to challenge\" whether California robbery constituted a \"crime of violence\" pursuant to \u00a7 16 until the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265185\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/626/#p630\">\n    769 F.3d at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]his Court's case law prior to [\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ] foreclosed the argument he now makes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265185\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/626/#p630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265185\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/626/#p630\">\n    at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, Garcia-Lopez \"demonstrated diligence ... in this Court\" by premising his argument on\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   in his opening brief and then supplementing his briefing once the Supreme Court affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   . The Government, for its part, has had \"a full opportunity to respond in written briefing\" to Garcia-Lopez's arguments.

Thus, it contends, because Garcia-Lopez filed his Motion to Dismiss after he pled guilty, his new argument has always been untimely, and he has therefore waived his ability to bring his Motion. Our cases hold otherwise. In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , we granted relief to a defendant who had failed entirely to bring a \"motion to dismiss ... prior to trial\" because he had shown \"good cause to [set aside] the waiver of his affirmative defenses.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5198350\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/662/#p669\">\n    472 F.3d at 668-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
