Retired union member Ronald Cup and similarly situated retirees requested-and the District Court ordered-arbitration of the dispute under the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation, its subsidiary Akers National Roll Company, and Akers' health and welfare benefit plan (collectively, the Company) filed this appeal, arguing that the District Court erred when it ordered arbitration. The appeal raises important questions of appellate jurisdiction and contract interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Akers operated a manufacturing facility in Avonmore, Pennsylvania. The Avonmore plant's employees were union members represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO/CLC, formerly known as the United Steelworkers of America (USW). For many years Akers and the USW engaged in a negotiation process that culminated in a series of collective bargaining agreements, as well as memoranda of agreement addressing the details of various employment policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2016, Akers was acquired by Ampco and a dispute over healthcare benefits soon arose. At that time, former Avonmore plant employees who had retired but were still under the age of 65 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not yet eligible for Medicare) paid $195 per month for their healthcare. But in July 2016, Ampco announced its intention to eliminate this healthcare plan for former Avonmore plant employees who had retired before March 1, 2015. The new plan would require retirees to purchase health insurance on the private market and then be reimbursed up to $500 per month for individuals or $700 per month for families. The affected retirees opposed this change because \"the monetary value of the monthly reimbursement ... is limited,\" \"the reimbursement is only available for five years,\" and the retirees would have to \"shop to purchase plans on the private market.\" App. 28. They also concluded that it violated a memorandum of agreement (MOA) dated February 26, 2015, which provided that while \"[a]ll active employees [would] be transferred to the [Company's] new health plan. ... [c]urrent retirees will remain on their existing Plan ($195.00 monthly premium).\" App. 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the USW sought recourse under the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in effect at the time. It filed a grievance under Section 6 of the CBA, which applies when \"differences arise between the Company and the Union or its members as to interpretation or application of, or compliance with the [CBA's] provisions.\" App. 207-08. Ampco rejected the grievance on the ground that the Union no longer represented the retirees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The USW and Ronald Cup, who retired from the Avonmore plant in 2014, sued the Company on behalf of Cup and other similarly-situated\n   workers who retired before March 1, 2015. As amended, their complaint contains three counts: (I) a non-substantive claim compelling arbitration under \u00a7 301 of the LMRA, (II) a claim to enforce the CBA under \u00a7 301, and (III) in the alternative, a claim under \u00a7 502(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The USW and Cup (collectively referred to as the Union) brought Counts II and III \"solely in the event that the Court determines that the Company is not obligated to arbitrate the retiree health dispute.\" App. 326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Company moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Union responded by moving to compel arbitration, arguing that Section 6, which permits the Union to \"appeal[ ] ... to arbitration\" an \"unsatisfactory\" Company grievance determination, App. 208, applied to the parties' dispute over the retiree-healthcare provision of the MOA as well as to the CBA itself. The District Court agreed and granted the motion to compel in an order entered on June 13, 2017. Emphasizing the \"strong federal policy in favor of resolving labor disputes through arbitration,\" it found that the CBA's \"broad arbitration provision ... does not expressly narrow or limit the types of disputes that the Parties intend to resolve through ... arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Cup v. Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202559624\">\n    2017 WL 2559624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (W.D.

Because the language of Section 6 was capacious enough to encompass the parties' dispute, the dispute was presumptively arbitrable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Having ruled in the Union's favor on the arbitration count, the District Court did three other things in its June 13 order. First, it dismissed the two substantive counts without ruling on their merits. Second, with the dispute apparently headed for arbitration, it denied the Company's motion to dismiss as moot and announced its intention to order the parties to mediation before the more formal arbitration, as stipulated. Finally, the Court administratively closed the case. The Company timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Meanwhile, the District Court took a number of administrative actions related to the June 13 order. In another order filed the next day, it referred the parties to mediation, which was unsuccessful. The District Court later denied the Company's motion to stay discovery while this appeal was pending, but this Court stayed enforcement of the arbitration order pending the outcome of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Company appeals the District Court's order granting the Union's motion to compel arbitration, asserting appellate jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As always, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear the Company's appeal, and our jurisdiction is not obvious in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We have jurisdiction over \"final decisions of the district courts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 92.

Because finality is the key to jurisdiction under both of these statutes, we must determine whether the District Court's order compelling arbitration and administratively closing this case is final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Union claims the District Court's administrative closure does not mean that its order compelling arbitration was final and appealable. The Union is quite right on this point, as we made clear in\n   <em>\n    Penn West Associates, Inc. v. Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232163,9226934\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/118/\">\n    371 F.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127-28 (3d Cir. 2004). But the order under review here did more than close the case administratively; the District Court also ordered arbitration and dismissed all of the other claims without prejudice.

In this case, the District Court's dismissal of both substantive counts is about as strong a \"signal\" as we can envision, and its order sending the parties to mediation does not call it into question. The parties had stipulated to the mediation earlier in the litigation, and their participation in it-no matter what the outcome-still \"le[ft] nothing more for the [District C]ourt to do.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green Tree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/#p86\">\n    531 U.S. at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/#p86\">\n    121 S.Ct. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As far as the District Court was concerned, the case was over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the reasons stated, we hold that the order compelling arbitration is final for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Federal Arbitration Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Having determined that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we turn to the arbitration order itself. The parties agree that their dispute is arbitrable if it is properly characterized as a \"difference[ ] ... between the Company and the Union or its members as to interpretation or application of, or compliance with the provisions of [the CBA].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 207-08 (CBA Section 6). But the Company argues that this dispute is not subject to arbitration under Section 6, because retiree health benefits are not covered by the CBA. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because CBAs must be interpreted \"according to ordinary principles of contract law,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    M&amp;G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/#p933\">\n    135 S.Ct. 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 933,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/#p933\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), we ascertain whether the CBA provides for retiree health benefits by studying its language. According to the Union, the key provision is found in Section 19, \"Other Plans,\" which provides that the employees subject to the CBA are covered by various benefit \"Plans,\" which include \"Medical Insurance.\" App. 236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Union mischaracterizes Section 19 as \"identif[ying] Company benefits plans enjoyed by both employees\n   <em>\n    and retirees\n   </em>\n   .\" Union Br. 15 (emphasis added). Contrary to the quoted statement, the CBA states that it applies only to \"employees\"-a term defined elsewhere to include \"production and maintenance employees at the Company's Avonmore plant\n   <em>\n    as of the date of this Agreement and thereafter\n   </em>\n   .\" App. 205 (emphasis added). So former employees like Cup, who retired before the CBA went into effect on March 1, 2015, are not \"employees\" under the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Union's fallback position is that even if retirees are not among the \"employees\" to whom Section 19 expressly applies, Section 19 implicitly incorporates the MOA, which\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   discuss retiree health benefits. In relevant part, the MOA provides that while \"[a]ll active employees wi[ll] be transferred to [a] new health plan ... [c]urrent retirees will remain on their existing Plan ($195.00 monthly premium).\" App. 95. The Union contends that this section is implicitly tied to Section 19, which refers to \"Medical Insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 236. Persuaded by this argument, the District Court concluded that the dispute was within the ambit of the CBA (and, by extension, Section 6's arbitration procedure) because the CBA \"expressly includes 'Medical Insurance' as an included ' Other Plan.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202559624\">\n    2017 WL 2559624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (quoting CBA Sections 6 and 19). We cannot agree that the words \"Medical Insurance\" supply the missing link between the MOA and the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even assuming Section 19's reference to \"Medical Insurance\" includes retiree health benefits as well as the \"new health plan\" for current employees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   App. 95, this single mention is insufficient to incorporate the MOA on the subject of retiree healthcare into the CBA. Our conclusion is consistent with\n   <em>\n    United Steelworkers of America v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761264\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/324/\">\n    522 F.3d 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2008), which involved a challenge by a group of manufacturing workers and their union to a denial of disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761264\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761264\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/324/\">\n    at 327, 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like the retiree health plan under discussion here, the retirement plan at issue in\n   <em>\n    RCA\n   </em>\n   \"fail[ed] to provide an independent basis for mandatory arbitration.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844752\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/700/921/#p927\">\n    700 F.2d at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that does not help the Union's cause, because we\n   <em>\n    declined\n   </em>\n   to require arbitration of the dispute in\n   <em>\n    RCA\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844752\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/700/921/#p927\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There, the CBA \"expressly provide[d] for arbitration and mention[ed] the Retirement Plan\" but contained \"no provision ... that either brings or seeks to bring the Retirement Plan within the ambit of the General Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844752\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/700/921/#p927\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For this reason, we concluded that \"mere[ly] mentioning ... the Retirement Plan in the General Agreement [wa]s insufficient reason to construe the Retirement Plan as part and parcel of the General Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844752\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/700/921/#p927\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The same is true of the CBA and MOA in this case. Despite the Union's arguments to the contrary, Section 19 of the CBA does not incorporate the MOA because \"[m]ere reference to another contract or document is not sufficient to incorporate its terms into a contract. There must be an express intent to incorporate, and there is no such expression here.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosenblum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11450895\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/657/#p665\">\n    299 F.3d at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   If anything, the CBA suggests an intent\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to incorporate the MOA, as language expressly incorporating other agreements can be found elsewhere in the CBA. Section 9-E(6), for example, declares that \"[t]he Absentee Control Program and the Tardy/Short Shift Programs ... are incorporated in this contract as a [sic] separate memoranda.\" App. 214. This section makes clear that the parties to the CBA knew how to incorporate other agreements into the CBA, so it's telling that they chose not to use the same language in Section 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With the benefit of hindsight, the Union now tries to reverse-engineer the requisite intent to incorporate, arguing that \"[o]ver the years, the parties [have] repeatedly used the CBA grievance and arbitration procedures to resolve their disputes about benefits identified in the CBA's 'Other Plans' section, including disputes regarding retiree benefits.\" Union Br. 9.
