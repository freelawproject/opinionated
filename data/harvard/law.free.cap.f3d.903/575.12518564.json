Med. Coll. of Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p641\">\n    418 F.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641 (6th Cir. 2005). Just last year, we encountered the credibility contest that we contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Flaim\n   </em>\n   and confirmed that when credibility is at issue, the Due Process Clause mandates that a university provide accused students a hearing with the opportunity to conduct cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    872 F.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401-02 (6th Cir. 2017). Today, we reiterate that holding once again: if a public university has to choose between competing narratives to resolve a case, the university must give the accused student or his agent an opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder. Because the University of Michigan failed to comply with this rule, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   John Doe and Jane Roe were students at the University of Michigan. Halfway through Roe's freshman and Doe's junior year, the two crossed paths at a \"Risky Business\" themed fraternity party. While\n   there, they had a drink, danced, and eventually had sex. Two days later, Roe filed a sexual misconduct complaint with the university claiming that she was too drunk to consent. And since having sex with an incapacitated person (unsurprisingly) violates university policy, the administration immediately launched an investigation. Over the course of three months, the school's investigator collected evidence and interviewed Roe, Doe, and twenty-three other witnesses. Two stories emerged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, Doe told the investigator that Roe did not appear drunk and that she was an active participant in their sexual encounter. According to him, the night went something like this: after he and Roe had a drink, danced, and kissed at the party, the two decided to go upstairs to his bedroom. Once there, they kissed \"vigorous[ly]\" and eventually made their way onto his bed. R. 16, Pg. ID 332. After they jointly removed their clothing, he asked Roe if she wanted to have sex. She said, \"Yeah,\" and the two proceeded to have intercourse followed by oral sex.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 333-34. When they were done, they cuddled until Roe became sick and vomited into a trash can by Doe's bed. Doe rubbed her back for five or so minutes and then left to use the bathroom and talk with friends. By the time he returned, Roe was crying and another female student was helping her gather her things. He asked Roe if she was okay, but Roe's new companion told him to \"[g]o away\" and the two women walked out of the room.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 335. At the time, he assumed that Roe was upset because he had left her alone after they had sex. He asserted that he had no reason to believe that she was drunk or that Roe thought any of his sexual advances were unwelcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Roe remembered the night differently. According to her, she was drunk and unaware of her surroundings when she and Doe went to his room. While kissing near the doorway, she told Doe \"no sex\" before she \"flopped\" onto his bed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 325-26. Without asking, Doe undressed her and had intercourse with her while she \"laid there in a hazy state of black out.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 326. And at some point, she passed out and woke up to Doe having oral sex with her. Afterwards, she felt a \"spinning sensation\" and fell back onto the bed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 327. Doe asked her if she was okay, and she told him that she was not. So Doe placed a trash can by the side of his bed and left the room. She proceeded to vomit into the trash can. Afterward, she attempted to find her clothes but could not get her bearings. Feeling a sense of \"desperation and defeat,\" she tried to catch another female student's attention by making \"vomit sounds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It worked, and the female student (\"Witness 2\") helped Roe find her clothes, put them on, and get back to her dorm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   If Doe's and Roe's stories seem at odds, the twenty-three other witnesses did not offer much clarification. Almost all of the male witnesses corroborated Doe's story, and all of the female witnesses corroborated Roe's. For example, Doe's roommate said that Roe \"didn't seem like she was hammered or that drunk,\" although he stated that he did not \"want to speculate\" about whether she had had some alcohol because he did not talk to her directly or \"really interact with [her]\" much.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at Pg. ID 339. Yet he mentioned that in his two interactions with her, he did not smell alcohol on her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Doe's roommate further alleged that Roe and Witness 2 were just \"rallying against a fraternity guy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 339-41. Another member of Doe's fraternity told the investigator that he saw Doe and Roe \"making out\" on the dance floor and there was no reason to suspect that either of them had too much to drink.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 347. And two others stated that Roe did not appear drunk when she left Doe's room at the end of the night,\n   although they indicated they had limited observations of Roe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Roe's sorority sisters, on the other hand, reported that Roe seemed \"more than a little buzzed\" at the party because her eyes were \"open but unfocused\" and she \"trail[ed] off at the end of sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 345-46. The female student who helped Roe leave the party told the investigator that she found Roe crying and \"very drunk\" in Doe's bed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 342-43. And two other friends provided that when Roe returned to her dorm that night, she sobbed on the floor of her room and said \"she thought she'd been raped.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 352.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Given the students' conflicting statements, the investigator concluded that the evidence supporting a finding of sexual misconduct was not more convincing than the evidence offered in opposition to it. The investigator did note, however, that Witness 2 might have been a more credible witness because she had no prior connection to Doe, Roe, or their respective Greek organizations. But because Witness 2 only observed Roe after the sexual encounter had ended, the investigator concluded that she could not address the relevant question-Roe's level of intoxication\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the encounter or what signs of intoxication she manifested at that time. So after three months of thorough fact-finding, the investigator was unable to say that Roe exhibited outward signs of incapacitation that Doe would have noticed before initiating sexual activity. Accordingly, the investigator recommended that the administration rule in Doe's favor and close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Roe appealed. She argued that the evidence did not support the investigator's findings and asked the university to reconsider. The case went up to the university's Appeals Board, and a three-member panel reviewed the investigator's report. After two closed sessions (without considering new evidence or interviewing any students), the Board reversed. Although the Board found that the investigation was fair and thorough, it thought the investigator was wrong to conclude that the evidence was in equipoise. According to the Board, Roe's description of events was \"more credible\" than Doe's, and Roe's witnesses were more persuasive. R. 6-5, Pg. ID 274-75. As a result, the university set the investigator's recommendation aside and proceeded to the sanction phase. Facing the possibility of expulsion, Doe agreed to withdraw from the university. He was 13.5 credits short of graduating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Since then, Doe filed a lawsuit claiming that the university's disciplinary proceedings violated the Due Process Clause and Title IX. He argues that because the university's decision turned on a credibility finding, the school was required to give him a hearing with an opportunity to cross-examine Roe and adverse witnesses. He also maintains that the Board violated Title IX by discriminating against him on account of his gender. The university filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court granted in full. Doe now appeals, and we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Kottmyer v.

He claims that because the university's decision ultimately turned on a credibility determination, the school was required to give him a hearing with an opportunity to cross-examine Roe and other adverse witnesses. The district court dismissed this claim, finding that even if credibility was at issue, the university's failure to allow for cross-examination was \"immaterial\" in Doe's case. R. 74, Pg. ID 2871. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When it comes to due process, the \"opportunity to be heard\" is the constitutional minimum.\n   <em>\n    Grannis v.

But determining what being \"heard\" looks like in each particular case is a harder question.

So, consistent with this command, our circuit has made two things clear: (1) if a student is accused of misconduct, the university must hold some sort of hearing before imposing a sanction as serious as expulsion or suspension, and (2) when the university's determination turns on the credibility of the accuser, the accused, or witnesses, that hearing must include an opportunity for cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    872 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   399-402 ;\n   <em>\n    Flaim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p641\">\n    418 F.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Due process requires cross-examination in circumstances like these because it is \"the greatest legal engine ever invented\" for uncovering the truth.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    872 F.3d at 401-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not only does cross-examination allow the accused to identify inconsistencies in the other side's story, but it also gives the fact-finder an opportunity to assess a witness's demeanor and determine who can be trusted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So if a university is faced with competing narratives about potential misconduct, the administration must facilitate some form of cross-examination in order to satisfy due process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Doe claims that the university ran afoul of this well-established rule in his disciplinary proceedings.

As it turns out, the university already provides for a hearing with cross-examination in all misconduct cases other than those involving sexual assault. So the administration already has all the resources it needs to facilitate cross-examination and knows how to oversee the process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    872 F.3d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a university does not bear a significant administrative burden when it already has procedures in place to accommodate cross-examination). And, importantly, the university identifies no substantial burden that would be imposed on it if it were required to provide an opportunity for cross-examination in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Still, the university offers four reasons why Doe's claim is not as plausible as it seems. None do the trick. First, the university contends that even if Doe did not have a formal opportunity to question Roe, he was permitted to review her statement and submit a response identifying inconsistencies for the investigator. As such, the university claims that there would have been no added benefit to cross-examination. But this circuit has already flatly rejected that argument. In\n   <em>\n    University of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   , we explained that an accused's ability \"to draw attention to alleged inconsistencies\" in the accuser's statements does not render cross-examination futile.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    at 401-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That conclusion applies equally here, and we see no reason to doubt its wisdom. Cross-examination is essential in cases like Doe's because it does\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than uncover inconsistencies-it \"takes aim at credibility like no other procedural device.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without the back-and-forth of adversarial questioning, the accused cannot probe the witness's story to test her memory, intelligence, or potential ulterior motives.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Universities have a legitimate interest in avoiding procedures that may subject an alleged victim to further harm or harassment.

But in circumstances like these, the answer is not to deny cross-examination altogether. Instead, the university could allow the accused student's agent to conduct cross-examination on his behalf. After all, an individual aligned with the accused student can accomplish the benefits of cross-examination-its adversarial nature and the opportunity for follow-up-without subjecting the accuser to the emotional trauma of directly confronting her alleged attacker.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

The university's first argument is therefore unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the university contends that Doe is not entitled to cross-examination because the university's decision did not depend\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   on a credibility contest between Roe and Doe. For support, the university brings our attention back to\n   <em>\n    University of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   , where we emphasized the exclusively \"he said/she said\" nature of the investigation at issue in that case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    872 F.3d at 395, 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the university reads far too much into that point. When we emphasized the exclusively \"he said/she said\" nature of the\n   <em>\n    University of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   dispute, we were not implying that cross-examination would be less important in cases where the school's finding rested on the credibility of several witnesses instead of one or two. Rather, we merely distinguished that case from others holding that cross-examination was unnecessary when the university's decision did not rely on\n   <em>\n    any testimonial evidence at\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    at 401, 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Plummer v.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    University of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that cross-examination is required only if the university's decision depends solely on the accuser's statement. Instead,\n   <em>\n    University of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   is consistent with our conclusion today: if credibility is in dispute and material to the outcome, due process requires cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    872 F.3d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that credibility disputes might be more common in sexual misconduct proceedings than other university disciplinary investigations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, the university claims that cross-examination was unnecessary in Doe's case because he admitted to the misconduct in a police interview the day after the incident in question. Here, the university is right about the law but wrong about the facts. This court has long held that cross-examination is unnecessary if a student admits to engaging in misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Flaim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p641\">\n    418 F.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After all, there is little to be gained by subjecting witnesses to adversarial questioning when the accused student has already confessed. But at the motion-to-dismiss stage, we cannot conclude that Doe confessed to the misconduct in this case. To see why, a closer look at the police report is instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During the police interview, a detective asked Doe to describe the previous night's sexual encounter. When doing so, Doe told the detective that Roe performed oral sex on him before they engaged in intercourse, and that when the pair began to have intercourse, Roe was on top. As it turns out, this story was different than the one Roe had reported to the detective earlier that day. According to the detective, Roe claimed that she told Doe \"no sex\" before making her way to the bed, and that she performed oral sex on Doe after the pair had intercourse. The detective thus relayed Roe's version of the story to Doe, and Doe immediately conceded that Roe was right and that he \"got it all wrong.\" R. 16, Pg. ID 356. Even so, however, Doe reiterated that (1) he never heard Roe say \"no sex,\" (2) he \"didn't rape\" Roe, and (3) he believed their sexual encounter was consensual.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p641\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the district court made this report part of the pleadings, we must read it in the light most favorable to Doe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Logsdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507516\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/334/#p340\">\n    492 F.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When we do, we cannot conclude that Doe admitted to any of the critical facts in his case-i.e., that Roe was too drunk to consent to sex, and that he knew or should have known as much. For one, we would have to ignore Doe's claim that the sex was \"consensual.\" R. 16, Pg. ID 356. And for another, because Doe did not mention anything about Roe's level of intoxication in his own account of the night's events, his concession that Roe was correct and that he \"got it all wrong\" appears to relate only to the points on which the detective said their two accounts actually diverged-the order of the sexual acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507516\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/334/#p340\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Pg. ID 354-56. This alleged confession thus does not sufficiently rebut the plausibility of Doe's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The university offers one last ditch effort to avoid reversal. It points out that\n   although Doe did not have an opportunity to cross-examine Roe in the university disciplinary process, he recently deposed her in state civil proceedings. According to the university, because Roe's deposition is consistent with what she told the investigator, Doe's inability to cross-examine her during the disciplinary proceedings did not cause any prejudice. To start, Doe disputes whether Roe's deposition is, in fact, consistent with her earlier statements in the disciplinary process. But more importantly, Roe's later deposition has no bearing on this case. As discussed above, the value of cross-examination is tied to the fact-finder's ability to assess the witness's demeanor.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    872 F.3d at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So just as a written response insufficiently substitutes for cross-examination, so too does a written deposition transcript. And, critically, cross-examination for the sake of cross-examination is not what Doe seeks. Rather, Doe seeks cross-examination as part of the credibility assessment\n   <em>\n    by the university\n   </em>\n   . That a state court later allowed for cross-examination as a part of\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   fact-finding after the university had already made its decision is beside the point. If anything, the fact that the state court allowed cross-examination only goes to show just how far removed the university's fact-finding procedures are from the tried and true methods invoked by courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264871\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/393/#p401\">\n    at 404-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that while classrooms are not courtrooms, at the very least a circumscribed version of cross-examination is required (citing\n   <em>\n    Cummins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12136955\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/662/437/#p446\">\n    662 F.

When news of the investigation broke, student groups and local media outlets sharply criticized the administration. The federal government's investigation and the negative media reports continued for years, throughout the Board's consideration of Doe's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This public attention and the ongoing investigation put pressure on the university to prove that it took complaints of sexual misconduct seriously. The university stood to lose millions in federal aid if the Department found it non-compliant with Title IX. The university also knew that a female student had triggered the federal investigation and that the news media consistently highlighted the university's poor response to female complainants. Of course, all of this external pressure alone is not enough to state a claim that the university acted with bias in this particular case. Rather, it provides a backdrop that, when combined with other circumstantial evidence of bias in Doe's specific proceeding, gives rise to a plausible claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Specifically, the Board credited exclusively female testimony (from Roe and her witnesses) and rejected all of the male testimony (from Doe and his witnesses). In doing so, the Board explained that Doe's witnesses lacked credibility because \"many of them were fraternity brothers of [Doe].\" But the Board did not similarly note that several of Roe's witnesses were her sorority sisters, nor did it note that they were female. This is all the more telling in that the initial investigator who actually interviewed all of these witnesses found in favor of Doe. The Board, by contrast, made all of these credibility findings on a cold record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   When viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Doe, as we must, one plausible explanation is that the Board discredited all males, including Doe, and credited all females, including Roe, because of gender bias. And so this specific allegation of adjudicator bias, combined with the external pressure facing the university, makes Doe's claim plausible. Indeed, other courts facing similar allegations have reached the same result.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miami Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p600\">\n    882 F.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff's complaint was sufficient where allegations included that the university faced \"pressure from the government to combat vigorously sexual assault on college campuses and the severe potential punishment-loss of all federal funds-if it failed to comply\");\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

But when viewed against the backdrop of external pressure, the Board's decision to discredit Doe's fraternity brothers in part because they were fraternity brothers, while not holding Roe's witnesses to the same standard, is basis enough at the motion-to-dismiss stage. Of course, anti-male bias is not the only plausible explanation for the university's conduct, or even the most plausible. The university might have been unaffected by the federal investigation or the media's criticism, and the significance of the Board's decision to disregard Doe's witnesses' statements might be overblown. And as the dissent points out, the Board might have ruled the way it did because it believed Witness 2's testimony was more credible. But alternative explanations are not fatal to Doe's ability to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    16630 Southfield Ltd. P'ship v.

Certain allegations that we must assume are true might be proven false. And with the benefit of exhibits, testimony, and cross-examination, a fact-finder may conclude that the inferences we were required to draw in Doe's favor are simply untenable. But these possibilities cannot affect this court's evaluation of Doe's complaint. Our job is simply to ensure that Doe is not deprived of an opportunity to prove what he has alleged unless he would lose regardless. Because Doe has alleged facts that state a plausible claim for relief, we reverse the district court's decision to dismiss his complaint. Whether he will ultimately succeed is a question for another day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Archaic Assumptions and Deliberate Indifference\n   </em>\n   . Doe advances two more theories of Title IX liability. First, he maintains that the university relied on archaic assumptions about the sexes when resolving his case.

The problem for Doe, however, is that neither of these theories applies in the context of university disciplinary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Title IX plaintiffs use the archaic-assumptions theory to show that a\n   school denied a student an equal opportunity to participate in an athletic program because of historical assumptions about boys' and girls' physical capabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mallory v.

Nor does Doe allege any facts suggesting a pattern of discriminatory behavior by the University in its response to sexual-assault allegations, or that he made any sexual-misconduct complaints himself that the University ignored, in contrast to the plaintiff's allegations in\n   <em>\n    Miami University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p600\">\n    882 F.3d at 590-91, 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, the investigator here found in favor of Doe, and Doe acknowledged that her investigation was \"thorough.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Doe also fails to show how general pressure on the University's administration to pursue and effectively address sexual-assault complaints led the Appeals Board-a board made up of an assistant dean from the law school, a retired professor from the dentistry school, and a student-to take actions against him based on gender bias. He also fails to identify any practice or policy adopted by the University in response to either external or internal pressure that would reflect bias against males. Moreover, the media reports published\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Appeals Board decision (which reports allege that the University was continuing to inadequately address sexual-misconduct complaints) would appear to belie any contention that the University had overcorrected by adopting policies or practices biased against male students accused of sexual misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The majority in fact recognizes that the alleged external pressure on the University alone is not sufficient to plausibly show that a university acted based on gender bias in Doe's particular case. Maj. Op. at 586. But it concludes that this pressure is sufficient when combined with Doe's allegation that the Appeals Board adopted all of the statements made by the female witnesses and rejected all of the statements made by the male witnesses. Maj. Op. at 586-87. More specifically, the majority reasons that \"when viewed against the backdrop of external pressure, the Board's decision to discredit Doe's fraternity brothers in part because they were fraternity brothers, while not holding Roe's witnesses to the same standard, is basis enough at the motion-to-dismiss-stage.\" Maj. Op. at 587. But the majority's observation about the Appeals' Board's alleged disparate treatment of the witnesses is not borne out by the record. (I recognize that the record would not normally be considered at the motion to dismiss stage of the case. But as acknowledged in footnote 4 of the majority opinion, the administrative record was referenced in the complaint and, without objection by either party, considered as part of the pleadings.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To start with, the Appeals Board discussed statements from only two of Roe's sorority sisters, although additional sorority sisters provided statements that were contained in the investigator's report. The record reflects the following evaluation by the Appeals Board:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Two witnesses who know [Roe] reported that they observed [Roe] drinking from the wine bag at [Doe's] fraternity and also reported that they perceived she was intoxicated for a variety of reasons (very energetic when she's drunk; inhibitions were lowered; and speech that was 'not completely clear,' contained 'occasional slurs,' and occasionally trailed off at the end of sentences).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Appeals Board provided no further discussion of these statements that would suggest that it was relying on them beyond its observation that Roe's statements were \"corroborated by other witnesses, particularly by Witness 2's observations of [Roe's] behavior and physical condition immediately after the sexual encounter.\" And this observation by the Appeals Board leads directly to the biggest weakness in both Doe's and the majority's position: the Appeals Board's decision to credit the testimony of Roe and Witness 2 (and subsequently to find Doe responsible for sexual misconduct) was based on the considerations that (1) Witness 2 spent significant time with Roe following Roe's sexual encounter with Doe, and (2) Witness 2 had no connection to Doe, Roe, or their respective Greek institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Appeals Board explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Although there were other witnesses who observed Complainant both prior to and after the sexual encounter with Respondent, many of them were fraternity brothers of Respondent, and all of them only observed Complainant briefly and/or at a distance. For these reasons, we find their statements to be significantly less persuasive than the statements of Complainant and Witness 2. Complainant knew that she consumed an excessive amount of alcohol and recognized that she was not mentally or physically in control. Witness 2 had no previous connection to Complainant and observed her for a lengthy period of time, spanning from a few minutes after Complainant's sexual encounter with the Respondent, through the time she got Complainant into bed at her dorm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Whether the statements made by Roe's sorority sisters were credible was not discussed. The Appeals Board's decision instead shows that the statements by Doe and his witnesses were disfavored only as compared to the statements of Roe and Witness 2, and that there was no categorical preference shown for or against statements by fraternity brothers versus sorority sisters, or for or against statements by men versus women as such. The Appeals Board also noted that Witness 2's observations were further corroborated by two witnesses who helped Roe into a vehicle outside the fraternity house and who, like Witness 2, had no connection to Doe or Roe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   I therefore find no basis to reasonably infer that the Appeals Board declined to rely on the statements made by Doe and his witnesses\n   <em>\n    simply because they were men\n   </em>\n   . This leaves us with only one fact from which to infer that gender bias caused the procedural defects in Doe's disciplinary proceedings-the general pressure on the University to adequately address sexual-assault claims.
