Morgan II and Anita L. Graf sued Fairfield County, Ohio, three of its officials, and five members of its sheriff's department under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming Fourth Amendment violations. Specifically, Morgan and Graf alleged that individual officers of the county's SCRAP unit-Street Crime Reduction and Apprehension Program-violated their Fourth Amendment rights when they surrounded Morgan's and Graf's house, without a warrant or exigent circumstances, in order to perform a 'knock and talk.'\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also claimed that the county violated their Fourth Amendment rights by making such illegal entries of property a policy or practice. The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in full. The district court was correct to conclude that the law was not clearly established, so that the claims against the individual officers failed on qualified immunity grounds. The district court was wrong, however, to conclude that the county was not liable for injuries caused by a policy that directed officers to make warrantless entries onto constitutionally protected property with no regard for-or even recognition of-constitutional limits. For these reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Morgan and Graf owned a home together on about a one-acre lot. The front of the house faced the road, and a sidewalk ran from the road to their front door. In the front window and on a vehicle parked on the property were no-trespassing signs. There were neighboring homes-each approximately 300 feet away. At the time of the events of this case, one of the neighboring houses was occupied; the other was empty. There were only limited sightlines between the houses and no residences across the street or behind Morgan's and Graf's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the back of the house there was a second-story balcony that was not visible from the front of the residence. There were no stairs to the balcony, so that the only way to access it was through the house. On one side of the balcony was a privacy fence, blocking the view to the one neighbor's house that was occupied. On the other side, large trees blocked the view to the unoccupied neighboring house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The county's SCRAP unit received two anonymous tips that Morgan and Graf were growing marijuana and cooking methamphetamine at their house. The SCRAP unit was familiar with Morgan and Graf; they had conducted a 'knock and talk' a year earlier and let Morgan and Graf off with a warning. The two new tips were not sufficient to establish probable cause for a warrant, however, and so the SCRAP unit decided to do another 'knock and talk.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Five members of the SCRAP unit went to the house and, following their standard practice, surrounded the house before knocking on the door. One officer was stationed at each corner of the house, and\n   one approached the front door. The officers around the perimeter were standing approximately five-to-seven feet from the house itself. The officers forming the perimeter could see through a window into the house on at least one side of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With the officers in position, the officer at the front door-Deputy Lyle Campbell-knocked and spoke briefly with Graf. Graf shut the door, remaining inside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Campbell was speaking with Graf, one of the officers positioned in the back of the house noticed seven marijuana plants growing on the second-floor back balcony and notified the other members of the SCRAP unit. By the time Campbell learned of the plants, Graf already had closed the front door. Fearing destruction of evidence, Campbell then demanded that Graf return and open the door. Almost immediately after voicing that demand, he opened the door, entered the house, and brought Morgan and Graf outside to wait for a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An Ohio court issued a search warrant based on the officers' observation of the marijuana plants. During the ensuing search, the police found weapons, drugs, and drug paraphernalia. Morgan and Graf were arrested and charged in state court. The trial court denied Morgan's and Graf's suppression motion, after which Morgan pleaded guilty and Graf was found guilty by a jury. On appeal, however, the denial of the suppression motion was overturned and the convictions vacated. The State of Ohio subsequently dropped the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The proceedings below\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the dismissal of the charges, Morgan and Graf filed this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action, alleging violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. They sued four members of the SCRAP unit in both their individual and official capacities, and they sued two Fairfield County commissioners and the Fairfield County sheriff in their official capacities. They also sued the county itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Morgan and Graf alleged that forming a perimeter around the house intruded on their curtilage, an area protected by the Fourth Amendment. What is more, the intrusion was not a one-time event-it was the county's policy to do so during every 'knock and talk.' On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court dismissed all of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, addressing the claims against the officers in their individual capacities, the district court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. Specifically, the court held, qualified immunity was appropriate because even if intruding onto the curtilage violated the Fourth Amendment, it was not clearly established that such an action was a violation at the time of the 'knock and talk'-June 19, 2012. The district court relied on the unpublished decision in\n   <em>\n    Turk v. Comerford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741837\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/488/933/\">\n    488 F. App'x 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2012), which this court had issued a month after the 'knock and talk' incident at issue here. In\n   <em>\n    Turk\n   </em>\n   , police had surrounded a home for a 'knock and talk' because they believed that a dangerous fugitive was inside.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741837\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/488/933/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741837\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/488/933/\">\n    at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Turk\n   </em>\n   panel looked to the opinion in\n   <em>\n    Hardesty v. Hamburg Township\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672706\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/646/\">\n    461 F.3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2006), which recognized that curtilage gets Fourth Amendment protection but concluded that officers may intrude on curtilage to look for someone during a\n   'knock and talk'\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they have indications that someone is inside and just not answering the door. Because it was unclear whether the logic of\n   <em>\n    Hardesty\n   </em>\n   applied to surrounding a house \"with no warrant, exigent circumstances, or consent,\" the panel in\n   <em>\n    Turk\n   </em>\n   concluded that the police were entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741837\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/488/933/\">\n    488 F. App'x at 947-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on\n   <em>\n    Turk\n   </em>\n   , the district court here concluded that if the law was not settled in July 2012, it was not settled in June 2012. Thus, the district court reasoned, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Next, the district court addressed the official-capacity claims and the claim against the county-correctly analyzed as one claim against Fairfield County-and concluded that Morgan and Graf could not meet the standard for municipal liability required by\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). The court noted that Morgan and Graf could not show that the policy was facially unconstitutional because there could be instances in which the policy would be applied constitutionally. Nor, said the district court, could they satisfy the burden of showing that the county was deliberately indifferent to unconstitutional application of its policy. The district court thus granted summary judgment in favor of all of the defendants on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This court reviews a grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Daughenbaugh v.

That is true especially when, as here, there are no neighbors behind the house and the backyard is not visible from the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The county mistakenly focuses its application of the\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   analysis on the backyard balcony itself, arguing that the there is no search because the balcony was not part of the curtilage. But even if the county were correct that a backyard, second-story balcony with no outside access was not part of the curtilage, it would make no difference here, because the balcony is not what is at issue. The curtilage that the officers are said to have entered is the area surrounding the house, five-to-seven feet from the residence. Regarding that area, the county argues only two points-first that the immediate perimeter surrounding the house was not part of the curtilage because there was no fence enclosing the rear or perimeter of the house and, second, that area was not part of the curtilage because Morgan and Graf had neighbors. Those arguments are belied, however, by\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   and the \"relatively unambiguous\" conclusion this court came to 20 years ago in\n   <em>\n    Daughenbaugh\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the area surrounding Morgan's and Graf's house was curtilage, and curtilage is treated as part of the home for Fourth Amendment purposes, the officers' entry onto the curtilage could be justified only by a warrant or one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. It is undisputed that the SCRAP unit had no warrant. As for exceptions to the warrant requirement, the county argues that the entry was justified for three reasons. None, however, is convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the county argues that forming a perimeter was not unconstitutional because the officers were protecting their own safety. To be sure, officer safety can be an exigency justifying warrantless entry. But \"[q]ualification for this exception is not easy\" and requires a particularized showing of a risk of immediate harm.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Purcell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3578252\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/953/#p960\">\n    526 F.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 960 (6th Cir. 2008). The only particularized facts that the county offers here are a contested fact,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Morgan was in a motorcycle gang, and a fact with no citation to the record,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Morgan may have had a weapon. Without more, the county cannot show \"the need for prompt action by government personnel\" required to conclude that delay to obtain a warrant \"would be unacceptable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3578252\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/953/#p960\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Yet rather than citing a case supporting that position, the county argues that drugs and guns often go together. Maybe. But that is no more than a general statement of correlation; and generic possibilities of danger cannot overcome the required particularized showing of a risk of immediate harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 961. But,\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   the officers knew that Morgan had a weapon, \"[t]he mere presence of firearms does not create exigent circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It might be safer for the police to enter the curtilage to form a perimeter; it would certainly be easier to\n   stop someone who might flee by establishing some sort of barrier to that flight. Indeed, many (if not most) Fourth Amendment violations would benefit the police in some way: It could be safer for police without a warrant to kick in the door in the middle of the night rather than ring the doorbell during the day, and peering through everyone's windows might be a more effective way to find out who is cooking methamphetamine (or engaging in any illegal behavior, for that matter). But the Bill of Rights exists to protect people from the power of the government, not to aid the government. Adopting defendants' position would turn that principle on its head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the county argues that the officers' presence in the backyard was not a search because they were not there for the purpose of executing a search.\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   forecloses that argument. The subjective intent of officers is irrelevant if a search is otherwise objectively reasonable, but subjective intent cannot make reasonable an otherwise unreasonable intrusion onto a constitutionally protected area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    569 U.S. at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, the county does not attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   -in fact it fails to cite it altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the county argues that the marijuana plants were discovered in plain view. It is a long-standing rule that police do not conduct a search under the Fourth Amendment by seeing something that is in plain view. After all, the Fourth Amendment does not require police to \"shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares.\"\n   <em>\n    Ciraolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12541\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/207/#p212\">\n    476 U.S. at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12541\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/207/#p212\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As explained above, the SCRAP unit discovered the marijuana only after entering Morgan's and Graf's constitutionally protected curtilage. The plain-view exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The SCRAP unit was concerned about general drug activity at Morgan's and Graf's house.

But as we held in\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   , and recently reaffirmed in\n   <em>\n    Arrington-Bey\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]here are important differences between these types of claims\" and so we must analyze them differently.\n   <em>\n    Arrington-Bey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276604\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/988/#p995\">\n    858 F.3d at 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That means that we must be careful not to apply\n   <em>\n    Gregory\n   </em>\n   too broadly.\n   <em>\n    Gregory\n   </em>\n   may help to determine municipal liability when an employee's\n   <em>\n    interpretation\n   </em>\n   of a policy causes harm. But that is not the case here. Like\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   , this case presents a straightforward challenge to the county's policy itself. And, as in\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   , we apply a straightforward test: Morgan and Graf must \"(1) identify the municipal policy or custom, (2) connect the policy to the municipality, and (3) show that [their] particular injur[ies] [were] incurred due to execution of that policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Alkire v.

It is uncontested that the county's policy required officers to enter \"\n   <em>\n    onto\n   </em>\n   the back\" of any property during\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   'knock and talk.' And as acknowledged by the sheriff and members of the SCRAP unit, that policy did not give any leeway for the officers to consider the constitutional limits that they might face. The SCRAP unit did not weigh the characteristics of properties to determine what parts of the properties were curtilage (and thus off limits). The policy gave no weight to the core value of the Fourth Amendment-one's right to retreat into his or her home \"and there be free from unreasonable government intrusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611993\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1663/#p1670\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    569 U.S. at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Quite the opposite: the policy commanded that the SCRAP unit ignore those limits. It was not one employee's interpretation of a policy that caused Morgan's and Graf's injuries-the policy was carried out precisely as it was articulated. And so, because the county's policy itself was the cause of Morgan's and Graf's injury, the county should be held liable under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is well-established that a warrantless entry of the home or the area immediately surrounding the home is presumed unreasonable unless it meets one of a few narrow exceptions. The SCRAP unit, following official policy, entered the constitutionally protected area around Morgan's and Graf's home without a warrant and without satisfying any of the narrow exceptions to the warrant requirement. In doing so, they violated the Fourth Amendment. But because of the state of this circuit's Fourth Amendment law at the time of the search, it was not clearly established that members of the SCRAP unit could not do what they did. For that reason, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's decision granting summary judgment to the individual officers based on qualified immunity. On the other hand, because the county's policy itself required officers to ignore the Constitution's rules protecting the curtilage and the home, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to the county\n   and the county officials in their official capacities.

IV. This mandate, though seemingly straightforward, has generated a morass of legal precedent that is often confusing, contradictory, and incomplete. After over two-hundred years, we are still not sure whether the Amendment protects privacy or property, and, in turn, what questions are relevant for determining whether a search occurred or if it was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At times like this, courts should turn back to first principles. The Amendment's text tells us that a Fourth Amendment violation occurs when three things are\n   true: (1) the government engages in a search, (2) of a person, house, paper, or effect, (3) that unreasonably violates a person's right to be secure in that object. To understand the meaning of those terms and place those inquiries in context, we look to the Fourth Amendment's meaning at the founding. For example, history shows that a \"search\" meant then what it means now: a purposeful, investigative act (and nothing more). When we apply this meaning to Morgan and Graf's case, no Fourth Amendment violation occurred here: the county's policy did not direct the officers to conduct a search. And, for slightly different reasons, existing Supreme Court precedent compels the same conclusion.

Start with\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   's \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p357\">\n    at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p357\">\n    88 S.Ct. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Harlan, J., concurring).

But the case at hand presented something different: the officers were using more than their naked eye yet doing something short of common law trespass.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To thread the needle, the Court held that \"obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally-protected area constitutes a search-at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citation omitted). What to do if the technology\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   in general public use, the Court has not said. And how to go about analogizing ever-evolving technology to on-foot search techniques will likely prove more difficult than the Court envisions. Under the ordinary and original meaning of \"search,\" however, neither question arises. The officers conducted a search in\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   because using a thermal imager to determine whether heat is emanating from a house is a purposeful, investigative act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A \"search\" under the Fourth Amendment is thus easier to identify when we are faithful to the ordinary and original meaning of the term, and the concept is broader than the Court's current jurisprudence contemplates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This brings me to the case at hand. The Fairfield County police received two anonymous tips that Morgan and Graf grew marijuana and cooked methamphetamine in their house. So five officers went to their home for a \"knock and talk,\" a police tactic where an officer walks up to the front door of a house and seeks to speak with a suspect and/or gain consent for a search. Consistent with county policy, two officers walked up to the front door, and the rest surrounded the perimeter of the house, standing five-to-seven feet from its exterior. One officer went around back and noticed marijuana plants growing on Morgan and Graf's second-story deck. With this information, the officers secured a warrant to search inside the home. Now Morgan and Graf contend that when the officers surrounded the home, they engaged in an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    The City Policy.\n   </em>\n   Let's start with the policy. The question before the court is whether the policy directed officers to violate Morgan and Graf's rights. The answer under both current doctrine and the original meaning is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that an unreasonable Fourth Amendment search occurs when an officer intrudes a constitutionally-protected zone, i.e., the house, to gather evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    569 U.S. at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet the county policy directing officers to secure the perimeter is designed to do one thing: ensure officer safety. As the officers testified, whenever they conduct a knock and talk, there is a risk that the officer knocking on the front door \"could be ambushed by somebody coming out of the back door.\" R. 45-6, Pg. ID 525. Or a dangerous individual\n   might flee the residence. And since the officers suspected that Morgan might have been dangerous, the policy required an officer to stand at every corner of the house. If the policy had required the officers surrounding the house to also investigate while there, the county would be directing the officers to violate the Fourth Amendment. But the county's policy was silent as to any information-gathering mandate for the officers. As such, the policy\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   did not direct the officers to violate the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Similarly, when analyzing the policy under the original meaning, the answer is the same. But the first question is different. Whereas the property-based approach asks whether the officers were in a constitutionally-protected zone, the original meaning asks if those officers were conducting a search. The key inquiry is not whether officers conduct a search while\n   <em>\n    in the\n   </em>\n   protected area, but rather whether they conduct a search\n   <em>\n    of the\n   </em>\n   protected area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part I. While this distinction may lead to different outcomes in other cases, in Morgan and Graf's case it does not. Here the county's policy did not direct officers to engage in a purposeful, investigative act of Morgan and Graf's home. Accordingly, since there was no search directed by the policy, no constitutional violation occurred under the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    The officers.\n   </em>\n   Turning to the officers, I agree with the majority that the constitutional violation was not clearly established. But, if I was writing on a clean slate, I would remand. And the question I would direct the district court to answer is whether the officers engaged in a purposeful, investigative act to find the marijuana plants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As the county's policy did not direct a search in Morgan and Graf's case (and the original meaning approach to the Fourth Amendment would require a remand to determine whether the officers in fact \"searched\"), the court need not go further. If there had been a search, however, then I would continue to adhere to a Fourth Amendment analysis guided by the Amendment's text and its original meaning. To do this analysis, ordinarily the court would need to look at the contours of the constitutionally-protected zones-persons, houses, papers, and effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   U.S. Const. amend. IV ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Maureen E.

Such an analysis would not prove difficult here as the marijuana plants were squarely within a constitutionally-protected zone, i.e., on the back-deck within the house's curtilage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court would also need to decide the appropriate source of law to determine when a person is \"secure in\" one of those constitutionally-protected zones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2241-42 (Thomas, J., dissenting);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2269 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). For instance, similar to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, should courts look to state property law to determine what rights someone has in the constitutionally-protected zone?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Baude &amp; Stern,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1842-43 (suggesting courts look to existing law (usually state) to determine constitutional protections); Richard Re,\n   <em>\n    The Positive Law Floor\n   </em>\n   , 129 Harv. L. Rev. F. 313, 332 (2016) (\"[W]hen lawmakers guard against privacy intrusions by private parties, then similar intrusions by the government would be presumptively unreasonable.\"). And, of course, the court must grapple with the appropriate meaning and function of the term \"unreasonable.\" While strong evidence suggests that \"unreasonable\" should be understood as \"against the common law,\" there is evidence that the original public meaning may have been broader.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Donahue,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1192 (arguing that \"unreasonable\" means \"against the common law\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   David A.
