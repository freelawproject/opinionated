Plaintiffs contend that the Policy violates the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\") because it disproportionately ousts Latinos as compared to non-Latinos. To state an FHA claim under a disparate-impact theory of liability, the plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the challenged practices have a \" 'disproportionately adverse effect on minorities' and are otherwise unjustified by a legitimate rationale.\"\n   <em>\n    Tex.

Additionally, the plaintiff must demonstrate a robust causal connection between the defendant's policy and the disparate impact. The district court determined that Plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie case of disparate impact because they failed to show the required causation between the Policy and the disparate impact, and consequently granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, we now vacate and remand the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Park is owned and operated by several entities: Waples Mobile Home Park Limited Partnership; Waples Project Limited Partnership; and A.J. Dwoskin &amp; Associates, Inc. (collectively, \"Waples\" or \"Defendants\"). Waples leases approximately 150 lots in Fairfax, Virginia, on which tenants park their mobile homes, and Waples serves as landlord for the Park. As part of its leasing and annual lease renewal policies, Waples requires all individuals who live at the Park to present either (1) an original Social Security card, or (2) an original (foreign) Passport, original U.S. Visa, and original Arrival/Departure Form (I-94 or I-94W), which together evince legal status in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the Policy, tenants who have one or more occupants who do not provide the required documentation will not have their leases renewed and are subject to eviction. Waples asserts that the Policy is necessary to confirm lease applicants' identities, to perform credit and criminal background checks, to minimize loss from eviction, to avoid potential criminal liability for harboring illegal aliens, and to underwrite leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Previously, Waples only enforced this Policy against the leaseholder. In mid-2015, however, Waples started requiring this documentation for all occupants over the age of eighteen. When one or more\n   occupants had not complied with the Policy, Waples provided notice that the leaseholder had 21 days from receipt of the notification to cure the violation, or 30 days from receipt to vacate the Park. These notifications were addressed to the entire household, including tenants who had complied with the policy. Waples also converted these leases to month-to-month leases, and charged leaseholders an additional $100 for each month a non-complying tenant had not vacated the lot, which Waples increased on June 1, 2016, to a $300 per month surcharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs are four couples who live or lived in the Park with their children: Jose Dagoberto Reyes and Rosy Giron de Reyes (the \"Reyes family\"); Felix Alexis Bola\u00f1os and Ruth Rivas (the \"Bola\u00f1os family\"); Esteban Ruben Moya Yrapura and Yovana Jaldin Solis (the \"Yrapura family\"); and Herbert David Saravia Cruz and Rosa Elena Amaya (the \"Saravia Cruz family\"). Plaintiffs are all non-citizen Latinos of Salvadorian or Bolivian national origin. The four male plaintiffs each have a Social Security number and have provided documentation to satisfy the Policy, and the ten children living with Plaintiffs are each U.S. citizens, but the four female plaintiffs cannot satisfy the Policy because each female plaintiff is an illegal immigrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the male plaintiffs initially leased a lot in the Park, three of the female plaintiffs were not listed on the lease applications, despite the requirement to list all adult tenants on the application. The male plaintiffs had each renewed their year-long leases without complying with the Policy, though Waples knew at least some of the female plaintiffs were living in the Park. In mid-2015, when Waples began enforcing the Policy's requirement that all adult tenants provide the required documentation, the four female plaintiffs attempted to use alternative methods to comply with the Policy, including providing their U.S. government-issued Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (\"ITINs\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Plaintiffs alleged can be used to run background checks and credit reports. Waples declined to accept any alternative forms of identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2014, Waples notified the Reyes family that Rosy Reyes needed to comply with the Policy, but permitted the Reyes family to renew their one-year lease without complying. In March 2015, at the expiration of the lease, Waples notified the Reyes family that they would be placed on a month-to-month lease and be subject to a $100 per month surcharge for non-compliance with the Policy. In early 2016, Waples sent notifications and placed the Yrapura, Saravia Cruz, and Bola\u00f1os families on month-to-month leases with a $100 per month surcharge for non-compliance with the Policy. Waples later sent all Plaintiffs notification that the monthly surcharge would increase to $300, but agreed not to charge or collect this increase during the pendency of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the time of filing the Complaint, only one Plaintiff couple had vacated the Park under threat of eviction; the other three Plaintiff couples continued to reside at the Park but feared eviction. By the time Plaintiffs filed their cross-motion for summary judgment, three Plaintiff families had been forced to move out of the Park because of threats of eviction and rent increases, and the remaining family was facing eviction but had not yet moved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit on May 23, 2016, by filing a six-count\n   complaint, including a claim under the FHA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is the only claim involved in this appeal. As relevant to the procedural posture of this case, an FHA claim can proceed under either a disparate-treatment or a disparate-impact theory of liability, and a plaintiff is not required to elect which theory the claim relies upon at pre-trial, trial, or appellate stages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Nat'l Archives &amp; Records Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421667\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/609/702/\">\n    609 F.2d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711 n.6 (4th Cir. 1979). Under a disparate-treatment theory of liability, a \"plaintiff must establish that the defendant had a discriminatory intent or motive,\" whereas \"a plaintiff bringing a disparate-impact claim challenges practices that have a disproportionately adverse effect on minorities and are otherwise unjustified by a legitimate rationale.\"\n   <em>\n    Inclusive Communities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/#p2513\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the disparate-impact theory, the plaintiff must also demonstrate a causal connection between the defendant's policy and the statistical disparity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/#p2513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/#p2513\">\n    at 2523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that Waples' Policy violates the FHA because it \"is disproportionately ousting Hispanic or Latino ('Latino') families from their homes and denying them one of the only affordable housing options in Fairfax County, Virginia.\" J.A. 27. To support their argument, Plaintiffs provided statistical evidence of the \"strong link [ ] between the undocumented immigrant population and the Latino population\" to demonstrate that \"a policy that adversely affects the undocumented immigrant population will likewise have a significant disproportionate impact on the Latino population.\" J.A. 39. These statistics included that Latinos constitute 64.6% of the total undocumented immigrant population in Virginia, and that Latinos are ten times more likely than non-Latinos to be adversely affected by the Policy, as undocumented immigrants constitute 36.4% of the Latino population in Virginia compared with only 3.6% of the non-Latino population. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, fees, and other relief deemed appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Waples filed a partial motion to dismiss several counts in the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure 12(b)(6), including the FHA claim. The district court denied the motion to dismiss as it related to the FHA claim. In its memorandum opinion, the district court stated that \"the allegations in their Complaint are sufficient to state a claim under the FHA.\" J.A. 165. It went on to state, however, that \"[a]lthough plaintiffs cannot rely solely on disparate impact to prove causation, they may use evidence of disparate impact to help prove that the Policy discriminates 'because of' race or national origin,\" and may use such evidence \"to show that the apparently neutral Policy is in fact a pretext for intentional racial or national origin discrimination against plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/#p2513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

In so doing, the district court seemed to suggest that Plaintiffs' FHA claim should continue under a disparate-treatment theory, rather than the disparate-impact theory Plaintiffs had argued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421667\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/609/702/\">\n    609 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   711 n.6 (noting that a trial court, in response to a motion to dismiss, may determine that either theory of liability is unsupported by the evidence, effectively allowing the claim to continue only under one theory of liability). In response to the denial of the motion to dismiss the FHA claim, Waples filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties then conducted months of discovery. Eventually, Waples moved for summary judgment on the FHA claim. In its motion, Waples addressed the FHA claim under both a disparate-impact theory of liability and a disparate-treatment\n   theory of liability. In response, Plaintiffs opposed Waples' motion for summary judgment on their FHA claim under the disparate-treatment theory, and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the FHA claim under the disparate-impact theory. To support their cross-motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs submitted evidence that Latinos are nearly twice as likely to be undocumented compared to Asians, and twenty times more likely to be undocumented than other groups. They also submitted evidence that 60% of the tenants at the Park were Latino, and that eleven of the twelve tenants at the Park who were not in compliance with the Policy as of May 2016, or 91.7%, were Latino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 21, 2017, the district court denied as moot the cross-motions for summary judgment as to the FHA claim under the disparate-impact theory, explaining that the \"disparate impact claims [ ] failed to survive the Rule 12(b)(6) stage ....\" J.A. 1099 (describing\n   <em>\n    de Reyes v. Waples Mobile Home Park Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-563,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204509869\">\n    2017 WL 4509869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. Feb. 21, 2017) (Order) ). During the motions hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   As you all know, I disposed of disparate impact at the motion to dismiss stage. ... I held explicitly that disparate impact could not be used to satisfy the causation requirement here, because to do so ... would effectively erase the causation requirement. But I went on to say that disparate impact ... could be used to help show disparate treatment in addition to other proof to meet the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating causation. ... So I would think that the motion for summary judgment on that ground should be denied as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   J.A. 1149-50. On April 18, 2017, the district court granted Waples' motion for summary judgment as to the FHA claim, and its memorandum opinion makes it clear that in doing so, the district court only considered the FHA claim under the disparate-treatment theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    de Reyes v.

Va. 2017) (starting its analysis by stating that \"Defendants have moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' disparate treatment claims under the FHA\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274268\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/251/1006/#p1013\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1013 n.8 (\"Thus, after full briefing and argument at the threshold stage, plaintiffs' housing discrimination claims were permitted to proceed as disparate\n   <em>\n    treatment\n   </em>\n   claims, and plaintiffs were further permitted to use evidence of disparate impact to support an inference of intentional discrimination.\" (emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in granting Waples' motion for summary judgment on the FHA claim. Moreover, Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding that their FHA claim could not continue past the motion to dismiss stage under a disparate-impact theory of liability and thus erred in failing to substantively address this theory in considering the cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs do not argue that the FHA claim should have survived the motion for summary judgment under a disparate-treatment theory of liability and, thus, we decline to address this theory of liability for Plaintiffs' FHA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, the overarching question is whether the district court erred in granting Waples' motion for summary judgment on the FHA claim, which constitutes the legal action that prompted this appeal. But because the district court premised its grant of summary judgment on the fact that it had dismissed Plaintiffs' disparate-impact theory at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage\n   and held that Waples was entitled to summary judgment under the disparate-\n   <em>\n    treatment\n   </em>\n   theory, our inquiry is more complicated. First, we must determine whether the district court erred in functionally dismissing Plaintiffs' disparate-impact theory at the motion to dismiss stage. Then, we must determine whether the district court erred in granting Waples' motion for summary judgment on the FHA claim because it did not consider Plaintiffs' disparate-impact theory of liability at this stage. We now hold that the district court erred on both occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We review a district court's ruling on a motion to dismiss de novo.\n   <em>\n    Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v.

In their Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that this particular policy violates the FHA because it \"is disproportionately ousting Hispanic or Latino ('Latino') families from their homes and denying them one of the only affordable housing options in Fairfax County, Virginia.\" J.A. 27. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs provided statistical evidence that Latinos constitute 64.6% of the total undocumented immigrant population in Virginia, and that Latinos are ten times more likely than non-Latinos to be adversely affected by the Policy, as undocumented immigrants constitute 36.4% of the Latino population compared with only 3.6% of the non-Latino population.

Therefore, accepting these statistics as true, we conclude that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a prima facie case of disparate impact. Plaintiffs satisfied step one of the\n   <em>\n    Inclusive Communities\n   </em>\n   framework by demonstrating that Waples' Policy of evicting occupants that are unable to provide documentation of legal status in the United States caused a disproportionate number of Latinos to face eviction from the Park compared to the number of non-Latinos who faced eviction based on the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Notably, the evidence did not merely allege that Latinos would face eviction in higher numbers than non-Latinos. Instead, Plaintiffs satisfied the robust causality requirement by asserting that the specific Policy requiring all adult Park tenants to provide certain documents proving legal status was likely to cause Latino tenants at the Park to be disproportionately subject to eviction compared to non-Latino tenants at the Park.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, we now hold that Plaintiffs have made a prima facie case that Waples' Policy disparately impacted Latinos in violation of the FHA, satisfying step one of the disparate-impact analysis, and that the district court therefore erred in concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We also take this opportunity to correct the district court's grievous error in concluding that the female Plaintiffs' legal status precluded them from making a prima facie showing of disparate impact, which is a misinterpretation of the robust causality requirement described in\n   <em>\n    Inclusive Communities\n   </em>\n   . In determining that Plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate robust causality, the district court stated that \"it is undisputed that the female plaintiffs are unable to satisfy the Policy-and prove legal presence in the United States-not\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   their race or national origin, but because they are, in fact, unlawfully present in the country.\" J.A. 1080 (emphasis added). The district court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   In the instant case, the disparate impact on plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    as Latinos\n   </em>\n   is incidental to the Policy's effect on all illegal aliens.

Here, for example, even though the district court seemed to admit that Latinos\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   disparately impacted by the Policy, the district court dismissed the disparate-impact claim because the female plaintiffs were impacted by the Policy because they are illegal immigrants, which is\n   distinct from their identity as Latinos (a protected class).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The district court's view threatens to eviscerate disparate-impact claims altogether, as this view could permit any facially neutral rationale to be considered the primary\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   for the disparate impact on the protected class and break the robust link required between the challenged policy and the disparate impact. Thus, the district court's view of causation would seem to require an\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to disparately impact a protected class in order to show robust causality, thereby collapsing the disparate-impact analysis into the disparate-treatment analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inclusive Communities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/#p2513\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing intent-based disparate-treatment cases from effect-based disparate-impact cases).

If we adopted the district court's understanding of robust causality, for example, we would have dismissed the claim in\n   <em>\n    Betsey\n   </em>\n   by reasoning that the fact that the plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    had children\n   </em>\n   is what actually\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   them to receive the termination notice, and that therefore any disparate impact on the plaintiffs as non-white tenants was merely incidental to the policy's effect on all parents.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"587589\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/736/983/#p986\">\n    736 F.2d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the district court would have us conclude that the disparate impact of the termination notices on non-white tenants existed because non-whites chose in greater numbers to have children, and therefore that their disparate-impact claim is foreclosed. Applying this logic to\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , and parroting the district court's language, we would have similarly held that \"it is undisputed that the plaintiffs are unable to obtain housing in the county not\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   their race, but because they are, in fact, poor and unable to afford the available housing,\" and thus that \"it cannot be fairly said that a policy terminating a public housing project and thereby disproportionately making housing unavailable to a class of the black population does so 'because of race.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 163;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"539006\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/682/1055/#p1065\">\n    682 F.2d at 1064-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellees' Br. 19. Waples' also argues that Plaintiffs waived their argument for reversal based on the HUD regulation and guidance by failing to raise these arguments in the district court or in the statement of the issue in their opening brief, and also by failing to develop an argument for deference to HUD.
