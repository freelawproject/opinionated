First, Oregon's program assigns a carbon intensity\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to all transportation fuels produced for in-state consumption. The program then sets a maximum carbon intensity value. Fuels with a carbon intensity level above the maximum allowed carbon intensity value generate deficits and fuels with intensity levels below this value generate credits. Oregon also requires producers with deficits to off-set those deficits by purchasing credits from competing fuel producers that have generated credits under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As American Fuel alleges, the discrimination arises from Oregon's decision to draw the maximum allowed carbon intensity value in such a manner that\n   <em>\n    all in-state\n   </em>\n   fuel producers generate credits and only out-of-state fuel producers generate deficits. As a practical matter, this not only exempts in-state entities from any burden under the law (to remedy deficits by purchasing credits from competitors), but it also affords them an additional subsidy in the form of valuable carbon credits. By contrast, out-of-state regulated entities, including American Fuel, generate deficits and experience the full impact of the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Thus, like the tax and subsidy in\n   <em>\n    West Lynn Creamery\n   </em>\n   , Oregon's program discriminates in its practical effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/#p188\">\n    512 U.S. at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/#p188\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Out-of-state entities bear the full brunt of the law's burden, even though all fuel producers (including in-state entities) contribute to greenhouse gas emissions (and consequently global warming). At the same time, in-state entities not only avoid the burden of the law, they also receive a subsidy from the out-of-state entities in the sale of their valuable credits. Thus, American Fuel plausibly alleges that the Oregon program discriminates in its practical effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   It is also plausible that there are nondiscriminatory means of advancing Oregon's legitimate interest in combating global warming.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703672\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1070/#p1081\">\n    730 F.3d at 1087, 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (identifying legitimate state interests in addressing global warming). To state a plausible claim, it is unnecessary to identify every \"available nondiscriminatory means\" of accomplishing the goal of reducing greenhouse gases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703672\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1070/#p1081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703672\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1070/#p1081\">\n    at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204804\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/131/#p138\">\n    477 U.S. at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204804\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/131/#p138\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, it is easy to suggest one plausible example. Oregon could simply adopt a per unit tax on carbon intensity. Such a tax would discourage use of carbon intense fuels without artificially shielding in-state interests from any responsibility for their contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. The availability of nondiscriminatory means of addressing global warming plausibly establishes that the discriminatory effect of Oregon's law violates the Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   There is no doubt American Fuel alleges a plausible claim. Taken together, the discriminatory practical effect of Oregon's program and the availability of nondiscriminatory alternatives plainly state a claim under the Commerce Clause that ought to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    I agree with the majority that\n    <em>\n     Rocky Mountain Farmers Union v.

Nonetheless, although bound by our circuit precedent, I continue to believe that the incorporation of location and distance data into the calculation of carbon intensity values is facially discriminatory under the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause analysis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rocky Mountain Farmers Union v.
