We find no abuse of discretion in either of the court's decisions and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Steve Vallejo (\"Steve\"), Vallejo's husband, began using the biologic Enbrel\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 2004 to treat psoriasis, a skin condition. At some point between 2004 and 2011, Steve developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He succumbed to MDS in 2011. Vallejo, individually and on behalf of Steve's estate, sued Amgen Inc., Wyeth, and Pfizer (collectively, \"Amgen\"), alleging that Enbrel caused Steve's MDS, resulting in his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Discovery Disputes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2015, the magistrate judge\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ordered phased discovery. The first phase addressed general medical causation to determine whether Enbrel can cause MDS. Vallejo complained that the magistrate judge's order was unclear, and the magistrate judge granted her leave to file a motion for clarification. Upon review, the magistrate judge granted Vallejo's motion and provided further instructions. After three planning conferences, the parties still disagreed on the scope of discovery, and the magistrate judge scheduled a hearing to resolve the issues. Although the magistrate judge ordered a joint filing outlining the disputed discovery issues, the parties could not agree on a single list and instead filed separate documents. The magistrate judge also ordered the parties to file briefs on Amgen's potential burden and the proportionality of the discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the hearing, Vallejo's expert, Dr. Linda Levesque, testified that she needed everything originally on Vallejo's request list, which amounted to \"every document the defendants or any of its predecessors have or can access for any person who ingested Enbrel and reported a symptom or impact on that person's red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, or any precursor cells for these blood cell lines.\" Disc. Order at 3-4. Dr. Levesque told the court that she \"is normally provided with 'every single clinical trial that has been done with a drug, whether it's a drug related to particular disease or disorder or not[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.1 (alteration in original). But Amgen's cross-examination revealed Dr. Levesque had \"never testified before.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, Dr. Levesque would not personally review the discovery; rather, \"[s]he would look at the synthesis of the information prepared by [Vallejo's] reviewing experts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.2. The magistrate judge found Vallejo's expert not credible and her demands unreasonable, concluding that the \"testimony did not assist the court in determining whether [Vallejo's] need for the requested information was proportional to the burden imposed on the defendants in responding to [Vallejo's] discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Amgen objected to many of Vallejo's demands, claiming the request would cost millions. The company was willing to produce the Biologic License Application (BLA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for Enbrel, MedWatch reports,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the original Investigator's Brochure\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the agent. Amgen also was willing to produce information regarding Enbrel and an MDS diagnosis, but it objected to the much broader request for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   information regarding Enbrel, an MDS diagnosis,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   any reported symptom associated with the disorder. Associated symptoms for MDS include generic conditions such as shortness of breath, pallor, and fatigue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Vallejo attempted to rebut Amgen's objection by demonstrating at the hearing \"the ease of researching [the] discovery demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The demonstration backfired. Vallejo had requested 206 search terms of adverse event reports submitted to the FDA based on Enbrel. Vallejo's counsel ran 21 of the 206 terms before the court; the search yielded 4,193 adverse event reports. The magistrate judge noted that \"the courtroom search conducted retrieved\n   <em>\n    only reports provided to the FDA\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    not to other entities\n   </em>\n   , and it included only the entry of a report-\n   <em>\n    not the underlying research and follow up documentation as to each report\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases added). The overbreadth of the discovery requests was obvious. The magistrate judge thus limited discovery to 15 search terms that provided the most specificity to MDS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vallejo also demanded information on other agents that work similarly to Enbrel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amgen objected to the relevance of the request and argued that the information was available in the public domain. The company also represented that it did not maintain a database on the other agents, and the search would impose an enormous burden. The search would entail examining the files of nearly 100,000 employees, as well as the files of its predecessor companies. The court, noting that it could have simply sustained Amgen's objection, nevertheless required Amgen \"to answer or produce discovery regarding studies on the causal relationship, if any, between Enbrel and MDS and produce such studies or reports within [Amgen's] custody or control that are not available in the public domain\" because \"the case [was] languishing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lastly, Amgen provided Vallejo with the name of one individual who has knowledge of Enbrel's safety-Dr. Janet Isles, Amgen's global safety officer in charge of Enbrel. Amgen also agreed to supplement individuals to the list as it became aware of them. Vallejo objected and demanded that Amgen provide\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   the organizational charts of 1) the persons responsible for determining whether Enbrel causes and/or is capable of causing MDS, and those working at their direction; 2) the person in charge of compiling adverse events, and those working at their direction; and 3) the person in charge of maintaining source documents for MDS adverse events.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (citation omitted). The magistrate judge concluded that Vallejo's request was unreasonable, given \"Enbrel's extensive history going back to the early 1990s and the fact that there were at least four companies\n   involved with Enbrel's development and production since that time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. She then permitted Vallejo to depose only Dr. Isles, with the understanding that should Isles be unable to provide Vallejo with necessary information, Amgen would \"need to locate witnesses who can answer [Vallejo's] relevant inquiries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In her discovery order, the magistrate judge noted that Amgen \"ha[s] failed to submit affidavits or sworn information by employees or experts regarding the burden of searching for and providing information or providing any meaningful estimates for the time and cost required by the plaintiff's discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Further, \"the attorneys in this case put the onerous responsibility on the court to balance proportionality while failing to provide substantial and reasonable guidance on this key point: In its current state the court is being forced to 'wade through generalized and conflated arguments of need, burden, and relevance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citation omitted). And, the magistrate judge emphasized that should further discovery disagreements arise, \"the parties must provide ... a more thorough proportionality analysis with each side addressing and shouldering its burden: The party who served the discovery must show why the information is important to the issues and the party opposing ... must quantifiably explain the burden of providing the requested information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly after the discovery order, Vallejo filed a motion seeking clarification from the magistrate judge; she also promptly filed an objection to the discovery order, asking the district court to reverse the magistrate judge's order. Vallejo argued that the magistrate judge's order was contrary to the law because Amgen failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the magistrate judge's discovery determinations. While those motions were pending, Vallejo served Amgen with a notice of deposition of Dr. Isles, prompting Amgen to move for a protective order seeking to limit the scope of the deposition to the magistrate judge's discovery order. The magistrate judge granted Amgen's motion and ordered Vallejo to delay the deposition until the district court ruled on Vallejo's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court overruled Vallejo's discovery objection. It concluded that \"[t]he parties and the [magistrate judge] have a collective responsibility to consider the proportionality of all discovery and consider it in resolving discovery disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    Vallejo v.

Neb. May 20, 2016) (first alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committee's notes to 2015 amendment).

The district court then overruled Vallejo's objections and affirmed the magistrate judge's discovery order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Vallejo deposed Dr. Isles in June 2016. About one hour into the deposition, the parties disputed the scope of Vallejo's questions to Dr. Isles and sought the magistrate judge's intervention. The magistrate judge suspended the deposition and reconvened it two months later in order to provide \"direct judicial supervision.\"\n   <em>\n    Vallejo v.

Neb. May 30, 2017) (\" Sanctions Order\"). Prior to the rescheduled deposition of Dr. Isles, Vallejo complained that Amgen had not complied with the discovery order. The magistrate judge ordered a briefing schedule in anticipation of Vallejo's motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The magistrate judge presided over the reconvened deposition and \"field[ed] ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   numerous objections, arguments, and re-arguments over the court's past and present rulings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203037391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Vallejo's \"counsel argued with the [magistrate judge's] ruling on objections approximately 16 times, and on more than one occasion, counsel asked the witness questions which were explicitly beyond the scope of discovery as ordered by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (citations omitted). At the deposition, Vallejo informed the magistrate judge that she had a general causation expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following day, the magistrate judge denied Vallejo's motion to compel, which requested leave to depose additional Amgen employees and to compel Amgen to produce additional documents.

But, the district court ordered Amgen to file a separate motion for sanctions, to include requests for fees and supporting documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its sanctions motion, Amgen claimed Vallejo \"made repeated attempts to circumvent the court's limitations on the first stage of discovery and abused the judicial process.\" Sanctions Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203037391\">\n    2017 WL 3037391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (citations omitted).

Amgen disputes that it ever claimed Dr. Isles was the sole possessor of knowledge about Enbrel's safety. Indeed, the record does not support Vallejo's claim. At the discovery hearing, Amgen stated that Dr. Isles \"would be the one to ... talk to the causation point.

However, the magistrate judge indicated that Amgen \"may need to locate witnesses who can answer the plaintiff's relevant inquiries\" in the event Dr. Isles cannot. Disc.

In another instance, Vallejo says Amgen misrepresented when it asserted that \"[m]any studies done on Enbrel are not designed to examine safety but instead look at other issues like medication utilization.\" Appellant's Br. at 18 (citation omitted).

Vallejo's counsel filed successive motions to relitigate issues previously denied by the court. Even\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the district court overruled counsel's objection to the magistrate judge's discovery order, Vallejo filed a motion to compel discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Vallejo argues she had cause to file the motion for clarification. Vallejo asserts that the discovery order was unclear on whether Vallejo was limited to a single deposition of Dr. Isles despite her allowance of ten under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30, or whether she was permitted to depose other individuals after seeking leave from the court. Vallejo offers as further justification for her motion the order's \"clear[ ] contemplat[ion] that Dr. I[s]les would identify additional witnesses who would be deposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. As to the motion to compel, Vallejo decries as \"utterly false and offensive\" the magistrate judge's characterization of the motion as an attempt to reconsider already litigated issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. Instead, she avers that \"[a]ll of the discovery sought was carefully crafted to meet previous orders of the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The record belies Vallejo's contentions. The magistrate judge's discovery order clearly permitted Vallejo to depose\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   Dr. Isles as the initial deponent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disc. Order at 12 (\"The plaintiff should instead depose Ms. Isles, and\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   she cannot provide the necessary information, [Amgen] may need to locate witnesses who can answer the plaintiff's relevant inquiries.\" (emphasis added) (citation omitted) ). At the discovery hearing, the magistrate judge explained to Vallejo,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   If you're planning on doing a 30(b)(6) deposition, that's just another opening to do exactly what you've done today, which is bring in all of this stuff.\n   <em>\n    There's no point in going down that path at this point\n   </em>\n   , because you'll ask that witness to come up with everything that you've said you need today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Tr. of Disc. Hr'g at 119 (emphasis added). The magistrate judge did open the prospect of Vallejo deposing additional Amgen witnesses. But, Vallejo would be permitted to do so\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   after first deposing Dr. Isles and if Dr. Isles failed to supply Vallejo with the necessary information. The magistrate judge's order was clear and required no clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Vallejo's motion to compel also sought to relitigate issues previously decided by the district court. Again Vallejo argued the issue of whether the district court permitted deponents other than Dr. Isles. Vallejo sought to compel the\n   <em>\n    supplemental\n   </em>\n   BLA for psoriasis, but the magistrate judge already limited Amgen's production to the\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   BLA. Vallejo also sought production of the \"Canadian Monograph,\" Enbrel's package insert for products sold in Canada. She argues that \"[a]t the time of the motion to compel, [Amgen] had not provided any discovery on this topic\" and that she thus \"was acting within the Court's boundaries of discovery and substantially justified in seeking this information.\" Appellant's Br. at 44-45. But, the magistrate judge made clear that she \"re-craft[ed] [Vallejo's] discovery to match the case, and ... order[ed] [Amgen] to answer or produce discovery ... that [is] not available in the public domain.\" Disc. Order at 10. The Canadian Monograph is readily available in the public domain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Vallejo defied the court's discovery order and sought to relitigate the issue in her motion to compel discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The bulk, if not the entirety, of Vallejo's motion to compel represented relitigation of issues already decided by the court.
