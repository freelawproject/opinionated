A grand jury returned a five-count indictment. Fool Bear proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, Fool Bear's niece testified that she and her brother moved into Fool Bear's home on the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation after their father died when she was seven or eight years old. She lived with Fool Bear on and off until she was sixteen.\n   <strong>\n    Count 1 (Attempted Aggravated Sexual Abuse of a Child):\n   </strong>\n   She testified that one day-\"[a]bout when [she] was ten\"-she stayed home from school because she was sick. Fool Bear was the only other person home. She testified that he asked her to lie down with him in his bedroom. He took off his clothes and asked her to touch his penis and he touched her buttocks and rubbed her vagina. Fool Bear told her not to tell anyone.\n   <strong>\n    Count 2 (Aggravated Sexual Abuse of a Child):\n   </strong>\n   The niece testified that a couple of months later she was again home from school and went into the living room, looking for Fool Bear. She testified that Fool Bear then \"grabbed [her] hand and he led [her] back into his bedroom.\" He started kissing her, \"and then he kind of gently pushed [her] down onto the bed.\" Fool Bear removed both of their pants and underwear and inserted his penis into her vagina. She testified that it hurt and her vagina later bled as a result of this penetration.\n   <strong>\n    Count 5 (Incest in Indian Country):\n   </strong>\n   After that, \"something like this\" type of sexual conduct would happen \"once or twice every month.\"\n   <strong>\n    Count 3 (Aggravated Sexual Abuse of a Child by Force):\n   </strong>\n   She described one last sexual encounter, which occurred in October or November 2015 when she was sixteen. She said that Fool\n   Bear \"had laid [her] on the bed and had started taking advantage of [her].\" Shortly thereafter, she reported the ongoing sexual abuse to her aunt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After trial, the jury convicted Fool Bear on four of the five counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fool Bear appeals, arguing that two of the charged offenses were multiplicitous, that the district court erred in instructing the jury, and that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fool Bear first argues that we must set aside either his conviction on Count 2 (Aggravated Sexual Abuse of a Child) or Count 5 (Incest in Indian Country) because the two counts are multiplicitous.

The government concedes that the evidence at trial did not show \"penetration, however slight, by a penis of the vulva of\" his niece, so the evidentiary support for this count turns on whether Fool Bear's actions on that occasion can be considered an attempt to engage in such conduct.

Based on the charge in this case, therefore, the government was required to show that Fool Bear's conduct during that first encounter was sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was Fool Bear's intent to engage in penetration of his niece's vulva by his penis, and that his conduct constituted a substantial step toward that conduct. Fool Bear argues the\n   government presented no evidence-in his niece's testimony or elsewhere-to demonstrate that, on that day, he intended to engage in penile penetration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government concedes that there was no direct evidence that Fool Bear intended to engage in the conduct the indictment alleges he attempted on that day. Rather, the government asks us to infer that this was Fool Bear's intent based on the fact that \"every single sexual assault after the first one involved penile-vaginal sex.\" While this evidence was admissible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2) ; Fed. R. Evid. 413(a) ; Fed. R. Evid. 414(a), that does not answer whether it was sufficient to support a reasonable inference of Fool Bear's intent, beyond a reasonable doubt. On this first occasion, unlike during the later incidents of abuse, Fool Bear stopped short of penetration, and the government introduced no evidence that this abandonment was triggered by some external event. And unlike in the cases cited by the dissent, there is no evidence that Fool Bear had engaged in penile penetration with his niece or another victim prior to this date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the sole evidence of a \"substantial step\" constitutes a different sex act, i.e., the touching and rubbing of genitalia. This act, standing alone, provides insufficient support for the inference that Fool Bear intended to engage in penile penetration-as he did on subsequent occasions-but failed to follow through.

Ever conscious of our deferential standard of review of a jury verdict, we nevertheless conclude that the evidence here was insufficient to show that force was used in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The requisite force is established 'if the defendant overcomes, restrains, or injures the victim or if the defendant uses a threat of harm sufficient to coerce or compel submission.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11166143\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/954/#p961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There is no evidence that Fool Bear's conduct constituted force sufficient to restrain or injure his niece, so this case turns on whether there was a use of force sufficient to \"overcome\" the victim. The government argues that we should read \"overcome\" to encompass \"conduct meant to get the better of\" the victim. But the word \"overcome,\" as used in this context, is narrower and addresses the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of force necessary to satisfy the statutory requirement that a defendant have accomplished the crime \"by using force against [an]other person.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Because conduct that no one would consider forceful-like emotional manipulation or financial pressure-would seem to satisfy the definition the government urges, it is a poor fit. In addition, we are not inclined to put an additional layer of interpretation on a word that is itself interpretive. Thus, the question before us is whether the evidence in this case showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Fool Bear acted with\n   <em>\n    force\n   </em>\n   sufficient to \"overcome\" his niece, keeping in mind that this level of force is meant to distinguish between the crime of aggravated sexual abuse and the lesser offense of sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The government argues force was evident because the niece used the words \"grab[ ],\" \"pull[ ],\" and \"push[ ]\" when testifying about Fool Bear's treatment of her during this incident.

First we note the niece did not use the word \"push.\" Instead, in response to a compound question based on assumptions not in evidence, she said \"Yeah.\" Similarly, while she did say that Fool Bear \"grabbed [her] shoulders,\" she did so in response to a question from the prosecution asking whether Fool Bear had \"grab[bed] her by the hand.\" The victim's mirroring of the prosecutor's language in responding to a question limits what reasonable inferences a jury might draw from this language. And she used the word \"pull\" to describe how \"he la[id her] down on the bed\" prior to the sex act. In context, the use of these words cannot be reasonably understood to demonstrate the type of force necessary to \"overcome, restrain, or injure\" a person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fire Thunder\n   </em>\n   , 908 F.2d at 274. The victim agreed with the prosecutor that she did not \"want to do this.\" But the lack of consent also is insufficient to meet the government's burden of proving \"the use of force\"-an element of the charged offense-beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The government argues, however, that this failure of proof does not matter because \"the jury was also aware of Fool Bear's very physically abusive conduct towards\" his niece. This conduct, it explains, supports an inference that she might have subjectively understood Fool Bear to be threatening her and, therefore, that she was coerced into submission because she was afraid of him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gabe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11166143\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/954/#p961\">\n    237 F.3d at 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That was the situation in\n   <em>\n    Gabe\n   </em>\n   , where the victim testified \"that she obeyed [Gabe] during these incidents because[, due to his past physical abuse,] she was afraid of him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11166143\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/954/#p961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, on the other hand, the niece did not offer similar testimony. The government nonetheless asks us to draw this inference from the mere fact of past physical abuse. While we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, this inference stretches too far. There was no evidence that Fool Bear's physically assaultive behavior had ever been linked to his sexually assaultive behavior, and there was evidence that, on\n   one occasion when Fool Bear had been physically assaultive, the niece fought back using a razor blade. Any inference that we might draw about her state of mind would be inadequate to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Fool Bear's conduct constituted an implied threat. Thus, we cannot conclude that the government carried its burden to show the use of force as required under Count 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We affirm Fool Bear's convictions on Counts 2 and 5, reverse his convictions on Counts 1 and 3, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   STRAS, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   I disagree with the court on only one issue. I would affirm Fool Bear's conviction of attempted aggravated sexual abuse of a child because I think he had the intent to complete the crime and did just enough to have taken a \"substantial step\" toward its completion. At the very least, the government presented sufficient evidence for the jury to have reasonably concluded that both of these elements were satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, the government proved Fool Bear's intent to penetrate his niece. His niece, who was only ten years old at the time of the incident, testified that Fool Bear told her to \"come l[ie] with [him],\" placed her hand on his erect penis, and then rubbed her vagina underneath her clothes.

For example, in discussing one of the completed penetrations that occurred\n   just \"a few months\" later, the niece testified that she stayed home from school, Fool Bear abused her in his bedroom, the encounter involved contact with her vagina, and it ended with a warning that she was not to \"tell anyone or else [they would] both get in trouble.\" The first encounter shared these same characteristics. The jury could have reasonably inferred, based on a continuous course of sexual abuse that began shortly thereafter, lasted several years, and involved a recurring pattern of behavior, that Fool Bear intended to penetrate his niece the first time he touched her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Second, Fool Bear's conduct, which included placing his niece's hand on his erect penis and touching her vagina under her clothes, was a \"substantial step\" toward completion of a crime requiring penetration.

Under\n   <em>\n    Mazzella\n   </em>\n   , he did enough, as it was not necessary for him to have actually penetrated her, or even been on the verge of penetrating her, for his conduct to have crossed the line into an attempt. Only a substantial step, not a completed or nearly completed offense, is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The court nevertheless concludes that \"the touching and rubbing of genitalia\" during the first encounter was not a substantial step toward penetration because it \"constitute[d] a different sex act.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 709. But just because an act completes one crime does not mean that it cannot also qualify as a substantial step toward the commission of another, different crime. A would-be killer who breaks into the intended victim's home has not only committed a burglary, he has also completed a substantial step toward committing a murder.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.01(2)(d) (explaining that \"unlawful entry of a structure ... in which it is contemplated that the crime will be committed\" is a substantial step).

Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the jury to have found that Fool Bear intended to penetrate her from the very beginning and that his actions during their first encounter were a substantial step toward that end.
