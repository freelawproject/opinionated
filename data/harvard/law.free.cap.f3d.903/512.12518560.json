STEWART, Chief Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jesus Islas-Saucedo appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for illegal reentry after having been deported. In this appeal, he contends that the district court improperly enhanced his base offense level by 12 levels under U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2015) and that this erroneously increased his U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range. His argument is predicated on his contention that his 1990 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) is not a crime of violence. More specifically, relying on\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

We reject that suggestion and VACATE and REMAND for re-sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 28, 2015, Islas-Saucedo was charged by a one-count indictment with being unlawfully present in the United States after deportation subsequent to a felony conviction, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(1). On January 26, 2016, without a plea agreement, Islas-Saucedo entered a plea of guilty to the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Using the 2015 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, the pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSR\") calculated the total offense level to be 17, by: (1) starting with a base offense level of eight, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(a); (2) adding 12 levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), on the ground that Islas-Saucedo's 1990 Texas felony conviction for burglary of a habitation was a \"crime of violence\" that was not assessed any criminal history points; and (3) subtracting three levels pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b) for timely acceptance of responsibility. A total offense level of 17, coupled with Islas-Saucedo's criminal history category of IV, resulted in a Guideline imprisonment range of 37 to 46 months. Islas-Saucedo did not object to the PSR's Guideline calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 2, 2016, the district court sentenced Islas-Saucedo to serve 42 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and a three-year term of supervised release. Islas-Saucedo timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 27, 2016, Islas-Saucedo, representing himself pro se, filed his opening brief. For the first time on appeal, Islas-Saucedo argues that the district court erroneously applied the 12-level crime of violence enhancement because (1) not all of the subsections of the Texas burglary statute, TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 30.02(a)(1)-(3), meet the definition of generic burglary, and (2) the modified categorical approach may not be used to narrow his offense because, under\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Texas statute is indivisible. He argues that\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   effectively overruled this court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Conde-Castaneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5919774\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/172/#p175\">\n    753 F.3d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175-77 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that a Texas burglary conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes generic burglary and, accordingly, is a crime of violence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 4, 2017, the Government filed a motion for summary affirmance on the ground that this court has already rejected Islas-Saucedo's arguments in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Uribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173467\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/667/#p671\">\n    838 F.3d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 671 (5th Cir. 2016) (holding Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a) is divisible). This court denied the motion on September 26, 2017. However, on October 5, 2017, this court granted the Government's motion to stay further proceedings pending a ruling on the petition for rehearing en banc in\n   <em>\n    Herrold\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court issued its\n   <em>\n    Herrold\n   </em>\n   opinion on February 20, 2018. The Government concedes that under\n   <em>\n    Herrold\n   </em>\n   , the district court's application of the crime of violence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) would be erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herrold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516082\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/517/#p517\">\n    883 F.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a) is overbroad and indivisible). Nevertheless, the Government requests that this court hold the case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court's determination on the petitions for a writ of certiorari filed in\n   <em>\n    Herrold\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition for Writ of Certiorari,\n   <em>\n    Herrold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516082\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/517/#p517\">\n    883 F.3d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (No. 17-1445);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Petition for Writ of Certiorari,\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277648\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/836/\">\n    850 F.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (No. 17-778). To preserve its position, the Government challenges our holding in\n   <em>\n    Herrold\n   </em>\n   by arguing that Islas-Saucedo was properly subject to the ACCA enhancement under the Texas burglary statute. The Government maintains that (1) under the categorical approach, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a) is a crime of violence because all of its subsections match a generic burglary offense, and (2) alternatively, the Texas burglary statute is divisible and, under the modified categorical approach, Islas-Saucedo's prior conviction is a crime of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
