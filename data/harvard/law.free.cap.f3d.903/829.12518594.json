In recent years, the Nevada legislature became concerned that its vicarious liability law was unfairly burdening general contractors with substantial liabilities. The legislature found that certain entities, in particular trusts that manage health and welfare benefit plans and which represent aggrieved employees in labor debt recovery actions, were suing general contractors years after labor debts accrued. Since a 2009 decision of our court, those suits could seek money damages not just for uncollected debts, but also for the trusts' legal fees and other costs incurred attempting to collect on those debts from subcontractors. The upshot was that unsuspecting general contractors were discovering years later that they owed the subcontractors' debts-and then some.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In an effort to remedy this perceived problem, in 2015 the Nevada legislature unanimously approved SB 223. The law limits the damages that may be collected from general contractors. It also imposes notification requirements on contractors and welfare benefit plans regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., before an action may be brought under Nevada law against general contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs-Appellees are ERISA trusts that manage ERISA plans. They claim SB 223 is preempted by ERISA because, they argue, it impermissibly \"relates to\" ERISA plans. They reason that the law intrudes on ERISA's uniform regulatory scheme by imposing additional administrative burdens on ERISA trusts like themselves, and by infringing ERISA trusts' fiduciary duty to manage plan funds. The district court agreed and granted Appellees' motion for summary judgment. We conclude, however, that SB 223 does not intrude on any federally-regulated field, conflict with ERISA's objectives, or otherwise impermissibly \"relate to\" ERISA plans. Instead, it targets an area of traditional state concern-debt collection-and pared back a state-conferred entitlement to collect unpaid debts from third-party general contractors. Accordingly, we hold that SB 223 is a legitimate exercise of Nevada's traditional state authority and\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nevada law provides that employees on construction projects who cannot collect on labor debts from their employers (i.e., subcontractors\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) may compel payment from general contractors.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20608.150\">\n    Nev.

Multiemployer plans are typically administered and managed by a board of trustees, represented equally by labor and management.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Through their administration of multiemployer plans, Appellees provide welfare and pension benefits to employees that perform work in the construction industry. Those benefits, as well as employers' (i.e., subcontractors') contribution obligations to the plans, are negotiated by employees-oftentimes through a union representative-and employers, and are set forth in the plans themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As is pertinent here, ERISA empowers ERISA trusts to bring actions against subcontractors for subcontractors' labor debts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2), 1145.

General contractors found themselves threatened with lawsuits by, among other entities, ERISA trusts, who sought to hold them vicariously liable for debts owed their members by subcontractors, sometimes several years later. Those debts consisted of delinquent wage and benefit contributions, as well as attorneys' fees and other costs resulting from protracted legal action between ERISA trusts and subcontractors. A 2009 per curiam opinion of this court contributed to this trend by interpreting \"labor indebtedness\" under Nevada's vicarious liability statute to include \"liquidated damages and attorneys' fees arising from a collective bargaining agreement [CBA].\"\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049000\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/578/1126/#p1127\">\n    578 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, after\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Insurance\n   </em>\n   , ERISA trusts like Appellees could litigate against potentially insolvent subcontractors for years, knowing that, should the litigation fail to make them whole, they could recover their legal expenses from general contractors later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2015, the Nevada legislature unanimously approved SB 223 to address the situation. The law had two main goals. First, it sought to reduce the liability faced by unsuspecting general contractors years after they had closed the books on a project. It did so by shortening the statute of limitations period to one year (SB 223 \u00a7 2) and limiting general contractors' vicarious liability to debts owed employees under a CBA (SB 223 \u00a7\u00a7 1(2) &amp; 3(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the law sought to increase general contractors' ability to address subcontractor debts early on. The law imposed a set of mutually reinforcing obligations on ERISA trusts on the one hand, and subcontractors on the other. Under the revised statutory scheme, ERISA trusts were required to issue pre-lien notices to\n   general contractors, thereby alerting general contractors to potential claims in the case of subcontractor delinquency (SB 223 \u00a7 4(8) ). They were also required to notify general contractors within sixty days after a debt became delinquent (SB 223 \u00a7 5). Thus, \u00a7\u00a7 4(8) and 5, read together, gave general contractors early notice of potential claims and a first opportunity to remedy an outstanding debt with a subcontractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In return, upon commencement of a project, a contractor (general or sub) that was party to an ERISA plan was required to notify the ERISA trust of the project (SB 223 \u00a7 4(7) ). This provision thereby afforded trusts an opportunity to monitor subcontractor performance and identify delinquencies early on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Some of SB 223's six provisions specifically referenced ERISA plans. They did so by variously referring to \"health or welfare funds\" (\u00a7\u00a7 1(2), 4(7) ), \"trust funds\" that collect and manage benefits and other forms of compensation for workers (\u00a7 4(8) ), and Taft-Hartley trusts (\u00a7 5(1) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   SB 223's six modifications to Nevada's vicarious liability law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20608.150\">\n    Nev.

In response to the district court's invalidation of SB 223, in July 2017 the Nevada legislature repealed SB 223 and replaced it with a new law, SB 338. SB 338 does not include the challenged notice and damages amendments (\u00a7\u00a7 1(2), 3(2), 4(7), 4(8), 5(1) ) from SB 223, and the repeal of those provisions was made retroactive to the enactment of SB 223. SB 338 also includes a truncated statute of limitations provision, which is not retroactive. The new limitations period is two years-up from SB 223's one year-which is still short of the pre-SB 223 period of up to four years. Because SB 338's limitations period was not made retroactive, Nevada argues that leaving the district court's determination undisturbed is causing actual and imminent harm: the four-year pre-223 limitations period is in place, rather than SB 223's one-year period, for the years 2015 to 2017. With the exception of the limitations provision, which only the State argues presents a live controversy, the parties agree the appeal is moot. Notwithstanding the parties' partial agreement on mootness, however, we must independently assess whether a live controversy exists on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Shell Offshore Inc. v.

Legislative Counsel's Digest, SB 338, 2017 Leg., 2017 Reg. Sess. (Nev. 2017). The preamble further asserts that the law resolves the problems identified by the district court.

Instead, SB 223 avoids ERISA's regulatory domain entirely, and instead pared back a state entitlement holding third party general contractors liable for plan members' debts.

In response, the Nevada legislature repealed SB 223 pending this appeal and replaced it with a new law. Because the legislature repealed SB 223 in response to an adverse judicial ruling, we deem the appeal moot only if Nevada demonstrates that it will not reenact the challenged law in whole or in part. Nevada fails to do so. Indeed, the law that replaced SB 223 incorporates several of the challenged components of the old law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   On the merits, SB 223 limits a state entitlement to hold third-party general contractors vicariously liable for the debts of ERISA plan members. Because SB 223 targets an area of traditional state regulation, the presumption against preemption applies. SB 223 is therefore only preempted if it invades the federal field regulated by ERISA or poses an obstacle to its objectives. SB 223 does neither of these things. Indeed, Appellees' obligations under ERISA remain exactly the same with or without SB 223. Thus, SB 223 has neither an impermissible \"connection with\" nor does it make an impermissible \"refer[ence] to\" ERISA plans.\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 943.

In the majority's view, the voluntariness of the statutory change provides a key basis upon which to separate cases rendered moot by statutory change from those that are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   I disagree that this is a meaningful doctrinal distinction upon which our cases can be categorized. First, binding precedent from both the Supreme Court and our circuit holds that statutory change is enough to render a case moot even when such change follows an adverse judicial ruling. In\n   <em>\n    Kremens\n   </em>\n   , discussed above, the Court held that a constitutional challenge to provisions of a Pennsylvania statute was moot where, after an adverse judicial ruling below, the legislature repealed and replaced the provisions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1824\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/119/\">\n    431 U.S. at 127-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1824\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/119/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Log Cabin Republicans\n   </em>\n   , our court held that a constitutional challenge to Congress's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy was moot where Congress repealed the statute after the district court ruled the policy was unconstitutional.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836149\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1162/#p1166\">\n    658 F.3d at 1165-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In these and other cases,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Maldonado v.

City of Surprise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"932093\" index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/1176/#p1181\">\n    434 F.3d 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2006) (cities' enactment of new ordinances after plaintiff filed action arguing that previous ordinances were preempted by federal law sufficient to render plaintiff's claims moot).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Second, and more fundamentally, it is not conceptually tenable to draw a line\n   between statutory change \"prompted by\" an adverse judicial ruling, Maj. Opn. at 840-41, and statutory change that merely follows an adverse judicial ruling. Outside of relatively clear situations-e.g., where a constitutionally suspect statute expires during pendency of appeal due to a sunset provision-there is not a reliable way of establishing that statutory change that occurs after an adverse judicial ruling is not, in fact, a response to that ruling. The most reasonable presumption is that when a legislature changes a law after a federal court invalidates that law, the change was prompted by the federal court ruling. Therefore, the majority is incorrect to suggest we can generally divide cases mooted by statutory change from those that are not based on the presence or absence of a causal link between the statutory change and an adverse judicial ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   I agree with my colleagues on one point-our mootness-due-to-statutory-change cases are indeed \"murky.\" Maj. Opn. at 843-44. But even if the doctrine contains a certain opacity, it is clear enough on the principle relevant here: a statutory change is \"usually enough to render a case moot\" unless \"it is virtually certain that the repealed law will be reenacted.\"\n   <em>\n    Log Cabin Republicans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836149\" index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1162/#p1166\">\n    658 F.3d at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Helliker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723285\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/871/\">\n    463 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   878 ). That principle is consistent with, rather than a departure from,\n   <em>\n    City of Mesquite\n   </em>\n   , and binding on our panel. We should abide by it here and conclude that this case is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   As a final observation, I point out that even though our\n   <em>\n    Noatak\n   </em>\n   line of decisions has not thoroughly explained the rationale behind the rule that statutory change is usually enough to render a case moot, there are good reasons for such a rule. One is that the formal, deliberative nature of the legislative process makes statutory change relatively difficult to undo on a whim. Having run the gauntlet of formal procedure, political debate, and legislative trade-offs involved in repealing and replacing a constitutionally suspect law, it seems unlikely that a legislature, as a general rule, would be inclined to reenact a repealed law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Neal Kumar Katyal &amp; Thomas P. Schmidt,\n   <em>\n    Active Avoidance: The Modern Supreme Court and Legal Change\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%202109\">\n    128 Harv.

Instead, the more logical presumption is that once Congress or a state legislature repeals or amends an objectionable statute, that change is likely to remain absent a strong indication the legislature intends to undertake the laborious process of reenacting the repealed law. In my view, our rule that statutory change is usually enough to render a case moot correctly reflects the realities of legislative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I conclude the Nevada Legislature's repeal of SB 223, and its enactment of SB 338, renders this case moot.

In\n    <em>\n     Northeastern Florida\n    </em>\n    , the city moved to dismiss the case as moot after repealing an ordinance the district court had declared unconstitutional, and replacing it with a substantially similar ordinance.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/\">\n     at 660-62\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/\">\n     113 S.Ct. 2297\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In holding that the case was not rendered moot by the change, the Court explained \"[t]here is no mere risk that [the City] will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct; it has already done so.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/\">\n     508 U.S. at 662\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/\">\n     113 S.Ct. 2297\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, rather than demonstrate that my reading of\n    <em>\n     City of Mesquite\n    </em>\n    is incorrect,\n    <em>\n     Northeastern Florida\n    </em>\n    simply reinforces those instances in which statutory change will not render a case moot-that is, where a city (or legislature) repeals an invalidated law but has demonstrated a likelihood of reenacting the same law, or of reengaging in unlawful conduct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
