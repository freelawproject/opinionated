At a minimum, it requires adequate information and correct application of the relevant standard. Because we conclude that the preliminary injunction in this case was entered based on less than adequate information and an insufficient regard for the relevant standard, we vacate the preliminary injunction and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The roots of this case can be traced to 2007. That year, the Missouri legislature amended the statutory definition of \"ambulatory surgery center\" (\"ASC\") to include most facilities that performed abortions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A number of consequences followed, two of which are at issue here. The first flows from statutory language. By law, all doctors who perform abortions at ASCs must be \"privileged to perform surgical procedures in at least one licensed hospital in the community.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"530387\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/10/87/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 197.215.1(2). The implementing regulations have further refined the \"in the community\" requirement to mean a licensed hospital that is 15 minutes away.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Code%20Regs.%20Ann.%20tit.%2019%2C%20%C2%A7%2030-30.060\">\n    Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 19, \u00a7 30-30.060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(C)(4). We refer to this as the \"Hospital Relationship Requirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second consequence at issue flows from enacting regulations. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (\"DHSS\") has delegated authority to enact health and safety regulations for abortion facilities.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20197.225.1\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 197.225.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pursuant to that authority, the DHSS has adopted a number of physical design and layout requirements specifically for facilities that perform surgical abortions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Code%20Regs.%20Ann.%20tit.%2019%2C%20%C2%A7%2030-30.070\">\n    Mo.

Instead, they are waivable upon written request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Code%20Regs.%20Ann.%20tit.%2019%2C%20%C2%A7%2030-30.070\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-30.070(2) (\"Requests for deviations from requirements on physical facilities shall be in writing to the [DHSS].\"). We refer to this specific provision as the \"Waiver Provision.\" The record contains one instance in normal course where a minor request was made-and granted-for waiver from a single design requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This is not the first time these laws have been challenged. Prior to the current suit, Appellee Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains (\"Comprehensive Health\") brought facial and as-applied challenges to the statutory classification of abortion facilities as ASCs almost immediately after the provision went into effect in 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Comprehensive Health succeeded in its as-applied challenge only. The district court enjoined the ASC statutory classification (and attendant requirements) for two facilities Comprehensive Health operated: one in Kansas City and one in Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Comprehensive Health and the State of Missouri settled the lawsuit in 2010 (\"2010 Settlement\"). The parties agreed to modifications of the requirements of the Physical Plant Regulations for the Columbia facility and a complete waiver of the requirements for the Kansas City facility. And Comprehensive Health agreed to release any claims \"whether or not now known or contemplated\" that are \"based on or arising out of the allegations in Lawsuits relating to licensure of the Columbia and [Kansas City] Centers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The 2010 Settlement was not the last word, however. After the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    as revised\n   </em>\n   (June 27, 2016), Comprehensive Health sent a letter to DHSS calling both the Hospital Relationship Requirement and the classification of abortion facilities as ASCs \"unconstitutional and unenforceable.\" It demanded that DHSS stop enforcing the provisions against Comprehensive Health facilities. This suit began shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Unlike its initial suit, Comprehensive Health is joined here by Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region (\"RHS\"), and Dr. Ronald Yeomans-a gynecologist who wishes to provide abortions at Comprehensive Health facilities in Missouri. Together, Comprehensive Health and RHS represent every facility that provides or is seeking to provide abortions in Missouri: Comprehensive Health operates facilities in Kansas City and Columbia, and RHS operates a facility in St. Louis and has plans to operate in Springfield and Joplin. The complaint here sought declaratory and injunctive relief to roll back the 2007 amendment which classified (most) abortion facilities as ASCs. It also sought specific relief from the Hospital Relationship Requirement. Both the ASC classification and the Hospital Relationship Requirement were challenged on substantive due process and equal protection grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After evidentiary submissions and a brief hearing, the district court issued a slightly narrower preliminary injunction. It preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the Hospital Relationship Requirement-as well as certain associated criminal penalties for doctors who violate it-and the Physical Plant Regulations solely on substantive due process grounds. In doing so, it found that\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   \"controls [its] ruling.\" Because of that, it refused to weigh any evidence of benefits of the provisions, likening Missouri's advocacy on this front to an \"attempt[ ] to undermine\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Drawing on administrative law jurisprudence, they argue\n   \"[w]here a regulatory regime provides for variances, a constitutional challenge to those restrictions is not ripe until the challenger has sought-and been denied-a variance.\" So because none of the facilities run by Appellees had utilized the Waiver Provision, the district court's injunction of the Physical Plant Regulations was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The main case they cite in support of this argument-\n   <em>\n    Suitum v.

There, it was noted that \"facial challenges to regulation\"-the only challenges at issue here-\"are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652874\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/725/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 736 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652874\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/725/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Missouri has not demonstrated why that general principle should not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In fact, it would make little sense to find an exception here.

Stated differently, \"[t]his suit is possible only because the [Supreme] Court has allowed abortion clinics and physicians to invoke a putative constitutional right that does not belong to them-a woman's right to abortion.\"\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2321-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Thomas, J., dissenting). To hold that Appellees must \"ripen\" a facial constitutional claim, which they do not possess, would be incongruous with the fact that the holder of such a right could bring the same facial challenge without any avenue to \"ripen\" it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176317\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/106/#p117\">\n    428 U.S. at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176317\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/106/#p117\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing providers \"assert the rights of women patients\"). We reject Missouri's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This is not to say, however, that a facial challenge to the Physical Plant Regulations on substantive due process grounds is justiciable at the present moment. To be clear, while we have said that individual organizations or facilities need not apply for waivers to \"ripen\" a facial claim, that does not mean we can decide a facial challenge to the Physical Plant Regulations without information about the Waiver Provision. Here, there is scant evidence as to how the Waiver Provision actually operates. As noted above, the record contains only one instance of a request for a minor waiver in normal course. In that case, it was granted with a single page letter from DHSS. In cases like this, the \"[r]ules of justiciability\" counsel against a decision \"based upon [an] amorphous and ill-defined factual record.\"\n   <em>\n    Renne v.

Because the record is practically devoid of any information on the mechanics of the Waiver Provision, a court has no way to make that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district court nevertheless made such a judgment, and we conclude that in doing so it committed an error of law. \"It would take a very hardy [DHSS] Director,\" according to the district court, \"to agree voluntarily to establishment of abortion clinics ... out of compliance with ASC standards.\" And so it enjoined the regulations on the presumption that a DHSS Director would act less than scrupulously on any waiver application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our starting point, though, is the polar opposite: \" '[t]he good faith of [state] officers and the validity of their actions are presumed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

Again, we emphasize this is distinct from the position Missouri has advocated. We are not holding that a facial claim must be \"ripened.\" We simply hold that we lack sufficient information to make a constitutional determination on the Physical Plant Regulations.

And currently it appears that only one prospective location (Springfield) is seeking to provide surgical abortions, meaning that the Physical Plant Regulations is pertinent only to that facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 6. If that one facility applied for a waiver, we would have some semblance of a record as to how the DHSS exercises the Waiver Provision. In other words, we would not have to \"wade through a quagmire of what-ifs\"-if litigation is pursued-to assess the facial validity of the Physical Plant Regulations.\n   <em>\n    Mo. ex rel. Mo.

Or a waiver application by the Springfield facility may mean that litigation is not pursued at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On remand, the district court should not consider a facial challenge on substantive due process grounds to the Physical Plant Regulations. That does not end the matter, though. The Appellees asked for broader injunctive relief from the statutory ASC classification,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20197.200\">\n    Mo.

Broader relief is likely foreclosed because Appellees trained the complaint (and injunction arguments) solely on the Physical Plant Regulations. But, given the \"narrow\" nature of our review at this stage, we leave it to the district court to decide this question in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    Taylor Corp. v.

Unlike the Physical Plant Regulations, the Hospital Relationship Requirement operates by statute, is unwaivable, and is enforced by criminal penalty. The district court erred in enjoining it (and related criminal provisions) because the district court did not apply the plain language of\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As noted in our prior discussion,\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   's rendition of the undue burden standard is fairly straightforward: it \"requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   did not find, as a matter of law, that abortion was inherently safe or that provisions similar to the laws it considered would never be constitutional. Instead, it held that the \"District Court applied the correct legal standard\" when it \"weighed the asserted benefits against the burdens.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court here explicitly refused to \"weigh[ ] the asserted benefits\" stating that to do so \"would be impermissible judicial practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   the district court erred in so ruling.
