The District Court concluded that the plaintiffs did not allege a concrete injury in fact and therefore dismissed their complaint for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complaint alleges the following facts. The three named plaintiffs were convicted of drug offenses in the relatively distant past: Michael White in 2006 and 2007, Joseph Shipley in 2001, and Frank Long in 1997. More recently, Plaintiffs applied to Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) for jobs that\n   involved operating vehicles. Each Plaintiff filled out a form disclosing his criminal history and authorizing SEPTA to obtain a background check. Initially, Plaintiffs' job applications seemed to meet with success: each received an offer or was given information about when to start training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ultimately, though, SEPTA denied employment to Plaintiffs. SEPTA told Long he was not hired because of \"the information SEPTA had received from [the] background check.\" App. 28 (Complaint \u00b6 47). SEPTA told White and Shipley they were not hired because of their \"criminal history.\" App. 29, 31 (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 57, 69). When Shipley requested more information, SEPTA sent a letter saying that for positions that \"require the operation of ... vehicles,\" SEPTA has a \"categorical lifetime ban\" on hiring anyone convicted of a crime \"involving the possession, sale, distribution, manufacture and use of controlled substances.\" App. 29-30 (Complaint \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   SEPTA did not send Plaintiffs copies of their background checks before it decided not to hire them. Nor did it send them notices of their rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The FCRA, however, required SEPTA to send both before it denied them employment. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(b)(3). Plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint based on these two FCRA violations, as well as other claims not at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   SEPTA moved to dismiss the complaint. The District Court granted the motion and dismissed for lack of standing. It concluded there was only a \"bare procedural violation,\" not a concrete injury in fact, because Plaintiffs alleged that SEPTA denied them jobs \"based on their criminal history, which Plaintiffs disclosed prior to SEPTA procuring their background checks.\"\n   <em>\n    Long v.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that SEPTA violated the FCRA by taking adverse employment action without providing copies of their background checks or notices of their rights under the FCRA. SEPTA argues that Plaintiffs lack standing because they were not harmed by what the District Court ruled were \"bare procedural violations\" of the statute. To determine whether the violations were \"bare\" and \"procedural,\" or whether they were concrete injuries in fact, we will first examine the statute to ascertain what rights it confers. Next, we will examine the factual allegations in the complaint. Finally, with the FCRA and the facts in hand, we will analyze whether Plaintiffs have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A. The Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The FCRA provides that \"before\" a potential employer, like SEPTA, takes \"any adverse action based in whole or in part\" on a consumer report, it \"shall provide\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   the person who is the subject of the report with \"(i) a copy of the report; and (ii) a description in writing of the rights of the consumer under [the FCRA].\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(b)(3)(A). An adverse action includes \"a denial of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873843\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/235/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681a(k)(1)(B). Criminal background checks are \"consumer reports,\" i.e., \"written ... communication\" that bears on \"a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living\" and \"is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for ... employment purposes ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873843\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/235/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681a(d)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the statute prohibits adverse employment actions based on consumer reports that an individual has not had the opportunity to review or discuss with the potential employer. SEPTA, on the other hand, argues that the statute protects only against adverse employment action that is based on inaccurate or misleading information. SEPTA's position is that Plaintiffs' consumer reports were accurate and therefore they suffered no injury in fact. SEPTA is incorrect, however. As we now explain, the statute confers a broader right than simply to be free from adverse action based on inaccurate information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the Supreme Court's directives, we \"look to the text of the statute, rather than the legislative history, to interpret a statute or determine legislative intent as an aid to interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Thorpe v.

The required pre-adverse-action notice of FCRA rights provides the individual with information about what the law requires with regard to consumer reports. The advance notice requirement, then, supports both accuracy and fairness. It helps ensure that reports are properly used and relevant for the purposes for which they are used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   SEPTA argues that \u00a7 1681b(b)(3) protects only against adverse action based on inaccurate information, but the subsection is not so narrow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b. The right to pre-adverse-action disclosures serves all of the purposes discussed above: accuracy, relevancy, proper utilization, and fairness. The individual's right to dispute and correct consumer reports is provided elsewhere,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i, so according to the statute's structure, \u00a7 1681b is not limited to situations where the report is inaccurate. In addition, it would not make sense for \u00a7 1681b(b)(3) to apply only to inaccurate information, because the consumer cannot know whether his report is accurate unless it is disclosed to him. Finally, if Congress meant to provide protections only against the use of inaccurate consumer reports, it could have written the statute to say so. The meaning of \u00a7 1681b(b)(3) is plain: before an employer takes adverse action based in any part on a consumer report, the consumer has a right to receive a description of his rights under the FCRA, as well as a copy of his report, regardless of its accuracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   SEPTA also argues that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1681b(b)(3) to protect against non-disclosure where the adverse action would have been taken regardless of any opportunity to comment. SEPTA asserts that Plaintiffs' criminal histories categorically disqualified them for the driver positions they sought, so the opportunity to respond would have made no difference. However, the FCRA does not condition the right to receive a consumer report on whether having the report would allow an individual to stave off an adverse employment action. Rather, the statute applies to all consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, \u00a7 1681b(b)(3) confers on the individual a right to receive, before adverse action is taken, a copy of his or her consumer report (regardless of its accuracy) and a notice of his or her rights. This right permits individuals to know beforehand when their consumer reports might be used against them, and creates the possibility for the consumer to respond to inaccurate or negative information-either in the current job application process, or going forward in other job applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.

These latter three types of privacy torts represent interference with an individual's ability to control his personal information. That is analogous to the injury here, which is the use of Plaintiffs' personal information-their consumer reports-without Plaintiffs being able to see or respond to it. Therefore, the second\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   test, the historical test, is also met. Because the statute meets both tests, and because Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient concrete harm, they have standing to bring their claim that SEPTA did not provide them with the required copies of their consumer reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   SEPTA points to hypotheticals in\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   to argue that Plaintiffs' injury is bare and procedural, and thus not a concrete injury-in-fact. In\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , the Court said that certain FCRA violations would \"result in no harm,\" such as where a consumer report contains an immaterial inaccuracy like an incorrect zip code, or where the report is \"entirely accurate\" but its use is not disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1550. SEPTA contends that-as in the second hypo-Plaintiffs' consumer reports were accurate, even if they did not receive the required notice. SEPTA's argument, however, depends on its view that the sole purpose of the \u00a7 1681b(b)(3) disclosures is to allow the correction of inaccuracies. As we have explained,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A, the right to the disclosures is the same whether the report is accurate or not.\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   naturally focused on accuracy; the plaintiff there had alleged that his consumer report was inaccurate\n   and therefore violated a different provision of the FCRA, \u00a7 1681e(b).\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   's focus on accuracy in connection with an alleged \u00a7 1681e(b) violation does not negate the language and purpose of \u00a7 1681b(b)(3), which is at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We turn next to SEPTA's alleged failure to notify Plaintiffs of their FCRA rights. Plaintiffs argue that this was a concrete harm because it \"increased the risk that ... individuals would not know of their FCRA rights and have their claims lapse before they could bring suit.\" Appellants' Br. 29. Under the principles outlined above, this is a \"bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm,\" that cannot \"satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1545\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
