While Plaintiff was incarcerated in an Illinois jail awaiting extradition to Coffey County, the administrator of the Coffey County Jail, Defendant Shannon Moore, requested that the Illinois jail arrange for multiple medical examinations of Plaintiff, including a chest x-ray and a CT scan of his brain, to determine whether he had suffered serious injuries after being tasered by United States marshals. When Moore inquired about the results of the tests, she was told that they showed bone lesions and possible cancer. Upon receiving this information, Moore and Defendant Randy Rogers, the Coffey County Sheriff, conveyed it to the Coffey County Hospital and to Plaintiff's family and friends, without first obtaining permission from Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon learning of these disclosures, Plaintiff sued Moore and Rogers in state court on various grounds under state and federal law, including alleged violations of his constitutional rights. Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The district court granted Defendants judgment on the pleadings on Plaintiff's federal-law claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the state-law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff appeals only the dismissal of his claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of his constitutional right to privacy. He does not challenge Defendants' acquisition of his medical information.

To put this claim in context, it is worth repeating a statement of Professor Kurland quoted by the Supreme Court some 40 years ago in an opinion that appeared to recognize the sort of privacy interest claimed in this case. The statement distinguishes three facets of a right to privacy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The concept of a constitutional right of privacy still remains largely undefined. There are at least three facets that have been partially revealed, but their form and shape remain to be fully ascertained.

In\n   <em>\n    A.L.A. v.

And we described\n   <em>\n    A.L.A.\n   </em>\n   as \"the first case in this circuit that recognized that there is a constitutional right to privacy regarding disclosure by a police officer of the results of an arrestee's HIV test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11203964\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1171/#p1173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We concluded that the probationer had correctly \"alleged a violation of a constitutional right to privacy in the non-disclosure of information regarding one's HIV status by a government official.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11203964\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1171/#p1173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff quite reasonably argues that these two precedents from our circuit, as well as a few similar decisions by other circuits, clearly establish the law supporting his constitutional claim in this case. But we are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   One reason is that there are factual differences between the precedential cases and the one before us. When our precedents were decided, the stigma of HIV was enormous. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    A.L.A\n   </em>\n   ., for example, said that the (inaccurate) disclosure that he was HIV positive caused family and friends to shun him and refuse to visit him in jail and that fellow prisoners and guards harassed him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514239\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/989/#p990\">\n    26 F.3d at 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A diagnosis of cancer is not nearly as opprobrious as a diagnosis of HIV was then. A further distinction is that the disclosure in this case had a plausible positive purpose-to encourage the support of family and friends-as opposed to the hostile purposes in our precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The second reason is the difference in governing law: the development-or, perhaps more precisely, the clarification-of the relevant constitutional law by the Supreme Court in the interval between our precedents and this case. As we proceed to explain, our precedents relied on a reasonable misreading of two Supreme Court opinions as establishing a right to informational privacy. More recently, however, the Supreme Court has made clear that the existence of such a right is an open question and it has not abandoned a third precedent which suggests that any right to informational privacy is limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The lower courts that have declared a constitutional protection against government disclosure of personal information have relied on two Supreme Court opinions from the 1970s, both of which held that there was no constitutional violation in the case before the Court. In\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7501\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/589/\">\n    429 U.S. at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7501\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/589/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court considered a challenge to a New York program that required physicians to disclose to the State certain information about their prescriptions for various controlled substances.

As for leave to amend, Plaintiff concedes that he did not raise that issue in district court. And on appeal he does not argue for plain-error review, arguing only that we can review the issue because it is important and \"pure[ly] legal\" in nature. Aplt. Br. at 27-28.
