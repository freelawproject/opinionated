Between 2004 and 2009, roughly 2,500 officers (\"the Officers\") of the Los Angeles Police Department (\"the Department\") opted into two collective actions alleging a pervasive, unwritten policy discouraging the reporting of overtime. After notice to potential collective action members and several years of discovery, the government defendant, the City of Los Angeles (\"the City\"), moved for decertification of the collective actions on the ground that the Officers within each were not \"similarly situated\" within the meaning of section 16(b) of the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). According to the City, if any Officers were denied pay for their earned overtime, it was due to unrelated instances of worksite- and supervisor-specific misconduct, rather than a single, Department-wide policy or practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court granted the City's motion for decertification and dismissed the Officers without prejudice to refiling their FLSA claims individually.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The original plaintiffs in the two decertified actions then reached settlements with the City on their own claims, and the district court entered final judgment. Although no longer plaintiffs at that point, the Officers filed timely appeals from final judgment, challenging their decertification and dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We are asked first whether the Officers can appeal a decertification order when they were dismissed from the collective action before final judgment and without prejudice to their individual FLSA claims. We hold that they can. Opt-in plaintiffs are parties to the collective action, and an order of decertification and dismissal disposes of their statutory right to proceed collectively. They therefore have standing to appeal and may do so after the interlocutory decertification order to which they are adverse merges with final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We are asked next whether the collective actions here were properly decertified and the Officers properly dismissed for failure to satisfy the \"similarly situated\" requirement of the FLSA. We hold that they were. Although the district court erred in its interpretation of the \"similarly situated\" requirement and in the standard it applied in evaluating decertification, a de novo review of the record reflects that the Officers failed, as a matter of law, to create a triable question of fact regarding the existence of a Department-wide policy or practice. In the absence of such a policy or practice, and in the absence of allegations of any other similarity of law or fact material to the disposition of the Officers' claims, the Officers were not \"similarly situated\" within the meaning of the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because much of this case turns on terminology and procedures specific to the FLSA, we begin with a brief explanation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and the collective action mechanism that arises from it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The relevant language of section 216(b) is spare:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   An action to recover the liability prescribed in [this subsection] may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated. No employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought. ... The right provided by this subsection to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee, and the right of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action, shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary of Labor ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is evident from the statute that workers may litigate jointly if they (1) claim a violation of the FLSA, (2) are \"similarly situated,\" and (3) affirmatively opt in to the joint litigation, in writing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is evident also that the \"right\" to litigate jointly has two permutations: The statute refers to \"[t]he right ... to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee,\" and to \"the right of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   -that is, the right to bring the collective litigation and the right to join it. But the statute specifies little else. It does not prescribe terms for the resulting proceeding. It does not provide a definition of \"similarly situated,\" on which access to the collective mechanism typically turns. It does not establish a process for evaluating the propriety of a collective proceeding as litigation unfolds-for example, it makes no mention of \"certification\" or \"decertification\" of a collective action. And it says nothing about the standard the district court should apply when the collective mechanism is challenged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Given these gaps, much of collective action practice is a product of interstitial judicial lawmaking or ad hoc district court discretion. In particular, although nothing in section 216(b) expressly compels it, it is now the near-universal practice to evaluate the propriety of the collective mechanism-in particular, plaintiffs' satisfaction of the \"similarly situated\" requirement-by way of a two-step \"certification\" process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 McLaughlin on Class Actions \u00a7 2:16 (14th ed. 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this process most often functions, plaintiffs will, at some point around the pleading stage, move for \"preliminary certification\" of the collective action, contending that they have at least facially satisfied the \"similarly situated\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 McLaughlin on Class Actions \u00a7 2:16. Later, after the necessary discovery is complete, defendants will move for \"decertification\" of the collective action on the theory that the plaintiffs' status as \"similarly situated\" was not borne out by the fully developed record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We will address in subsequent sections the propriety of this two-step approach, as well as the proper means of evaluating whether plaintiffs are entitled to litigate in a collective action. As an initial matter, however, it is useful to address certain\n   common misconceptions about the \"preliminary certification\" and \"decertification\" of collective actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As noted, neither \"certification\" nor \"decertification\" appears in text of section 216(b). The terms have instead been adopted from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which governs class actions in federal court. The underlying assumption of that appropriation seems to be that collective and class actions, which to a degree resemble one another, must be handled in procedurally parallel ways. That assumption is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Collective actions and class actions are creatures of distinct texts-collective actions of section 216(b), and class actions of Rule 23 -that impose distinct requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7B Fed.

Again, the term implies that a district court has some threshold role in creating a collective action. But, once more, section 216(b) does not provide for any \"certification\" process in the ordinary sense. Under section 216(b), workers have a \"right\" to bring or join a collective action, and may create the collective action of their own accord by\n   filing opt-in forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    Symczyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697066\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/66/\">\n    569 U.S. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697066\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/66/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For a collective action to be \"decertified,\" then, means that the plaintiffs cannot proceed collectively on the existing complaint because they are not similarly situated, so the opt-in plaintiffs must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Despite the imprecision, we will adhere to the terms commonly used in collective action practice, as the terms are now widespread. For the reasons we have explained, we do not mean by the use of terms derived for the class action context to imply that there should be any particular procedural parallels between collective and class actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Symczyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832224\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/189/#p194\">\n    656 F.3d at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We turn now to the facts and procedural history of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Since at least 2000, the Officers have been subject to a written, FLSA-compliant policy prohibiting off-the-clock work. According to this policy, the Officers are required to report all overtime accurately, in six-minute increments, whether or not the overtime was approved in advance by a supervisor. The written policy states that those who fail to comply may be subject to discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This overtime policy was widely known among the Officers. Since at least 2000, the overtime policy has been memorialized in the Officers' collective-bargaining agreements, in letters to the Officers from the Los Angeles Chief of Police, and in the Department manual. No Officer claims ignorance of the official obligation to report overtime accurately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Officers contend, however, that the Department follows an unwritten policy that dissuades, and as a practical matter prevents, accurate time reporting. According to the Officers, supervisors routinely require short blocks of extra work-pre-shift work, post-shift work, or work through meal breaks-yet discourage or reject overtime claims in amounts of less than one hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Officers' allegations of an unwritten, Department-wide policy served two purposes. First, it went to the merits of the Officers' FLSA claims. The FLSA requires covered workers to be paid at least 1.5 times their normal rate for all work in excess of forty hours weekly,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), provided the employer has actual or constructive knowledge that the work is occurring.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.11\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Forrester v.

Employers who violate this requirement are liable for damages in the amount of the unpaid overtime, \"an additional equal amount as liquidated damages,\" and \"reasonable attorney's fee ... and costs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). An unwritten policy discouraging the reporting of overtime, if proven at trial, would both lend credence to the Officers' claims that they incurred unpaid overtime and help satisfy the element of knowledge. Second, credible allegations of a Department-wide policy should suffice to make the Officers similarly situated, as required to maintain a collective action.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The first of the two collective actions at issue in this appeal,\n   <em>\n    Alaniz v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 04-8592 AG (AJWx),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was filed in 2004. By the end of 2007, the\n   <em>\n    Alaniz\n   </em>\n   collective action had been joined by over 2,200 Officers. The second of the collective actions,\n   <em>\n    Mata v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 07-06782 AG (AJWx), was filed\n   in 2007. By the end of 2009, it had been joined by over 150 Officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties in\n   <em>\n    Alaniz\n   </em>\n   stipulated to preliminary certification of the collective action in mid-2006. The parties in\n   <em>\n    Mata\n   </em>\n   did not so stipulate. But the two cases were related by the district court shortly after\n   <em>\n    Mata\n   </em>\n   was filed, and thereafter proceeded on the same track, with overlapping discovery. Discovery was extensive, lasted several years, and was complete for the purposes of decertification at the time the City filed its decertification motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The City moved for decertification of both collective actions in January 2014. In opposition, the Officers submitted 232 declarations, each from a different Officer claiming uncompensated overtime. These declarations were largely identical, except for each declarant's identifying information and his or her estimate of the average time spent each day in unscheduled pre-shift, post-shift, and meal-break work. A small number of declarations referred to specific instances of supervisors discouraging or rejecting overtime reports for small increments of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Officers also submitted 50 declarations, each from a different Officer, listing types of uncompensated tasks and stating, generally, that workplace \"culture and policy\" discouraged accurate time reporting. These declarations-also largely identical, except for each declarant's list of tasks-stated that supervisors were aware of off-the-clock work and knew that the Department benefitted from it, but did not insist that the Officers report it. The declarations also stated that the declarants learned from their first days with the Department that, notwithstanding written rules to the contrary, overtime in amounts of less than one hour was not to be reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In support of its motion for decertification, the City submitted an analysis of the overtime that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   reported. This analysis, uncontroverted by the Officers, revealed roughly 6.6 million overtime reports between 2001 and 2014. Of these 6.6 million reports, 330,000 reports were for overtime of less than one hour, and 112,000 were for overtime of less than 30 minutes. Of the reports claiming less than an hour of overtime, 64,000 were filed by plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Alaniz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mata\n   </em>\n   actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The City also submitted uncontroverted evidence demonstrating the Officers' dissimilarity in tasks and in geographic assignments. According to the declaration submitted by the Department's FLSA compliance manager, the Officers worked at seven different ranks and within each of the Department's 31 divisions. The Officers had at least hundreds of different supervisors among them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To determine whether, in light of this evidence, the Officers were \"similarly situated\" within the meaning of the FLSA, the district court applied a three-prong test widely used in district courts both within this circuit and without, although it has not been endorsed by this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   First, the district court considered the \"factual and employment setting\" of the Officers. According to the district court, the \"boilerplate\" nature of the Officers' declarations called into question their evidentiary value, whereas the City's uncontroverted evidence reflected widespread compliance with the overtime reporting policy, even for fairly short periods of overtime. As a result, the officers could not have been subject to a uniform policy preventing the reporting of overtime period of less than one hour. In the absence of such a policy, the district\n   court concluded, the Officers' claims were necessarily tied to discrete worksites and supervisors, and unsuited to a collective of the scale the Officers sought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, the district court considered the defenses available to the City. The district court found many of these defenses-lack of actual or constructive knowledge, good faith, the de minimis nature of the alleged overtime violations-situation-specific, and thus difficult to address on a collective basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, the district court considered \"fairness and procedural considerations,\" and concluded that there was no benefit to the court or to the parties in attempting to litigate collectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As all three factors weighed in favor of decertification, the district court granted the City's motion and dismissed the Officers without prejudice.

So, although choosing to settle claims may prevent the settling plaintiff from appealing, for the non-settling plaintiffs, it is immaterial that the settling plaintiff cannot be a party to the appeal.

Again, the City relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   , which adopted the City's view based on the opt-in language at issue in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   First, nothing inherent in the opt-in process requires waiving the right or delegating the responsibility to appeal a decertification order. The spare language of the FLSA regarding the opt-in form refers only to a \"consent in writing to become ... a party.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Accordingly, if the members of a collective reach their own agreement to delegate litigation duties, such an agreement marks a deviation from the statute's default assumption of coequal status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, nothing about the opt-in forms in this case-which differ substantially from those in\n   <em>\n    Halle\n   </em>\n   -suggests that the Officers delegated their authority to appeal an order ousting them from the case. The consent forms here at issue state only, \"I ... authorize the filing and prosecution of the action in my name.\" The district court's decertification order in essence negated that consent, by dismissing the opt-in plaintiffs from the suit; no longer could the action be prosecuted in their names. So, to the extent there was a delegation here, it was not a delegation that survived the decertification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As there is no obstacle to appellate review in this case, we turn to the district court's decertification order.

As previously discussed, it is clear from the language of section 216(b) that (1) workers may join a collective action if they claim a violation of the FLSA, are \"similarly situated\" to the original plaintiff, and affirmatively opt in; and (2) participation in the collective action is a statutory \"right\" held equally and individually by each party plaintiff, whether originally appearing in the complaint or later opting in.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, the FLSA leaves the collective action procedures-beyond the requirement of a written opt-in-open. As here relevant, the FLSA does not establish a process for evaluating the propriety of the collective mechanism as litigation proceeds. It does not provide a definition of \"similarly situated\"-the requirement that largely determines the viability of a collective action. And it says nothing about the standard the district court should apply when the collective mechanism is challenged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We address each question in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In the absence of statutory or case law guidance, the district courts, both within this circuit and without, have arrived at a loose consensus as to the proper procedure for determining whether the collective\n   mechanism is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 McLaughlin on Class Actions \u00a7 2:16 (14th ed. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leuthold\n   </em>\n   , 224 F.R.D. at 466-67 (citing examples).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, at or around the pleading stage, plaintiffs will typically move for preliminary certification. 1 McLaughlin on Class Actions \u00a7 2:16 ; 7B Fed.

There are of course limits to that discretion.

Notice was provided to putative collective action members upon preliminary certification. Discovery was extensive, and the relevant record was complete at the time of the district court's ruling on the decertification motion.

First, the district court considers the \"disparate factual and employment settings of the individual plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Thiessen\n   </em>\n   , 267 F.3d at 1103. Second, the district court considers \"the various defenses available to defendants which appear to be individual to each plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, the district court considers \"fairness and procedural considerations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The ad hoc test is the only one that has been fully endorsed at the circuit level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 551 F.3d at 1260 n.38 (collecting examples).

But the ad hoc test has two major flaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   First, although the ad hoc test is properly aimed at gauging whether party plaintiffs are legally or factually \"similarly situated,\" it does so at such a high level of abstraction that it risks losing sight of the statute underlying it. As it stands, the ad hoc test offers no clue as to what\n   <em>\n    kinds\n   </em>\n   of \"similarity\" matter under the FLSA. It is, in effect, a balancing test with no fulcrum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Third Circuit, for example, has offered a list of potentially salient considerations in ADEA cases-\"whether the plaintiffs are employed in the same corporate department, division and location; [whether they] advanced similar claims of age discrimination ...

The \"common question\" requirement within Rule 23, like the similarly phrased requirements within Rules 20 and 42, bears a close resemblance to the \"similarly situated\" requirement of section 216(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Similarly, in the collective action context, what matters is not just\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   similarity between party plaintiffs, but a legal or factual similarity material to the resolution of the party plaintiffs' claims, in the sense of having the potential to advance these claims, collectively, to some resolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calderone\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 1103 ;\n   <em>\n    Symczyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832224\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/189/#p194\">\n    656 F.3d at 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, for the reasons discussed above, broad reliance on\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   and other class action case law remains unwise in the collective action context, as it risks importing into the FLSA, contrary to its terms, the \"rigorous analysis\" uniquely applied under Rule 23 to purely representative litigation,\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 350-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as factors-for example, adequacy, superiority, predominance-with no foundation in the language of section 216(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7B Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 1807 (observing that district courts have \"uniformly\" rejected the argument that\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   affects the FLSA's \"similarly situated\" requirement). Under section 216(b), if the party plaintiffs are similar in some respects material to the disposition of their claims, collective treatment may be\n   <em>\n    to that extent\n   </em>\n   appropriate, as it may\n   <em>\n    to that extent\n   </em>\n   facilitate the collective litigation of the party plaintiffs' claims. District courts have ample experience managing cases in this way. For example, Rule 42, which offers a closer analogy to the collective mechanism than Rule 23, already provides for the possibility of partial consolidation for trial, to the extent separate actions involve common questions of law or fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The second flaw of the ad hoc test lies in its \"fairness and procedural considerations\" prong. Such an open-ended inquiry into the procedural benefits of collective action invites courts to import, through a back door, requirements with no application to the FLSA-for example, the Rule 23(b)(3) requirements of adequacy of representation, superiority of the group litigation mechanism, or predominance of common questions. Again, the FLSA does not give district courts discretion to reject collectives that meet the statute's few, enumerated requirements.\n   <em>\n    Zavala v. Wal Mart Stores Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508544\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/527/#p535\">\n    691 F.3d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (3d Cir. 2012). To the contrary, the FLSA gives party plaintiffs the power to decide in what form they wish to proceed, for \"Congress has stated its policy that [party] plaintiffs should have the opportunity to proceed collectively.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoffmann-La Roche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330614\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/165/#p173\">\n    493 U.S. at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330614\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/165/#p173\">\n    110 S.Ct. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   That is not to say that \"procedural considerations\" can never justify decertification. A \"collective\" action in which, as\n   a practical matter, no material dispute truly could be heard on a collective basis would hardly be consistent with the FLSA's remedial purpose. But if the party plaintiffs' FLSA right to choose collective litigation has any force, \"procedural considerations\" must mean more than the inconvenience, from the court's or defendant's viewpoint, of the party plaintiffs' choice. Importantly, the theoretical alternative to collective litigation is the possible proliferation of individual actions-in the present case,\n   <em>\n    thousands\n   </em>\n   of individual actions-litigated seriatim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 551 F.3d at 1265. Accordingly, at this second step of the ad hoc test, decertification of a collective action of otherwise similarly situated plaintiffs cannot be permitted unless the collective mechanism is truly infeasible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    c. The district court's analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The district court's approach to decertification in the present case offers a useful example of both flaws of the ad hoc test. The Officers' position was that there was a tacit, Department-wide policy discouraging the reporting of earned overtime. If that allegation were adequately supported by the record, the \"similarly situated\" requirement would have been met. The Officers would have been alike in a way material to their litigation, as proving (or failing to prove) the existence of such a Department policy would have affected the ultimate findings regarding the occurrence of unpaid overtime and the City's knowledge of it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.11\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , thus collectively advancing the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In applying the ad hoc test, however, the district court focused less on whether there was adequate evidentiary support for the posited policy and more on the overall sameness of the Officers' employment circumstances. For example, the district court emphasized that Officers worked on different tasks, in different divisions, and under different supervisors. Those distinctions would not have mattered to the determination of liability if it were proven, as claimed, that the Department had an overall policy against submitting small overtime claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 551 F.3d at 1264. A systemic policy is no less common across the collective if those subject to it are affected at different times, at different places, in different ways, or to different degrees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Klimchak v. Cardrona, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV-09-04311 (SJF)(ARL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201120463\">\n    2011 WL 1120463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2011) (\"[I]f defendants had a policy or practice of not paying overtime compensation to any of its laborers, whether full-time or part-time, union member or non-union member, all of those employees would be similarly situated for purposes of this analysis.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The district court emphasized also that the Officers worked different hours and claimed overtime of different amounts, including some amounts that might have been de minimis. But those distinctions go to the individualized calculation of damages or the individualized application of defenses. Such distinctions do not preclude collective treatment for the purpose of resolving the common issue that\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   exist, and that must be answered in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bouaphakeo v.

City of San Diego\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841453\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/616/#p624\">\n    479 F.3d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 624 (9th Cir. 2007). \"Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to support a conclusion even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Reese v.

The standard is therefore a mid- or post-trial analogue to the test applied at summary judgment, which asks, pretrial, whether sufficient evidence exists to preclude a judgment as a matter of law because, viewing the competent evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the trier of fact could properly find for the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Accordingly, to the extent decertification and summary judgment on the merits present the same question, it should be the ordinary summary judgment standard, rather than a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, that applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Here, for instance, the Officers' allegations of an unwritten, Department-wide policy discouraging the reporting of overtime do double duty. They provide a basis for collective treatment, as they raise a similarity of fact or law whose disposition would advance the litigation of the Officers' FLSA claims. And, relatedly, they go directly to the merits of the individual Officers' claims, as proving the policy at trial is essential to the Officers' FLSA theory, including their satisfaction of the FLSA's knowledge requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.11\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows that, in this case, a post-discovery decertification motion does double duty as well. It is, in effect, indistinguishable from a motion for partial summary judgment limited to the question of whether an unwritten, Department-wide policy existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Put differently, to the extent overlap exists between the availability of the collective action mechanism and the merits of the underlying claim, challenges to the former are no different from challenges to the latter, and so should be analyzed under the same standard. In the present posture of this case-a post-discovery decertification motion-that standard is summary judgment. If it were otherwise, a decertification motion could become an end run around the submission of factual disputes to the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   It follows that, to the extent decertification overlaps with the merits, a district court cannot weigh the evidence, as ordinary summary judgment practice precludes doing so. The collective mechanism is meant to ensure that party plaintiffs have the option of benefitting from the efficiencies of collective litigation-including, in cases presenting genuine disputes of material fact, collective access to trial. That principle is not consistent with allowing district courts to break apart the collective based on their own resolution of merits questions otherwise reserved to the trier of fact. If there is a merits dispute that would survive summary judgment on which the disposition of decertification also depends, the merits dispute should be tried. Whether the question will be answered favorably or unfavorably is for the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Big Lots Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026817\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/561/567/#p567\">\n    561 F.Supp.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 567, 579-80 (E.D. La. 2008) (decertifying a collective action premised on a \"uniform policy or practice\" after a trial on that and other questions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In sum, to the extent the decertification issues overlap with the merits, we agree with the district courts' widely held view that the standard on a post-discovery decertification motion is effectively the summary judgment standard.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 22. We emphasize, however, that as with a motion formally styled as summary judgment, the district court may not, on a merits-dependent decertification motion, weigh evidence going to the merits. If collective treatment is premised on a genuine dispute of material fact as to the merits of the party plaintiffs' FLSA claims, the collective action cannot be decertified unless the factual dispute is resolved against the plaintiffs' assertions by the appropriate factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   We turn now to the substance of the district court's decertification order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As an initial matter, the district court's approach to decertification was legally incorrect in two respects. First, as already discussed, the district court applied an overly demanding test of the FLSA's \"similarly situated\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.2.c. Second, although the district court recited the substantial-evidence standard, which is an adequate statement of the summary judgment analysis, it weighed evidence regarding the existence of a Department-wide policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As with a motion styled summary judgment, however, we need not remand for reconsideration when the district court applies an improper standard, as our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v. City of Tacoma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351576,9114966\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/332/574/\">\n    332 F.3d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578 (9th Cir. 2003). Under de novo review, we may affirm if we conclude, as a matter of law, that the record does not reveal a genuine dispute of material fact as to the existence of a Department-wide policy discouraging the reporting of overtime. We do so conclude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The key problem for the Officers in providing evidence of the Department-wide policy they allege is one of scale. That the policy is Department-wide is essential to the viability of the collective action, as it is the sole justification advanced for a Department-wide collective. Yet the evidence in the record is simply not probative of an unwritten overtime policy of that breadth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Officers' primary contention appears to be that there exists a kind of tacit policy that operates top-down, such that an inference may be drawn that the policy applies Department-wide. As the district court noted, however, the evidence the Officers have produced-a mass of individual declarations, mostly containing rote recitations of hours worked and bare assertions of a certain Department \"culture\"-has a fundamentally different focus. The Officers' declarations speak of immediate supervisors at discrete worksites. And even then the evidence is not of a uniform practice from which one might infer direction from a higher level, but of variable practices variably applied. Critically, there is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence of any directives, incentives, conversations, emails, or actions (such as denials of promotions) by Department leadership that could have communicated to local supervisors, implicitly or otherwise, a uniform policy against reporting small amounts of overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the declarants' vaguely reported experiences are in fact representative of the experiences of the party plaintiffs Department-wide; the only evidence in the record is that they are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First, the Officers offer no sampling or expert statistical evidence tying the declarants' statements to the experiences of the party plaintiffs or of the workforce generally. The declarations are too limited in individual detail to support an inference that failure to report specific instances of overtime was tied to a policy from above. Nor have the Officers presented evidence-lay or expert, anecdotal or statistical-that the City's overtime claims process, or the enforcement of it, was somehow structurally inadequate, or implemented Department-wide in a way that inhibited the accurate reporting of overtime. Furthermore, as the district court noted, many of the declarants who claim they were first taught not to report overtime during their training at the Police Academy \"were members of Academy classes that substantially pre-date[ ] the\n   [D]epartment's promulgation of the current [written] overtime policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Second, although the Officers' declarations are creditable evidence of instances of unpaid overtime, when it comes to the issue of a Department-wide policy, they run up against the City's overwhelming evidence of widespread FLSA compliance. It is undisputed that 330,000 overtime claims in amounts of less than one hour were filed during the relevant period, including 64,000 by the party plaintiffs themselves. Confronted with that contradiction, lacking affirmative evidence of a structural problem, and in light of the Department's widely disseminated written policy requiring that overtime claims be filed, no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the City fostered or tolerated a tacit policy of noncompliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Absent substantial evidence that the City fostered or tolerated a tacit, systemic policy against the reporting of overtime, there is no genuine dispute of fact as to the only allegation the party plaintiffs have cited as a basis for proceeding in a Department-wide collective. The collective action was therefore correctly decertified and the opt-in plaintiffs correctly dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    APPENDIX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Campbell v.

Spurious class actions, which were available under the pre-1966 version of Rule 23, allowed plaintiffs to litigate en masse if they asserted a \"several\" right, shared a \"common question of law or fact affecting the several rights,\" and sought \"common relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) (1965). Such class actions were \"spurious\" in the sense that, unlike true class actions, but similar to collective actions, they required each plaintiff to join the litigation individually.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kinney Shoe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"893700\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/564/859/#p862\">\n     564 F.2d at 862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    This approach is widely used within this circuit.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Sargent\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344887\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/171/1063/#p1070\">\n     171 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1079 ;\n    <em>\n     Stiller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321712\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/611/#p631\">\n     298 F.R.D. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    631 ;\n    <em>\n     Beauperthuy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823114\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/772/1111/#p1118\">\n     772 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1118 ;\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270097\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/266/446/#p449\">\n     266 F.R.D. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    449 ;\n    <em>\n     Smith v.
