But if her landlord offers her an alternative that likewise satisfies that need, she has no right to demand the particular accommodation that she wants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Carol Vorchheimer needs ready access to her rolling walker and wanted to leave it in her building's lobby. The building managers refused, but offered her four other ways to store and access her walker. She sued under the Fair Housing Amendments Act, claiming that her preferred accommodation was necessary to equally enjoy her home. The District Court dismissed her complaint, holding that she had not plausibly pleaded necessity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We will affirm. Necessity is a demanding legal standard. For a housing accommodation to be \"necessary\" under the Act, it must be required for that person to achieve equal housing opportunity, taking into account the alternatives on offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Here, Vorchheimer's own complaint, including the exhibits attached to it, forecloses her claim. Leaving the walker in the lobby was her preference. But given the four alternatives offered-which she herself pleaded-she did not plausibly plead that it was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We accept as true the well-pleaded allegations in the amended complaint, including those in the exhibits attached to it: Vorchheimer suffers from pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure ) and other disabilities. As a result, she must use a rolling walker to get around. She owned a\n   condominium in The Philadelphian and had a reserved parking space in front of the building. Vorchheimer would use her walker to get from her condo to the lobby and then use her cane from the lobby to her car. She could neither lift her walker, nor fold it, nor put it into her car. Instead, she began leaving her walker in The Philadelphian's lobby when she left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One day, Vorchheimer left her walker in a corner of the lobby. A building staffer took the walker and stored it in a room behind the concierge desk. The next day, The Philadelphian's general manager, Frank Bonom, emailed Vorchheimer and asked her to give her walker to the front-desk staffer whenever she left. She refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A year-long quarrel ensued, culminating in this case. Vorchheimer kept leaving her walker in the lobby. The Philadelphian's staff kept putting it into storage until she returned and asked for it. And Vorchheimer kept insisting that putting it away was unacceptable. Because of her disabilities, she asserted, she needed her walker to be available in the lobby upon her return so that she could independently retrieve it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although The Philadelphian refused to let Vorchheimer leave her walker in the lobby, it offered her four alternative accommodations. Am. Compl. \u00b6 33 &amp; Ex. 8. First, she could have staff store the walker and then return it to her in the lobby-she could either phone ahead to have it ready for her, or sit on a bench to await its retrieval. Second, she could have a staffer deliver the walker to her car before she got out of it. Third, she could have the doorman load the walker into and take it out of her car's trunk. Or finally, she could start parking in the building's indoor valet-parking garage, where she could leave her walker near the valet station. But Vorchheimer rejected all these alternatives and insisted that she needed to leave her walker in the lobby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To support her demand, Vorchheimer gave the building's managers several letters from her doctors. In the first two, her doctors detailed her medical issues and wrote that \"[h]er use of a rolling walker is a medical necessity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 4 &amp; 7. In the third, her doctor reiterated that she needs to \"have ready access to her walker or scooter\" and that she should \"not [be] required to stand [a]waiting assistance for any period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9. The doctor noted management's offer to bring the walker to Vorchheimer's car. But he considered it \"preferable to simply have her walker readily available to her in the building lobby.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This way, she could \"maintain[ ] her independence\" and not risk having to stand and wait for someone else to get the walker.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Neither side would budge. So Vorchheimer sued Bonom, The Philadelphian Owners' Association, and the Association's then-president, June Idzal. She alleged that the defendants were violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) by refusing to let her leave her walker in The Philadelphian's lobby so she could retrieve it by herself. And she attached to her complaint her doctors' letters and her correspondence with the building's managers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Court dismissed Vorchheimer's complaint. It acknowledged that \"keeping her equipment in the lobby may be Plaintiff['s] preferred accommodation.\" App. 2 n.1. But she had not plausibly alleged that it was necessary. App. 3 n.2. So, the Court held, \"Defendants' storage ... and prompt retrieval of [her walker] when she returns does not deny Plaintiff a full and equal opportunity to enjoy her housing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Vorchheimer's amended complaint added nothing material, so the District Court dismissed again based on lack of necessity. App. 5 n.1. Vorchheimer then\n   filed this appeal and later moved out of The Philadelphian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

TO BE \"NECESSARY,\" A HOUSING ACCOMMODATION MUST BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY IN LIGHT OF THE ALTERNATIVES OFFERED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Fair Housing Amendments Act forbids housing discrimination against the disabled.

This case turns on the first half of the third element: whether a requested accommodation is necessary. That is an independent requirement, one we must now define.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The statutory text requires an accommodation be essential to achieve equal housing opportunity, measured against any alternatives that were offered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We begin with the text. We look to the statutory provision's language and to the ordinary meaning of the words it uses.\n   <em>\n    Artis v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616009\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/594/#p603\">\n    138 S.Ct. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616009\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/594/#p603\">\n    199 L.Ed.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Dictionaries, statutes, case law, treatises, literature, and even songs cast light on the ordinary meaning of \"necessary.\" These sources tell us at least three things: First, \"necessary\" means \"required.\" It is a high standard. Second, we must consider what is necessary to satisfy the particular disabled person's need. This statute pegs necessity to affording this disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy her dwelling. And third, we must gauge necessity in light of proposed alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    \"Necessary\" means required, indispensable, essential.\n   </em>\n   \"Necessary\" is a \"word[ ] of limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058782\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/322/#p327\">\n    355 F.3d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (4th Cir. 2004). As an adjective, it means \"[i]ndispensable, requisite, essential, needful; that cannot be done without,\" or \"absolutely required.\" 10\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   275-76 (2d ed. 1989);\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1510-11\n   (1966). The other sense of the adjective is causal: \"Inevitably determined or fixed by predestination or the operation of natural laws; happening or existing by an inherent necessity.\" 10\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   at 275-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Necessary's dictionary definitions reflect the word's ordinary meaning. Consider its use in formal logic: a necessary condition is something essential for something else to be true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   at 276; Irving M. Copi et al.,\n   <em>\n    Introduction to Logic\n   </em>\n   471 (14th ed. 2011). In the example above, lemon juice is a necessary condition for making lemonade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In keeping with these definitions, English speakers distinguish desired goods from necessary ones. Thoreau categorized the \"necessaries of life\" as \"Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel.\" Henry David Thoreau,\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   14 (Courage Books 1990). \"\n   <em>\n    [N]ext to\n   </em>\n   necessaries,\" he ranked only \"a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a wheelbarrow, etc., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery, and access to a few books.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (emphasis added). And years before he became president, Lincoln contrasted alcohol with staples like \"flour, beef, bacon, or any other of the real necessaries of life.\" Abraham Lincoln, Temperance Address, Springfield, Illinois (Feb. 22, 1842).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   So the word \"necessary,\" without more, is stringent. When it is not followed by an object, as it is in this statute, English speakers and writers typically reserve \"necessary\" for our physiological needs and perhaps our needs for health and safety.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   A.H. Maslow,\n   <em>\n    A Theory of Human Motivation\n   </em>\n   , 50 Psych. Rev. 370 (1943) (describing these as the foundational and second levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs). Necessities do not include conveniences and creature comforts, much as they are desirable or even helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   True, we sometimes speak loosely, confusing our wants with our needs. Children may declare, \"I need candy.\" Adults may groan that they need a beer or a vacation. But wants are not needs. Parents remind their children that, while they want candy, they do not need it. So too with beers and vacations. As The Rolling Stones put it: \"You can't always get what you want / But if you try sometimes you might find / You get what you need.\" The Rolling Stones,\n   <em>\n    You Can't Always Get What You Want\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    on Let It Bleed\n   </em>\n   (London Records 1969). And though we sometimes use the verb \"need\" loosely, we do not do the same with the adjective \"necessary.\" Nor does Congress write statutes with such loose, colloquial phrasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Like ordinary English speakers, the common law uses \"necessary\" in this strict sense of essential or indispensable. In contract law, \"the predominant rule is that a minor's contracts are generally voidable but that contracts for what are known as 'necessaries' are enforceable.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Reading Hous.

Describing a necessity as \"absolute,\" \"logical,\" \"physical,\" or \"bare\" constricts\n   the necessity required even more. But when Congress wants to loosen necessity to mean just \"sufficiently important,\" it uses the phrase \"reasonably necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ayestas v.

Congress knew how to broaden \"necessary\" by adding \"or appropriate\" in \u00a7 3608(e)(6), but chose not to do so in \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B). Each statute is different, however, and the text, structure, or context of another provision may suggest a different interpretation or degree of necessity. Our holding today is limited to this particular provision of the Fair Housing Amendments Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The statute applies \"when such accommodations may be necessary,\" but \"may\" does not change our analysis.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(B). Vorchheimer cites a few district-court decisions that imply that the conditional \"may\" waters down the degree of necessity, requiring only a probability of necessity.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kuhn ex rel.

The condition, when met, makes the accommodation necessary, as in the phrase \"as the case may be.\" \"[W]hen such accommodations may be necessary\" in \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B) is another way of saying \"whenever they are necessary\" or \"as far as they are necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In short, the Act's necessity element requires that an accommodation be essential, not just preferable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    We must gauge necessity in light of the goal of achieving equal housing opportunity.\n   </em>\n   Necessity tracks an underlying need or goal.

To qualify as alternative \"reasonable accommodations,\" the accommodations must afford the particular disabled person equal opportunity both to use and to enjoy her home. An accommodation that does not provide\n   <em>\n    equal\n   </em>\n   opportunity, or that provides equal opportunity to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   but not to\n   <em>\n    enjoy\n   </em>\n   , will not satisfy that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   So courts must weigh whether the tenant's requested accommodation and the landlord's proposed alternative afford equal housing opportunity. Whether the accommodations do so depends on that particular tenant's abilities and disability, which may require a fact-intensive inquiry.

Even so, it is unpersuasive on this point.

VORCHHEIMER DID NOT PLAUSIBLY PLEAD NECESSITY, SO DISMISSAL WAS PROPER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Necessity is amenable to dismissal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Vorchheimer argues that necessity is so fact-specific, and so divorced from the alternatives on offer, that it is never amenable to dismissal-or even perhaps summary judgment. We disagree. As we have explained, the necessity element has a legal meaning. And that legal meaning requires considering the alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Our holding today in no way raises or shifts the pleading requirements or burden of proof for housing-discrimination claims. We do not require plaintiffs to hypothesize alternatives, let alone to preempt hypotheticals. Nor do we change how courts should treat these claims, including the necessity element, on a motion to dismiss. To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff need only plausibly plead enough facts to make out the three elements set forth in \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B) : refusal, reasonable accommodation, and necessity/equal opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiffs need not, and generally do not, plead alternative accommodations. So, ordinarily, district courts do not have alternatives before them on a motion to dismiss. Assessing alternatives typically requires a factual record, and developing that factual record requires discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But this is not an ordinary case. Vorchheimer did not just plead facts supporting the statutory elements, including her disability and her requested accommodation. She also specifically pleaded the four alternative accommodations in her complaint. Am. Compl. \u00b6 33.a-d. She attached Idzal's correspondence (on behalf of The Philadelphian) outlining them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/#p140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exs. 5, 8.

Vorchheimer did not plausibly plead that her requested accommodation is necessary in light of the alternatives offered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although Vorchheimer asked to leave her walker in the lobby, she did not plausibly plead that it was necessary. Her own doctors' letters establish two medical necessities. First, while she can \"walk[ ] (with the assistance of a cane) the short distance from her car to the lobby,\" \"her use of a rolling walker is a medical necessity\" to get from the lobby to and from her apartment. Am. Compl. Exs. 7, 9. So she needs \"ready access to her walker or scooter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046220\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1096/#p1103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9. Second, she needs to \"[m]inimiz[e] her periods of unsupported standing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046220\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1096/#p1103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7. \"Even just standing, for periods as brief as 5 minutes, result[s] in the occurrence of progressive symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046220\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1096/#p1103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   All four of the proffered alternatives, however, satisfy both of these medical needs. Staff could retrieve the walker from storage to the lobby, while Vorchheimer sits on a bench, or retrieve it before she arrives if she calls ahead. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33.a &amp; Exs. 5, 8. A staffer could bring the walker to her car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.b &amp; Ex. 8. The doorman could fold the walker, load it into her car, and unload and unfold it upon her return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.d &amp; Ex. 8. Or she could park in the indoor valet-parking garage and leave her walker there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.c &amp; Ex. 8. On their face, all four of these alternatives offer her \"ready access to her walker or scooter\" and \"[m]inimiz[e] her periods of unsupported standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 7, 9. Not one requires her to stand without support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Nor, though Vorchheimer amended her complaint, did she plausibly plead the contrary. Her only suggestion that the alternatives are inadequate is half a sentence in a footnote at the very end of her brief, citing three paragraphs of her amended complaint. Br. 21 n.5 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 39). The cited paragraphs allege at least four occasions on which she left her walker in the lobby and had to stand and wait for front-desk staff to retrieve it. But in none of the examples she gives did she seek to use The Philadelphian's alternatives; each time, she neither used the bench nor called ahead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 \u00b6 35, 39. She alleged no problem with calling ahead to the front desk, having a doorman bring the walker to her, having a doorman load and unload the walker from her car, or using valet parking. Nor did she allege that she ever tried any of these options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Vorchheimer also alleged a third medical necessity: preserving her \"functional independence.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23, 32, 34, 48, 69, 70, 78. She claims that if she cannot herself get the walker in the lobby, she might have to wait for it, increasing her stress. But those allegations of necessity are conclusory and contradicted by her\n   own exhibits. Her doctors' letters do not state that independent access is necessary. On the contrary, Dr. Palevsky repeatedly described it as \"preferable\" or \"medically preferable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 9, 12. It causes Vorchheimer less stress, which her doctor described as desirable. \"When faced with two potential solutions, the one that permits the patient to retain her independence is the better option.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Palevsky was careful to distinguish her needs from her preferences. So are we.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Even if it were necessary for Vorchheimer to retrieve her walker independently upon her return, a satisfactory option was on the table. Idzal offered to let her park in the indoor valet-parking garage, \"where [she] could leave [her] rolling walker in close proximity to the pick-up and drop-off spot for [her] vehicle.\" Am. Compl. Ex. 8. Vorchheimer's only quibble with the valet-parking option is that she would have to \"relinquish her coveted, designated outdoor parking space.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 33.c. But nothing in the Act gives her a right to her preferred option. Wants are not needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   One final note: If a civil-rights complaint fails to state a claim, a district court must grant leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be futile or inequitable.\n   <em>\n    Mullin v. Balicki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263720\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/140/#p151\">\n    875 F.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151 (3d Cir. 2017). But here, Vorchheimer had already amended her complaint once and did not move to amend again or suggest what she might add. The District Court concluded that further amendment would be futile. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Carol Vorchheimer preferred to have access to her walker without having to wait for a staffer. But she did not plausibly plead that she needed to leave it in the lobby. To enjoy her home, she needed access to her walker without having to stand for minutes. She pleaded four alternatives on offer that, on their face, satisfied those needs. And she attached doctors' letters that distinguish her needs from her preferences. Because the Act guarantees her only a \"reasonable accommodation\" that satisfies her needs, not the particular accommodation that she wanted, we will affirm.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
