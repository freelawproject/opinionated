The conviction depends on whether Hobbs Act robbery is a \"crime of violence\" subsumed by \u00a7 924(c)(3)(a). Defendants urge us to extend\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   to reconsider our precedent on this question. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nonetheless, Defendants argue that Hobbs Act robbery can be committed without the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, because \"fear of injury\" is included in the definition of robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We decline to extend\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   's holding that far. Section 924(c) contains both an elements clause and a residual clause; the elements clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\" whereas the residual clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it, \"by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(c)(3).\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   only addressed, and invalidated, a residual clause mirroring the residual clause in \u00a7 924(c) ; it did not address the elements clause. Whatever arguments may be made opposing Hobbs Act robbery's inclusion under the elements clause as a crime of violence,\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   has not affected them, and therefore, they are foreclosed to us in light of\n   <em>\n    Buck\n   </em>\n   . Thus, we affirm our prior judgment regarding Davis and Glover's convictions for violations of \u00a7 924(c) as predicated on Hobbs Act robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants' firearms convictions for knowingly using, carrying, or brandishing a firearm to aid and abet conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery under Count Two present a less clear question. We have held that conspiracy to commit an offense is merely an agreement to commit an offense.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103529\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/728/#p731\">\n    636 F.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (5th Cir. 2011). Therefore, here, the conspiracy offense does not necessarily require proof that a defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use force. Accordingly, the Government concedes that Defendants could only have been convicted as to Count Two under the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government attempts to change its prior approach to these cases on remand by abandoning its longstanding position that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B) should be analyzed under the categorical approach. In light of\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the Government argues we can, and should, adopt a new \"case specific\" method when applying the residual clause; this method would compare \u00a7 924(c) 's residual definition to the \"defendant's actual conduct\" in the predicate offense. Regardless of whether\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   would otherwise permit us to do so, we do not find a suggestion by a minority of justices in that case sufficient to overrule our prior precedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096824\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/423/#p431\">\n    343 F.3d 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 (5th Cir. 2003) (\"We use the so-called categorical approach when applying [ \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) ] to the predicate offense statute.

Therefore, we must address the serious constitutional questions apparent in the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) in light of\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Supreme Court rested its decision in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   on its concerns about the language of the statute itself. Although \u00a7 16(b) contained linguistic differences to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") residual clause the Court had previously invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), it noted that each statute contained \"both an ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk threshold,\" and this \" 'devolv[ed] into guesswork and intuition,' invited arbitrary enforcement, and failed to provide fair notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1223 (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2559 ). Because the language of the residual clause here and that in \u00a7 16(b) are identical, this court lacks the authority to say that, under the categorical approach, the outcome would not be the same. We hold that \u00a7 924(c) 's residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. Therefore, Defendants' convictions and sentences under Count Two must be vacated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude this decision does not implicate the sentences on the other counts.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

After granting certiorari in this case, the Court vacated our previous opinion and remanded for consideration in light of the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The majority remedies the error with respect to Davis and Glover's convictions under \u00a7 924(c) 's residual clause by reaching into their sentences and excising a period of time. But the aggregate sentences here-combinations of concurrent and consecutive sentences for different counts-resulted from a sentencing judgment by the district court. \" 'A criminal sentence is a package of sanctions that the district\n   court utilizes to effectuate its sentencing intent.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pepper v.

It is for the district court-not this court-to reach sentencing decisions in the first instance. \"[A] district court's 'original sentencing intent may be undermined by altering one portion of the calculus' \"-here reductions by 120 months of the defendants' 608-month and 498-month sentences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649569\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/466/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The majority concludes that excision of the sentences associated with Davis and Glover's Count Two convictions does not implicate their sentences relative to other counts, citing to our\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 486. But\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   was an appeal from a\n   <em>\n    district court's\n   </em>\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176067\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/350/#p360\">\n    816 F.3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the district court had determined that, after excision of time associated with a dismissed conviction, the petitioner's remaining aggregate sentence entailed an appropriate package without further adjustment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176067\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/350/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176067\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/350/#p360\">\n    at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the instant case were an appeal from a district court's resentencing of Davis and Glover, I would find\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   controlling and reliance upon it sound. Today's decision, however, involves the Court of Appeals making that determination. A district court declining to adjust the remaining parts of its original sentencing package does not speak to an appellate invasion of the district court's sentencing prerogatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The appropriate remedy is to vacate Davis and Glover's entire sentences and remand for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Such a disposition is especially appropriate where the district court in any event under current law may well be faced with constructing a new sentencing package. This because, lurking in the background of the majority's disposition in this case is another issue: the sentencing package here also included Davis's ACCA sentence enhancement predicated on convictions for Texas burglary. Were Davis resentenced, the district court would consider current law, including\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Management of the sentencing process is best left to the court charged with the task and best situated to accommodate it.
