Osher sought to enjoin the condemnation proceedings and to obtain relocation benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204622\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   abstained from deciding Osher's claim against the Redevelopment Authority and dismissed his claim against the Agency. We conclude that the Act does not create a private right of action against the Agency, and that Osher waived any challenge to the court's abstention decision, so we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court dismissed this case at the pleading stage, so we take the allegations in Osher's complaint as true. In 2012, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency announced its intention to move its western headquarters in St. Louis to a new location. To help persuade this employer to remain in the locale, the City of St. Louis sought to secure an attractive site for the Agency's new headquarters. The City's proposed site in north St. Louis included Osher's property. The St. Louis Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority began acquiring property within the proposed site. After notifying Osher of its intent to procure his property in December 2015, the Redevelopment Authority brought a condemnation action in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the state court action was pending, Osher brought suit in the district court and moved for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction against the condemnation proceedings. He alleged, among other things, that the Redevelopment Authority and the Agency violated the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (the \"Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204622\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by failing to pay him the relocation benefits provided by the Act. Osher sought relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At a hearing on the motion, the district court determined that the parties agreed on the following additional facts. In the state court proceedings, Osher did not challenge the Redevelopment Authority's right to condemn his property, and the Redevelopment Authority took title to the property after paying the property's fair market value of $810,000 plus interest. After Osher refused to vacate the property,\n   the Redevelopment Authority petitioned for a writ of possession from the state court. By the time of the hearing in federal court, the state court had granted the writ of possession and ordered Osher to tender possession of the property to the Redevelopment Authority immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court ultimately denied Osher's motion and dismissed all of his claims. Citing the pending state court condemnation proceedings, the court abstained from exercising jurisdiction over Osher's claim against the Redevelopment Authority under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756, 760,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). The court dismissed Osher's claim against the Agency on the grounds that \u00a7 1983 does not provide a remedy against a federal agency, and that the Act does not create a private right of action. Alternatively, the court concluded that Osher's claim failed on the merits, because the Act did not apply to the underlying eminent domain proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Osher noticed an appeal on June 16, 2017, \"from the final judgment entered in this matter on May 2, 2017.\" The Agency agrees that we have appellate jurisdiction, but the Redevelopment Authority argues that the notice was untimely. As timeliness under a statutory deadline is jurisdictional in a civil appeal,\n   <em>\n    Bowles v.

The district court's order dismissing the action was filed December 29, 2016, more than 60 days before he filed the notice of appeal on June 16, 2017. But because Osher filed a timely motion for relief from the judgment under Rules 59 and 60, the time to file his appeal did not begin to run until the district court disposed of that motion on May 2, 2017. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Osher filed his notice of appeal within 60 days of May 2, so it is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There is a second reason to be confident that Osher's notice of appeal was timely. \"The entry of a judgment triggers the running of the time for appeal,\"\n   <em>\n    Jeffries v.

R. Civ. P. 58(a). If the separate document requirement is not satisfied, however, \"then the order is deemed 'entered' 150 days after the dispositive order was entered on the civil docket.\"\n   <em>\n    Jeffries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755875\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/1008/#p1012\">\n    721 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1012 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(c)(2). The district court here entered its dismissal order on December 29, 2016, but never set out the judgment in a separate document. The judgment was therefore deemed entered on May 28, 2017. Osher filed his notice of appeal within 60 days of May 28, so his appeal is timely for that reason as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the merits, Osher challenges the district court's dismissal of his claims against the Agency under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act. He disputes the district court's conclusion that there is no private right of action under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Act provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Whenever a program or project to be undertaken by a displacing agency will result in the displacement of any person, the head of the displacing agency shall provide for the payment to the displaced person of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) actual reasonable expenses in moving himself, his family, business, farm operation, or other personal property; [and] ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) actual reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or farm ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204622\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (3).

The Court did not address whether the Act created a private right or remedy, and it is neither binding nor persuasive authority on those questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Osher also contends that by stating expressly in \u00a7 4602(a) that the provisions of \u00a7 4651 \"create no rights or liabilities and shall not affect the validity of any property acquisitions by purchase or condemnation,\" Congress implicitly declared that \u00a7 4622\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   create a private right of action. An express disavowal of rights under one section, however, does not amount to an unambiguous manifestation of intent to create enforceable rights under another. We consider the statute as a whole, and the text and structure of the Act fall short of demonstrating a congressional intent to create a private cause of action under \u00a7 4622. The district court properly dismissed Osher's claim against the Agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Osher's notice of appeal also encompassed the district court's order abstaining from the exercise of jurisdiction over his claim against the Redevelopment Authority. Osher's notice of appeal stated that he was appealing \"from the final judgment entered in this matter on May 2, 2017,\" and it brought up for review all of the previous rulings and orders that led to the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosillo v.

In his opening brief, however, Osher did not advance a meaningful argument that the district court erred by abstaining under the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   doctrine. The contention is therefore waived.\n   <em>\n    White v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275766\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/1064/#p1075\">\n    865 F.3d 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 (8th Cir.2017). Osher suggested at oral argument that he waived any challenge to abstention only on his claim for injunctive relief, while he adequately disputed the district court's decision to abstain from ruling on his claim for damages. We reject this dichotomy. The brief includes no argument about the abstention ruling in either context, and the point is waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
