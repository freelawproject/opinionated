Classifications pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard impact what benefits workers are entitled to under the State's labor laws and the corresponding burdens placed on the entities that hire them. We hold that the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard, a generally applicable test used in a traditional area of state regulation, is not \"related to\" prices, routes, or services, and therefore is not preempted by the FAAAA. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff-Appellant California Trucking Association (\"CTA\") is an association devoted to advancing the interests of its motor carrier members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   CTA members are licensed motor carrier companies that manage, coordinate, and schedule the movement of property throughout California in interstate commerce. Based on factors such as efficiency and market demand, CTA members use either \"company drivers\" or \"owner-operators\" to haul freight. As expected, \"company drivers\" haul freight using trucks that are owned by the motor carrier; \"owner-operators\" use their own trucks. When CTA members use owner-operators, the parties enter into contracts providing, generally, that the owner-operators: (1) must provide the truck and a qualified driver to haul the freight; (2) must be responsible for operating expenses like truck maintenance, repair, and refueling; (3) will, in turn, have control over whether and how to perform a haul; and (4) will then be paid at an agreed-upon rate. CTA alleges that owner-operators are independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CTA filed suit against Defendant-Appellee Julie Su in her official capacity as Labor Commissioner of the State of California Department of Industrial Relations (the \"Commissioner\"). The Commissioner is responsible for enforcing the California Labor Code, which affords certain benefits and protections to workers who qualify as employees. As with any other industry, the Commissioner applies the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard\n   to assess owner-operators' claims that they have been misclassified as independent contractors and so denied certain benefits under the Labor Code. CTA alleges the Commissioner's application of the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard disrupts the contractual arrangements between owner-operators and motor carriers, which introduces inefficiencies into the transportation services market and is inconsistent with Congress' deregulatory goals under the FAAAA. CTA therefore seeks a declaration that the FAAAA preempts the Commissioner's application of the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard to disrupt these contracts, and corresponding injunctive relief barring the Commissioner from applying the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard to motor carriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commissioner moved to dismiss CTA's Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motion, concluding that the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard used by the Commissioner was not preempted under the FAAAA. The district court denied CTA's motion for reconsideration, and CTA timely appealed the dismissal of its Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Relevant here, the Commissioner applies the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard when adjudicating and enforcing claims within her jurisdiction. If she were to determine that, under\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   , certain owner-operators are employees of a motor carrier, this could result in obligations under the California Labor Code that are inconsistent with the parties' contractual arrangements (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , who is responsible for truck maintenance expenses). CTA contends the FAAAA thus compels the Commissioner and courts to accept the parties' agreements at face value. The Commissioner, in turn, seeks the power (as with any other employer) to look behind the agreements and apply the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard to ensure that owner-operators are, in fact, independent contractors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Compelling Who Provides Services\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   CTA argues that a state law or policy compelling a carrier to use employees to provide its services is preempted. Even so, the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard does not, by its terms, compel a carrier to use an employee or an independent contractor. Nor does CTA contend that the nature of the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard compels the use of employees to provide certain carriage services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This case is therefore wholly different from\n   <em>\n    American Trucking\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   559 F.3d at 1053-57. There, in reversing the denial of a preliminary injunction, we concluded that the FAAAA likely preempted the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach's directive that carriers must use only employee drivers and give hiring preference to drivers with more experience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As compared to the\n   <em>\n    Borello\n   </em>\n   standard, which sets a background rule for ensuring a driver is correctly classified,\n   <em>\n    American Trucking\n   </em>\n   stands for the obvious proposition that an \"all or nothing\" rule requiring services be performed by certain types of employee drivers and motivated by a State's own efficiency and environmental goals was likely preempted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1053-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For similar reasons, it is immaterial that other States have adopted the \"ABC\" test to classify workers, the application of which courts have then held to be preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schwann v.

Like\n   <em>\n    American Trucking\n   </em>\n   , the \"ABC\" test may effectively compel a motor carrier to use employees for certain services because, under the \"ABC\" test, a worker providing a service within an employer's usual course of business will never be considered an independent contractor.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 438.
