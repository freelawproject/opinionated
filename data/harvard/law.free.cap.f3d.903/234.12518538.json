Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This consolidated appeal considers a bevy of challenges brought by the Township of Bordentown, Township of Chesterfield,\n   and Pinelands Preservation Alliance's (\"PPA\") (collectively, the \"petitioners\"), seeking to prevent the expansion of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities operated by the Transcontinental Pipe Line Company, LLC (\"Transco\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioners contend that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") violated the federal statute governing the approval and construction of interstate pipelines, as well as other generally applicable federal environmental protection statutes, by arbitrarily and capriciously approving Transco's proposed project. The petitioners further maintain that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (\"NJDEP\") violated New Jersey law by (1) improperly issuing to Transco various permits that Transco was required under federal law to obtain before it could commence construction activities on the pipeline project, and (2) denying the petitioners' request for an adjudicatory hearing to challenge the permits' issuance, based only on the NJDEP's allegedly incorrect belief that the New Jersey regulations establishing the availability of such hearings were preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As explained more fully below, although we conclude that the petitioners' challenges to FERC's orders lack merit, we agree that the NJDEP's interpretation of the relevant federal law was incorrect, thus rendering unreasonable the sole basis for its denial of the petitioners' request for a hearing. Given our disposition, we do not reach the petitioners' substantive challenges to the NJDEP's provision of the permits, which-assuming a hearing is granted-we leave for the NJDEP to address in the first instance. We accordingly will deny in part and grant in part the petitions for review, and we will remand to the NJDEP for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This case presents challenges to both the federal and state governments' treatment of Transco's application to construct its interstate pipeline project.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The permits at issue in this case relate to Transco's Garden State Expansion Project (the \"Project\"), by which Transco planned to upgrade its existing interstate natural gas pipeline system so that it could support the transportation of another 180,000 dekatherms per day of capacity for natural gas from its Mainline to its Trenton-Woodbury Lateral. The Project proposed to construct a new meter and regulating station, compressor station, and electric substation along the Trenton-Woodbury Lateral in Chesterfield, New Jersey (Station 203), and to upgrade and modify the existing motor drives and compressor station located on the Mainline in Mercer County, New Jersey (Station 205).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The New Jersey Natural Gas company (\"NJNG\") contracted with Transco to utilize all the capacity added by the Project, for distribution via NJNG's intrastate pipeline system. In anticipation of obtaining the excess capacity, NJNG has proposed to construct the Southern Reliability Link Project (\"SRL\"), a 28-mile-long intrastate pipeline that would connect to Transco's Trenton-Woodbury Lateral pipeline and deliver gas south-eastward for connection into NJNG's existing system. Separately, PennEast has proposed to construct the interstate PennEast Pipeline Project, which would deliver natural gas from Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale region\n   and terminate at an interconnect with Transco's Mainline. NJNG has independently contracted with PennEast to purchase 180,000 dekatherms per day of the PennEast project's expected supply, for delivery to the SRL via Transco's pipeline network.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As required by the NGA, Transco sought and obtained from FERC a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction of the Project, subject-as is generally the case-to Transco \"receiv[ing] all applicable authorizations required under federal law.\" Appendix (\"App.\") 67. Prior to issuing the certificate, FERC conducted an environmental analysis and issued an EA concluding that, with the appropriate mitigation measures, the Project would have \"no significant impact\" on the environment. App. 1479;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   App. 45. FERC issued the EA in November 2015 and, after receiving comments, issued Transco the certificate in April 2016. Bordentown and Chesterfield moved FERC for a rehearing, which FERC denied in November 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 74-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the Project would be situated in freshwater wetlands and transition areas, and the construction of the Project would require discharging fill or dredge material into navigable waters as well as the diversion of a significant volume of water, Transco applied to the NJDEP for a Freshwater Wetlands Individual Permit and Water Quality Certificate (\"FWW permit\") and dewatering permit, as required by the CWA and New Jersey law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NJDEP held two days of public hearings to consider the FWW permit, and received over 1,800 written comments, which included concerns raised by each of the petitioners. After obtaining Transco's responses to the public comments, as well as its responses to the NJDEP's requests for additional information concerning possible alternative sites for an electrical substation that would be built as part of the Project, the NJDEP issued the FWW permit on March 13, 2017. Shortly thereafter-and also following a public hearing-the NJDEP on March 16, 2017 issued the temporary dewatering permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Pursuant to New Jersey law, the petitioners sought an adjudicatory hearing concerning each permit. Bordentown-later joined by Chesterfield and PPA-filed a request for a hearing on the FWW on March 22, 2017. On April 11, 2017, Bordentown alone also requested an adjudicatory hearing on the dewatering permit. Both requests were filed within the 30-day limitations period established under New Jersey law for seeking adjudicatory hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207\">\n    N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :7A-21.1(b) ; 7:14A-17.2(c). Bordentown asserted that it had standing under state law to challenge the permits as a third party because it had a particularized property interest affected by the Project, given that part of the project would be built on Bordentown-owned land, which Transco had acquired through eminent domain under the authority granted by the FERC certificate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NJDEP App. 37 &amp; n.4; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h). On August 22, 2017, the NJDEP denied the petitioners' requests for an adjudicatory hearing on either permit. The sole stated basis for the NJDEP's denial of the request was that this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Delaware I\n   </em>\n   established that we have\n   \"exclusive jurisdiction to review the issuance of permits regarding interstate natural gas pipeline projects\" and accordingly that by operation of the NGA \"the state administrative hearing process provided for in the [FWPA] is not applicable to permits for interstate natural gas projects.\" NJDEP App. 39. Concluding that the NGA \"requires that final permits be appealed to the Third Circuit,\" the NJDEP denied the petitioners' hearing requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The petitioners timely sought review in this Court, both of FERC's orders issuing the certificate and denying rehearing, and of the NJDEP's issuance of the permits and its order denying the requests for an adjudicatory hearing to challenge them. We have jurisdiction to review these petitions for review of the federal and state agencies' orders regarding the interstate Project under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Challenges to FERC's Orders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We begin with the challenges directed at FERC's orders (docket No. 17-1047). As explained more fully below, we conclude that the petitioners' FERC-related claims are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Interpreting the CWA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Before turning to the merits of the certificate's issuance, we must address the petitioners' challenge to its timing. As noted, Transco was required under the CWA to obtain a Section 401 permit from the NJDEP affirming that Transco's discharge activities would comply with federal and state water quality standards. Under Section 401, Transco had to obtain such a permit prior to the issuance of any \"Federal license or permit to conduct any activity ... which may result in any discharge into the navigable waters.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"No license or permit shall be granted until the certification required by this section has been obtained or has been waived....\"). The petitioners argue that, despite this clear language, FERC issued the certificate to Transco before Transco obtained the Section 401 permit from New Jersey, thereby authorizing the pipeline project that \"may result in ... discharge into the navigable waters\" in contravention of \u00a7 1341(a) 's mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   FERC does not dispute that Transco had yet to obtain the Section 401 permit, but argues instead that it only issued a conditional certificate, which required Transco first to obtain the required state permits and then to secure FERC's permission to proceed before it could begin any construction related to the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 67, 89-90. In FERC's view, because the certificate did not, in fact, permit Transco to \"conduct any activity\" that could \"result in any discharge into the navigable waters\" until Transco had received the necessary state permits, FERC's issuance of the conditional certificate prior to Transco's receipt of the state-issued Section 401 permit did not contravene the CWA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with FERC's position and hold that FERC's practice of issuing certificates that condition the start of construction on the receipt of the necessary state permits complies with the plain language of the CWA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained, \"the 'logically antecedent' question under \u00a7 401 is\n   whether the disputed federal permit or license 'is subject to the provisions of Section 401(a)(1)' in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    Del.

Cir. 1997) ). Where the conduct that the certificate authorizes \"would not result in a discharge,\" Section 401(a) is inapposite and no \"license or permit\" is needed to engage in that conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854928,3704444\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/1175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The petitioners concede that the certificate did not permit Transco to engage in any construction-which implicitly acknowledges that it did not permit Transco to engage in any activity that could result in discharge-but argue that the certificate nevertheless \"sanctions other conduct that Transco would not otherwise be permitted to undertake,\" such as initiating condemnation actions under the NGA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h). Pet. Br. 35. However, the activity that FERC's certificate allows to commence-bringing a condemnation action-cannot, without a series of additional steps (among them the prohibited construction activities), result in the discharge of water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even accepting the petitioners' argument, FERC's conditional certification does not contravene the CWA's requirements. The petitioners' argument would expand the CWA from a statute meant to safeguard the nation's water sources to a statute regulating the initiation of an interstate pipeline's construction process. However, the latter statute already exists and, as the petitioners themselves note, it provides Transco the condemnation authority upon the issuance of the certificate, with no caveats.

Br. 16. But this is simply not so. The statements that the petitioners point to in support merely articulate the undisputed fact that the Project would supply capacity to NJNG; they are agnostic as to the source of the gas that would utilize the capacity. App. 887, 1419.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, as FERC concluded below, the agreement between NJNG and Transco concerning the Project makes clear both that NJNG contracted for Transco's capacity without regard to the source (or even availability) of the natural gas-which NJNG is alone responsible for sourcing-and, more importantly, that the actual source of the physical supply for the capacity added by the Project is the Station 210 Zone 6 pooling point, not the PennEast line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, FERC found the PennEast project's proposed capacity of 1,107,000 dekatherms per day is 90 percent subscribed by 12 different shippers, such that NJNG's subscription makes up less than 15 percent of the pipeline's capacity. App. 47-50; 80. In other words, the Project would go forward even if PennEast were not built (such that NJNG could not obtain PennEast gas to consume Transco's capacity) and conversely the PennEast project would go forward even if the Project were not built (such that PennEast could not deliver its gas to NJNG).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Indeed, in their reply, the petitioners all but concede that their segmentation claim fails. They acknowledge that PennEast has\n   independent utility from the Project because it serves many shippers apart from NJNG. Reply Br. 7. They further concede that, even if PennEast is not built, NJNG could use the extra capacity provided by the Project to transport gas purchased from another supplier and moreover that NJNG's contract with Transco obligates it \"to obtain the gas regardless of whether the Penn East project is built.\" Reply Br. 7. The petitioners' continued argument that FERC improperly segmented the Project and PennEast thus relies on the petitioners' bare assertion that this contractual setup-which establishes that NJNG must use the Project's increased capacity whether or not the gas comes from the PennEast line-is entirely irrelevant to determining whether the sole purpose of the Project is to connect PennEast and the SRL. But even to describe the petitioners' argument is to refute it. If just constructing the Project-and thus adding the capacity that NJNG requires-is sufficient to meet Transco's contractual obligation, such that NJNG must buy the capacity regardless of any other contingency (such as PennEast's status), then the Project's construction alone plainly serves an independent purpose separate and apart from whatever happens to the PennEast pipeline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NRDC v.

Cir. 2018) (rejecting as insufficient to rebut a finding of economic viability a petitioner's claim that the developer had \"envisioned\" the project \"as part of a larger\" development plan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To conclude otherwise, the petitioners confuse the means of the Project for its ends. The Project exists to fulfill NJNG's need for gas in southern New Jersey, a need that will exist and require satisfaction whether or not PennEast is constructed. As we elaborate on below in discussing the need for the Project, NJNG required more supply to shore-up the southern parts of the state after Hurricane Sandy. App. 1419. To obtain that supply, NJNG contracted (1) with Transco to increase its pipeline's capacity and (2) with PennEast to get the gas to Transco. But while Transco's capacity increase is necessary to the plan, PennEast's participation is not. NJNG can (and by contract, must) simply buy gas from the Zone 6 pooling point that was delivered by a different supplier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, even if the petitioners are correct that we are obligated to ignore the contractual terms and focus only on the functionality of the pipeline, such an analysis\n   points conclusively in FERC's favor. Transco's Mainline can change the direction of gas flow depending on market conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 49-501. The Station 210 Zone 6 Pooling point (connecting Transco's Leidy line to the Mainline) thus can either send gas from the Leidy line to the South or pull flow from the Gulf of Mexico northward, depending on market factors-such as where the cheaper gas is being produced. App. 49. The PennEast pipeline will connect to the Transco Mainline south of the Station 210 Zone 6 pool from which NJNG has contracted with Transco to obtain the supply created by the project. Accordingly, the Zone 6 pool will only be filled with gas physically brought in by the PennEast line during times when the Mainline is running South-to-North. The mechanics of the Transco Mainline's flow-determined without consideration of the NJNG contract-make it highly unlikely that the physical gas flowing from the Zone 6 pool, through the Transco lateral, to the SRL will only be gas piped in by PennEast. In a pipeline, gas is fungible, so \"its 'transportation' does not always take the form of the physical carriage of a particular supply of gas from its starting point to its destination.\"\n   <em>\n    Associated Gas Distribs. v.

Cir. 1990). NJNG's contract to purchase gas from PennEast and its simultaneous contract with Transco for capacity to transport that exact amount of gas was not, as the petitioners argue to this Court, a contract to purchase and transport PennEast's physical gas to the SRL. It was rather a contract to purchase an amount of gas from PennEast for inclusion in the Transco system, supported by a separate contract between NJNG and Transco to transport that same amount of gas from Transco's pooling station to the SRL. As FERC explained in its order denying rehearing, although \"it is feasible, using backhaul and other methods, that natural gas from the PennEast Project could ultimately be delivered on Transco to reach the\" SRL, that is not the way that the Mainline will necessarily operate. App. 81 n.36. The Project will thus often service the SRL with non-PennEast-derived natural gas, cementing our conclusion that the Project has a value independent of the PennEast line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because we conclude that the Project's purpose is to supply the capacity that NJNG requested from their Zone 6 pool, and that the source of the pool's gas will be determined based on market conditions, we agree that FERC's refusal to consider PennEast a \"connected action\" in the Project's EA was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

App. 83. It reached this conclusion after giving careful attention to each factor. As to the first factor, for the same reasons that PennEast and the Project were not improperly segmented, FERC concluded that PennEast, the SRL, and the Project do not comprise a single corridor type project and that the Project would be a comparatively minor element compared to the 30-mile SRL. On the second factor, FERC concluded that the SRL did not \"uniquely determine\" the location of the project, because the SRL needed only to connect to the Transco lateral at some point at or downstream of the newly constructed Station 203, not to the compressor station itself. The location of Station 203, accordingly, was not uniquely dictated by the needs of the SRL. Regarding the third factor, FERC explained that (excluding PennEast which, as noted, is not part of the Project) the jurisdictional Project is dwarfed by the size of the SRL. FERC rejected the contention that its oversight of the PennEast's and the Project's costs-which the petitioners assert will be passed on to SRL ratepayers-means that FERC has decisional authority impacting the SRL. As FERC further explained, because each pipeline is owned by different companies, there will be no cost sharing between them; rather, shippers using each line will bear their own costs. Moreover, the tariffs of SRL, as an intrastate line, are governed by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and FERC has no role in funding, approving, or overseeing the SRL's construction or operation. Finally, concerning the fourth factor, FERC noted the almost total absence of federal control over the SRL and rejected the petitioners' argument that, by briefly traversing a federal military base and in light of some generally applicable federal permitting requirements, the SRL was subject to significant cumulative federal control. Although we recognize that one could quibble with its analysis of the second factor, we discern no abuse of discretion in FERC's final analysis or its weighing of the factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The petitioners' argument that the first factor is satisfied is based solely on their view that the Project, when considered in conjunction with the 122-mile PennEast line, is significantly larger than the SRL. But this avenue of attack is foreclosed by our agreement with FERC's determination that the PennEast line was properly segmented from the Project. The petitioners' assertion that FERC has\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facto\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over the SRL by virtue of its oversight over the Project's rates which in turn impacts the SRL's rates, even if accurate, articulates a logic that would extend\n   FERC oversight over every nonjurisdictional project that attaches to an interstate pipeline. Such a rule would swallow the non-jurisdictional exception altogether. By its nature, a pipeline network consists of interstate and intrastate projects, and so the projects' connectedness alone-along with inherent cross-effects created by that connection-cannot weigh meaningfully in favor of federal control over purely intrastate projects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New River\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429528,9237970\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/1323/\">\n    373 F.3d at 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (repudiating view that would require \"the Commission to extend its jurisdiction over nonjurisdictional activities simply on the basis that they were connected to a jurisdictional pipeline\"). Finally, that the SRL (1) would need to obtain an easement from the federal government, (2) traverses a federally designated National Reserve (managed by a state agency), and (3) must abide by generally applicable pipeline safety regulations are slim reeds upon which to assert cumulative federal control over the entire SRL.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley Envtl.

FERC recognized that both the Project and the SRL would impact wetlands, but concluded based on the Project's limited geographic and durational impact, along with FERC's mandated mitigation measures, that any cumulative effects would be minor. It reached similar conclusions regarding impacts to vegetation and wildlife, explaining that cumulative effects are greatest when projects are built in the same geography, during the same time period, and where the impacts are expected to be long-term. FERC noted that the SRL, although largely occurring within existing rights of way, would be a significant pipeline project situated in a variety of habitats, including the protected Pinelands Area, and would be subject to extensive state-level regulation that would determine its ultimate environmental impacts. FERC accordingly outlined the potential area and kinds of resources that the SRL could impact but-in recognition of the ongoing state regulation-did not firmly conclude how the impacts would manifest. Nonetheless, it determined that the Project's largely short-term effects on vegetation and wildlife would not result in cumulative long-term impacts, even when added to the SRL's potentially greater impacts, which would in any event be controlled by state regulators. FERC similarly concluded that the Project's contribution to cumulative impacts on land use would minimal, given that only a small portion of the land permanently impacted by the Project would be forested, compared to the varied and more expansive terrain impacted by the miles-long SRL. Based on its finding that \"each project would be designed to avoid or minimize impacts on water quality, forest, and wildlife resources,\" and given the Project's expected \"temporary and minor effects,\" FERC concluded that the Project \"would not result in cumulative impacts.\" App. 1465, 1474.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The petitioners complaint is not that the .25 mile area was incorrect,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that FERC failed to take full account of all the environmental impacts across the entire span of pipelines other than the project under review-impacts far afield from the geographic area impacted by the Project-merely because those pipelines will ultimately be part of the same network as that served by the Project. To echo the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, such an expansive reading of the cumulative impacts requirement \"draws the NEPA circle too wide for the Commission,\" which need only review impacts likely to occur in the area affected by the project under FERC review.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334632,12310535\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/36/\">\n    827 F.3d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, notwithstanding its determination-uncontested on appeal-that the area impacted by the Project was of an exceptionally small size, FERC considered the cumulative impact of the totality of the SRL (and PennEast) pipeline and determined that their cumulative impact was insignificant. In light of the gratuitousness of FERC's extended cumulative impacts review, the petitioners' complaint-which concedes the sufficiency of FERC's analysis as it relates to wetlands-that FERC gave short-shrift to its consideration of the SRL's impact on vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic species fails to persuade us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The core of the petitioners' argument, that the SRL \"as a major linear project\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   that will span \"approximately 30 miles in length\" will result in \"considerable\" environmental impacts along its path, Pet. Br. 20, itself defeats their claim that FERC had to consider all those various and oblique impacts when determining whether the SRL would cumulatively impact \"the same area\" as the project before it-involving no new pipeline construction and disturbing only the immediately surrounding area. Accordingly, FERC did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when it \"acknowledge[d] that these resources may be affected\" by the SRL but properly determined that \"a detailed analysis\" of the impacts along the entirety of the SRL was \"not within the scope of our environmental analysis\" for the jurisdictional Project under review.

FERC explicitly acknowledged that the SRL may affect the Pinelands National Reserve and concluded reasonably that any impacts would be mitigated by the responsible state agency overseeing the permitting process for that project.

FERC thus reasonably concluded in the EA that the Project's \"minimal impacts\" in its service area-relegated largely to \"geological and soil resources\" impacts and other temporary impacts-meant that the Project necessarily \"would not result in cumulative impacts.\" App. 1465, 1469. We conclude that FERC did not abuse its discretion in reaching this decision. This is especially true considering that the impacts from the SRL that the petitioners allege FERC ignored are different than the limited kind of impacts that FERC concluded were likely to result from the Project and so are less likely to result in cumulatively significant impacts when considered together.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Council of Envtl.

Given that the petitioners failed to show anything more than minimal impacts from the Project itself, they have failed to show that FERC acted arbitrarily or capriciously in determining that the Project would likewise not contribute to significant cumulative impacts, even taking into account the potential different impacts of the SRL on other areas within the Project's region.

But this cannot be how the cumulative analysis inquiry operates. To hold otherwise would permit a jurisdictional project with little environmental impact to be torpedoed based only on a nearby non-jurisdictional project's significant impact, which FERC has no authority to control or mitigate. Such a rule would effectively condition the approval of pipelines operating under federal jurisdiction on the fastidiousness of pipeline companies operating in the same region under state authorities. Pipelines subject to lax state authorities or state environmental requirements that fall short of federal standards could, by mere proximity to a jurisdictional project, trump federal regulation and undermine FERC's careful balancing of environmental protection and public energy needs. Less pernicious, if a proposed state-governed project has potentially significant impacts but has not yet gone through the state's regulatory process (which could be expected to mitigate those impacts), such a project would essentially stay all federally regulated projects proposed in the area until the state agency either rejects the plan or approves a mitigation proposal. Congress surely did not intend for FERC's exclusive authority to control interstate pipeline construction to be so easily usurped by state regulators. Rather, the cumulative impacts analysis was meant to address instances where the jurisdictional project itself has minor environmental impacts that nevertheless fall short of stopping the project, but where-if added to the minor impacts from nearby non-jurisdictional projects-the cumulative impact of all the projects would be significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201508.7\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201508.7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1508.27 (setting out considerations for whether a project is \"significant,\" including whether it \"is related to\n   <em>\n    other actions with individually insignificant\n   </em>\n   but cumulatively significant impacts\" (emphasis added) ).

Where the other projects' impacts are themselves already significant or greatly outweigh the jurisdictional projects' impacts, such that the jurisdictional project will not meaningfully influence the extent of the already significant environmental impacts, the cumulative impacts test is inapposite. Were this not so, a single proposed project with a significant projected impact would preempt any other development-even no-impact or impact-reducing projects-regardless of whether the proposed project ultimately will come to fruition or have those expected impacts. Plainly, such an application of the cumulative impacts analysis is unreasonable and unwarranted, and we reject it.

Potable Well Impacts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The petitioners' final NEPA-based claim regards FERC's conclusion that the Project's construction would not significantly impact the water quality of wells or cisterns in the service area. In its EA, FERC determined that \"[m]inor, temporary impacts on groundwater infiltration could occur as a result of tree, herbaceous vegetation, or scrub-shrub vegetation clearing\" around Station 203 during its construction, but that Transco would thereafter \"restore and revegetate cleared areas to pre-construction conditions to the maximum extent practicable.\" App. 17-18. The EA continued that, in the event that groundwater is \"encountered during construction,\" Transco would adhere to a series of mitigation measures, which would ensure that \"impacts on groundwater would be adequately minimized.\" App. 18. Although reaching this general conclusion about the risk of groundwater impacts as a result of the Project, FERC made no specific finding about the impacts to any particular wells or cisterns \"within 150 feet and up to one mile\" from the Project, because at the time of the EA, neither FERC nor Transco had identified any such resources. App. 17. Accordingly, the particular finding that FERC did not \"anticipate any significant impacts on cisterns, wells, or septic systems in the Project areas\" was based most directly on FERC's understanding that those resources simply did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Transco and several commenters subsequently notified FERC that there were numerous private wells in the project area. Nevertheless, based on additional assurances from Transco that it would remedy any damage or disruption to the water supply-and without revising the EA or identifying the specific number of potentially impacted wells-FERC issued Transco the certificate, subject to additional monitoring and mitigation conditions. These included the requirement that Transco identify and file the locations of all private wells in the Station 203 project area prior to beginning construction; conduct \"pre- and post-construction monitoring of well yield and water quality\"; and report to FERC any complaints it receives from well owners and how the complaints were resolved. App. 56. Some of the petitioners challenged the propriety of the certificate, arguing that the underlying assessment of the impact on wells was necessarily insufficient given that it was made without regard to the number of impacted wells. In denying the motion for rehearing, FERC rejected this claim, asserting that the certificate's requirements that Transco identify and monitor the wells, and Transco's promise to \"minimize and remediate impacts\" and \"to repair, replace, or provide alternative sources of potable water\" in the event of more permanent impacts, \"appropriately identify and mitigate any potential impacts to groundwater resources.\" App. 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On appeal, the petitioners in large part renew the challenge levied before FERC. They add that even if FERC were not absolutely required to identify the number of affected wells, its proposed mitigation plan is inadequate because: (1) it cannot effectively be enforced, and (2) because without knowing how many wells are potentially impacted, it is impossible to determine whether the proposed mitigation plan will suffice. The petitioners contend that FERC's \"no significant impacts\" conclusion was therefore arbitrary and capricious because it was not based on sufficient evidence. Because we conclude that FERC sufficiently established the efficacy of the proposed mitigation plan, we will not disturb its conclusion that the Project's groundwater impacts-if any-will not be significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   When an agency's \"proposed mitigation measures [are] supported by substantial evidence, the agency may use those measures as a mechanism to reduce environmental impacts below the level of significance.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc. v.

We conclude therefore that the record establishes that FERC adequately considered the potential impact to the wells, responded appropriately to the concern, and reasonably concluded that in light of its intervention, any impact would be insignificant. Given that FERC in the EA had already reached a reasoned conclusion regarding the intensity of the expected effects of the construction-which it deemed to be minor and transient-its failure to detail fully the number of wells potentially impacted by this limited impact is insufficient to render its findings arbitrary and capricious. The petitioners do not contend that FERC underestimated how the construction would impact a well in the project area, but only that it has not confirmed how many wells this uncontested calibration would disturb.

The need is not, as they contend, to provide capacity for gas to reach the SRL; this is the means of fulfilling the need, not the need itself. Rather, the \"need\" is for the provision of \"enhanced reliability and resiliency to NJNG's service territory in Monmouth and Ocean Counties,\" App. 790, which is why NJNG is building the SRL and why it is seeking additional capacity from Transco. This need exists objectively, and independently of the SRL. If for whatever reason NJNG cannot build the SRL as it is proposed, this need for \"enhanced reliability and resiliency\" will endure, and the Project will still be necessary to meet that need by providing additional capacity for the southward supply of natural gas. Nor, as we explained above, is the Project reliant on PennEast's completion. Thus, FERC correctly determined based on substantial evidence that even if the SRL or PennEast were not built, the Project would still serve the public need.

This finding, like all FERC fact-finding, is conclusive where supported by substantial evidence. FERC's determination is supported by Transco's submission, filed March 24, 2015, that it had \"mailed notices to all affected landowners\" and re-mailed to new addresses the notices that were returned undelivered, FERC Docket CP15-89, Submittal 20150324-5228 (Mar. 24, 2015), and FERC's own investigation confirming the submission's accuracy, App. 44, 96.

Green Acres Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The petitioners' penultimate claim is that FERC erred by granting Transco the certificate because it will permit Transco to construct the Project on property subject to regulation under New Jersey's Green Acres Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   without first seeking state-level approval to divert the property to non-Green Acres uses. This argument is facile because the petitioners entirely fail to articulate what portion of its governing law was violated when FERC neglected to seek New Jersey state approval before granting the certificate of public necessity, the authority over which Congress exclusively vested in FERC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Although the parties primarily dispute whether the Green Acres Act is preempted or whether FERC addressed sufficiently the Act's substantive concerns before granting the certificate, we need not even get that far. Nothing in the NGA, NEPA, or its implementing regulations require FERC to do anything more than at most consider the proposed land-use and its alternatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is certainly no requirement that prior to issuing a certificate, FERC pass through the procedural hoops that the state places upon the alienation of land subject to its authority. The petitioners' demand that FERC should have proceeded\n   with \"caution\" in light of New Jersey's exacting regulatory scheme, Reply 16, while laudable, finds no support in the text of FERC's regulations. Given that FERC did not have to receive New Jersey's approval prior to its issuance of the certificate, we cannot conclude that it erred by failing to do so with regard to the Green Acres Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   If anything, the NGA itself suggests that FERC need not concern itself with the legal technicalities concerning-or the ownership status of-land upon which FERC determines that the placement of a pipeline would be in the public interest. The NGA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f (h), affords certificate holders the right to condemn such property, and contains no condition precedent other than that a certificate is issued and that the certificate holder is unable to \"acquire [the right of way] by contract.\" Two salient points emerge. First, this section places sole responsibility on the certificate holder-not FERC-to secure the legal right to utilize the land at issue. Second, there is no requirement that the certificate holder first attempt to acquire the property via the state's preferred process: if the holder cannot reach an arm's-length agreement with the property owner, then the holder may proceed under \u00a7 717f(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent, then, that any preemption is squarely at issue here, the NGA already speaks pellucidly about the hierarchy of land rights, and it is entirely silent about any requirement that the state's existing regulations concerning the land be substantively complied with or respected.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominion Transmission, Inc. v.

FERC, in issuing the certificate, did not specifically opine that any particular provision of the Green Acres Act is preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 63 (explaining generally in the certificate order\n   that state requirements that \"prohibit or unnecessarily delay Transco from meeting its obligations under this Order\" are \"preempted by the certificate\"). To the extent that Bordentown feels compelled to ignore the Green Acres Act as a result of FERC granting the certificate, then it is their (allegedly overbroad) reading of FERC's authority that is to blame. If, conversely, Bordentown concludes that the granting of the certificate does not override the applicability of the Green Acres Act, then \"no harm, no foul,\" as FERC would not-in the petitioners' telling-have exceeded its authority by granting the certificate notwithstanding its failure to consider the Green Acres Act. Put simply, \"[u]nder either interpretation, the certificate order has only whatever preemptive force it can lawfully exert, and no more.\"\n   <em>\n    Myersville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149312,4355863\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/1301/\">\n    783 F.3d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because FERC, when issuing the certificate, did not \"purport to compel\" Bordentown to undertake an act inconsistent with the NGA, and because \"no provision of the [NGA] identified by [the p]etitioners barred [FERC] from issuing a conditional ... certificate under these circumstances,\" the petitioners' Green Acres Act challenge fails.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149312,4355863\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/1301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Cumulative Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The petitioners finally ask that we grant the petition based on the cumulative effect of FERC's various alleged errors. Under the cumulative error doctrine-which we have to date applied only in the context of criminal trials-a court \"may determine that, although certain errors do not require relief when considered individually, the cumulative impact of such errors may warrant a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

We need not decide whether the cumulative error doctrine applies in this type of case, because even assuming its applicability, our conclusion that none of FERC's challenged decisions were individually erroneous forecloses a cumulative error claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747614\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/180/#p196\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

As noted above, we conclude that the NJDEP misunderstood the scope of the NGA's assignment of jurisdiction to the federal Courts of Appeals. Because this erroneous view was the only articulated reason for its denial of the petitioners' hearing request, we will remand to the NJDEP for reconsideration of the petitioners' request and to give the NJDEP the opportunity to in the first instance address the petitioners' substantive challenges to the provision of the permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

For example, \u00a7 717r(b) -which is titled \"Review\" and discusses appeals to the Courts of Appeals from a FERC order-allows a party \"aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission\" to \"obtain a review of such order\" in the Courts of Appeals. In contrast, \u00a7 717r(d)(1) -which is titled \"Judicial review\"-grants \"original and exclusive jurisdiction over any\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    review\n   </em>\n   of an order or action of a ... or State administrative agency.\" (emphasis added). Congress therefore clearly understood the difference between establishing direct judicial \"review\" over agency action (supplanting any alternative intra-agency process) and creating an exclusive judicial forum in the federal Courts of Appeals for a \"civil action\" challenging an agency's decision-making (separate from the agency's own internal review process). As opposed to affirmatively installing federal courts to oversee the administrative process, as it did in \u00a7 717r(b) by placing the \"review\" of all FERC action in the Courts of Appeals, Congress did not interject federal courts into the internal workings of state administrative agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkshire Envtl.

This may be so. However, the determination of whether we\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   assert jurisdiction immediately upon a permitting decision does not answer whether the agency is simultaneously stripped of jurisdiction to provide an administrative adjudicatory hearing in the ordinary course. Our limitation to considering only final orders,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaware III\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 10, is a constraint on our own jurisdiction, not a determination that we are the only forum available to consider final orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, if the NJDEP and Transco are correct that the NJDEP orders at issue here were final when issued,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Transco Br. 24; NJDEP Br. 10, 12, New Jersey clearly provides for a 30-day window to seek an adjudicatory hearing to contest that final order. We therefore do not necessarily disagree with the NJDEP and Transco's assertion that the petitioners could have immediately appealed the NJDEP's orders to this Court. Nor do we disagree that, assuming the petitioners sought immediately to bring such a civil action-and again putting aside the question of finality-this Court would be the only judicial body to which such a challenge could be brought. Our holding is only that (1) instead of bringing a civil action in this Court, the petitioners were entitled under New Jersey law to have alternatively first sought an intra-agency adjudicative hearing, and (2) the NJDEP violated New Jersey law by unreasonably denying the petitioners' request for such a hearing based on its misreading of the NGA and this Court's precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In sum, although the plain language of the NGA strips state courts-as well as federal district courts-of jurisdiction to hear civil actions challenging an administrative agency's permitting decision regarding interstate natural gas pipelines, it does not purport to meddle with the inner workings of the agency's approval process or to insert federal appellate courts arbitrarily into the state administrative scheme. The language of the statute merely requires that judicial challenges to the outcome of the administrative process come straight to us. If, however, a state allows for an internal administrative review of a permitting process, such a process does not contravene the NGA. Because the NJDEP denied the petitioners' request for an adjudicatory hearing based on its belief to the contrary, we will remand to the agency with instructions to reconsider the petitioners' request for a hearing in light of our clarification. In doing so, we express no opinion on the petitioners' ultimate entitlement to an adjudicatory hearing based on New Jersey law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

In arguing that FERC improperly determined that there was a public need for the Project, the petitioners accuse FERC of accepting Transco's \"speculative\" assertion of need given that \"there is a very real possibility that ... the SRL will [not] go forward.\" Pet. Br. 22. Nevertheless, the petitioners simultaneously demand that FERC consider the worst-case scenario of environmental impacts from the SRL as part of its approval of the Project, without accounting for the state-mandated mitigation that would necessarily attach to any approved plan. But obviously, if the SRL's construction is at this point so speculative that it cannot be the basis of Transco's proof of public need, then FERC need not consider the hypothetical cumulative impacts of that speculative project. Especially where, as here, we have concluded that FERC was correct to segment the Project and the SRL, our precedent demands that it be \"sufficiently certain that [the] other projects will be constructed\" before an agency is required to include a cumulative impact analysis in its EA.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527178\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/168/#p182\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527178\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/168/#p182\">\n     at 182\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

FERC reiterated in its order denying rehearing, however, that if Transco's post-construction testing showed decreased well yield or water quality, FERC has authority to require Transco to mitigate the impact. App. 88. FERC's clarification implies Transco's responsibility to inform FERC of any changes. Moreover, landowners can be expected to complain to Transco if there is a noticeable change in their well's yield or water quality, complaints which Transco is expressly required to pass on to FERC. If the impacts on the wells are so negligible that the landowner does not even notice them, then such impacts are-as FERC predicts will be the case-insignificant and do not require mitigation.

To the extent that Transco would have had to utilize the right to seek eminent domain that is conveyed by the receipt of the certificate, it would only be because Bordentown-the landowner actually subject to the Green Acres Act-refused to agree to seek a diversion under the Act or because New Jersey refused to permit a diversion. The petitioners' argument suggests to the contrary that the granting of the certificate immediately condemns the property, notwithstanding state law. This is plainly incorrect, as the certificate merely signals FERC's approval of the Project's siting, based on the assumption that Transco will either receive the landowner's permission to use the property or else exercise its statutory right to condemn the property. Because FERC could issue the certificate and Transco could still (and, in fact, did) thereafter proceed via the Green Acres Act, it is unclear what additional \"caution\" the petitioners expect FERC to afford to the Green Acres Act scheme or, indeed, how much caution would in their view suffice.
