But the Hayes family's landlord, Appellee Philip Harvey, contends that this statutory right to \"elect to remain\" does not apply at the end of a lease term. Thus, according to Harvey, he is permitted to evict the Hayes family without cause once their lease has expired. The District Court agreed and granted Harvey's motion for summary judgment. We will reverse, however, because the statute's plain language and history make evident that enhanced voucher holders may not be evicted absent good cause, even at the end of a lease term. We will therefore remand so that the District Court may consider whether Harvey has good cause to evict under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Concerned that property owners would decline to renew the contracts and force low-income tenants out by raising rents to rates that exceeded the statutory payment standard, Congress passed a number of laws intended to protect tenants in the event their landlords converted their subsidized units to normal, market-based housing. Among these measures was a notice requirement enacted as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub L. No. 100-242, \u00a7 262(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20Stat.%201815\">\n    101 Stat. 1815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1890 (1988) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(c)(8) ). In its present iteration, this measure requires that owners provide tenants and HUD with at least one year's notice before opting out of their project-based assistance contracts. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(c)(8)(A). Owners \"may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants' rent payment until\" the one-year period has elapsed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20Stat.%201815\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(c)(8)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Roughly a decade later, as project-based contracts continued to expire, Congress enacted additional tenant protections through creation of the \"enhanced voucher\" program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub L. No. 106-74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Stat.%201047\">\n    113 Stat. 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1109-15, 1121-24 (1999). Whereas the notice requirement protects project-based tenants before their property owner's long-term contract with the applicable PHA expires, enhanced vouchers come into play after the notice period has elapsed and the property owner has completed the process of opting out of the project-based assistance program. HUD is statutorily required to provide enhanced vouchers to tenants who had previously been receiving project-based assistance, beginning on the date the owner's project-based contract expires and is not renewed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f note-a date that the statute refers to as the \"eligibility event,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Stat.%201047\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(t)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Enhanced vouchers are generally governed by the ordinary voucher provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o), except where modified by the enhanced voucher provision, \u00a7 1437f(t).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1). As originally passed in 1999, the enhanced voucher provision stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   during any period that the assisted family continues residing in the same project in which the family was residing on the date of the eligibility event for the project, if the rent for the dwelling unit of the family in such project exceeds the applicable payment standard established pursuant to subsection (o) for the unit, the amount of rental assistance provided on behalf of the family shall be determined using a payment standard that is equal to the rent for the dwelling unit (as such rent may be increased from time-to-time), subject to paragraph 10(A) of subsection (o) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pub L. No. 106-74, \u00a7 538(a), 113 Stat. at 1122. Thus, unlike ordinary tenant-based and project-based vouchers, enhanced vouchers were designed to cover the difference between the tenant's statutorily prescribed rent contribution and the rent amount set by the property owner after opting out of the project-based assistance program,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) -which is usually higher than the payment standard that would otherwise apply to ordinary project-based vouchers. Indeed, the rent amount that the owner chooses to charge after opt-out is not subject to any specific limit and can be increased periodically. It need only \"be reasonable in comparison with rents charged for comparable dwelling\n   units in the private, unassisted local market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(o)(10)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Aside from the higher payment standard, enhanced vouchers are, in a sense, a hybrid of the two types of ordinary vouchers. Like project-based vouchers, they are tied to the particular project; if the family moves out of that project, their enhanced voucher eligibility terminates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(C)(i). Like tenant-based vouchers, enhanced vouchers are tied to the particular assisted family; if the family attempts to transfer the voucher to a third party who was not residing in the unit on the date of the eligibility event, the family's enhanced voucher eligibility, again, terminates, and the payment standard for the unit is determined pursuant to the ordinary voucher provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(C)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2000, Congress amended the enhanced voucher provision to add the language at the heart of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub L. No. 106-246, \u00a7 2801,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Stat.%20511\">\n    114 Stat. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (2000) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) ). Importantly, the first clause of the provision was changed, and as a result, the provision in its current form now states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    the assisted family may elect to remain in the same project in which the family was residing on the date of the eligibility event for the project, and if, during any period the family makes such an election and continues to so reside\n   </em>\n   , the rent for the dwelling unit of the family in such project exceeds the applicable payment standard established pursuant to subsection (o) of this section for the unit, the amount of rental assistance provided on behalf of the family shall be determined using a payment standard that is equal to the rent for the dwelling unit (as such rent may be increased from time-to-time), subject to paragraph 10(A) of subsection (o) of this section and any other reasonable limit prescribed by the Secretary [of HUD], except that a limit shall not be considered reasonable for purposes of this subparagraph if it adversely affects such assisted families ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 1982, Florence Hayes and her son Theodore moved into 538B Pine Street, a four-bedroom unit in a duplex built as part of Washington Square East, a project-based Section 8 development located in the Society Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia. A few years later, they were joined by Aqeela Fogle, Florence's granddaughter and Theodore's niece. Theodore moved out some time in the 1980s before moving back in 2003. Florence and Fogle, however, never left. Florence lived in the unit until her death in 2015. Fogle continues to live there, now with her three minor children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In early 2008, the then-owners of Washington Square East, Pine Street Associates, decided not to renew their project-based Section 8 contract with the Philadelphia Housing Authority upon its expiration on January 17, 2009. Consistent with federal law, on January 9, 2008, Pine Street Associates notified the tenants of Washington Square East that it would not be renewing the contract. The notification letter explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Federal law allows you to elect to continue living at this property provided that the unit, the rent and we, the owner, meet the requirements of the Section 8 tenant-based assistance program. As an owner, we will honor your right as a tenant to remain at the property on this basis as along [sic] as it continues to be offered as rental housing, provided that there is no cause for eviction under Federal, State or local law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   J.A. 636. The Hayes family opted to remain in their unit, and, as a result, they began receiving enhanced voucher assistance after Pine Street Associates' project-based contract expired in January 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following year, Pine Street Associates sold a parcel of three duplex houses to Philip Harvey-a parcel that included the Hayes family's unit at 538 Pine Street. Harvey subsequently signed a Housing Assistance Payment (\"HAP\") contract with the Philadelphia Housing Authority and executed a one-year, Section 8 model lease with Florence Hayes, who at the time was designated head of the Hayes household. The lease listed Florence and Theodore Hayes, Aqeela Fogle, and Fogle's three minor children as the family members authorized to live in the unit. The parties renewed the lease in 2011 and 2013 for additional two-year terms, the second of which expired on April 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In February 2015, Florence Hayes passed away, and the Philadelphia Housing Authority transferred the head of household status to Theodore Hayes. Two weeks later, Harvey sent the Hayes family a letter stating that he did not intend to renew their lease when it expired at the end of April, citing Florence Hayes's passing and his desire to renovate the unit as reasons for the nonrenewal. Upon expiration of the lease, however, the Hayes family did not vacate the apartment, and on May 1, Harvey sent a second letter reiterating that he would not sign a new lease. In this second letter, Harvey again provided Florence Hayes's death and his plan to renovate as reasons for nonrenewal. But Harvey also added a third reason: his intent to move his daughter into the apartment. Harvey concluded the letter by stating that he would initiate eviction proceedings if the family did not move out within five days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Theodore Hayes and Aqeela Fogle responded by filing suit in the District Court, seeking declaratory relief and an order enjoining Harvey from evicting them. They argued that the enhanced voucher provision provided them with an enforceable right to remain in their unit. As a result, Harvey could not evict the family without cause, and, according to them, Harvey's stated reasons did not constitute good cause. Harvey, on the other hand, contended that he was not even bound by the enhanced voucher statute because he had never participated in the project-based program. Alternatively, he argued that the statute did not create a right that was enforceable at the end of a lease term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the District Court ruled in favor of Harvey.\n   <em>\n    Hayes v.

We disagree-albeit for different reasons than those provided by the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The District Court concluded that Harvey was obligated to comply with the program's requirements because he was \"a party to a tenant-based HAP contract and related lease,\" which were \"governed by, and subject to, ... the Section 8 statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127785\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/427/\">\n    186 F.Supp.3d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But nothing in the enhanced voucher provision limits its effect to the original owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t). Indeed, \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(C) provides only two conditions under which enhanced voucher eligibility terminates: when the family moves and when the voucher is used by someone other than the original family. Neither involves the opt-out owner's sale of the property. Although the Section 8 scheme is generally administered through the use of contracts and leases, nothing in the statute itself conditions its effect in all circumstances on common law devices. Accordingly, the enhanced voucher provision applies even to landlords who choose not to enter into HAP contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Park Vill. Apartment Tenants Ass'n v.

Instead, according to the District Court, the provision merely \"authorizes and requires the [HUD] Secretary to provide a tenant who wishes to remain in a rental housing unit additional rental assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127785\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/427/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, in the District Court's view, the enhanced voucher provision does not grant eligible tenants any right enforceable against their landlords-much less one that applies at the end of a lease term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We disagree. The plain language of \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B)'s first clause, read in the context that it is used, does in fact provide enhanced voucher holders with a right that is enforceable against their landlords such that tenants may be evicted only for cause, even at the end of a lease term. The remainder of the provision, which is not at issue in this suit, then establishes a higher\n   payment standard applicable when voucher holders exercise that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Importantly, \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B)'s first clause is written from the tenant's perspective, and it includes two verbs. The first is \"elect,\" which means \"to choose (a course of action) [especially] by preference.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 731 (1976). The second is \"remain,\" meaning \"to stay in the same place or with the same person or group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1919. This right to \"choose ... by preference\" to \"stay in the same place\" is not limited to any particular time period, and it is not directed to only HUD or any other specific party. Thus, the assisted family's right necessarily limits the ability of the property owner to evict. If a landlord could simply ignore an eligible family's choice to stay and force them to leave, the statutory right would be meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Likewise, the assisted family's right would be meaningless if it were not enforceable at the end of a lease term. Under such an interpretation, the first clause of \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) would simply reflect the baseline conditions of landlord-tenant relations: During the term of their lease, tenants generally may not be evicted, absent some reason enumerated in the lease or authorized by law; at the end of their lease term, tenants may seek to renew their leases, as long as their landlords agree to do so. Thus, if enhanced voucher holders' right to \"elect to remain\" limited property owners' rights during only the lease term, the first clause of the provision would have no independent meaning; it would describe what was already true. It is, however, a well-established canon of statutory interpretation that \"statutes should be read to avoid making any provision 'superfluous, void, or insignificant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Milner v.

In this case, the original iteration of \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B), enacted in 1999, did not include the first clause providing that eligible families \"may elect to remain.\" It instead provided that the higher payment standard would apply \"during any period that the assisted family continues residing in the same project in which the family was residing on the date of the eligibility event for the project.\" Pub. L. No. 106-74, \u00a7 538(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Stat.%201047\">\n    113 Stat. 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1122 (1999). In other words, the 1999 version of the provision did not alter the baseline conditions of landlord-tenant relations. At the end of a lease term, it stated only that HUD would provide (through the applicable PHA) any additional required financial assistance if the assisted family sought to remain in the unit\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the property owner allowed the family to do so by agreeing to renew their lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But the very next year, in 2000, Congress replaced the above language with the current version of \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B)'s first clause, stating that \"the assisted family may elect to remain in the same project in which the family was residing on the date of the eligibility event.\" Pub. L. No. 106-246, \u00a7 2801,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Stat.%20511\">\n    114 Stat. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (2000). Our interpretation must effectuate that change, for it simply is not plausible that Congress amended the statute within one year of its initial enactment merely to set the scene differently. By providing that\n   eligible families \"may elect to remain,\" Congress must have given those families some right that they did not enjoy previously-a right to choose to stay that their landlords must accept by continually renewing their leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   According to both the Dissent and the District Court, however, the significance of the 2000 amendment is that it \"obligates HUD to provide [tenants] the financial means to afford the increased rent\" after their property owners opt out of the project-based program. Dissenting Op. 51-52;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127785\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/427/\">\n    186 F.Supp.3d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently, in the Dissent's estimation, the post-amendment version of \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) provides two different protections: \"[i]t not only protects against an early [lease] termination following an opt-out, but it also explicitly provides eligible enhanced-voucher tenants with a guarantee that HUD will provide them with an enhanced voucher.\" Dissenting Op. at 53 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The problem with this interpretation-aside from being an implausible reading of the provision's plain language-is that eligible families already had an express guarantee that HUD would provide them with enhanced vouchers. A separate provision of the 1999 version of the statute already required HUD to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 106-74, \u00a7 531(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Stat.%201047\">\n    113 Stat. 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1113 (1999) (amending the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, \u00a7 524(d)) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f note) (\"In the case of a contract for project-based assistance under section 8 for a covered project that is not renewed ... , upon the date of the expiration of such contract, the [HUD] Secretary shall make enhanced voucher assistance ... available on behalf of each low-income family who, upon the date of such expiration, is residing in an assisted dwelling unit in the covered project.\"). With respect to the other protection identified by the Dissent, enhanced voucher families were also already shielded from \"early termination following an opt-out.\" Dissenting Op. at 53 n.5. As we said above, a property owner generally may not terminate a lease and evict a tenant during the lease term, absent some reason enumerated in the lease or authorized by law. That is the baseline condition of the landlord-tenant relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Thus, neither of the Dissent's identified protections needed to be codified in 2000. Because all of the relevant HUD obligations were covered by the 1999 version of the statute, adopting the Dissent's construction would require us to conclude that Congress amended the statute in 2000 solely to repeat what the statute and common law already required. Such a conclusion fails to give the 2000 amendment any \"real\" or \"substantial effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597464\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1850/#p1858\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p397\">\n    514 U.S. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p397\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In rejecting our interpretation of the enhanced voucher provision, the District Court also expressed concern about \"imposing any continued obligation on the owner to remain in the [Section 8] program\" and subjecting the owner to \"an endless or perpetual lease.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127785\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/427/\">\n    186 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   434-35 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. at 50 n.1. Examining the entire statutory scheme in context, however, makes evident that such concern is unwarranted. For one, the statute provides that enhanced vouchers cannot be transferred to \"any family other than the original family on behalf of whom the voucher was provided.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(C)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally,\n   any existing lease agreement or HAP contract will provide grounds for eviction. Indeed, leases for enhanced voucher tenancies are statutorily required to include a \"good cause\" eviction clause. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-1b(b)(3). Further, regardless of whether a lease or HAP contract is in effect, the statutory provisions and regulations governing ordinary vouchers generally apply to the enhanced voucher program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1). Thus, \u00a7 1437f(o)(7)(C), from the ordinary voucher subsection, applies and allows property owners to, at any time, terminate enhanced voucher tenancies \"for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nothing in the enhanced voucher provision's \"may elect to remain\" language abrogates or forecloses application of these standards in the enhanced voucher context. Accordingly, the 2000 amendment to the provision does not reflect congressional intent to subject property owners to perpetual leases. Rather, it evidences congressional desire to strike a balance between the interests of tenants and those of property owners. On the one hand, the enhanced voucher provision permits property owners who comply with the notice provision and opt out of the project-based program to raise rents to rates that exceed the payment standard applicable to ordinary tenant-or project-based vouchers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B). On the other hand, the enhanced voucher provision places a limitation on those property owners' nonrenewal rights by requiring good cause before the owners may terminate a tenancy. But for each owner, the number of tenancies to which the enhanced voucher good cause requirement applies will be fixed and relatively small, because enhanced vouchers are available to only families who were receiving project-based assistance on the date of the eligibility event,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(C), (t)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   That Congress chose to enact such a compromise is unsurprising given its purpose for creating enhanced vouchers in the first place: \"allow[ing] tenants to continue to maintain their homes where the owners of their rental units have raised rents after rejecting the renewal of project-based contracts.\" S. Rep. No. 106-161, at 62 (1999). Congress considered this goal \"especially ... important where the tenants [we]re elderly or persons with disabilities ...

As we have explained, the statutory provisions governing ordinary vouchers generally apply to the enhanced voucher program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1). Accordingly, \u00a7 1437f(o)(7)(C), from the ordinary voucher subsection, allows property owners to, at any time, terminate enhanced voucher tenancies \"for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Up to this point, we have yet to focus on one critical question: what constitutes \"other good cause\" to terminate an enhanced voucher tenancy? Unlike the previous issue regarding the \"elect to remain\" language, this question presents us with statutory ambiguity, for the Section 8 statute itself does not provide a definition of \"other good cause.\" We are confronted, then, with a \"statutory gap,\" and \"[f]illing [such] gaps ... involves difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomm.

Because HUD had repeatedly failed to address this opt-out problem, Congress passed legislation designed to compel HUD to act. Enhanced vouchers, which were a part of this legislation, offered property owners a carrot to continue renewing enhanced-voucher tenancies: market-rate rent. With its decision today, the majority takes this carrot and wields it like a stick, holding that property owners must continuously renew enhanced-voucher tenancies because such tenants supposedly have an enforceable \"right to remain\" in their units beyond the expiration of their lease term. Without any basis in the statutory text or history, the majority has converted Congress's incentive into an edict.

Harvey purchased 538 Pine Street free and clear of any impediments, encumbrances, liens, or restrictions. He entered into a contract with the Philadelphia Housing Authority and a related lease with the Hayes family for the four-bedroom apartment at 538B. The lease provided Harvey with sole discretion over renewal. J.A. 656 (\"The Owner\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   offer the Tenant a new lease.\") (emphasis added). When the lease expired, Harvey notified the family that he did not intend to renew it. Under the majority's view, however, Harvey must continuously renew the Hayes family's lease for as long as they wish to remain at 538B-provided he does not have good cause to evict. This supposed \"right to remain\" extends to anyone who was on the lease at the time of the opt-out. As a practical matter, given that three minor children were on the lease at the time of the opt-out, Harvey's property will likely be tied up for decades.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Congress meant to create such a \"right to remain,\" it would have done so clearly.

From these four words, the majority infers an entirely new \"right to remain\" for enhanced-voucher tenants, enforceable against their landlords. The majority's reasoning is flawed on several fronts. It largely analyzes these four words in isolation, rather than in their proper context; it mistakenly construes the provision as being directed at property owners, when it is actually directed at the relationship between HUD and assisted tenants; and it ignores the fact that if Congress meant to so expansively alter property law, it would have done so clearly.

Indeed, despite repeatedly acknowledging that a statute must be examined in context, the majority never attempts to examine the key four words within the context of the enhanced voucher provision, let alone the \"broader context of the statute as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456597\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/137/#p141\">\n    274 F.3d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Marshak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136925\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/184/#p192\">\n    240 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   192 ). By failing to read these words in context, the majority incorrectly determines that this provision is somehow directed at property owners. Then, based on this incorrect premise, the majority infers a \"right to remain\" because if an assisted family \"may elect to remain,\" then that must impose a corresponding obligation on property owners to continuously renew an enhanced-voucher tenancy. There is no basis in the text to support this inferential leap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The language-\"the assisted family may elect to remain\"-does not plainly restrict a property owner's nonrenewal rights. Indeed, nothing in the clause, nor the entire subsection, even mentions property owners. As the majority notes, there are two key verbs: \"elect\" and \"remain.\" \"Elect\" means \"to make a selection of ... to choose ... especially by preference.\"\n   <em>\n    Elect\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/elect (last visited July 31, 2018). \"Remain\" means \"to stay in the same place or with the same person or group.\"\n   <em>\n    Remain\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/remain (last visited July 25, 2018). Thus, what this clause plainly states is that an assisted tenant can \"make a selection\" or \"choose\" to \"stay in the same place.\" But for how long? One year? Five years? For life? Choosing to stay is plainly different than having a right or entitlement to stay. The majority, however, conflates the two and infers a corresponding obligation on property owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   When viewing the language first in the proper context of \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B), it is evident that \"may elect to remain\" has nothing to do with property owners, but is rather directed at HUD and assisted tenants. The provision explains what tenants must do to maintain eligibility, and that a tenant's \"elect[ion] to remain\" is the triggering mechanism that initiates HUD's obligation under the provision. It works as follows. After a valid opt-out, an assisted family can \"elect to remain\" in the same project. If the post-opt-out rent exceeds the payment standard, then the assisted family's rent is calculated as specified by the statute. But how can the assisted family be\n   <em>\n    assured\n   </em>\n   that HUD will provide them with an enhanced voucher to afford the\n   increased rent?\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Enter \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B), which obligates HUD to provide the financial means to afford the increased rent. In other words, it makes their election to remain meaningful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is the key feature of the enhanced voucher program-namely that HUD is required to provide an enhanced voucher to an eligible tenant, once they \"elect to remain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   What this provision does not do is impose a duty on a landlord to continuously renew such a lease beyond its natural expiration date. The majority infers such a duty, reasoning that otherwise, the family's choice under the statute would be meaningless. Under the majority's novel reasoning, a \"right\" is \"meaningless\" unless it makes the right-holder's objective not only possible, but perfectly assured. It follows, I suppose, that if a foundation guarantees a full college scholarship to a high school student, this is \"meaningless\" because no college is required to offer the student admission. Nonsense. When there are multiple parties involved in a transaction, a guarantee to one party is not meaningless, in any sense, even if it does not bind all parties. The right conferred in \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) is the right to have HUD increase the level of assistance to match the market-rate rent set by the now-opted-out property owner. And this is far from a token assurance-without the enhanced voucher program, tenants like the Hayes family often would be unable to afford market-rate rent following an opt-out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The majority also fails to view the language in the context of the entire statute. If Congress meant to direct any part of the enhanced voucher statute at property owners, it would have done so in unambiguous terms, as it does elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o)(7)(B) (\"owner shall offer leases to tenants under this subsection\"); \u00a7 1437f(o)(7)(C) (\"owner shall not terminate\"); \u00a7 1437f(o)(13)(G) (\"may obligate the owner\"); \u00a7 1437f(o)(13)(J) (\"The owner ... shall not admit any family to a dwelling ... other than a family referred by the public housing agency from its waiting list.\"); \u00a7 1437f(cc)(2)(B) (\"require the owner to submit an application for those rent requirements\"). So within the context of the overall statute, it is evident that \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) has nothing to do with property owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Read in context, these four words-\"may elect to remain\"-simply cannot bear the weight the majority heaps upon them.

The answer is that the language provides enhanced-voucher recipients with a guarantee that they will not be evicted, during their lease term, by a landlord who refuses to accept enhanced vouchers as part of their rental payment. As the Ninth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   The statute gives \"assisted families\" the right \"to remain in the same project.\" The statute also authorizes owners to raise their rents to a reasonable market rate and to receive a housing assistance payment, by means of an enhanced voucher, to cover the authorized increases in rent. It does not authorize owners to raise their rents to a reasonable market rate, but then to refuse to accept payment by means of an enhanced voucher, and evict an \"assisted family\" for nonpayment of rent. Practically, the statute requires owners to permit tenants to remain in the housing complex while paying only their statutorily prescribed portion of the rent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Park Vill.

Under the plain language of this provision, Harvey's termination rights were limited \"during the term of the [Hayes family's] lease.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952844,3573950\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1063/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After the lease term expires, so do\n   these protections.

In focusing on these reports, the majority overlooks the overall purpose behind the enhanced voucher provision, and the means by which Congress sought to achieve that purpose. A proper analysis of the statutory history reveals two key points: first, that the enhanced voucher provisions are clearly directed at HUD-not property owners-because of HUD's repeated failure to confront the impending opt-out problem; and second, that Congress intended the enhanced voucher provision to act as a market-based tool to incentivize-not force-property owners to renew leases of enhanced voucher holders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   At the outset, I note where I agree with the majority. I agree that one of the main purposes of the enhanced voucher provision was to \"allow tenants to continue to maintain their homes where the owners of their rental units have raised rents after rejecting the renewal of project-based contracts.\" S. Rep. No. 106-161, at 62 (1999); Maj. Op. at 44-45. I also agree that this\n   goal \"especially is important where the tenants are elderly or persons with disabilities, and want to age in place.\" S. Rep. No. 106-161, at 62 (1999). I further acknowledge that the opt-out problem was a real one-reliable studies showed that 500,000 units of affordable housing could have been at risk in the following years due to increasing opt-outs. 145 Cong. Rec. 22850 (Majority Staff,\n   <em>\n    Marking up to Market: Renewing Section 8 Contracts and the Problem of Owner \"Opt Outs,\"\n   </em>\n   June 23, 1999). Likewise, I agree that the enhanced voucher provision shows that Congress wanted to strike a balance between tenants' and landlords' interests. The problem, which the statutory history reveals, is that the majority strikes a balance that Congress clearly did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Although the majority correctly notes Congressional desire to allow tenants to maintain their homes, it wholly ignores another major factor prompting the legislation; Congress was concerned with HUD's inaction regarding the looming threat of increasing opt-outs. Section 8 Housing: Hearing Before the Sen. Subcomm. on Hous. and Transp., 106th Cong. (1999),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20492964\">\n    1999 WL 492964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (written testimony of Rep. Rick Lazio, Chairman, H. Subcomm. Hous. &amp; Cmty.) (explaining that \"Congress must act,\" because \"[f]or the last 18 months, HUD has had broad authority to prevent opt-outs and the loss of affordable housing,\" but has failed to act); 145 Cong. Rec. 22850 (majority Staff,\n   <em>\n    Marking up to Market: Renewing Section 8 Contracts and the Problem of Owner \"Opt Outs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    \"\n   </em>\n   June 23, 1999) (noting that \"HUD has failed to offer or develop anything resembling a comprehensive approach to solving the opt-out problem,\" and that \"many in the advocacy community and some legislators expressed belief that encouraging nonrenewals was an intentional policy choice [by HUD].\"). Indeed, even the Senate Report the majority cites reveals that, in order to achieve the stated goal of allowing assisted tenants to remain in their homes, Congress was authorizing\n   <em>\n    HUD\n   </em>\n   to act, as opposed to imposing any obligation on landlords. S. Rep. No. 106-161, 62 (\"[a]uthoriz[ing] HUD to provide ... enhanced vouchers\" for this purpose, and instructing \"HUD [to] make every effort to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts before making [enhanced] vouchers available\"). All of this further suggests that the majority's reading of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) is based on an incorrect premise-that it somehow is directed at the landlord-tenant relationship. On the contrary, this history makes clear (as does the statute itself) that the enhanced voucher provision is directed at the relationship between HUD and assisted tenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Next, although the enhanced voucher provision reflects congressional intent to strike a balance between landlords' and tenants' interests, the majority imposes a far different balance. Specifically, nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress ever meant to force owners, like Harvey, to continuously renew enhanced-voucher tenancies, absent good cause to end the lease. Rather, the enhanced voucher program was clearly designed as a\n   <em>\n    market-based solution\n   </em>\n   that would incentivize and encourage owners to continue renewing enhanced-voucher tenancies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   145 Cong. Rec. 22848 (statement of Rep. Rick Lazio, Chairman, H. Subcomm. Hous. and Cmty.) (\"[W]hat we have done with this bill is ...\n   <em>\n    create the right incentive for owners\n   </em>\n   to ensure the continuity of allowing the seniors, the disabled ... to continue to live ... there.\") (emphasis added)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20492964\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   (statement of Rep.

To combat this problem, Congress enacted a solution: compelling HUD to make up the difference between what assisted families could pay and market-rate rents. This solution struck the appropriate balance between tenants' interests and landlords' interests. This balance, however, never included forcing landlords to continuously renew enhanced-voucher tenancies after the leases expired on their own terms. Rather, the balance was that Congress would compel HUD to provide enhanced vouchers to eligible tenants; this, in turn, provided property owners with the proper incentive-market-rate rent-to continue renewing enhanced-voucher tenancies. Of course, if a property owner decided not to renew an enhanced-voucher tenancy, then nothing in the statute could, or would, require him to do so. After all, an incentive is not an edict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Admittedly, much of the foregoing discussion pertains to the earlier version of the enhanced voucher statute. But that context is critical, especially given the complete dearth of information regarding the 2000 amendment. Indeed, the only explanation provided for the insertion of the \"may elect to remain\" language at issue here is that it was added to \"\n   <em>\n    clarify\n   </em>\n   [ ] that assisted families continue to have the right to elect to remain in the same unit of their project if that project is eligible to receive enhanced vouchers.\" H.R. Rep. No. 106-521, 42-43 (2000) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 106-710, at 164 (2000) (Conf. Report) (noting that the amendment was intended to \"clarif[y] the intent\" of the enhanced voucher provision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This reveals another major flaw in the majority's reasoning. Clarify, after all, means \"to make understandable,\" or \"to free of confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Clarify\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clarify (last visited July 25, 2018). Thus, according to the legislative history the majority relies on, the purpose of the 2000 amendment was simply to make the 1999 version \"understandable\"-not\n   to substantively change it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Undoubtedly, the creation of an entirely novel, judicially enforceable \"right to remain,\" which radically alters property rights, is a substantive change. Deriving this right entirely from the 2000 amendment, as the majority does, cannot be correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Indeed, aside from those two reports, the legislative history the Dissent references relates to the 1999 statute, which we concede did not require property owners to renew the leases of enhanced voucher tenants. Thus, those two committee reports appear to form the keystone of the Dissent's contention that the 2000 amendment was intended to merely restate what the 1999 statute already required. In cases like this, however, where the statutory language is unambiguous, we require far more than a single word used in two committee reports before we depart from the general presumption that \"[w]hen Congress amends legislation, ... it intends [the change] to have real and substantial effect.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ross\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597464\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1850/#p1858\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 1858\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (last alteration in original) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p397\">\n     514 U.S. at 397\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p397\">\n     115 S.Ct. 1537\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    We acknowledge that the right to elect to remain is tied, not to the particular unit, but to the \"same\n    <em>\n     project\n    </em>\n    in which the family was residing on the date of the eligibility event.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B) (emphasis added). One would think, then, that at least under certain circumstances, property owners could arrange for an enhanced voucher family to move to another unit in the \"same project\" and still be in compliance with \u00a7 1437f(t)(1)(B). Here, however, Harvey has not expressed a willingness to permit the Hayes family to move into another one of his apartments on Pine Street, so we need not address the question, and for practical purposes of this case, the inquiry is whether Harvey may evict the family from this particular unit without cause. For the reasons we have just provided, we conclude that he may not.

Op. at 42. It not only protects against an early termination following an opt-out, but it also explicitly provides eligible enhanced-voucher tenants with a guarantee that HUD will provide them with an enhanced voucher. The majority finds my reading \"implausible\" because the 1999 version of the statute contained a similar provision. But in its single-minded quest to give the 2000 amendment \"independent meaning,\" the majority ignores everything else-the plain language of the text, the context in which the language is used, the broader context of the overall statute, and the fact that Congress does not alter fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms. Indeed, had Congress meant to radically alter property rights in the way my colleagues do today, it would have done so clearly.
