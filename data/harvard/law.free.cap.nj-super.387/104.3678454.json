We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">These are the pertinent facts regarding Quest\u2019s use of the vacutainers, derived from the agreed or undisputed facts available to the Tax Court on the Division\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Quest, which describes itself as the largest diagnostic testing laboratory in the country, performs laboratory testing of human blood, urine, and other bodily specimens when prescribed by physicians. The majority of the collected specimens are blood, and the most common testing is for such information as glucose and cholesterol levels and blood counts. These are examples only, and not a complete description of the tests Quest performs.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">The vacutainers are test tubes that are sealed by the manufacturer with a vacuum inside. In order to draw blood, a trained medical professional inserts a needle into a patient\u2019s vein and then punctures the top of the vaeutainer\u2019s rubber top with the opposite end of the needle. The puncture breaks the vacuum seal, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>outside air pressure causes suction, which draws blood from the vein through the needle and into the vacutainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Each vacutainer contains a chemical essential to the preservation or preparation of the sample for testing. The vacutainers are of two varieties and are distinguished by different colored tops. The lavender-topped vacutainers contain EDTA, an anti-coagulant that preserves the blood specimen in its original, whole form until it can be transported to the laboratory and tested. The blacktopped vacutainers contain a clot activator for the separation of blood elements for testing. The vacutainers are never reused; they are treated as bio-hazardous waste and destroyed after the specimens are tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">As is common in the industry, Quest provides vacutainers without charge to physicians who collect the samples and prescribe such testing. Quest supplies a \u201ccourier\u201d box from which it collects such samples as requested. Quest also maintains centers for those patients whose physicians do not collect the samples in their offices. In either case, the cost of the vacutainer is passed through to the patient or third-party insurance payor as part of the test fee. Quest also tests specimens that have been collected in vacutainers supplied to physicians by a competitor laboratory, and Quest\u2019s competitors also test specimens that have been collected in Quest\u2019s vacutainers.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In the matter before us, Quest paid sales tax on its purchase of vacutainers from Becton-Diekinson during the period from April 1, 1996 through December 81, 2000. In the course of an internal audit, Quest\u2019s auditor advised the company that certain of the supplies upon which it had paid sales tax, including the vacutain-ers, should have been exempt from taxation. As a result, Quest filed a request with the Division for refund of $2,107,197. When the Division undertook its own audit, it determined that Quest owed an additional $984,325.56 in sales and use tax due on other items for the same period. An agreement was reached to offset the additional tax due, against the claimed refund, leaving Quest\u2019s refund request to be addressed to the extent of the balance that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>arose out of tax paid on vacutainers. Thus the only issue before us is the taxability of Quest\u2019s purchase or use of vacutainers.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">We are concerned with two sections of the Sales and Use Tax Act, specifically, <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:32B-3, which imposes the tax, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.15, which provides the exemption claimed by Quest. Prior to its recent amendment increasing the tax to 7%,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3(a) provided, in relevant part, \u201cThere is imposed and there shall be paid a tax of 6% upon [t]he receipts from every retail sale of tangible personal property, except as otherwise provided in this act.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:32B-6 provides for a compensating \u201cuse tax\u201d upon the purchase price of tangible personal property subject to the sales tax, when no such tax was collected by the seller.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The exemption which Quest invokes to qualify its purchase and use of vacutainers is defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:32B-8.15, which provides, in pertinent part, <em>\u201cSales or use </em>of wrapping paper, wrapping twine, bags, cartons, tape, rope, labels, <em>nonretumable containers, </em>reusable milk containers, and <em>all other wrapping supplies when such use is incidental to the delivery of any personal property ... </em>are exempt from the tax imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Act.\u201d (Emphasis added). Quest maintains that the vacutainers qualify either as \u201cnonreturnable containers,\u201d on the ground that they cannot be reused, or as \u201cother wrapping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>supplies,\u201d on the ground that they envelope the blood and secure it for transport.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The Division relies upon Quest\u2019s distribution of vacutainers without charge to physicians, who \u201ccould return the vacutainers unused or could use them to transmit blood or other specimens to Quest for testing, but were not required to do so,\u201d and maintains that \u201cQuest thus \u2018used\u2019 this tangible personal property as an inducement to employ its testing services, [rendering] the vacu-tainers ... taxable ____\u201d The Division cites the principle that \u201ctax exemptions are narrowly construed, reflecting the legislative intent of the \u2018inclusive\u2019 taxability of the Act.\u201d The Division notes that \u201cbecause Quest performed non-taxable services for its customers,\u201d an exemption would \u201cresult in an incorrect loss of tax revenue____\u201d In sum, the Division relies upon \u201cQuest\u2019s business, the plain language of the Act, relevant case law and even common sense\u201d to conclude that the vacutainers were \u201ca taxable cost of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The scope of review of the Division\u2019s decision, both in the Tax Court and before us, is limited. As the Supreme Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">We have recognized that the Director\u2019s expertise, particularly when exercised in the specialized and complex area covered by these provisions of the Act, is entitled to great respect by the courts. Moreover, the agency\u2019s interpretation of the operative law is entitled to prevail, so long as it is not plainly unreasonable. <em>[Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 327, 478 A.2d 742 (1984) (internal citations omitted).!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-11\"><em>See also GE Solid State, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>298, 306, 625 A.2d 468 (1993) (\u201cGenerally, courts accord substantial deference to the interpretation an agency gives to a statute that the agency is charged with enforcing.\u201d); <em>Aetna Burglar &amp; Fire Alarm Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>16 <em>N.J.Tax </em>584, 589 (1997) (\u201c[T]he Director\u2019s construction of the operative law, which is not plainly unreasonable and with which the Legislature has not interfered, is entitled to prevail.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">The Court has repeatedly noted that \u201ctax exemptions are to be strictly construed against the claimant.\u201d <em>GE Solid State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 306, 625 A.2d 468 (citing <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 326, 478 A.2d 742); <em>see also Metpath, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>147, 152, 474 A.2d 1065 (1984) (\u201c[W]e are mindful of the general principle that tax exemptions are to be construed narrowly.\u201d). Moreover, it is the taxpayer claiming an exemption who bears the burden of proving its applicability. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 474 A.2d 1065. \u201c[A]ll doubts which arise are to be resolved against the party seeking the exemption.\u201d <em>Millington Quarry, Inc. v. Taxation Div. Dir., </em>5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>144, 147 (1983); see <em>also Adamar of N.J. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>17 <em>N.J.Tax </em>80, 85 (1997) (when the taxpayer seeks an exemption, \u201cthe probable legislative intent is one of inclusion and exemptions are to be construed narrowly\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>18 <em>N.J. Tax </em>70 (App.Div.1999); <em>Global Terminal &amp; Container Servs., Inc. v. N.J. Div. of Taxation, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>152, 158 (1987) (\u201c[Exemption statutes must be strictly construed, and the burden is on the taxpayer to establish entitlement to exemption.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The Tax Court went through a somewhat more complex analysis of the words of the exemption statute than necessary to conclude that the vacutainers were neither \u201cnonreturnable containers\u201d nor \u201cother wrapping supplies.\u201d We need not adopt the court\u2019s analysis in full to conclude that the result was correct and the decision must be affirmed. Irrespective of their name, these test tubes constitute medical equipment essential to the process of drawing blood, as Quest itself has carefully explained. They contain a chemical additive essential to the proper preservation and preparation of the blood samples. Yes, they also serve the function of a \u201ccontainer\u201d in which the samples are transported to the laboratory, but they are \u201creturnable\u201d containers, although they are not reusable once punctured or filled with blood. Clearly, however, they are an essential part of the operation and function of Quest\u2019s laboratory business, and common sense dictates that they are neither \u201ccontainers\u201d nor \u201cwrapping materials\u201d as contemplated by the exemption statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>It has been said, in connection with statutory interpretation, that a literal reading of the words of the statute may not yield the Legislature\u2019s intended result. <em>See Smith v. Fireworks by Girone, Inc., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>199, 216, 850 A.2d 456 (2004) (\u201c[I]t is well settled that statutory construction should not turn on literalisms, but on the objectives of the legislation and the common sense of the situation.\u201d). Writing for the Court in <em>Fireworks by Girone, </em>Justice Long quoted Chief Justice Weintraub\u2019s words on statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">It is frequently difficult for a draftsman of legislation to anticipate all situations and to measure his words against them. Hence cases inevitably arise in which a literal application of the language used would lead to results incompatible with the legislative design. It is the proper function, indeed the obligation, of the judiciary to give effect to the obvious purpose of the Legislature, and to that end words used may be expanded or limited according to the manifest reason and obvious purpose of the law. The spirit of the legislative direction prevails over the literal sense of the terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>New Capitol Bar &amp; Grill Corp. v. Div. of Employment Sec., 25 N.J. </em>155, 160, 135 A.2d 465 (1957)) (internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Moreover, the various arguments of the parties, as well as the trial court\u2019s analysis, in attempts to interpret the literal words of the statute, demonstrate the inherent ambiguities in the exemption statute as applied to these facts. To the extent that the statute is ambiguous, we adhere to the principle of narrow construction. <em>See, e.g., GE Solid State, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 306, 625 A.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-6\"> <em>See </em>Assembly, No. 4901 (amending and supplementing <em>L. </em>1966, <em>c. </em>30, effective July 15, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3(b) provides a similar tax on receipts for certain services.
