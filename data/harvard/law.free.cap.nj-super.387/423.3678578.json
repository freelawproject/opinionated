The Council ruled that petitioner \u201cwas not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u2018prevailing party\u2019 and ... not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to OPEA.\u201d We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The matter began with petitioner\u2019s complaint filed with the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) against an adoption agency for having falsely advertised that it was licensed in New Jersey.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> DYFS eventually determined that the adoption agency had violated the rules of its Bureau of Licensing (Bureau), and it reported the results of its investigation to petitioner in a letter dated October 11, 2000. In the meantime, petitioner had requested a copy of the investigatory report. After repeatedly responding that the report had not been completed but would be soon, DYFS eventually declined to release it. Petitioner filed two \u201cDenial of Access\u201d complaints with the Council, on July 29 and August 8, 2002, alleging separate requests to DYFS for the records on July 8 and July 29, 2002, and denials on July 17 and August 8, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The first complaint, filed pro se, described the record requested as \u201cDocuments from DYFS Bureau of Licensing file on the [adoption agency involved].\u201d That complaint described the \u201c[r]e-sponse to [the] request\u201d as \u201csaying that I would not receive documents until August 16. I was not given the reason for the delay. This is too long of a delay and as such I consider it to be a denial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The second complaint, also filed pro se, described the record requested as \u201cDYFS Bureau of Licensing investigation report first requested in a letter dated October 27, 2000.\u201d That complaint described the \u201c[r]esponse to [that] request\u201d as follows: \u201cThe records custodian has not responded to my request within the required 7 business days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>During the period, according to petitioner, on September 1, 2000, the Bureau had licensed the adoption agency involved and had issued certificates to it in March and September of 2001, and again in March, June and July of 2002. On August 5, 2002, the Bureau issued a Notice of Revocation of Certificate of Approval following a newspaper report entitled \u201cFrom \u2018Perverted\u2019 Web Sites To Child Adoption.\u201d On August 14, 2002, DYFS provided petitioner with what it represented as the entire file pertaining to the particular adoption agency, 496 pages of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Subsequently, in a supplement to her denial-of-aceess complaints, petitioner, on October 16, 2002, through an attorney, asserted that portions of the file, including chronological lists, had been omitted with no expressed justification. In a formal response dated November 6, 2002, DYFS\u2019s custodian of records stated that none of the documents described existed. Nevertheless, on December 11, 2002, DYFS produced a fourteen-page chronological list and some other missing documents. The additional disclosure fell short of full compliance with petitioner\u2019s requests, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On February 5 and 6, 2003, the Council\u2019s Executive Director made preliminary findings and recommendations regarding the two complaints. He determined that DYFS had failed to meet OPRA\u2019s requirements and that the records petitioner requested should be provided to her immediately subject to appropriate redaction in order to effect any expressed OPRA exception. He also concluded that petitioner \u201cis a prevailing party, entitled to reasonable counsel fees.\u201d He reserved decision on the extent to which, if any, a \u201ccustodian penalty\u201d should be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">On February 13, 2003, the Council issued its interim decisions on both complaints, effective February 28, 2003. It \u201c[d]eferred until [its] next meeting a decision on the issue of \u2018prevailing party\u2019 status and the custodian penalty in this case____[and][o]rdered the custodian to provide comment\u201d on some of the issues raised, to provide petitioner access to certain of the records sought, or to justify claims that they did not exist. In a letter response dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>February 28, 2003, DYFS maintained that custodian penalties were not warranted and that petitioner was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the Act. DYFS requested an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On September 11, 2003, the Council referred petitioner\u2019s OPRA complaints to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for a contested-case hearing, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-9, 10, on five specified questions, because, according to the Executive Director, \u201cthe Council was unable to make a determination as to access and other issues based on the Complainant and Custodian\u2019s responses.\u201d The Council, however, reserved to itself the determination whether petitioner \u201cis a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d The questions to be determined in the contested-case hearing were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">1. What records were provided in response to the request?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">2. What records were not provided and whether these records were properly withheld?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">3. Whether access to any portion of the OPRA request was not provided within the statutory time period and whether any delay in providing access was justified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">4. Whether a \u201cknowing and willful\u201d violation of OPRA occurred under the totality of the circumstances pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-11?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">5. Identify all records or portions thereof that OAL awarded access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">On January 29, 2005, according to the Executive Director, \u201c[t]he parties reached a \u2018Partial Settlement Agreement\u2019 through the OAL[ ]\u201d that stipulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">1. there is no admission by DYFS of wrongdoing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">2. there [are] no findings of fact/or findings of fault by OAL;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-15\">3. all documents sought in the above requests were provided to the Complainant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-16\">4. there are no remaining issues regarding access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-17\">o. the Agreement does not resolve the issue of \u201cprevailing party\u201d pursuant to OPRA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-18\">Petitioner\u2019s attorney separately acknowledged the parties\u2019 understanding that the Council was to determine the \u201cattorney\u2019s fees issue.\u201d The settlement agreement specifically provided for further litigation of the issue, and recited: \u201cThis agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The matter then returned to the Council. The Executive Director reported his findings and recommendations on May 6, 2005. He framed the remaining issue as follows: \u201cWhether [petitioner] is a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6 and 47:1A-7(f) as a result of the settlement agreement reached by the parties concerning access?\u201d He \u201creeommend[ed] that the Council dismiss [the] case on the basis that [petitioner] was not a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 and [her] Counsel is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to OPRA.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the Executive Director referred to another case decided by the Council in which it had denied attorney\u2019s fees under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6 and -7f after invoking the holding of <em>Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>598, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). The Executive Director stated that \u201cno one \u2018prevailed\u2019 by reason of the ALJ\u2019s decision or judgment\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnE\">there was no \u201cenforceable judgment on the merits\u201d determined or \u201cdecided\u201d by the Administrative Law Judge. OAL procedure requires that the \u201csettlement\u201d become the decision, however, the ALJ did not make any determination in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In a May 12, 2005 final decision, the Council adopted \u201cthe entirety of [the Executive Director\u2019s] findings and recommendations\u201d and \u201cdismissed the case on the basis that [petitioner] was not a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 and [her] Counsel is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to OPRA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Although we are enjoined to accord respect to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it is assigned to administer, <em>see Matturri v. Board of Trustees, Judicial Retirement System, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>368, 381, 802 A.2d 496 (2002); <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 575, 384 A.2d 795 (1978), we are not bound by an agency\u2019s interpretation of law, <em>see SSI Medical Services, Inc. v. Department of Human Services, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>614, 620-21, 685 A.2d 1 (1996); <em>Mayflower Securities Co. v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973), any more than we are bound by the legal rulings of lower courts, <em>see Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Township Committee of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>An interpretation of federal legislation by the United States Supreme Court is not binding upon a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own statutes. <em>See In re Application of White, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>449, 453-54, 114 A.2d 261 (1955); <em>see also Shepherd v. Hunterdon Developmental Ctr., </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>1, 20-21, 803 A.2d 611 (2002); <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 333, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995); <em>Grigoletti v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>89, 107, 570 A.2d 903 (1990). Of course, we are obliged to accord respect to the considered views of the federal courts, as we are to the courts of sister states, but in interpreting New Jersey law, we must give the greatest sway to our Legislature\u2019s intendments as they are illuminated by the language of the statute at issue, the public policies underpinning the statute, and such State law precedents as are available. <em>See Alderiso v. Medical Ctr. of Ocean County, Inc., </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>191, 201-02, 770 A.2d 275 (2001); <em>Lesniak v. Budzash, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 626 A.2d 1073 (1993); <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 436-37, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992). Naturally, a State agency is bound to follow the same approach. <em>Cf. ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In <em>Baer v. Klagholz, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 786 A.2d 907 (App.Div. 2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>193, 803 A.2d 1165 (2002), we recognized the binding nature of <em>Buckhannon\u2019s </em>approaches where the counsel fee provisions of federal statute were at issue. We determined, however, that the claimants met the test for being a \u201c \u2018prevailing party\u2019 because they prevailed in their attack upon eight of the sixty regulations they challenged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81-82, 786 A.2d 907. <em>See also P.N. v. Clementon Bd. of Ed., </em>442 F.3d 848 (3d Cir.2006)(determining that federal law requirements for classifying the claimant as a prevailing party had been met); <em>but see John T. v. Delaware County Intermediate Unit, </em>318 <em>F.</em>3d 545, 558 (3d Cir.2003)(denying prevailing party status after analyzing all pertinent factors). In <em>Baer, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 83, 786 A.2d 907, we noted that <em>Buckhannon </em>had rejected the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d as a basis for an award of counsel fees under the two federal statutes there involved. <em>See Buckhannon, supra, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>at 610, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1843, 149 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 866-67. We stated, nevertheless, that \u201c[w]e [did] not read <em>Buckhannon </em>as changing the criteria for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>award which can be made when the claimant is partially successful.\u201d <em>Baer, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 83, 786 A.2d 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Here, we are called upon to determine whether petitioner can be deemed a prevailing party purely as a matter of State law. We must determine, under State law, if a settlement during litigation is any different from a judgment for the purpose of determining whether the claimant has prevailed. In approaching the question, it may be useful to consider how the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d applies in this State notwithstanding its rejection in <em>Buckhannon, </em>i.e., whether that concept has independent provenance under New Jersey law.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for five members of the Court in <em>Buckhannon, supra, </em>defined the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d as \u201cposit[ing] that a plaintiff is a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d 532 <em>U.S. </em>at 601, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1838, 149 L.Ed.2d at 861. The Court went on to note that \u201cmost Courts of Appeals recognize the \u2018catalyst theory,\u2019 \u201d although, in the case at hand, it had been rejected by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 601-02, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1838-39, 149 L.Ed.2d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The \u201cprevailing party\u201d rubric, so central to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckhannon, supra, </em>is a term found in \u201c[njumerous federal statutes,\u201d 532 <em>U.S. </em>at 600, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1838, 149 L.Ed.2d at 860, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA) and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA) at issue there. The pertinent clause of the FHAA provides that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 3613(c)(2). The ADA provision is identical except that it adds \u201cincluding litigation expenses\u201d to the factors that may be reflected in an award. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 12205.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The New Jersey statutes have a different tone and flavor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6 and 47:1A-7f each provide: \u201cA requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d The difference in language suggests a difference in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The majority opinion in <em>Buckhannon </em>stated that the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d is flawed as a rule of entitlement because \u201c[i]t allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Buckhannon, supra, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>at 605, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1840, 149 L.Ed.2d at 863. \u201cOur precedents ... counsel against holding that the term \u2018prevailing party\u2019 authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees <em>without a </em>corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This view of federal precedent has no direct bearing upon the meaning of our State statutes, especially to the extent the federal rule embodies a sense that settlements, or even the results of proceedings before administrative agencies, are not reliable measures of success. <em>See, e.g., John T., supra, </em>318 F.3d at 560-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Both the language of our statutes and the terms of court decisions in this State dealing with the issue of counsel fee entitlements support a more indulgent view of petitioner\u2019s claim for an attorney\u2019s fee award than was allowed by the majority in <em>Buckhannon, supra, </em>based, in major part, upon \u201cthe clear legislative language\u201d of the federal statutes. 532 <em>U.S. </em>at 610, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1843, 149 L.Ed.2d at 866-67. Among other considerations, the reference in our statutes to a claimant who prevails \u201cin any proceeding\u201d and the use of the mandatory \u201cshall be entitled\u201d suggest the existence of different normative standards under State law than exist under federal law. Even a cursory reference to the history of approaches to counsel fee entitlements under State law demonstrates a difference in policy orientation that calls for a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In <em>Packard-Bamberger &amp; Co. v. Collier, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>427, 771 A.2d 1194 (2001), for example, the Supreme Court of New Jersey articulated a two-part test for determining, for fee-shifting purposes, whether a party had prevailed in a legal malpractice case. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">The first prong requires that the litigant seeking fees establish that the \u201c \u2018lawsuit was causally related to securing the relief obtained; a fee award is justified if [the party\u2019s] efforts are a \u201cnecessary and important\u201d factor in obtaining the relief.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>* s * That prong requires the party seeking fees to demonstrate a factual nexus between the pleading and the relief ultimately recovered. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">The second prong involves a factual and legal determination, requiring the party seeking fees to prove that \u201c \u2018the relief granted has some basis in law.\u2019 \u201d * * * The party seeking fees need not obtain all relief sought, but there must be a resolution of some dispute that affected the defendant\u2019s behavior towards the prevailing plaintiff. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 444, 771 A.2d 1194 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Both of these criteria, which can be seen as invoking the \u201ccatalyst theory,\u201d have been satisfied in the case at hand. Petitioner engaged in reasonable efforts to pursue her access rights to the records in question. She sought attorney assistance only after her self-filed complaints and personal efforts were unavailing. With that assistance, she achieved a favorable result that reflected an alteration of position and behavior on the Division\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\"><em>Warrington v. Village Supermarket, Inc., </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 746 A.2d 61 (App.Div.2000), predated <em>Buckhannon. </em>It involved two State statutes, the Handicapped Access Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:32-4 to -10, and the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42, as well as the federal ADA, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12101 to 12213. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">A plaintiff is considered a prevailing party \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of [the] claim materially alters the relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 420, 746 A.2d 61 (quoting <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>103, 111-12, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>566, 573, 121 <em>L.Ed2d </em>494, 503 (1992)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Whether the resolution of the matter involved a judicial decree, a quasi-judicial determination, or a settlement was not a factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">The sources of the tests in <em>Packard-Bamberger </em>and Warrington were both decisional and statutory, with textual roots very different from those informing <em>Buckhannon. See also Tarr v. Ciasulli </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>70, 86-87, 853 A.2d 921 (2004)(\u201c[A] plaintiff who is awarded some affirmative relief by way of an enforceable judgment ... or other comparable relief through a settlement or consent decree is a prevailing party under ... the LAD.\u201d). In addition to the differing textual bases found in State law, we are mindful of the strong public policy of this State favoring settlements. <em>See Nolan v. Lee Ho, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>465, 472, 577 A.2d 143 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>(1990)(quoting <em>Jannarone v. W.T. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 476, 168 A.2d 72 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>61, 171 A.2d 147 (1961)); <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank and Trust Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>17, 35, 134 A.2d 761 (1957). A result that places a claimant in a distinctly worse position economically if she settles than she would be by carrying the matter to a successful litigation conclusion disserves that policy. <em>See Buckhannon, supra, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>at 639, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1859, 149 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 885 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In their \u201cpartial settlement agreement,\u201d the parties here had agreed \u201cthat all documents sought by [petitioner] ... on July 8, 2002 and July 29, 2002, respectively[,] have been produced by the Division.\u201d That settlement result had clearly been achieved as a consequence of the litigation. The parties also agreed that petitioner would \u201cno longer pursue sanctions and/or penalties under OPEA against the Division, or any of its employees or agents[ ] for knowing and willful violation(s) of OPRA\u201d with respect to those requests, and that a \u201cletter of apology\u201d that had been issued to petitioner by the chief of the Bureau would \u201cserve as resolution of any claim of sanction and/or penalty against the Division, its employees or agents, with respect to these matters.\u201d Despite the additional stipulation that \u201c[t]his Agreement does not constitute an admission by the Division that any of the actions taken in response to [petitioner\u2019s] OPRA requests constituted knowing and willful violations of OPRA[,]\u201d it seems obvious that this very proceeding \u201cmodified] [DYFS\u2019s] behavior in a way that directly benefited [petitioner].\u201d <em>Warrington, supra, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 420, 746 A.2d 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">It is also clear that the repeal of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-4, shortly after <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6 and -7 were adopted, was a renunciation of a narrower attorney\u2019s fees rule (i.e., embodying a prerequisite for a court order requiring disclosure, a limitation to $500, and a discretionary authority in the trial court), in favor of the broader, mandatory standard of entitlement based on the sole test of \u201cprevail[ing] in any proceeding,\u201d and subject to a rule of reasonableness with no expressed monetary limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Applying the language of our current statutes in the light of this State\u2019s public policies regarding fee-shifting as articulated in case law, we hold that, under the laws of New Jersey, petitioner was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to an award of a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6, -7f. We are constrained to observe that, according to the analysis employed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>P.N., supra, </em>442 F.3d 848, even under federal standards applied since <em>Buckhannon, </em>given all the facts and considering all procedural events that transpired, petitioner would likely have been deemed a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d She \u201creceived all that [she] sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856. She \u201cachieved success on significant issues[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857. <em>See also North Bergen Rex Transp., Inc. v.
