On June 28, 2006, the Court held that a violation of the Convention does not warrant the suppression of a statement taken from a foreign national which would be otherwise admissible in our courts of law. <em>See Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, </em>--- U.S. ---, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 165 L.Ed.2d 557 (2006). Foreign nationals accused of crimes receive the protections accorded by the law of this state including that required by the federal constitution. To the extent state courts may apply their own rules of law, the Convention, which provides only for notification to the foreign national of his right to consular notification of his detention, arrest, or imprisonment, presents no basis for either requiring the suppression of evidence for noncompliance, development of independent rules of law, or departure from the law as it now stands in New Jersey with respect to all accused offenders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. King, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 241-42, 858 A.2d 4 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>266, 883 A.2d 1062 (2005); <em>State v.

However, as the Supreme Court made clear \u201c[a] defendant can raise an Article 36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the voluntariness of his statements to police.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra, </em>--- U.S. ---, ---, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2669, 2682, 165 L.Ed.2d 557, ---(2006). In this case, the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office notified the Mexican <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Consulate of defendant\u2019s arrest on July 28, 2000 as the Convention requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The essential evidence at trial<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> revealed the following: In July 2000, defendant was an eighteen and one-half year old citizen of Mexico in the United States and living in Passaic illegally. He could not read, write, or understand the English language; however, he could read, write, and understand the Spanish language. His highest level of education was the sixth grade, which he had completed in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Approximately two buildings away from where defendant resided with his uncle, cousins and others including Rosalva Gonzalez, lived Bernarda M. and Felicito R. and their four-month old daughter, L.R. Several others were also residing in their home, including Bernarda\u2019s son Hippolito,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sage seventeen. Rosalva sometimes babysat for L.R. while Bernarda and Felicito were at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">On the evening of July 23, 2000, at approximately 10:00 p.m., Bernarda bathed L.R. She did not notice anything unusual with L.R. at that time; nor did she notice anything unusual with L.R. when she left for work at approximately 6:30 a.m. on July 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Felicito woke up shortly after Bernarda left for work on July 24. He changed L.R.\u2019s diaper, and did not notice anything out of the ordinary at that time. At approximately 7:00 a.m., Felicito dropped L.R. off at Rosalva\u2019s home, where defendant also resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Rose Barrera, who resided in the apartment above defendant\u2019s, stated that between 11:00 a.m. and noon on July 24, 2000, she heard a baby crying loudly for approximately twenty minutes. The sound came from the downstairs apartment. Based upon her experience as the mother of five children, Barrera believed the cries came from a baby who was younger than one year old. However, Barrera was not aware that any babies under the age of one lived in the building at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">L.R. was picked up from the babysitter\u2019s home on the afternoon of July 24. When they arrived home, Bernarda checked the baby\u2019s diaper and discovered blood and an injury to L.R.\u2019s vaginal area. After Felicito arrived home from work, Bernarda showed him L.R.\u2019s injury and the two took her to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The hospital notes reflect that L.R. arrived at approximately 6:00 p.m. According to Dr. Kirnan Mariwalla, the emergency room doctor at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, L.R. had suffered bruising and a laceration with bleeding, which extended the entire length of her perineum, from her vagina to her anus. The wound appeared \u201cfresh,\u201d and the doctor estimated that it had been inflicted \u201cwithin the past six to [ten] hours.\u201d The doctor decided to have L.R. transported to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, which had the pediatric surgical facilities necessary to perform a full examination and treatment of L.R.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The Division of Youth and Family Services (\u201cDYFS\u201d) and the police were notified of L.R.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Investigator James Arnold, who was employed in the Child Abuse Unit of the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, was assigned to the case at approximately 7:30 p.m. on July 24. Arnold coordinated with the Passaic Police Department and met Detective Milton Figueroa, a Spanish-speaking officer, at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Paterson. Arnold took photographs of L.R.\u2019s injuries, and the two officers interviewed Bernarda, with Detective Figueroa acting as interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Based upon information obtained from Bernarda, Investigators Arnold and Figueroa proceeded to the babysitter\u2019s home, arriving there after 10:30 p.m. They advised Rosalva about the subject of their investigation, and she agreed to be interviewed. She was then transported to the Passaic Police Station where she waived her <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Later the next morning, at 10:00 a.m. on July 25, 2000, Investigator Arnold returned to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital with Investigator Hector Jiminez, a Spanish-speaking officer employed in the Child Abuse Unit of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Investigator Jiminez took additional photographs of L.R. while Investigator Arnold spoke with Bernarda (with the translation assistance of a Spanish-speaking nurse). The two Investigators then spoke with L.R.\u2019s physician, Dr. Albert Sanz.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Dr. Sanz testified that L.R. had suffered a deep laceration, which extended the entire length of her perineum, from the external genital area to the anal area. She had also suffered \u201can obvious tear of the hymen,\u201d an internal structure/membrane located at the opening of the vagina. The injury was still oozing blood, so Dr. Sanz believed it had been caused only a short time before.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Dr. Sanz opined that L.R. had suffered a \u201csevere, deep penetrating injury,\u201d with some object having been forced into the area. As to this issue, Dr. Sanz noted that the damage to L.R.\u2019s hymen was indicative of penetration because the hymen is generally protected by the surrounding tissue. Surgery would be required to determine the extent of any internal damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">An internal, surgical examination later revealed no injury to L.R.\u2019s vaginal inside walls. However, given the injury to L.R.\u2019s hymen, this finding did not alter Dr. Sanz\u2019s opinion that L.R. had suffered a penetrating injury. Sixty-five stitches were required to repair the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Dr. Sanz continued to see L.R. for several follow-up examinations after his initial examination. He noted that, over the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of several months, between July and October 2000, the injury to L.R.\u2019s hymen did not completely heal.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Based upon the information provided by Dr. Sanz, the Investigators suspected that a male individual had caused L.R.\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, they began to interview males who had access to the child. They asked Bernarda to identify the male members of her household, and she executed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form with respect to her juvenile son, Hippolito.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The investigators went to L.R.\u2019s home, where they spoke with Hippolito and Felicito, both of whom agreed to be interviewed. They were taken to the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s office where they were placed in separate interview rooms and advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights. They waived their rights and gave formal statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Thereafter, Bernarda gave a formal statement. Subsequently, the investigators began interviewing and taking statements from the male members of Rosalva\u2019s household. Defendant\u2019s uncle, Santiago Patino, Sr., was first to be formally interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Investigator Jiminez then spoke to Santiago Patino, Jr. and defendant, and both men agreed to be interviewed. They were taken to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office at approximately 12:00 a.m. on July 26. Neither man was restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">At the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the men were placed in separate interview rooms and advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish. After both men had been <em>Mirandized, </em>Santiago Junior was interviewed first, followed by defendant. Thereafter, formal statements were taken from the two men separately, with Santiago Junior\u2019s statement taken first. Santiago\u2019s formal statement commenced at 3:00 a.m. and was completed at 3:37 a.m. The statement was reviewed with him and he was allowed to make corrections before he signed the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at 1:00 a.m. Defendant was provided with a <em>Miranda </em>form written in Spanish, which was read aloud with Investigator Jiminez. Defendant ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tialed the <em>Miranda </em>form after each of the enumerated rights, and he signed the bottom of the form, once to indicate that he understood his rights, and a second time to indicate that he voluntarily chose to waive his rights. Defendant was not handcuffed, and no weapons were present in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Defendant was interviewed, and he gave a formal statement to the investigators between 4:00 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. Defendant denied any knowledge as to how L.R. had been injured. After the statement was taken, it was reviewed with defendant, he initialed the changes that were made, and he executed the statement under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">After defendant and Santiago Junior had given their statements, the investigators drove them home. There, the police asked Carlos Patino, Rosalva\u2019s husband, if he was willing to be interviewed. He agreed to be interviewed, and the investigators transported him to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. At the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the investigators advised Carlos of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, in Spanish, interviewed him, and took a formal statement from him. His statement was taken between 6:00 a.m. and 6:20 a.m. After the interview, the investigators drove Carlos home.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">At 9:00 a.m. on July 26, 2000, Investigators Arnold and Jimi-nez met with other members of the Child Abuse Unit. Suspicion focused on four men: Felicito (the father), Santiago Senior, Santiago Junior, and defendant (members of the babysitter\u2019s household). Defendant in particular was suspected due to his nervousness when confronted at his home. Defendant avoided eye contact, looked around at the ground, and his hands were sweaty. The other individuals interviewed had not exhibited such nervous behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The investigators decided to re-interview the suspected individuals. Later that day, the investigators asked the four men to come in for additional questioning. The men agreed to be re-interviewed, and they were transported to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Rosalva also agreed to be re-interviewed on the night of July 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>From the late afternoon of July 26, to the early morning hours of July 27, a team of investigators conducted interviews of the four male suspects and Rosalva. With respect to all interviews, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were again given prior to the questioning. During the hours the suspects spent at the Prosecutor\u2019s Office on July 26 and 27, they were provided with pizza, drinks and escorted access to the restrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Defendant arrived at the Prosecutor\u2019s Office at approximately 4:00 p.m. on July 26. He remained at the office for at least ten hours, until the early morning hours of July 27, when he confessed to sexually assaulting L.R. The other members of the babysitter\u2019s household, Rosalva, Santiago Senior, and Santiago Junior, remained at the Prosecutor\u2019s Office during the same period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">During his time at the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, defendant was seated in a room which contained a long table, a bench with a handcuff, and several chairs. Defendant was not restrained, and he never asked to leave or stated that he wanted to leave. He never asked for an attorney, and never stated that he did not understand what was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">At 6:19 p.m. on July 26, before he was re-interviewed, defendant was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish. Defendant executed the form, which was written in English and translated into Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Thereafter, between 6:19 and 8:56 p.m., defendant was interviewed by Investigator Beatrice, with Investigator Resto acting as interpreter. During the early part of the interview, Beatrice obtained background information from defendant. Defendant stated that he had come to the United States from M\u00e9xico in April 1999, and he had lived temporarily with his brother in Los Angeles before coming to live with his uncle and cousins in Passaic, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Beatrice explained to defendant that he was being questioned in relation to the sexual assault of a four-month-old girl. During this part of the interview, defendant appeared sad; his head was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lowered, his shoulders were hunched, and his voice was low. He stated that only a crazy person or a \u201cmonster\u201d would do such a thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Investigator Beatrice asked defendant if his parents were aware of the allegations, and how they would feel if they were to find out. At this point, defendant\u2019s arms and legs were crossed, his head was down, and his voice was low. He responded that his parents would think \u201che was involved, that he did it.\u201d Beatrice asked defendant why his parents would believe that, and defendant did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Investigator Beatrice asked defendant to look at pictures of L.R. and her injuries. Investigators Beatrice and Resto then left the interview room and observed defendant from a monitoring room. They observed defendant push away a picture of L.R.\u2019s face. At that point, the investigators reentered the room and Beatrice asked defendant why he had pushed away the facial shot. Defendant responded that the picture made him sad, and Beatrice instructed defendant to look at all the pictures and \u201crealize what he was responsible for.\u201d The investigators then left the room for a second time and continued to observe defendant from the monitoring room. Defendant sat at the table with his head bowed over the pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Investigator Beatrice decided to have Santiago Junior speak with defendant. Investigators Beatrice and Jiminez brought Santiago Junior into defendant\u2019s interview room and Jiminez translated the conversation between Santiago Junior and defendant, which was conducted in Spanish.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Santiago Junior was talking, defendant \u201cjust emotionally collapsed\u201d and assumed a \u201cdefeated\u201d posture. He sagged in his chair and lowered his head and shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Thereafter, defendant was left in the interview room alone while Investigator Beatrice observed Investigators Heath and Urena take a formal statement from Santiago Junior. Defendant was given pizza and a soda in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">After Santiago Junior\u2019s statement was taken, Beatrice re-interviewed defendant, using Investigator Urena as a translator. Beatrice showed defendant the pictures of L.R. again, and he told defendant he \u201cdidn\u2019t believe that he didn\u2019t know anything about this\u201d and stated his belief that defendant was \u201cresponsible for this.\u201d Beatrice asked again why defendant\u2019s parents would believe that defendant was responsible, and defendant did not respond.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Showing defendant the pictures, Beatrice asked defendant how he could have caused the injuries, and how the injuries made him feel. Defendant appeared defeated and sad, and his eyes welled up with tears. Defendant responded that the pictures made him feel sad, and he crossed his legs and arms and lowered his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In Beatrice\u2019s opinion, defendant was using his physical movements to \u201cblock[] his emotions,\u201d so Beatrice \u201cseparated\u201d and \u201cuncross[edj\u201d defendant\u2019s legs and \u201ctook his arms down,\u201d and \u201cheld\u201d defendant\u2019s hands. As Beatrice did so, defendant leaned his head into Beatrice\u2019s chin and began to cry. Investigator Beatrice told defendant he needed to be truthful and stated that he did not view defendant as a crazy person or a \u201cmonster.\u201d He asked defendant whether he was a \u201cmonster\u201d or just a person who had used poor judgment, and defendant responded that he had used poor judgment. Defendant stated that he was sorry, and he thanked Beatrice \u201cfor not thinking [of] him as a monster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Defendant then explained his version of events. He was very sad and very soft-spoken; his eyes filled up with tears, and he spoke with his head down, at the level of Beatrice\u2019s chest. At first, defendant maintained that, as he was coming from the shower on July 24, he saw L.R. lying on the bed in Carlos and Rosalva\u2019s room. She had no clothes on, and he believed she was going to fall off the bed, so he had grabbed her by the log. Beatrice explained that L.R.\u2019s injuries could not have been caused by defendant grabbing her leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Defendant then revised his version of events. He stated that he went into Carlos and Rosalva\u2019s room after he took a shower. He saw L.R. on the bed, crying, without any clothes on. He picked her up to comfort her, and, as he did so, she slipped out of his hands. As he attempted to grab her, his right index and middle finger entered her vagina. As he made this statement, defendant was crying and repeatedly saying that he had not done it on purpose. Beatrice \u201cheld his hands and told [defendant] it was all right,\u201d and \u201ccomforted him.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Beatrice asked defendant why he had not told his family or Investigators Arnold and Jiminez what had happened, and defendant responded that he had been \u201cembarrassed\u201d and \u201cscared,\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be perceived as a monster.\u201d He had been so upset by the incident that he had been unable to eat supper on the evening it happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Beatrice advised defendant that, based upon his admissions, he would be arrested and charged. He asked defendant if he would provide a formal statement, and defendant responded that he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Thereafter, between 1:10 a.m. and 2:15 a.m. on July 27, a formal statement was taken from defendant. Defendant was questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>by Investigator Beatrice, with Investigator Urena translating and Investigator Arnold typing.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">As the statement was taken, defendant sat in one of the chairs at the table. Investigator Beatrice was seated next to defendant, while Investigators Arnold and Urena were at the end of the table. Defendant was not restrained, and no weapons were present in the room. Defendant was not physically threatened or injured in order to coerce a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">As he was giving the statement, defendant explained his version of events, as he had previously done with Investigator Beatrice, stating that he had accidentally penetrated L.R. with his fingers while attempting to grab her and prevent her from falling. At or about this point in the statement, Investigator Arnold interrupted and told defendant that he would type defendant\u2019s version of events, but he \u201cdidn\u2019t believe\u201d his story. Arnold told defendant that he did not believe a judge or jury would believe him.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Investigator Beatrice was upset that Investigator Arnold had interrupted the interview because he believed defendant might shut down and refuse to continue. Reacting to Investigator Arnold\u2019s statements, defendant began to lower his head, cross his legs, and cry. As defendant did so, Investigator Beatrice \u201crub[bed] his shoulders\u201d and told him \u201cit was okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Defendant then stated that he had \u201cused his penis.\u201d Investigator Beatrice asked defendant to explain, and defendant responded that, after his shower on July 24, he had passed Carlos and Rosalva\u2019s room. L.R. was on the bed with a towel, and defendant was dressed. He lowered his pants and sat on the bed. His penis was erect. He put the baby on top of his penis and \u201cpumped her two or three times,\u201d explaining that his penis went \u201chalfway\u201d into the vagina.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant stated that L.R. \u201ccried [and he] got scared,\u201d so he \u201cput her down\u201d and \u201cleft the room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>As he confessed, defendant spoke in a soft voice, but he was not crying. Defendant stated that he \u201cfelt terrible [and] sad\u201d for what he had done, and that he \u201cwasn\u2019t a monster.\u201d He understood that he would be arrested and go to jail, but he had given the statement because he felt bad for the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">After the statement had been taken, Investigator Urena reviewed the statement in Spanish with defendant. He allowed defendant to make corrections, and both he and defendant initialed each page of the statement. Defendant admitted that he had been treated well by the police and was not coerced in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">At the conclusion of the statement, defendant asked to use the bathroom, and Investigator Beatrice escorted him to the men\u2019s room. Just before he entered the bathroom, defendant turned, hugged Investigator Beatrice, and said \u201cthank you\u201d in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Defendant was then arrested and a photo was taken of him. In his pretrial ruling, the motion judge noted that the photo shows no sign of physical injury of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Antonio Burr, Ph.D., a psychologist, testified on behalf of defendant at the trial. Dr. Burr opined that defendant had an I.Q. of approximately sixty-five, which placed him in the range of mild mental retardation. However, Dr. Burr admitted that the test upon which he based that conclusion was non-verbal and therefore insufficient to diagnose a person with mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Dr. Burr also opined that, based upon defendant\u2019s responses on a Rorschach Psycho Diagnostic Test, defendant had a very limited capacity to address complex, ambiguous, or emotionally charged matters. Finally, Dr. Burr did not find any evidence that defendant suffered from sexually deviant arousal patterns.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Defendant asserts that his statements were inadmissible because he was an eighteen-year old illegal alien with an I.Q. of 65 and was mildly retarded, could not read or speak English, and was in the interrogation room for eight hours, commencing around 6 p.m. on July 26, 2000, and in custody about twelve hours before the formal statement was taken. He also points to the fact that the incriminatory formal statement on July 27 was given only after Detective Arnold, who was typing it on his laptop, interrupted Detective Beatrice and told defendant that no one would believe what he was saying and refused to take it down. Moreover, defendant insists his statement cannot be deemed credible, therefore affecting its admissibility, because Dr. Sanz indicated that the injuries would have been \u201ccatastrophic\u201d if they occurred as detailed in the final statement given.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Judge Ronald Sokalski, the judge who heard the motion to suppress, rendered a comprehensive written opinion admitting into evidence both the written statement taken from defendant between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. on the morning of July 26, 2000 and the formal written statement taken between 1:10 and 2:15 a.m. in the early morning of July 27, 2000. As to both, the judge found defendant was advised of, and knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived, his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that the statement was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">We affirm the admission of the statements of Judge Sokalski substantially for the reasons expressed in his letter opinion of October 19,2001, and add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201cConfessions obtained by police during custodial interrogation are barred from evidence unless the defendant has been advised of his constitutional rights. <em>Miranda v.

In determining the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statement, courts consider whether the statement was \u201c \u2018the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u2019 in which ease the statement may be used against the defendant, or whether the defendant\u2019s \u2018will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 654, 628 A.2d 735 (1993). \u201cAmong the factors to consider in determining voluntariness are the suspect\u2019s age, education, intelligence, previous encounters with law enforcement, advice received about his or her constitutional rights, the length of detention, the period of time between administration of the warnings and the volunteered statement, and whether the questioning was repeated and prolonged in nature or involved physical or mental abuse.\u201d <em>State v.

Moreover, the interrogation occurred during hours when defendant was usually at work, so he was not unduly tired. And defendant was given food and drink during this period. Nor can it be said that he was \u201ctargeted\u201d or \u201csingled out\u201d in any way. His relatives and members of his household were similarly treated. Further, despite repeated warnings, defendant never asked for an attorney or for the interrogation to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As already noted, after the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing, Judge Sokal-ski concluded that defendant had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, understood those rights, and knowingly and voluntarily waived them and gave voluntary statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Judge Sokalski also denied defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration made about nine months after his decision following the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing based upon the expert report of Dr. Burr. He found that nothing in Dr. Burr\u2019s report was inconsistent with his previous holding that defendant understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Similarly, before sentencing defendant, Judge Miguel de la Carrera, before whom the case was tried, denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the extent it was based upon the admission of defendant\u2019s statements to the police, Judge de la Carrera stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">[Njone of what I heard or saw during the trial led me to a different conclusion than Judge SokalsM did with regard to the voluntariness of that confession. In fact, I\u2019ll note that I allowed the defense some leeway during cross-examination at times where it was implied that the defense would later be bringing in some evidence of much greater coercion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">But nothing that I saw and heard during the trial suggested to me that it wasn\u2019t a voluntary statement. And it was one which was elicited gradually through questioning.. . There had ... been no pressure at the time of the first statement and ... there were some seven or so different suspects initially. Including the father and brother of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">It was after ... [defendant] was the only one not to pass ... the polygraph exam that further questioning was undertaken. At which point ... the story essentially came out in dribs and drabs. And what\u2019s been described as the breakdown I think was properly characterized by [the prosecutor] because it was the way that it struck me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">And that even the slumping of ... [defendant] was a physical manifestation of what had happened. He had unburdened himself of his guilt. He had begun with outright denial. He had gone through a modified confession in terms of the accidental digital penetration, and ultimately came to the\u2014the intentional, but nonetheless, brief penile penetration. Limited as that penetration was, but significant nonetheless, as it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">And indeed, there were descriptions by\u2014I think it was Investigator Beatrice ... that the defendant afterwards requested to go to the lavatory, and, in fact, in some fashion hugged or embraced that investigator and thanked him. He said thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">All of which, to my mind, was consistent with the actions of someone who was relieved in the way that I think common experience tells all of us people often are when they have confessed something which has been laying on their mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">[WJhile it was . . some time into the middle of the night ... this did not appear to be a water torture involved here. Something extraordinarily out o\u00ed\u2014things of the length of the interview or the\u2014the hour of the night, in fact, I believe, when information came to the investigator\u2019s attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>[Wlould it be a better practice to audiotape and/or videotape statements taken in witness interview rooms?

To what extent is cost the ... principal reason for not doing it? I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">[Videotaping is] quite frequently helpful in an inculpatory rather than an exculpatory way. So the notion that the video cameras aren\u2019t there because it\u2019s ... part of a ... web designed to catch somebody in a coerced confession ... is not persuasive to me. And I found nothing to suggest that ... there was coercion of any kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">The actions of the Prosecutor\u2019s investigators and the ... Passaic officers involved seemed to me quite ... appropriate and quite professional in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">The retardation question which was related to that, there was lots of detailed information with regard to that and it was noted that it was a borderline retardation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">[T]here\u2019s every indication by Dr. Burr that the defendant was coherent. That he answered responsively to his questions. That he was oriented to time and place and everything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">And he had been employed, gainfully employed for some period of time. There was\u2014indeed, the testimony was that the grade level that he had completed ... in school in Mexico was the equivalent of something at least of completion of Middle School and I believe even the early stages of high school____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">I\u2019m satisfied that he was properly instructed as to his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">We find, under our scope of review, no basis for disturbing the motion judge\u2019s determination (supported by the trial judge) that the statements were voluntary and admissible. <em>State v.

Cook, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 847 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>A.2d 530, requiring the recordation of all custodial interrogation is not effective with respect to non-murder cases until next January. <em>See </em>Supreme Court Administrative Determination Re: Report of Special Committee on Recordation of Custodial Interrogations, 182 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>346, 347 (October 24, 2005). And to the extent defendant complains he was tricked by the police or advised to change his statement because he was not believed, we note that \u201c[ujnlike the use of physical coercion, ... use of a psychologically-oriented technique during questioning is not inherently coercive ____Cases holding that police conduct had overborne the will of the defendant have typically required a showing of very substantial psychological pressure on the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Galloway, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 654-55, 628 A.2d 735. As stated in <em>State v. Knight, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">In short, we find there was sufficient credible evidence for the trial court to find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant voluntarily waived his right against self-incrimination and freely gave his . statement to the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">[183 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 874 A.2d 546.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The proof was sufficient to sustain the conviction for aggravated sexual assault; <em>see State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967); the object inserted and depth of penetration was not relevant to constitute a first degree crime of a victim of four months, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(1), as alleged in count one. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1c. As stated by the trial judge in denying a judgment of acquittal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">[I]n looking at the evidence that\u2019s been presented to date, and giving ... the benefit of all inferences which could be drawn to the State in support of a conviction, and incorporating counsel\u2019s request to analyze this matter from a commonsense point of view, I have to deny the defense\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">Common sense tells me that when the defendant ... used the expression that he penetrated this child, that he went halfway in, ... that there\u2019s anything other than penetration. There was obviously no measuring which occurred by [defendant) of the length of his erection or the exact amount that there was penetration. I could even see had the exact word or equivalent thereof, halfway, been used in Spanish, that it was still a figure of speech, meaning the equivalent of partway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The fact that it would be a medical impossibility to penetrate halfway of an adult male\u2019s erect penis doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s the theory of the State\u2019s case, and that that\u2019s what all of the medical evidence shows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">There is medical evidence here of a substantial injury requiring 65 stitches. And the fact that .... it dearly would not be possible for there to be a penetration halfway in doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s what this case [is] about, that the jury needs to conclude that there was____[TJhere\u2019s no evidence at this point [about] the length of the defendant\u2019s male member when he is erect. But let\u2019s say we\u2019re six inches, that it went in three inches, there\u2019s nothing resembling any precision regarding the degree of penetration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">Simply the issue here and the charge here involve penetration. The charge isn\u2019t that he penetrated halfway in. The charge is penetrating. And that\u2019s what the indictment says, the three counts of the indictment say. And I find that the State has met its burden at this point. And these are issues for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Finally, the State could ask Dr. Burr about the nature and scope of his interview with defendant, including defendant\u2019s reticence in answering, for purposes of evaluating the credibility of the expert opinion. <em>State v.

The fact that polygraph examinations were given was not admitted into evidence, but the <em>Miranda </em>waiver forms (in English and Spanish) he used were admitted as relevant. At the motion to suppress, Investigator Beatrice described the polygraph procedure and form used and read in Spanish by Investigator Resto. Beatrice\u2019s direct testimony at the motion hearing appears as \"Jiminez-Recross.\u201d All information pertaining to the polygraph was redacted from the forms admitted at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> On cross-examination by defense counsel, Beatrice admitted that he did not believe the second version of events was any more truthful than the first.
