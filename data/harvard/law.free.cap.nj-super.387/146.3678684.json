We conclude that such a search, if conducted contemporaneously with the arrest, is a valid search incident to an arrest under both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Defendant and his brother Babatunde Oyenusi were indicted on two counts of Medicaid fraud, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4D-17, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-7; second-degree theft by deception, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-4, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:2-6 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-7; second-degree misconduct by a corporate official, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:21-9c; and conspiracy to commit the foregoing offenses, in violation of <em>N.J.SA. </em>2C:5-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Codefendants moved to suppress evidence obtained in a search incident to Babatunde\u2019s arrest. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion. Codefendants were subsequently tried jointly, which resulted in a guilty verdict against defendant on all charges. Babatunde was acquitted of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent five-year terms of imprisonment for theft by deception and misconduct by a corporate official and a three-year concurrent term for one count of Medicaid fraud. The court also imposed a $75,000 fine and required defendant to pay the State $152,215 in restitution. The court merged defendant\u2019s other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The Medicaid fraud scheme that formed the basis of defendant\u2019s convictions consisted of submitting Medicaid claims for prescription drugs that were not actually dispensed. A confederate in this scheme, Morris Dicker, testified for the State that he entered into an arrangement with Babatunde and defendant, who was a registered pharmacist, under which he would supply them with fake prescriptions written on doctors\u2019 prescription pads and Medicaid cards obtained from Medicaid recipients, in exchange for prescription drugs or cash. The State presented other evidence, including expert testimony, to show that defendant used these fake prescriptions and Medicaid cards to submit thousands of fraudulent Medicaid claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The search that is the subject of this appeal was conducted on February 10, 1996 pursuant to a warrant for Babatunde\u2019s arrest. This warrant was not based on evidence of the Medicaid fraud scheme for which defendant was convicted, but instead on evidence of Babatunde\u2019s participation in the sale of stolen prescription drugs through pharmacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The arrest was made outside of Babatunde\u2019s Newark residence by Division of Criminal Justice investigators. At the time of Babatunde\u2019s arrest, he was carrying two white plastic bags. The arresting officers took the bags from Babatunde, placed handcuffs on him, and then looked inside the bags, which were not sealed or otherwise secured. One of the bags contained a typewriter, and the other a notebook, blank prescription pads, Medicaid eligibility cards under various names, and some prescriptions ostensibly written by doctors. The items found in the second bag were subsequently used by the State to prove defendant\u2019s involvement in the Medicaid fraud scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">At the suppression hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one of the arresting officers was asked how much time elapsed between Babatunde\u2019s arrest and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>examination of the contents of the bags, in response to which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">Not much. I mean, we arrested him out on the street, looked in the bags on the street. We did it all right there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress, concluding that the examination of the contents of the plastic bags Babatunde was carrying constituted a valid search incident to his arrest. In reaching this conclusion, the court found that the arrest and handcuffing of Babatunde and the examination of the contents of the bags were \u201creasonably contemporaneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">On appeal, defendant\u2019s only argument is that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress because the investigators\u2019 examination of the contents of the plastic bags Babatunde was carrying at the time of his arrest was not a valid search incident to the arrest. The State responds that defendant lacks standing to challenge the validity of the search because he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy either in the plastic bags seized from Babatunde or the incriminating items found in the bags and, alternatively, that the search was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">The State\u2019s standing argument was not presented to the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we question whether this argument is properly before us. <em>See Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). In any event, we have no need to address the point because we are satisfied that the examination of the plastic bags Babatunde was carrying at the time of his arrest was a valid search incident to the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In a letter submitted after the filing of his brief, defendant argues, relying upon <em>State v. Eckel, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>523, 888 A.2d 1266 (2006), that our Supreme Court has interpreted the New Jersey Constitution to impose stricter limitations upon searches incident to arrest than are imposed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Therefore, we first consider the validity of the search of the bags Babatunde was carrying at the time of his arrest under the Fourth Amendment. Because we conclude that this search did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we next consider whether the Supreme Court of New Jersey has construed the New Jersey Constitution to impose stricter limitations upon the kind of search incident to arrest involved in this case than are imposed under the Fourth Amendment. We conclude that, except for a search of the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s automobile, the Court has applied the same test to determine the validity of searches incident to arrest under the New Jersey Constitution as applies under the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the suppression motion and defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The leading case dealing with the permissible scope of a search incident to an arrest under the Fourth Amendment is <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>752, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). The Court in <em>Chimel </em>held that when the police arrest a suspect, they may conduct a search of his \u201cperson and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019\u2014construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 23 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 694. The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed the <em>Chimel </em>test for determining the validity of a search incident to an arrest. <em>See, e.g., Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>640, 644, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2605, 2608, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>65, 70 (1983); <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>1, 14, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2476, 2485, 53 L.Ed.2d 538, 550 (1977); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>218, 226, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>467, 472, 38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>L.Ed.2d 427, 435 (1973); <em>see generally </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure:ise on the Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 6.3(b) (4th ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The authorization to search incident to an arrest is based on the need to disarm the arrestee and preserve evidence for later use at trial. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>at 234, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 476, 38 L.Ed.2d at 439-40. However, the validity of such a search \u201cdoes not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 477, 38 L.Ed.2d at 440. \u201cA custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 477, 38 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 440-11; <em>see also Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>31, 35-36, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2627, 2631, 61 L.Ed.2d 343, 348 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The authority to search an arrestee and the area within his immediate control includes the authority to search a container found in the arrestee\u2019s possession. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>798, 821-23, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2157, 2171-72, 72 L.Ed.2d 572, 591-92 (1982); <em>Gustafson v. Florida, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>260, 266, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>488, 492, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>456, 461-62 (1973); <em>Robinson, supra, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>at 236, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 477, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The only limitation upon a search of an arrestee\u2019s person and the area within his immediate control is that the search may not be \u201cremote in time or place from the arrest[.]\u201d <em>Chadwick, supra, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>at 15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 L.Ed.2d at 550-51 (quoting <em>Preston v. United States, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>364, 367, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>881, 883, 11 L.Ed.2d 777, 780 (1964)). This limitation is sometimes expressed as a requirement that the search be \u201csubstantially contemporaneous\u201d with the arrest. <em>See Shipley v. California, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>818, 819, 89 <em>S.Ct, </em>2053, 2054, 23 L.Ed.2d 732, 734 (1969); <em>United States v. Currence, </em>446 F.3d 554, 557 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Holmes v. Kucynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1082 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>States v. Morgan, </em>936 <em>F.2d </em>1561, 1580 (10th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>1102, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1190, <em>117 L.Ed.2d </em>431 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The requirement of substantial contemporaneity of the arrest and search is ordinarily satisfied if the search of the arrestee and a container in his or her possession is made at the location of the arrest while the arrestee is still on the scene. <em>See, e.g., Currence, supra, </em>446 <em>F.</em>3d at 554-59 (search into hollow area inside handlebar of defendant\u2019s bicycle valid where defendant was arrested and handcuffed before the police looked into the handlebar while defendant was still on the scene); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>102 <em>F.</em>3d 1344, 1346-47 (4th Cir.1996) (search valid where, within a few minutes, agents arrested defendant in the front room of an apartment, removed his shoulder bag, took him to a separate upstairs bedroom for questioning, and searched the bag), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>1203, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1567, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>713 (1997); <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>100 F.3d 1409, 1419-20 (9th Cir.1996) (search valid where rifle case was near defendant\u2019s feet at the time of arrest, and search was conducted three minutes after defendant was removed from the room), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>939, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>353, 139 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>274 (1997); <em>United States v. Han, </em>74 F.3d 537, 541-43 (4th Cir.) (search valid where bag was \u201cunquestionably ... in [defendant\u2019s] immediate control at the beginning of the encounter; the delay lasted just a few minutes; and the search occurred at the scene of the arrest\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>1239, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1890, 135 L.Ed.2d 184 (1996); <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>677 F.2d 602, 606-08 (7th Cir.1982) (search valid where bag was opened five minutes after defendant was handcuffed and moved to the street); <em>see generally </em>3 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Consequently, the fact that the police seize a container in the possession of an arrestee at the time of the arrest, thereby depriving the arrestee of access, does not mean that a warrant must be obtained before the container can be opened and examined. As the court explained in <em>Nelson,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">While the need for the incident-to-arrest exception is indeed grounded on the need to protect law enforcement officers and evidence, the validity of such a search does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>not end at the instant the risks justifying the search come to an end. Even though the warrant exception is well grounded on the existence of exigent risks attending arrest, the pragmatic necessity of not invalidating such a search the instant the risks pass is well accepted____Just as arresting officers need not determine that the defendant <em>actually </em>have a gun or <em>actually </em>intend to destroy evidence before conducting a search incident to arrest, they need not reorder the sequence of then-conduct during arrest simply to satisfy an artificial rule that would link the validity of the search to the duration of the risks. Pragmatic necessity requires that we uphold the validity and reasonableness of a search incident to arrest if the search is part of the specific law enforcement operation during which the search occurs. [102 <em>F.</em>3d at 1347.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Moreover, a search incident to an arrest may be valid under some circumstances even though it is not conducted contemporaneously with the arrest. In <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>800, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974), the Court upheld the validity of the seizure and subsequent search of clothing taken from an arrestee in jail approximately ten hours after his arrest. In holding that this seizure and search did not require a warrant, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">[O]nce the accused is lawfully arrested and is in custody, the effects in his possession at the place of detention that were subject to search at the time and place of his arrest may lawfully be searched and seized without a warrant even though a substantial period of time has elapsed between the arrest and subsequent administrative processing, on the one hand, and the taking of the property for use as evidence, on the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 807, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1239, 39 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 778.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\"><em>See generally </em>3 LaFave \u00a7 5.3(a). However, such a delayed search incident to an arrest may be made only of items that are \u201cimmediately associated with the person,\u201d such as a purse or wallet, and not of items such as the footlocker involved in <em>Chadwick. Curd v. City Court, </em>141 F.3d 839, 842-44 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>888, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>204, 142 L.Ed.2d 167 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the search of the plastic bags seized from Babatunde was a valid search incident to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>his arrest. Since Babatunde was carrying the bags when he was arrested, they were clearly \u201cwithin his immediate control.\u201d Consequently, defendant does not question the right of the arresting officers to seize the bags. Immediately after the seizure, the officers looked inside the bags and determined that they contained apparent evidence of criminal activity. Although Babatunde no longer had access to the bags at that point, the search was substantially contemporaneous with his arrest and therefore constituted a valid search incident to the arrest under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Because the search of the bags was substantially contemporaneous with Babatunde\u2019s arrest, we have no need to consider whether the bags were \u201cpersonal effects\u201d that under <em>Edwards </em>could have been searched even a substantial period of time after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We consider next whether the Supreme Court of New Jersey interpreted the New Jersey Constitution in <em>Eckel </em>to impose stricter limitations on searches incident to arrest than the federal courts have interpreted the Fourth Amendment to require. In <em>Eckel, </em>the Court rejected the \u201cbright-line\u201d rule of <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>454, 460, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2860, 2864, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>768, 775 (1981) \u201cthat when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d In rejecting this rule, the Court concluded that <em>\u201cBelton </em>detached itself from the theoretical underpinnings that initially animated the search incident to arrest exception.\u201d <em>Eckel, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 888 A.2d 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">To determine the relevance of <em>Eckel </em>to the search incident to Babatunde\u2019s arrest, it is necessary to identify the specific issue to which the <em>Belton </em>bright-line rule is addressed. As posed in the majority opinion, the issue in <em>Belton </em>was: \u201cWhen the occupant of an automobile is subjected to a lawful custodial arrest, does the constitutionally permissible scope of a search incident to his arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>include the passenger compartment of the automobile in which he was riding?\u201d 453 <em>U.S. </em>at 455, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2861, 69 L.Ed.2d at 771-72. In answering this question affirmatively, the Court accepted \u201cthe generalization that articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within \u2018the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary [item,]\u2019 \u201d and therefore, the passenger compartment may be searched as a contemporaneous incident to the arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 460, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2864, 69 L.Ed.2d at 774-75 (quoting <em>Chimel, supra, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>at 763, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d at 694). Thus, <em>Belton </em>held that the geographical scope of \u201cthe area within the immediate control of the arrestee\u201d that <em>Chimel </em>allows the police to search incident to an arrest includes the entire passenger compartment of an automobile that the arrestee had recently occupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In criticizing this holding, Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent charged that the majority had \u201csubstantially expanded] the permissible scope of searches incident to arrest by permitting police officers to search areas and containers the arrestee could not possibly reach at the time of arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2867, 69 L.Ed.2d at 779. He also stated that \u201cthe crucial question under <em>Chimel </em>is not whether the arrestee could <em>ever </em>have reached the area that was searched, but whether he could have reached it at the time of arrest and search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2868, 69 L.Ed.2d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">In <em>Eckel, </em>our Supreme Court rejected <em>Belton\u2019s </em>expansion of the geographical scope of \u201cthe area within the immediate control of the arrestee\u201d to include the entire passenger compartment of an automobile recently occupied by the arrestee as well as the contents of any container found in the automobile. However, the <em>Belton </em>majority opinion did not address the temporal limits of a search incident to an arrest\u2014how soon after an arrest the police must conduct a search for it to be considered \u201ccontemporaneous.\u201d <em>See Chimel, supra, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>at 764, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d at 694. Therefore, our Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the <em>Belton </em>rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>relating to the geographical scope of a search incident to the arrest of an occupant of an automobile did not reflect any conclusion concerning the temporal limits of a search incident to an arrest under the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Furthermore, except for its rejection of the <em>Belton </em>rule, our Supreme Court generally has not \u201cafforded greater protection regarding the scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest under our State Constitution than that provided in <em>Chimel\u2019s </em>interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Dangerfield, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>446, 462, 795 A.2d 250 (2002); <em>see also State v. Patino, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8-9, 414 A.2d 1327 (1980); <em>State v. Ercolano, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>25, 36 n. 3, 397 A.2d 1062 (1979). Indeed, the Court in <em>Eckel </em>reiterated that \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s traditional approach to the search incident to arrest exception parallels <em>Chimel.\u201d </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 535, 888 A.2d 1266. The Court in <em>Eckel, </em>as part of its rationale for rejecting the <em>Belton </em>rule, relied upon the fact that \u201conce the occupant has been removed from the vehicle, placed under custodial arrest and seated in a police car, there is no danger that the arrestee might reach into his own vehicle to gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536, 888 A.2d 1266 (quoting <em>State v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211, 235 n. 15, 440 A.2d 1311 (1981)). However, we see no basis for construing this statement in <em>Eckel, </em>in which the only issue presented was the validity of the <em>Belton </em>rule under the New Jersey Constitution, as a rejection of <em>Ross, Gustafson, Robinson </em>and the other federal cases discussed in section I of this opinion, which uphold the validity of a contemporaneous search of a container in the immediate control of an arrestee even though the police remove the container from the arrestee\u2019s possession before searching it.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> The transcript of the suppression hearing includes only part of the arresting officer's cross-examination.
