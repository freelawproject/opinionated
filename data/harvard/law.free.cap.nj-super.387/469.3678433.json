Pursuant to our leave granted, NJT appeals the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order granting Andersen\u2019s motion to dismiss its complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim. Additionally, appeals were filed by the individual defendants asserting unrelated relief. We consolidated the appeals for argument. After argument, the matters were deconsolidated by order dated November 18, 2005 and the appeals of the individual defendants were separately addressed. <em>See State of NJ v. Qwest Communications Int., Inc., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 904 A.2d 786 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In NJT\u2019s appeal, we review whether the trial court erred in granting Andersen\u2019s motion to dismiss NJT\u2019s amended complaint, relying on the New Jersey Accountant Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A53A-25 (Act). We hold that it did, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Our factual review starts with the pleadings. By complaint dated November 27, 2002, NJT sought damages for the fraudulent activities of Qwest, Andersen and the individual defendants, during the period of November 2000 through November 2001, which \u201ccaused Qwest\u2019s stock to trade at artificially inflated prices by employing improper accounting practices, and by issuing false and misleading statements about Qwest\u2019s business, revenues, and profits.\u201d More specifically, NJT asserts Andersen \u201cparticipated in and blessed Qwest\u2019s illicit swap transactions and the improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>accounting practices\u201d designed \u201cto inflate Qwest\u2019s reported revenues and earnings,\u201d and in turn its stock price, at a time when NJT purchased the stock through its Division of Investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The complaint alleges \u201cone key component of the scheme\u201d to artificially inflate Qwest\u2019s revenues and earnings, \u201cinvolved Qwest\u2019s participation in \u2018swap\u2019 transactions [of optical network capacity] ... which had no legitimate economic purpose.\u201d In these \u201cswap transactions\u201d Qwest purportedly sold capacity on its optical telecommunications network to other carriers reporting the receipts as revenue, while simultaneously buying a nearly identical amount of capacity from other carriers and capitalizing that expense over time, rather than reporting it as a current operating cost. As a result, the reported corporate revenues swelled. In turn, Qwest\u2019s stock price rose. Upon discovery of the alleged fraudulent practices, Qwest acknowledged the erroneous revenue reporting, its stock price then plummeted, resulting in NJT\u2019s loss of tens of millions of dollars on its investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Andersen moved to dismiss those counts of the original complaint against it asserting the complaint failed to state a claim for relief. After a hearing, the trial court granted NJT leave to amend its complaint and cure the noted deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">NJT filed its amended complaint on October 17, 2003. The amended complaint charged that during the period April 1999 through December 2001, Andersen, both as the outside auditor for Qwest for the years 1999 to 2002, as well as a professional consultant to the corporation its subsidiaries and affiliates, \u201cwas deeply involved and complicit in the fraudulent conduct at issue in this case.\u201d NJT contends Andersen aided and abetted Qwest\u2019s fraud by intentionally advising Qwest on how to structure the illicit swap transactions and other accounting practices to artificially inflate Qwest\u2019s revenues because Andersen \u201cpossessed unique and superior knowledge of Qwest\u2019s accounting and business practices, and was informed of the specific fraudulent actions used in various acquisition transactions, including [the] \u2018swap agreements.\u2019 \u201d In furtherance of the fraud, NJT maintains \u201cAn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>dersen participated in, knew of, and/or recklessly disregarded the facts and circumstances of the [fraudulent] acts\u201d when issuing numerous public documents regarding Qwest\u2019s financial status and participated in Qwest\u2019s manipulation of the fraudulent public financial disclosures by advising the corporation on how to accomplish its fraud. The amended complaint also contains a new claim of civil conspiracy against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The amended complaint includes details supporting the NJT\u2019s allegations regarding Andersen\u2019s role in aiding and abetting the alleged fraudulent scheme. NJT maintains its amended pleading identifies the specific fraudulent acts committed by Andersen evincing Andersen\u2019s actual knowledge of and participation in the fraudulent accounting scheme, which NJT asserts Andersen purposefully designed for Qwest with the sole objective of inflating earnings without reporting corresponding expenses, in order to inflate the corporate balance sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The amended complaint contains allegations of Andersen\u2019s conduct in paragraphs 411 to 442. NJT\u2019s arguments can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">Advising Qwest of the manner to structure the illicit swap transactions and related accounting activities designed to fraudulently inflate Qwest\u2019s revenues and, correspondingly, the corporate share price for the period 1999 to 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">Directing the actual implementation of the financial reporting of the scheme, then submitting its audit opinion for the company\u2019s fiscal year-end financial statements for 1999, 2000, and 2001, certifying the accuracy of the financial disclosures as a \u201cneutral outside auditor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">Preparing a series of \u201cWhite Papers\u201d for Qwest\u2019s use itemizing a step-by-step plan for Qwest to immediately recognize revenue from the illicit swap transactions, notwithstanding accounting guidelines mandating a contrary reporting method of that revenue stream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">Providing accounting audit opinions, along with tax and audit advice, which were included in SEC filings and proxy statements, knowing the opinions failed to disclose the illicit swap transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">Participating in Qwest\u2019s plan to manipulate corporate revenue by sanctioning the public release of the financial reports, which included the improper increased earnings, and failing to ensure that Qwest\u2019s public financial reports disclosed the sham transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Communicating with Qwest\u2019s management, including the Board of Directors, through emails, Excel programs and other reports, which approved and assisted Qwest\u2019s in-house accounting staff to structure the fraudulent transactions. Certifying Qwest\u2019s Form 10-K for calendar years 2000 and 2001 despite Andersen\u2019s knowledge that the reports contained fraudulent financial data and overstated revenues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In further support of its position, NJT maintains that after discovery of the fraud, Qwest\u2019s management directly implicated Andersen. Afshin Mohebbi, a former Qwest CEO and President, testified on September 4, 2002, before the House of Representatives, that Andersen reviewed Qwest\u2019s swap transactions each quarter. Robin Szeliga, a former CFO and V.P. of Finance for Qwest and defendant in this action, testified that Andersen played a critical role in advising Qwest on financial reporting and accounting, worked closely with Qwest\u2019s controller and technical accounting group, performed annual audits and quarterly pre-issuance reviews, and periodically made presentations to the audit committee of the board of directors. In a July 2002 press release Qwest reported that Andersen had full knowledge and approved of Qwest\u2019s method of accounting for the swap transactions and in an October 28, 2002 press release Qwest stated that with the guidance of Arthur Andersen, Qwest had improperly recognized and reported $1.48 billion of revenue from the swap transactions following the June 30, 2000 merger of Qwest and U.S. West, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">NJT further asserts that throughout the period in question, Andersen received millions of dollars in fees, not only as Qwest\u2019s independent auditor, but also in payment for accounting services and advice in furtherance of the fraudulent reporting. Thus, Andersen\u2019s continued active participation in structuring and concealing the illegal fraudulent accounting activities was designed to continue Andersen\u2019s accounting and consulting fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Andersen filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, arguing the amended pleading \u201cdid not cure the deficiencies identified by th[e] Court last year. It essentially re-characterizes the same allegations of negligence [as fraud], and it fails to allege with particularity the facts regarding Arthur Andersen.\u201d Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Andersen argued plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. A hearing on Andersen\u2019s motion to dismiss was held on June 28, 2004, at which time decision was reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">On December 3, 2004, the court granted Andersen\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings with prejudice pursuant to <em>B. </em>4:6-2(e) and <em>B. 4:5-8, </em>dismissing the counts of NJT\u2019s complaint alleging aiding and abetting fraud and civil conspiracy against Andersen. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>E. Dickerson &amp; Son, Inc. v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>500, 846 A.2d 1237 (2004), the trial court held that the complaint, as pled, failed to state a claim against Andersen cognizable under subsection b(2) of the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On appeal, NJT argues the amended complaint sufficiently states a claim for aiding and abetting fraud and civil conspiracy, and the trial court incorrectly interpreted the Act in a way that \u201cundermines the legislative public policy objectives ... by encouraging accountants to coach their clients in the mechanics of accounting fraud and assist them in defrauding investors.\u201d On that ground NJT asks us to reverse. Andersen contends that the trial court correctly dismissed the claims against it because \u201cthe allegations in the amended complaint are palpably insufficient to support claims for aiding and abetting fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud,\u201d and support only claims based on negligence, which are barred by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">When a motion challenging the legal sufficiency of a complaint is filed, plaintiff is entitled to a liberal interpretation and given the benefit of all favorable inferences that reasonably may be drawn. <em>Stubaus v. Whitman, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>38, 52, 770 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.2001) <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. 442, </em>794 A.2d 181 (2002); <em>Burg v. State, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 319-20, 371 A.2d 308 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>11, 379 A.2d 242 (1977). \u201cOur inquiry is limited to examining the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged on the face of the complaint\u201d after an in depth search \u201cmade with liberality,\u201d to discern whether a cause of action is found, even in \u201can obscure statement of claim.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Morristown v. Sharp Electronics Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989); <em>Rieder v. Dept. of Transp., </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 552, 535 A.2d 512 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">A motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a cause of action must be denied if the claim has been made out. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31. The motion should be granted only in rare instances, ordinarily without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 772, 563 A.2d 31; <em>Fazilat v. Feldstein, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>74, 78, 848 A.2d 761 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Andersen correctly points out that, the enactment of <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25 ... provides greater protections for accountants by limiting their exposure to liability for damages for negligence to third parties.\u201d <em>NCP Litigation Trust v. KPMG, </em>LLP, 187 <em>N.J. </em>353, 380, 901 A.2d 871 (2006). Thus, generally, the negligent performance of audit services for a client does not give rise to third-party liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In pertinent part, the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">b. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, no accountant shall be liable for damages <em>for negligence </em>arising out of and in the course of rendering any professional accounting service unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">(1) The claimant against the accountant was the accountant\u2019s client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">(2) The accountant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">(a) knew at the time of the engagement by the client, or agreed with the client after the time of the engagement, that the professional accounting service rendered to the client would be made available to the claimant, who was specifically identified to the accountant in connection with a specified transaction made by the claimant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">(b) knew that the claimant intended to rely upon the professional accounting service in connection with that specified transaction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">(c) directly expressed to the claimant, by words or conduct, the accountant\u2019s understanding of the claimant\u2019s intended reliance on the professional accounting service....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25b (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">The Act, however, exempts from its immunity provisions, negligence occurring where the accountant and the third party are in privity. <em>Finderne Mgmt. Co. v. Barrett, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 205, 809 A.2d 857 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>219, 827 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>A.2d 287 (2003), so that negligent conduct is actionable when the accountant knows the third party will rely upon his audit and the accountant agreed his work would be released to and relied upon by the third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The trial court found as dispositive the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling <em>E. Dickerson &amp; Son, Inc., supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 846 A.2d 1237. In <em>E. Dickerson, </em>however, plaintiffs did not allege Ernst and Young committed fraud, only that it had negligently failed to detect the fraud perpetrated by its client. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint against Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), holding the complaint failed to allege a cause of action for negligence not barred by the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 846 A.2d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Centering its review on whether NJT alleged an act of negligence against Andersen cognizable under the Act in this matter, the trial court found none and dismissed NJT\u2019s complaint. NJT concedes it has not satisfied the Act\u2019s exceptions as to a cause for negligence. NJT asserts, however, that its complaint sounds in fraud, which is not barred by the Act. We agree. The Act applies to actions for negligence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25b. It does not shield accountants from intentional acts of fraud or from intentional acts which assist a client in committing a fraud or conspiratorial cooperation aimed at perpetration of a fraud. The plain language of the statute limits its provisions to and precludes extension beyond negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Andersen counters, as an alternate basis of relief, that aiding and abetting fraud is not a recognized cause of action in New Jersey and \u201c[e]ven if a separate tort of aiding and abetting fraud exists in New Jersey, plaintiff failed to plead the necessary facts to establish aiding and abetting liability here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We disagree with Andersen\u2019s contentions that there is no actionable tort of aiding and abetting fraud and find that aiding and abetting fraud is a cognizable civil cause of action under New Jersey law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Generally, the combination, \u201cto aid or abet,\u201d is used in criminal law. In that context, we have defined \u201caid\u201d as meaning \u201cto assist, support or supplement the efforts of another,\u201d and \u201cabet\u201d as meaning \u201cto encourage, counsel, incite or instigate the commission of a crime.\u201d <em>State v. Newell, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 469, 378 A.2d 47 (App.Div.1977). The terms have frequently been used with the same meaning in civil law contexts. <em>See, e.g., Jaclyn, Inc. v. Edison Bros. Stores, Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>334, 368, 406 A.2d 474 (Law Div.1979); <em>Schneider v.

Stecker, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 191, 645 A.2d 1218 (App.Div.1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM5\">Recognition of claims for aiding and abetting liability is found in cases where one party \u201cknows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself.\u201d <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co., 25 N.J. </em>17, 29, 134 A.2d 761 (1957) (internal citations omitted). <em>See also In re Integrity Ins.

Consol. Dressed Beef Co., </em>579 A.2d 793, 799 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>930, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>318, 58 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>323 (1978); <em>Landy v. Federal Deposit Ins.

Ciasulli, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>70, 84-85, 853 A.2d 921 (2004), has interpreted the terms \u201caid\u201d and \u201cabet\u201d as found in section 12e of the Law Against Discrimination Act (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12e.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court held that \u00a7 876(b) of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1979) provides the proper standard by which to define the terms \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet\u201d under the LAD because \u201cthe <em>Restatement </em>definition is consistent with the common usage of those terms\u201d imposing concert liability on an individual if he \u201cknows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself.\u201d <em>Tarr, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 853 A.2d 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Section 876(b) of the <em>Restatement </em>defines the tort of aiding and abetting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">For harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">(a) does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a common design with him, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">(b) knows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">(c) gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and his own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to the third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\"><em>[Restatement, supra, </em>876(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">To impose liability the <em>Restatement </em>recites, \u201cit is essential that the conduct of the actor be in itself tortious. One who innocently, rightfully and carefully does an act that has the effect of furthering the tortious conduct or cooperating in the tortious design of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>another is not for that reason subject to liability.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>876(b) comment c. One court has suggested \u201cinaction\u201d could form the basis of aiding and abetting liability if it rose to the level of \u201cproviding substantial assistance or encouragement.\u201d <em>Failla v.

When both parties engage in the acts, each becomes subject to liability for the acts of the other.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 876(b) comment d. The standard is set above \u201cmere knowledge or implementation.\u201d <em>Herman v.

The defendant must share the same intent as the one who actually committed the offense.\u201d Id. at 424, 765 A.2d 217. <em>See also Alliance for Disabled in Action, Inc. v.

We conclude that an action against a defendant for the tort of aiding and abetting is cognizable and, further, we find the elements as found by the Court in <em>Tarr </em>equally apply to a non-LAD tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In the ease at hand, NJT\u2019s complaint alleges Andersen aided and advised Qwest in performing its fraudulent reporting of earnings to inflate its stock price which caused NJT injury in the form of multi-million dollar losses when the fraud was disclosed. NJT alleges that Andersen was \u201cgenerally aware of [its] role as part of the overall illegal [] activity\u201d because it was an active participant and helped perpetrate the fraud; and Andersen \u201cknowingly and substantially assisted]\u201d Qwest with the creation and implementation of fraudulent accounting schemes to implement the fraud. Thus, NJT pled the fundamental requisites of aiding and abetting fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">A claim for aiding and abetting fraud also requires proof of the underlying tort, that is, the fraud committed by Qwest. Before a court can determine whether NJT\u2019s complaint withstands Andersen\u2019s motion under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), further examination of the alleged fraud action must be made, in compliance with <em>Rule </em>4:5-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">A complaint sounding in fraud, must on its face, satisfy the requirements of <em>Rule </em>4:5-8. The heightened fraud pleading requirements set forth in the Rule provide the \u201cparticulars of the wrong, with dates and items if necessary, shall be stated insofar as practicable. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be alleged generally.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:5-8(a). A court may dismiss a complaint alleging fraud if \u201cthe allegations do not set forth with specificity, nor do they constitute as pleaded, satisfaction of the elements of legal or equitable fraud.\u201d <em>Levinson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>v.

Whale, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>619, 624-25, 432 A.2d 521 (1981)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Paragraphs 411 to 442 of the Amended Complaint list facts, known before discovery, asserting Andersen\u2019s actions in presenting and propagating the fraudulent accounting reporting to advance Qwest\u2019s objective of increasing its stock value so an investor, like NJT, would increase its investment, to its detriment. The allegations are not merely that Andersen failed to detect Qwest\u2019s alleged fraudulent reporting of revenue and expenses, but that it actually facilitated the known fraud. NJT argues further discovery will provide the specificity of Andersen\u2019s acts. NJT\u2019s argument is tenable. Prior to discovery in any meaningful sense, NJT is hardly able to plead the precise culpable conduct of Andersen. Nevertheless, the complaint identifies numerous public statements containing false facts, allegedly known to be false by Andersen when reported. Finally, plaintiff alleges the elements of reliance and injury flowing from Andersen\u2019s allegedly fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Accepting the facts in the pleadings as true, giving NJT \u201cthe benefit of the most favorable inferences\u201d when reviewing these allegations, NJT sufficiently states the requisites of the cause of action to defeat a motion to dismiss under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). We reject Andersen\u2019s contention that NJT\u2019s claim of common-law fraud should be dismissed because NJT failed to plead the cause of action with particularity. <em>R. </em>4:5-8(a). An indulgent reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the allegations in the amended complaint satisfies us that NJT has stated the necessary elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Turning to the cause of action alleging a civil conspiracy between Qwest, its officers and Andersen, the necessary proofs must show</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201ca combination of two or more persons acting in concert to commit an unlawful act, or to commit a lawful act by unlawful means, the principal element of which is an agreement between the parties to inflict a wrong against or injury upon another, and an overt act that results in damage.\u201d <em>Morgan v.
