Having so resolved this jurisdictional dispute, we affirm the Merit System Board\u2019s determination that plaintiff engaged in unbecoming conduct and that a six-month suspension\u2014and not termination as directed by the assignment judge and sought by the City\u2014was an appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">Michelle Thurber (plaintiff) had been employed by the City as a deputy municipal court administrator for approximately ten years when she was stopped by Officer Larry Robb in Cherry Hill at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>approximately 2:00 a.m. on September 16, 2000. The record indicates that plaintiff either made or received cell phone calls while the officer was attempting to talk with her. She said during this encounter that she suffered from anxiety or panic attacks and, as Officer Robb and Officer Timothy Tedeseo attempted to handcuff her, plaintiff indeed began screaming and pulling away. Once handcuffed and in the back of the police vehicle, plaintiff kicked out a side window and attempted to escape through the broken window. She eventually calmed down. Plaintiff was taken to the police station, where two breathalyzer tests indicated she had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 and 0.11. She was charged with speeding, driving while under the influence, criminal mischief and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The following Monday, plaintiff met with the City\u2019s administrator, who later circulated a memorandum that indicated he told plaintiff that he \u201cconsidered] such behavior both serious and ... unacceptable,\u201d and that the City would make available counseling and substance abuse programs as she might require. No other action regarding plaintiffs employment status was then taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">On October 10, 2000, however, the assignment judge wrote to the City\u2019s mayor and council, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">As you are undoubtedly aware, Ms. Thurber has been charged with numerous offenses by the Cherry Hill Police on September 16, 2000. As a result, and being fully cognizant of her presumption of innocence, I am exercising my authority as Assignment Judge of Burlington County pursuant to Rule 1:33-4 to temporarily remove her from the Municipal Court in Burlington City, effective immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">I leave to your sound discretion and good judgment whether to suspend her with or without pay, or to employ her in another capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The mayor wrote to plaintiff on October 12, 2000, acknowledging receipt of the assignment judge\u2019s letter and indicating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">The City ... shares the concern as expressed by [the assignment judge]. Until the charges have been disposed, your employment with the City ... is suspended, with pay, effective immediately. Once the charges have been disposed, a final decision regarding your employment will be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">On January 17, 2001, plaintiff pled guilty to reckless driving, which resulted in a 120-day suspension of her driving privileges, and also to disturbing the peace in violation of a Cherry Hill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ordinance, which resulted in a $1,000 fine. Although not clearly disclosed by the record, we assume that the driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest and criminal mischief charges were then dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The next day, the assignment judge was advised of the outcome of the charges and, as a result, he sua sponte entered an order on January 23, 2001, which required plaintiff to show cause on February 20, 2001 why \u201cshe should not be permanently removed from the position as Deputy Court Administrator.\u201d Plaintiffs attorney immediately responded, seeking written notice of the specific administrative charge to which plaintiff was to respond, citing <em>Nicoletta v. No. Jersey District Water Supply Comm\u2019n, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>145, 163, 390 A.2d 90 (1978) (holding that \u201cthe first prerequisite of due process is fair notice, so that a response can be prepared and the respondent fairly heard\u201d). A few days later, the assignment judge wrote to the city solicitor to advise that he was \u201cwithdrawing, for the time being, my order to show cause\u201d; the judge, however, gave the City further direction regarding plaintiffs employment status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">Inasmuch as Ms. Thurber is protected by a contract of employment, I am directing you as [city] solicitor ... to inform the Mayor and Council to take disciplinary action against her as [a] result of the municipal court charges in Cherry Hill Township. The Council is to appoint a hearing officer who may not be a Municipal Court Judge to hear the charges against her and to render written findings and conclusion. Thereafter, based upon the facts which have been established at a hearing, I will renew my order to show cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In response to this direction, the City issued a preliminary notice of disciplinary action, charging plaintiff with \u201cconduct unbecoming a public employee\u201d as a result of the September 16, 2000 events \u201cwhich led to [her] conviction of offenses in the Cherry Hill municipal court.\u201d This unbecoming conduct was described in the notice as including: her \u201crefusal to perform field sobriety tests as directed\u201d; her making and receiving of cell phone calls while the Cherry Hill officer was attempting to conduct an investigation; her refusal to be handcuffed and her struggle with the Cherry Hill officers after being informed she was under arrest; her resistance after being placed in the patrol car; her damaging a police car by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>kicking <em>out </em>a rear passenger window; and her attempt to escape from custody through the broken window.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The City appointed an attorney (the hearing officer) to conduct a hearing into these accusations. The record does not indicate whether plaintiff had any input into the selection of the hearing officer. At this proceeding, the hearing officer received the testimony of the Cherry Hill police officers regarding the September 16, 2000 events. Plaintiff chose not to present any evidence except for an expert report written by Dr. Roberta Ball, which was provided along with her attorney\u2019s written summation, and which indicated that plaintiff suffered from panic attacks of a nature similar to what occurred when she was arrested on September 16, 2000. In the words of her attorney, this medical evidence was \u201cnot offered in mitigation of the events testified to by the officers ... [but] rather, it is offered as substantial evidence of the precipitating cause of her actions on September 16, [2000], and points to the complete absence of any voluntary misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In his May 8, 2001 written findings, the hearing officer concluded, as was undisputed, that plaintiff engaged in the conduct described by the officers, and, in addition, found plaintiffs expert to be unreliable and the expert opinion as having no bearing on the circumstances alleged. He recommended that, as a result, plaintiffs \u201cemployment with the City ... be terminated and specifically that her employment as the Deputy Court Administrator ... be terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The next day, May 9, 2001, the assignment judge wrote to advise the City that he had reviewed the hearing officer\u2019s \u201creasoning very carefully\u201d and concluded that it was \u201csound.\u201d It is not clear to us whether the assignment judge had access to a transcript of the testimony taken by the hearing officer, the written submissions provided by the parties to the hearing officer or plaintiffs expert report. We assume that the parties had no opportunity to argue to the assignment judge regarding the merits of the hearing officer\u2019s decision, or the process that generated it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>because the assignment judge rendered his decision the day after the hearing officer issued his findings. As a result of his view of the \u201csoundness\u201d of the hearing officer\u2019s findings, the assignment judge \u201cdirected\u201d the City to terminate plaintiff \u201cfrom her position as Deputy Court Administrator.\u201d The judge further advised that his decision was made \u201cindependently in my capacity as Assignment Judge and is not intended to influence or affect any decision of yours as a public employer pursuant to the Civil Service laws of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">On May 9, 2001, the City\u2019s mayor wrote to plaintiff to notify her that effective the close of business on May 14, 2001, plaintiff was \u201cterminated from employment with the City.\u201d This letter advised that \u201c[tjhis action was based on the findings and recommendation of [the hearing officer] in his ruling of May 8, 2001.\u201d The mayor made no mention of the assignment judge\u2019s directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">On May 21, 2001, plaintiff appealed the City\u2019s determination to terminate her employment to the Merit System Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">On July 16, 2001, the City issued another preliminary notice of disciplinary action, charging \u201cother sufficient cause for discipline,\u201d namely, the assignment judge\u2019s May 9, 2001 directive that plaintiff be removed from her position as deputy municipal court administrator. On August 14, 2001, the City issued a final notice of determination on these newer charges, and again determined that removal from employment was appropriate. Plaintiff appealed this decision to the Merit System Board as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">A few days later, on August 17, 2001, the assignment judge wrote to the City regarding the \u201cgreat confusion\u201d caused by his May 9, 2001 letter, which he sought to alleviate by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">After reviewing the report and recommendation of .. the hearing officer, I concluded that Ms. Thurber was not fit to continue in the position of Deputy Court Administrator in Burlington City, a conclusion which I continued to hold. However, my use of the word \u201ctermination\u201d has obviously been misconstrued. I am simply directing that Ms. Thurber be removed from her position in the Municipal Court. The issue of her continued employment in the City of Burlington in some other capacity is solely within your authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The assignment judge directed that the second notice of disciplinary action should be withdrawn \u201cbecause it is simply unnecessary\u201d and that the case \u201cshould proceed before the Office of Administrative Law as a contested matter, and you will thereafter decide what action you will take, if any.\u201d Not heeding this direction, the City decided not to voluntarily dismiss or withdraw this second charge, apparently because the position of deputy municipal court administrator, as its attorney later wrote, \u201cdid not ... qualify her for any other City position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">These appeals to the Merit System Board were transferred to the Office of Administrative Law. Initially, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) heard argument regarding the consolidation of plaintiffs appeals and the City\u2019s motion for summary disposition. The ALJ issued a written decision on March 20, 2003, ordering that the appeals be consolidated and rejecting the City\u2019s argument that, because plaintiff worked in the municipal court, she did not have a right to appeal the City\u2019s actions to the Merit System Board. Relying upon <em>R. </em>1:33-4, the ALJ held that although the assignment judge, as the Chief Justice\u2019s representative, had the final authority over personnel in the municipal courts within the vicinage, \u201cthat does not mean that she is or remains unfit for any other municipal employment.\u201d As a result, the ALJ concluded that a hearing would thereafter be conducted regarding the September 16, 2000 incident and the City\u2019s decision to terminate plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">On June 23 and 30, 2003, the ALJ heard the testimony of Officers Robb and Tedesco, plaintiff, and Dr. Ball. On August 16, 2004, the ALJ rendered a thorough written decision, containing his findings of fact and legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">In examining the evidence regarding what transpired on September 16, 2000, the ALJ found there was no dispute that plaintiff was under the influence of alcohol at the time she was pulled over for speeding, during the events that transpired at the site of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>motor vehicle stop, and while she was processed at the Cherry Hill Police Department. He held that plaintiff registered 0.10 and 0.11 blood alcohol content (BAC) readings on a breathalyzer, which \u201cconclusively established] that [plaintiff] was, at least in the eyes of the law, under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The ALJ observed that there was also \u201ca significant dispute\u201d about whether Xanax played any role in plaintiffs behavior on September 16, 2000. He stated in his written decision that \u201cOfficer Tedesco testified credibly that he heard [plaintiff] decline to perform the field sobriety tests, \u2018staffing] in effect that she could not do the tests because she suffered from panic attacks,\u2019 \u201d and that Officer Tedesco also heard plaintiff state \u201c \u2018that she was on Xanex [sic] and she refused to perform[] any more tests.\u2019\u201d The ALJ found that Officer Tedesco was \u201ca very credible witness\u201d and that he had \u201clittle if any doubt that he heard [plaintiff] say she was \u2018on\u2019 Xanax.\u201d The ALJ, however, found that there were \u201cany number of plausible reasons for her having said it,\u201d including that she said it in the \u201chope of not having to take the field sobriety tests and go home with just a speeding ticket in hand.\u201d This and other plausible, conflicting reasons for plaintiffs statement regarding the ingestion of Xanax led the ALJ to conclude that he could not find by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff had ingested Xanax at or about the time of the incident. He also observed that, even if he had found otherwise, there was no evidence regarding the amount of Xanax taken or whether or to what extent it may have contributed to her behavior. And, lastly, the ALJ concluded that he was persuaded by Dr. Ball\u2019s \u201cuncontro-verted testimony that [plaintiffs] conduct was not consistent with someone who had mixed Xanax and alcohol.\u201d As a result, the ALJ determined that there was no legitimate or persuasive explanation for plaintiffs \u201csudden Jekyll/Hyde-like\u201d change in demean- or other than the explanation provided by Dr. Ball\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Dr. Ball testified as to the nature of panic attacks and opined that plaintiff suffered from such an attack during the police encounter on September 16, 2000. The ALJ thoroughly explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Dr. Ball\u2019s description of the nature and cause of panic attacks in his written decision, including his following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">Dr. Ball described a panic attack as \"a sudden surge of mounting psychological arousal that can occur \u2018out of the blue\u2019 or in response to encountering a phobic situation.\u201d Physical symptoms present at the onset of an attack may include heart palpitations, tightening in the chest or shortness of breath, choking sensations, dizziness, faintness, sweating, trembling, shaking and/or tingling in the hands and feet. Concomitant psychological reactions often include fears of having a life-threatening illness, \u201cgoing crazy,\u201d or losing control. During an intense panic attack, an individual may feel very confused and disoriented, and experience an intense urge to run away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">Dr. Ball went on to explain that panic attacks can be triggered by a \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, or can be completely spontaneous. In a spontaneous panic attack, the body experiences exactly the same physiological flight reaction that it would in a truly life-threatening situation. Although the causes of spontaneous panic attacks remain unknown, it is clear that individuals who have been undergoing prolonged stress or have recently suffered a significant loss are much more prone to experience them than the average person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">Whether the initial cause is apparent or spontaneous, it is how the individual perceives and responds to the physiological changes that will determine if he or she has a full-blown attack. As a general rule, people who panic are likely to become preoccupied with the changes in their bodies or moods, and will have an increased tendency to interpret slight aberrations as being dangerous or catastrophic. Should the panic develop into a full-blown attack, the long-term effect is likely to be traumatic, leaving the individual feeling terrified and helpless, with strong anticipatory anxiety about a possible recurrence. As a result, the feelings of panic are recurrent, even in those individuals who have been in remission, although the frequency of recurrence varies among individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Dr. Ball concluded that plaintiff suffered a \u201csevere\u201d panic and anxiety attack on the night of September 16, 2000. Dr. Ball was persuaded to this view, and the ALJ persuaded to Dr. Ball\u2019s view, by the fact that plaintiff \u201chad lost control of her bowels while the police officers were attempting to cuff her,\u201d which was, in the ALJ\u2019s words, \u201cthe physiological reaction of an individual experiencing an intense amount of fear.\u201d In summarizing his findings, the ALJ held that \u201c[g]iven Dr. Ball\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, a BAC of between 0.10 and 0.11, and the absence of evidence establishing that [plaintiff] actually ingested a finite quantity of Xanax while under the influence, the only logical explanation for [plaintiffs] conduct is that she did, indeed, suffer an intense panic and anxiety attack [and] [consequently, she should not be held responsible for the combative and violent conduct in which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>engaged after the officers placed her under arrest and attempted to handcuff her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The ALJ, however, held that this panic attack did not explain or excuse her earlier conduct. Prior to the panic attack, as the ALJ found, plaintiff was able to: drive over the speed limit; ignore Officer Robb\u2019s repeated directives for her to put down her phone; call another police officer instead of complying with Officer Robb\u2019s orders; ask Officer Robb why he asked her to exit the vehicle; have another discussion on her cell phone; and recite the alphabet correctly during the field sobriety test. Considering that plaintiff held a responsible position in the judicial system and was expected to meet a high standard of conduct, the ALJ concluded that plaintiffs conduct prior to the panic attack \u201cwas contumacious and exhibited a lack of respect for a police officer,\u201d and he held that the City demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiffs conduct, \u201cfrom the time she was stopped up to the point she was placed under arrest and was about to be handcuffed,\u201d represented conduct unbecoming a public employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In turning to the discipline to be imposed, the ALJ found that plaintiff was to be considered \u201cas having no prior disciplinary record,\u201d because she testified that she had a spotless record and, although the City argued to the contrary, the City presented no evidence of an alleged prior written reprimand. As a result of Ms findings as to what occurred on September 16, 2000, and the impact of plaintiffs panic attack on a portion of her conduct that night, the ALJ determined that removal was inconsistent with the doctrine of progressive discipline and drew the following conclusions regarding what he believed would be a more appropriate discipline justified by the circumstances he found to have occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">As a deputy municipal court clerk, [plaintiff] comes into daily contact with members of the public, including those who had been arrested for driving under the influence. She must be made to understand that as a public official and, more significantly, as a judicial employee, she is held to a higher standard and must avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Therefore, upon considering all of [plaintiffs] pre-arrest actions as one overall course of conduct, I have concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that even though she does not have a prior disciplinary record, a six-month suspension is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The ALJ also determined that plaintiff was entitled to back pay, as well as all other employment benefits, and such counsel fees as the Merit System Board might deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision were filed. The Merit System Board, in its written decision of May 5, 2005, decided to adopt the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law in all respects, except that it did not adopt the conclusion, more fully discussed in the ALJ\u2019s initial March 20, 2003 decision, that the Board did not have the ability \u201cto reinstate [plaintiff] to the Deputy Municipal Court Administrator title in the City\u2019s municipal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The Board thoroughly reviewed the circumstances and concluded that it was authorized to direct the reinstatement of plaintiff to her position as deputy municipal court administrator. In this regard, the Board concluded that it had jurisdiction, emphasizing that \u201cthe City ..., <em>not </em>the Judiciary, is the appointing authority for municipal court personnel,\u201d and that it is the Board which is specifically authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>llA:2-6(a)(l) to render the final administrative decision on appeals concerning permanent career service employees in situations involving potential removal. The Board did not dismiss the significance of <em>R. </em>1:33-4, which expresses the authority of the assignment judge\u2014as the Chief Justice\u2019s representative\u2014over the supervision, superintendence, and allocation of judges and personnel having a support function in the vicinage. But the Board also considered the historical \u201ccollaborative effort\u201d between the judiciary and the Board in similar circumstances in concluding that it had jurisdiction to reinstate plaintiff to her former position with the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">In this last respect, the Board observed, among other things, that in 1993 the Board had ordered the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop new job specifications for the title of municipal court administrator and municipal court director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>jointly with the former County and Municipal Government Services Division (CMGS), and in consultation with the Administrative Office of the Courts. The Board observed that by 1995 the OPM and CMGS developed \u201cnew standards for approval of appointments to the titles of Municipal Court Administrator and Director,\u201d and also that \u201cthese standards were developed as a result of the establishment of a joint team consisting of representatives of OPM and CMGS, and the Administrative Office of the Courts,\u201d and that this joint team developed job specifications for \u201cthe <em>unclassified </em>titles of Municipal Court Director and Deputy Municipal Court Director (First Class City); and for the <em>career service </em>titles of Assistant Municipal Court Director, Chief Municipal Court Administrator, Assistant Chief Municipal Court Administrator, Municipal Court Administrator, and <em>Deputy Municipal Court Administrator.\u201d </em>Viewing the adoption of these job specifications by this joint team, the Board held that the unmistakable intent of all involved, including the Administrative Office of the Courts, was that the Board would be empowered to grant full and meaningful relief to career service employees holding such positions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Given this level of participation by the AOC in this project, in which the catalyst was the question surrounding appointments to the unclassified service within the Municipal Court title series, it appears that the AOC was satisfied in 1995 that the Deputy Municipal Court Administrator title should be allocated to the career, rather than unclassified service. In this regard, it is noted that <em>R. </em>1:33-4, including paragraph (e), authorizing the appointment and discharge authority for judicial support personnel within the vicinage, was in effect prior to the joint evaluation of the standards required for appointment to either the unclassified or career service title. As such, since the AOC participated in the evaluation and recommendations surrounding appointments to this title series, had it not wanted incumbents in the Deputy Municipal Court Administrator title to serve in the career service, with the appeal rights to the Board associated with such an appointment, it is likely that issue would have surfaced in 1995. As such, since [plaintiffs] title is a career service title, the Board\u2019s authority in these matters is not just limited to what amounts to pro forma appeal rights for the sake of the appearance of due process. Rather, in order for an appellant to be provided with a meaningful remedy as a result of the appeal process, the Board must be empowered to provide the same remedies available for all other career service employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The Board also based its conclusion that it was authorized to order the reinstatement of plaintiff to her former position on the Legislature\u2019s enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:ll-5(a), which directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>that \u201c[s]ubject to the judiciary\u2019s rights to create new unclassified positions and make unclassified appointments under court rule,\u201d and subject to other exceptions not relevant here, \u201cthe judiciary\u2019s personnel practices shall be governed by the State Government Services provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes and the rules promulgated thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Thus finding that it was empowered to grant complete relief, the Board concluded that a six-month suspension was appropriate, that plaintiff was entitled to mitigated back pay, as well as all other benefits and seniority rights, but not counsel fees, and that the City was required to \u201cimmediately reinstate [plaintiff] to her permanent position\u201d as deputy municipal court administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The City filed a notice of appeal with this court on June 17, 2005; plaintiff filed a notice of cross-appeal soon after. We also permitted the Judiciary and the assignment judge (hereafter collectively \u201cthe Judiciary\u201d) to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The City moved for a stay pending appeal. The Board denied the motion, and ordered the City to take steps to immediately reinstate plaintiff to her position with the municipal court. We denied the City\u2019s motion for a stay on November 2,2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">A few days later, plaintiff petitioned the Board for enforcement of its final order. On December 21, 2005, the Board directed the City to reinstate plaintiff to her position as deputy municipal court administrator no later than January 3, 2006 for reasons set forth in a written opinion. On January 2, 2006 we granted the Judiciary\u2019s emergent application, but we limited our emergent order solely to preventing plaintiffs \u201cphysical ] return\u201d to her place of employment and subject also to the submission of briefs by the parties on an expedited schedule. Following the presentation of a formal motion, and the submission of briefs from all interested parties, on January 30, 2006, we continued the terms of our prior limited stay pending the disposition of this appeal; we also accelerated this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>A motion for direct certification was denied by <em>the </em>Supreme Court on June 9, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In this appeal, the City and the Judiciary contend that the Board\u2019s exercise of authority over the disciplining of plaintiff was unconstitutional and in violation <em>of </em>the assignment judge\u2019s prerogatives, as delineated in <em>R. </em>1:33-4. They also argue that, even if permitted to act in this matter, the Board\u2019s findings were erroneous and the sanction imposed was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. Plaintiff argues in her cross-appeal that the six-month suspension was excessive. We conclude (a) that the Board was authorized to review the City\u2019s termination of plaintiff and empowered to mandate the reinstatement of plaintiff to her position with the City as deputy municipal court administrator, (b) that we should defer to the Board\u2019s findings of fact because they are supported by the evidence in the record, and (c) that the six-month suspension imposed by the Board was commensurate with its findings as to the plaintiffs unbecoming conduct and entitled to our deference. Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s final decision in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The judiciary\u2019s control over the administration of the courts and the complex relationship generated by the impact of that constitutionally based principle on personnel and labor concerns has been thoroughly explained elsewhere, <em>see, e.g., In re P.L.2001, Chapter 362, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>368, 895 A.2d 1128 (2006); <em>In the Matter of Judges of Passaic County, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>352, 495 A.2d 848 (1985); <em>Knight v. City of Margate, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>374, 431 A.2d 833 (1981); <em>Passaic County Probation Officers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. County of Passaic, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>247, 374 A.2d 449 (1977), and need not be repeated or revisited here in any great depth. To briefly summarize, the primary reason for the adoption of a new constitution in 1947 was the people\u2019s desire \u201cto establish a simple but fully integrated system of courts and to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the judiciary the power and thus to impose on them the responsibility for seeing that the judicial system functioned effectively in the public interest.\u201d <em>Winberry v. Salisbury, 5 N.J. </em>240, 244, 74 A.2d 406, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 <em>U.S. </em>877, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>638 (1950). In reorganizing its judicial system through the adoption of the 1947 constitution, in the words of Dean Pound, the people of New Jersey exchanged \u201cAmerica\u2019s worst court system for America\u2019s best.\u201d <em>Passaic County Probation Officers\u2019, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 253 n. 4, 374 A.2d 449 (quoting 31 <em>Judicature </em>131 (1948)). Since the establishment of our fully integrated judicial system, our courts have wrestled with the \u201cextremely subtle and complex\u201d labor and personnel problems as affected by the judiciary\u2019s need to effectively manage the courts. <em>Passaic County Judges, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 357, 495 A.2d 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Municipal courts, of course, are included within the scope of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d defined in Article VI, Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, which is vested in the Supreme Court, the Superior Court, \u201cand other courts of limited jurisdiction,\u201d see <em>Knight, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 384-85, 431 A.2d 833; see <em>also In re Yengo, </em>72 <em>N.J. 425, </em>434-35, 371 A.2d 41 (1977); <em>In re Matter a, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>259, 266, 168 A.2d 38 (1961), and are thus encompassed by the Court\u2019s rules and policies. In fulfilling the constitutional mandate to \u201cmake rules governing the administration of all courts in the State,\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VI, \u00a7 2, 113, the Supreme Court established that the assignment judge\u2014subject to the rules of court and subject to the direction of the Chief Justice, who is \u201cthe administrative head of all the courts in the State,\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VI, \u00a7 7, 111\u2014plays a large role in carrying out the policies and directives necessary to insure the efficient management of the judicial system within the vicinage. <em>B. </em>1:33^1 memorializes the extent to which the Court has delegated its authority to assignment judges. That rule states, among other things, that the assignment judge \u201cshall be the authorized representative of the Chief Justice for the efficient and economic management of all courts within the vicinage,\u201d thus enveloping \u201call such matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>affecting county and municipal governments, including but not limited to budgets, personnel, and facilities.\u201d <em>B. </em>l:33-4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Despite this broad description of powers, not every personnel decision lies within the assignment judge\u2019s discretion nor should be determined through resort to the process envisioned in <em>B. </em>1:33-4. As noted, the scope of the assignment judge\u2019s powers are limited by the policies of the Supreme Court and, even when a personnel matter may fall within the limits of <em>B. </em>1:33\u20144, there are also circumstances that suggest deferral to administrative agencies. Having closely examining the issues raised in this appeal, we conclude that the Supreme Court did not intend that an assignment judge engage in a dispute concerning such a municipal employee\u2019s alleged unbecoming conduct and the discipline to be imposed and, also, that the Merit System Board\u2019s existing procedures and its considerable expertise in such matters warranted deferral, as a matter of comity, to the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">As we have indicated, the scope of the assignment judge\u2019s authority is encircled by the directions and policies of the Supreme Court. Of keen relevance in this regard is Directive # 8-87, adopted by the Court in 1987, which established the \u201cuniform minimum standards and conditions\u201d required by <em>B. </em>l:33-4(e), and which limited appointments in the \u201cjudiciary unclassified service\u201d and the \u201cappointing] and discharging][of] judicial support personnel within the vicinage\u201d to three categories: (1) \u201c[k]ey members of the management teams in the vicinage,\u201d who have \u201csignificant administrative responsibilities, e.g., establishing and enforcing policies, preparing budgets, setting work goals, objectives, priorities and determining needs, and assigning staff,\u201d (2) direct and confidential support employees to the judges, and (3) positions of a highly technical nature with duties or requirements for which regular selection procedures are not viable. These descriptions do not remotely encompass deputy municipal court administrators, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We also observe, as the Merit System Board recognized, that there is a considerable history of cooperation between the Department of Personnel and the Administrative Office of the Courts in allocating job titles to either the unclassified service or career service. The record on appeal includes not only directive # 8-87 but also past correspondence between the Director of the AOC and the DOP, and other memoranda and reports, which demonstrate a working relationship between the courts and these departments despite the potential for conflict between the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional authority to \u201cmake rules governing the administration of all courts in the State,\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VI, \u00a7 2,113, and the appointment, promotion and discipline of employees according to merit and fitness, which serves as the basis for the merit system contained in the New Jersey Civil Service Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:2-1 to -24. As a result, we are satisfied that the Court did not intend to have the powers enumerated in <em>R. </em>1:33-4 envelop this particular disciplinary matter or others like it. That the authority to consider the removal or other significant sanction on a deputy municipal court administrator lies with the Merit System Board is further demonstrated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:ll-5(a), which declares that other than certain judicial employees that would not include plaintiff, \u201cthe judiciary\u2019s personnel practices shall be governed by the State Government Services provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes and the rules promulgated thereunder.\u201d This statute was enacted over ten years ago, without any known attack on its constitutionality since.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Principles of comity have also been applied by our Supreme Court in permitting the resolution of personnel and labor conflicts by administrative agencies other than the judiciary. In <em>Judges of Passaic County, </em>the Court held that, in considering whether the county or the judiciary was to be designated as the employer for collective bargaining purposes, \u201cthe appropriate solution is to ask, as a matter of comity, that [the Public Employment Relations Commission] address the factual issues raised\u201d in order that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>competing concerns of the judiciary and the County will be afforded a hearing before as detached and impartial a panel as can be provided.\u201d 100 <em>N.J. </em>at 367, 495 A.2d 848. Indeed, the Court\u2019s willingness to consider the views of other branches of government in personnel matters extends to its deferral to statutory enactments that impact upon public employees involved in the administration of justice. In this sense, although recognizing that the constitutional mandate to make rules governing the administration of all courts in the State \u201ctranscends the power of the Legislature to enact statutes governing those public employees properly considered an integral part of the court system,\u201d the Court has, in the same breath, engaged in a practice, since 1948, \u201cwith only occasional deviation, to accept and adopt legislative arrangements that have not in any way interfered with this Court\u2019s constitutional obligation\u201d in Article VI, Section 2, Paragraph 3. <em>Passaic Cty. Probation Officers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 255, 374 A.2d 449. <em>See also CWA Local 1044 v. Chief Justice, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>495, 501, 572 A.2d 613 (1990) (holding that, \u201cin the spirit of comity,\u201d it is the Court\u2019s \u201cpolicy that when a statute has an impact on our administration, we will follow it unless it interferes with the effective functioning of the courts\u201d). In <em>CWA Local 1044, </em>the Court observed that the \u201creams of statutory material with which we have complied overwhelm the few instances when we have gone our own way.\u201d 118 <em>N.J. </em>at 501, 572 A.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In considering the location of the line between the assignment judge\u2019s authority over judicial personnel within the vicinage\u2019s municipal courts and the authority of the Merit System Board over career service employees, we also consider the principles of comity referred to by the Supreme Court and whether the Board\u2019s exercise of authority over plaintiff, a deputy municipal court administrator, does or does not interfere with the administration of justice in the vicinage. In our judgment, the shared interests of the judiciary and the Merit System Board in both protecting employees from arbitrary removal and in securing the staffing and management of municipal court personnel that serves, and does not prejudice, the administration of justice\u2014coupled with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Board\u2019s considerable expertise in personnel matters\u2014warrants our determination that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over the dispute must take precedence. Indeed, we observe that the assignment judge altered his initial approach to the problem, later indicating to the City that his determination to preclude plaintiff from working in the municipal court did not extend to plaintiffs continued employment by the City. The latter aspect, he observed, was a matter to be resolved by the Merit System Board. The assignment judge, in short, recognized the limits on the scope of <em>R. </em>1:33\u2014 4 over a municipal court employee such as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Deferral to the procedures of the Merit System Board, as a matter of comity, is further warranted when recognizing the Board\u2019s considerable experience and its existing procedures as compared to the absence of a methodology for the assignment judge, in such a circumstance, to resolve such a dispute. Here, the assignment judge, in an ad hoc manner, directed the City to appoint an attorney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to conduct a hearing into what occurred on September 16, 2000, and then reviewed those findings without providing the parties with an opportunity to be heard. On the other hand, a forum for a full examination of the September 16, 2000 incident was provided by the Merit System Board; a plenary hearing was conducted by the ALJ, and his findings were thoroughly reviewed by the Merit System Board, an administrative agency which has extensive experience in such matters. The availability of these procedures thus presented yet another reason for the deferral as a matter of comity to the Board in this matter. <em>See, e.g., Hinfey v. Matawan Reg. Bd. of Educ., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>514, 532, 391 A.2d 899 (1978) (holding that \u201c[cjomity and deference to cognate tribunals are designed to assure that a controversy, or its most critical facets, will be resolved by the forum or body which, on a comparative scale, is in the best position by virtue of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>statutory status, administrative competence and regulatory expertise to adjudicate the matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">For all these reasons, we conclude that, although the line is not always clear as to when an assignment judge may exercise jurisdiction over a disciplinary matter involving a municipal court employee, principles of comity strongly suggest that the Judiciary should defer to the administrative competence and regulatory expertise of the Merit System Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Since we have determined that jurisdiction over the City\u2019s attempt to terminate plaintiff resided with the Merit System Board, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2B:ll-5(a), and, in any event, that principles of comity require deferral to the Merit System Board\u2019s jurisdiction over this disciplinary matter, we hold that we have jurisdiction over the Merit System Board\u2019s final decision, <em>see R. </em>2:2\u20143(a)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, thus, consider whether we should defer to the Board\u2019s findings relating to plaintiffs conduct on September 16, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In reviewing such a determination, we apply the familiar standard governing the review of final agency decisions. That is, we recognize that a \u201cstrong presumption of reasonableness attaches to the actions of administrative agencies,\u201d <em>Matter of Vey, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 205, 639 A.2d 724 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>306, 639 A.2d 718 (1994), and that a reviewing court will not ordinarily upset a determination by an administrative agency, such as the Merit System Board, \u201cin the absence of a showing that it was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or that it lacked fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>support in the evidence, or that it violated legislative policies express or implicit in the Civil Service Act,\u201d <em>Campbell v. Dep't of Civil Service, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In an earlier portion of this opinion, we described the circumstances surrounding the September 16, 2000 incident, and the detailed findings rendered by the ALJ and adopted by the Merit System Board. These findings included the determination that plaintiff was intoxicated at the time of the motor vehicle stop, that she did not comply with the officers\u2019 directions, and that, as the police encounter progressed, plaintiff suffered a panic attack, which led to the more egregious conduct urged by the City and the Judiciary as a reason for her termination. The ALJ found that the pre-panic attack circumstances justified a finding of conduct unbecoming and sustained the City\u2019s contentions in that regard. The ALJ found, however, that plaintiffs suffering of a panic attack during this police encounter warranted his conclusion that plaintiff \u201cshould not be held responsible for the combative and violent conduct in which she engaged after the officers placed her under arrest and attempted to handcuff her.\u201d All these conclusions find support in the evidence adduced during the hearing conducted by the ALJ. The ALJ made credibility findings based upon his observations of the witnesses, and the Board thoroughly reviewed and adopted those findings. As a reviewing court, which has not had the opportunity to observe the witnesses or judge their credibility, we are in no position to be dismissive of the findings underlying the Merit System Board\u2019s decision. It suffices to say that there is evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the findings which gird the Merit System Board\u2019s decision are arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, and we can find no substance in the contrary assertions of the City and the Judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We lastly turn to the Board\u2019s issuance of a six-month suspension without pay. The City and the Judiciary argue that this penalty was too lenient and only removal will alleviate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ostensible shock to the public\u2019s confidence in the administration of justice caused by plaintiffs unbecoming conduct on September 16, 2000. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the six-month suspension was too onerous. We reject both arguments and conclude that the Board\u2019s disposition of the matter was neither arbitrary, capricious nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The New Jersey Civil Service Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:2-1 to -24, protects classified employees from arbitrary removal from their position or other unreasonable sanctions imposed by the appointing authority. <em>See, e.g., Prosecutor\u2019s, Detectives and Investigators Ass\u2019n v. Hudson Cty. Bd. of Freeholders, </em>130 <em>N. J.Super. </em>30, 41, 324 A.2d 897 (App.Div.1974). In serious circumstances, the immediate removal of a classified employee may be appropriate, <em>Golaine v. Cardinale, </em>142 <em>N. J.Super. </em>385, 397, 361 A.2d 593 (Law Div.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 395 A.2d 218 (App.Div.1978), but progressive discipline is the norm because it better serves the goal of providing employees with job security by shielding them from arbitrary sanctions, <em>West New York v. Bock, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>500, 522-24, 186 A.2d 97 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In examining the propriety of the City\u2019s determination to terminate plaintiff and whether it comported with the practice of progressive discipline, the Board accurately concluded that the record is bereft of any evidence of the prior disciplining of plaintiff. In his August 16, 2004 written decision, the ALJ stated in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">[Plaintiff] contends that she has had no prior discipline and enjoys a \u201cspotless\u201d record. The City, on the other hand, makes reference to a prior written reprimand, although there is no evidence of it in the record. In any event, the difference is so negligible as to be meaningless and, for purposes of imposing discipline, [plaintiff] may be considered as having no prior disciplinary record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">This conclusion accurately describes the content of the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">In weighing the absence of any prior discipline of plaintiff of any sort and the significance of the conduct found to be unbecoming, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the ALJ properly viewed as excessive the City\u2019s decision to terminate this ten-year employee. He concluded that a six-month suspension would more than adequately redress plaintiffs breach of the high standard of conduct expected of a municipal court employee. The Board agreed with the ALJ\u2019s determination and we also agree, finding nothing arbitrary or capricious in these findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The ALJ observed that plaintiffs position with the municipal court implicitly included a \u201cstandard of good behavior which devolves upon one who stands in the public eye as an upholder of that which is morally and legally correct.\u201d This is undoubtedly true and supports the issuance of a six-month suspension without pay,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but we would draw the line there and doubt the reasonableness of any greater penalty when the unbecoming conduct in question consisted of speeding, driving while under the influence of alcohol, and failing to comply with the directions of a police officer. Indeed, we cannot square plaintiffs termination or the imposition of a lengthier suspension as the means of restoring the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary and those who work within the judicial system with the more lenient discipline imposed by the Supreme Court for the similar misconduct of municipal judges. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Richardson, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>355, 709 <em>A.2</em>d 197 (1998) (holding a public reprimand warranted for a municipal judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>convicted of driving while intoxicated); <em>Matter of Carton, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>330, 658 A.2d 1211 (1995) (holding a public reprimand warranted for a municipal judge who gave legal advice in a pending criminal matter and who sent a fax to another judge before whom that matter was then pending); <em>Matter of Blackman, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>547, 591 A.2d 1339 (1991) (holding a public reprimand warranted for a municipal judge\u2019s attendance at a social event hosted by a convicted felon).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The discordant sanction of termination\u2014which the City attempted to impose and which the City and Judiciary herein trumpet\u2014cannot be justified in these circumstances. We cannot find the words which would rationally explain why a greater sanction, let alone termination, is warranted for a deputy municipal court administrator when lesser sanctions have been imposed for similar misconduct by members of the judiciary, who play a larger role in the administration of justice, and, thus, are likely when engaging in such conduct to more seriously shake public confidence in the administration of justice, than caused by the similar misconduct of a municipal clerk. Accordingly, we conclude that the Merit System Board\u2019s issuance of a six-month suspension was reasonable and by no means arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-5\"> In light of our disposition of this appeal, we need not consider whether plaintiff's due process rights were violated by the City having been given the unilateral right to appoint a hearing officer whose findings played an overarching role in the City\u2019s decision to terminate plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\"> Were this not so, then this court would likely have no jurisdiction to review the assignment judge's determination that plaintiff should have been terminated from her position with the City's municipal court. There is nothing in the rules of court or the structure of the judiciary itself that would suggest that the Appellate Division has jurisdiction to review the personnel decisions of an assignment judge. In light of our disposition of this appeal, we need not decide this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> We observe that included within the record on appeal is a letter dated June 1, 2005, written by the City's municipal judge, containing a litany of allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>regarding plaintiff's conduct as deputy municipal court administrator since the municipal judge\u2019s appointment in 1995. This information was forwarded to the Board well after the City's decision to terminate, well after the ALJ closed the record and rendered his decision, and nearly one month after the Merit System Board rendered its final decision. Because it obviously should not, this hearsay information has not played a role in our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> We also observe that along with this suspension, plaintiff has been subjected to uncertainty about her position with the City for nearly six years. While a final decision has hung in the balance, plaintiff was required to secure other employment. Even though mitigated back pay and other benefits have been awarded, the uncertainty and delay implicit in the long course these proceedings have taken to reach this day have also been a form of discipline that should not be ignored in our review of the Board\u2019s final determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
