Proof of the notes and of appellant\u2019s failure to pay them was shown at trial, and the minor discrepancy between the amount proved at trial, based on six notes, and the amount claimed in the complaint, based on five notes, should have been anticipated by appellant, and does not require a new trial on the issue of damages <em>(see, Matter of Town of Lumberland v New York State Div. of Human Rights, </em>229 AD2d 631, 634; <em>Brook-Hattan Utils. v 893 Constr. Corp., </em>180 AD2d 660). Also inconsequential was the verdict\u2019s reference to the notes representing the $30,000 debt assumed by the corporate defendant and also guaranteed by appellant as due to \u201cplaintiff\u201d in the singular, it being clear that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>intended to award the sum of the amounts shown in all of such notes, and it is also being clear which portion of such sum was due to each of the plaintiffs. Plaintiff Sills\u2019 recovery is not precluded by the loss of the bearer notes that were given to him and his necessary reliance on photostatic copies thereof. However, he should have been required to post security to indemnify appellant from any future actions on these lost instruments (UCC 3-804), and we modify accordingly. We have considered appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Concur \u2014 Sullivan, J. P., Ellerin, Nardelli, Rubin and Mazzarelli, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
