Since the police action was legal, the weapon abandoned by appellant was not subject to suppression <em>(People v Matienzo, </em>81 NY2d 778).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress statements was properly denied. Since appellant\u2019s mother twice declined to go to the precinct after having been notified pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7 305.2 (3) of her son\u2019s arrest, the police were under no duty to advise her over the telephone of appellant\u2019s rights, prior to advising him of his rights <em>(Matter of Jermaine W., </em>210 AD2d 236).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">We have reviewed appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Concur \u2014 Lerner, P. J., Rubin, Williams, Mazzarelli and Andidas, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
