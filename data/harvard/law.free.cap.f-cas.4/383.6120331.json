The ship went to Mobile, and thence to New Orleans. At the latter port she was moored out of the precincts of the city, to prevent the libellant and other colored men of the crew being put in prison diming the stay of the ship there, according to the laws at that port After so remaining a few days, the libellant requested the defendant, the master of the ship, to procure him a berth on board another vessel going north, to relieve him from the danger of imprisonment at New Orleans. Such place was procured for him, and three other colored men of the crew. \u2014 berths on board the ships Egyptian and Trenton, one bound to New York, and the other to Boston. The libellant shipped accordingly on such vessel at the same rate of _ wages he was paid on the Hungarian, and sailed to this port.

It is considered by THE COURT: (1) That it was lawful and proper, under the facts of the case, for the defendant to discharge the li-bellant from the Hungarian at New Orleans, and that the arrangement was at the instance and for the benefit of the libellant. (2) That New Orleans is not a foreign country to the state of Maine, within the meaning of the act of congress of February 28. 1803 [2 Stat. 203] so that the libellant is not entitled on his discharge there, with his own consent, to three months\u2019 wages; nor was the consent of a consul or commercial agent to his discharge necessary, in order to render it valid. (3) That the libellant has been paid, by the defendant, in full, all the wages earned on board the Hungarian, and to which he is by law entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">Wherefore, it is ordered that the libel be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
