Brown was in the employment of Hon. Daniel Webster, then a senator of congress, at the time of the arrest, the act has no application to him, and affords no justification to the officer making the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Which the court refused to give, and said that the corporation has full authority to pass the law; and that the plaintiff, to come within the proviso and exception to the general principle of the law, must show that he exhibited the evidence of his exemption from its general provisions to the officer making the arrest, and upon the trial prove in evidence that he did so exhibit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Counsel for plaintiff moved for a new trial because the court misdirected the jury. Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
