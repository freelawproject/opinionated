History of the Claim. The petitioners claimed under the Baron de Bastrop, to whom it was represented that the Baron de Carondelet, on the 20th June, 1797,- had granted twelve leagues square, or more than a million of arpeas of land, and situated, according to the figurative plan of Don Carlos Trudeau, royal surveyor, in the port of Onchita, eighty leagues above the mouth of that river, adjoining on the part of the southwest the eastern shore of the river and bayous Ouchita, Bartholomew, and Siard, and giving a further description. The grant is principally situated in Louisiana, the smaller portion being situated in Chicot county, Arkansas, on the bayou Bartholomew. The history of the claim, will be found in full in the case of U. S. v. Philadelphia &amp; New Orleans, 11 How. [52 U. S.] 010, in the supreme court, on appeal from the district court of Louisiana, which was argued by Mr. Crittenden, attorney-general, for appellants, and Mr. Strawbridge, Mr. Soul\u00e9, and Mr. Sergeant, for the appellees. The supreme court, by Judges Taney, Catron, Daniel, Nelson, and Woodbury, decided the claim to be invalid, and rejected the same; Judges McLean, Wayne, McKinley, and Grier, dissenting. Ann M. Cal-lender et al. brought their petition in the district court of Louisiana for the confirmation of the de Bastrop grant, which was declared invalid by the supreme court. 11 How. [52 U.
