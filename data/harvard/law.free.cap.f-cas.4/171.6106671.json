She was then fitted as a privateer, but not armed, and had only eight or ten men on board. Some alterations were made to her in this port, but there was a contrariety in the evidence as to their applicability to purposes of war. Some time after her arrival in port, the collector was asked for his permission to arm, which was, of course, refused, and additional vigilance excited. When she was upon the point of sailing, the French consul applied by letter to the governor for leave that she might depart as a commissioned vessel. It was proved that she had increased her force of men from eight or ten to more than thirty, among whom were some American citizens. She sailed from hence \u00f3n the 7th of October, chased the Nancy on the 9th, and captured her on the 10th, at the distance of nearly 100 leagues from the bar of Charleston; at which time she had both cannon and swivels mounted. As she was unarmed when she came in here with her cargo, there was the most violent presumption that these guns were taken in here.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Aeh\">THE COURT was of opinion that this was such an augmentation of force in our ports as amounted to a breach of our neutrality and of the law of nations, and to a violation of the act of congress of June [5], 1794 [1 Stat. 383, 384, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 6], and restitution of the prize and her cargo was decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
