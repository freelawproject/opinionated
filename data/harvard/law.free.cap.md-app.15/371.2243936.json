Powers presiding without a jury, should be reversed because the trial judge was clearly in error when he found the prosecuting witness did not consent to the act of intercourse and because the state introduced certain testimony concerning polygraph tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">On February 24, 1971, Burnette made a date with Bonita Vernon, the prosecutrix, by telephone for later that evening. Although they had been on at least a couple of double dates previously, this was their first date with each other. Burnette picked up Miss Vernon at her apartment and then stopped to purchase a six-pack of beer. The testimony of the prosecutrix which bears directly upon the issue of consent was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">Q. \u201cAnd did there ever come a time when he stopped the car that you were in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">A. \u201cAside from buying the beer, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">Q. \u201cWhere was this ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">A. \u201cHe was going down a dead end and I said, \u2018Maurice, where are you going?\u2019 He said, T don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to turn around.\u2019 So he turned the car around but he stopped. He turned off the ignition. I said, \u2018You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u2019 And so then he tried to kiss me. So I let him kiss me one time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">Q. \u201cOkay, and after he kissed you one time what, if anything, did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>A. \u201cHe tried to make an advance. He tried to feel me up, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">Q. \u201cWhat do you mean feel you up ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">A. \u201cTried to feel my breast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Q. \u201cWhat happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">A. \u201cI asked him to stop. And then I said, T want to go home now.\u2019 He said, \u2018Why?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because I have got to go to work tomorrow.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll take you home. First you got to do what I want you to do.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">Q. \u201cWhat happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">A. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t believe him at first and I sat and I looked at him. He said. \u2018Okay, now, Bonnie, Take your pants off or I will.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No.\u2019 And he kept telling me, repeating this, \u2018I\u2019m not playing games now, take them off or I will.\u2019 I kept saying, \u2018Maurice, let\u2019s talk, let\u2019s talk.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Okay, Bonnie, what do you want to talk about?\u2019 I said, \u2018You know, why are you doing this?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Because I know you will never go out with me again.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, I will. Just take me home and I won\u2019t tell anybody if you won\u2019t. Just take me home. Just take me home.\u2019 And so he told me, no, that\u2019s not the way it was going to be, that I was going to take my pants off. And he had had his arm around me and I tried to move away. He said, \u2018You want to fight? Okay, we\u2019ll fight.\u2019 He hit me in my face a couple of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">Q. \u201cWhat did he hit you with ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">A. \u201cJust his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">Q. \u201cWas his hand open or closed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">A. \u201cI don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">Q. \u201cAs a fist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">A. \u201cI don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">Q. \u201cWhere did he strike you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-18\">A. \u201cIn my face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-19\">Q. \u201cWhat happened then ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-20\">A. \u201cAnd so then he took my head and he pushed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>it all the way back in the seat of the car and covered my. . . face with his hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">* * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">Q. \u201cHe pressed your head back over what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">A. \u201cOver the seat, the back of the seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">Q. \u201cAnd what did you do when he did this ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">A. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I wasn\u2019t going to win. It\u2019s when I gave up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">Q. \u201cAnd why did you give up ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">A. \u201cBecause he was going to hurt me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\"><em>* \u00a1H </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">Q. \u201cDid you consent to this? Did you agree to let him do this ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">A. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">Q. \u201cWhy did you allow him to have intercourse with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-17\">A. \u201cBecause he had already struck me a couple of times, he had already pushed my face back, and if I had fought him any more I am sure that I would have really gotten hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-19\">Q. \u201cWould you state whether or not you had any conversation with him about your physical condition at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-20\">A. \u201cI had told him before that \u2014 first I told him that I was on my period, and he told me it didn\u2019t matter. I told him I had V.D., and he said that didn\u2019t matter. I told him I was built funny and he told me that didn\u2019t matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-21\">Q. \u201cAnd was this before or after he struck you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-22\">A. \u201cThis was before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-23\">Q. \u201cAnd can you state whether or not any of these conditions were true that you had related to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-24\">A. \u201cI was on my period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-25\">Q. \u201cAnd how long did this intercourse take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-26\">A. \u201cFifteen, twenty minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Q. \u201cAnd what were you doing during the intercourse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">A. \u201cCrying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The witness further testified that after the intercourse Burnette took her to her apartment where she told her roommate what had occurred but because of fear and confusion she did not report the matter to the police department until two days later. Her roommate testified corroborating the prosecutrix especially in that she had two bruises, one on the left side of her face and one on the left side of her nose and that her clothing was covered with blood, presumably from the menstrual discharge and that her clothing and hair were disheveled. She said the victim was \u201ccrying hard\u201d upon her arrival at the apartment and was very upset for the next few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Burnette testified admitting the intercourse but stated that it occurred with the prosecutrix\u201d full consent and cooperation and denied that he struck her. He admitted that after the police had initially questioned him concerning the incident he gave up his job and went to Florida for a period of about four weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">On appeal he relies on <em>Winegan v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 196, 268 A. 2d 585, in which we reversed a rape conviction where the evidence showed that the victim was accosted on a public street and walked with the accused five blocks to his apartment, followed him up three flights of stairs to the apartment, all without any direct threats or physical abuse. In that case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cWhile we are frequently called upon to review the sufficiency of the evidence in rape cases, most of them are so clear it is seldom necessary to review the law in any great detail; however, two cases recently have required a detailed review, <em>Walter v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 385, 264 A. 2d 882 and <em>Rice v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 552. In both we held where the <em>victim\u2019s story could not be corroborated by wounds, bruises or disordered clothing, </em>the lack of consent could be shown by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>fear based upon reasonable apprehension. The rule requiring the apprehension be reasonable was first enunciated in Maryland in <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464, 469, 157 A. 2d 922: \u2018If the acts and threats of the defendant were reasonably calculated to create in the mind of the victim \u2014 having regard to the circumstances in which she was placed \u2014 a real apprehension, due to fear, of imminent bodily harm, serious enough to impair or overcome her will to resist, then such acts and threats are the equivalent of force.\u2019 (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cThe rule of reason, as we shall call it, was reiterated, either expressly or impliedly, by us in <em>Walter v. State, supra </em>and <em>Rice v. State, supra. </em>It is expressly supported by several cases throughout the country.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The error of Burnette\u2019s position in relying on <em>Winegan v. State </em>is the rule applies where the \u201cvictim\u2019s story could not be corroborated by the wounds, bruises or disordered clothing\u201d. In the instant case the victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated by bruises and disordered clothing; therefore the rule of reason as expressed in <em>Winegan </em>is not directly applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In <em>Rice v. State, supra, </em>at page 560, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cIn <em>Hazel </em>[swpra] the contention was made the victim did not resist at the actual time of the intercourse, but after citing the difference between submission and consent, the Court found there were sufficient threats of violence prior thereto to justify the trial court\u2019s finding that rape had occurred. In <em>Walter </em>we found the victim's fear of policemen was sufficient, under the circumstances, to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the victim submitted to the intercourse only through fear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201cThe appellant relies on several Illinois cases, <em>People v. DeFrates, </em>33 Ill. 2d 190, 210 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>467; <em>People v. Qualls, </em>21 Ill. 2d 252, 1, N.E.2d 612; <em>People v. Helton, </em>245 N.E.2d 1, which, while recognizing the rule a woman need not resist an unwanted sexual relationship if she is reasonably in fear of her safety, apply the rule most strictly and, in our opinion, are thus too narrow in requiring physical resistance by the victim. We do not think sound public policy requires a woman to resist to the extent that she runs a substantial risk of grievous bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">The sounder test is whether the act was performed with or without the consent of the prosecuting witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The thought expressed in <em>Rice </em>is dispositive of Burnette\u2019s claim. The witness testified that from the physical attack upon her she felt that if she had \u201cfought him anymore I am sure I would have really gotten hurt.\u201d The trial judge accepted this testimony as true and there is no basis for us to say, under Maryland Rule 1086, that his finding was clearly erroneous. Such a finding supports the public policy recited in <em>Rice, supra, </em>that the resistance required of a woman to support a rape conviction should not be so great as to require her to run a substantial risk of grievous bodily harm. The victim in the instant case was alone with appellant who in a lonely spot assaulted and beat her. There is nothing to indicate he would not have beaten her more substantially if she had continued to resist his advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Although it appears that the state went out of its way to refer to certain lie detector tests, the trial judge steadfastly refused to accept the evidence and stated he would not consider any reference to such tests. If this were a jury trial, a more serious problem would be presented, but as the Court of Appeals said in <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547-550, 267 A. 2d 190, \u201cThe assumed proposition that judges are men of discernment, learned and experienced in the law and capable of evaluating the materiality of evidence, lies at the very core of our judicial system. Such an assumption would be completely unwar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ranted with regard to a jury of laymen and the impact which evidence may have upon their deliberative powers.\u201d In the instant case the trial judge stated he was not considering the improper evidence and although the State should have been more careful not to have brought such evidence in the record, we must find the error on the part of the prosecutor harmless.

State, </em>217 Md. 191, 141 A. 2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
