Bar Journal 2 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Although now apparently an autonomous \u201cexception\u201d in its own right the \u201cPlain View Doctrine\u201d had obscure beginnings as a marginal factor in the \u201csearch incident\u201d law and its early growth went largely unnoticed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Its seedtime cannot be understood apart from the \u201csearch incident\u201d context that generated it initially and was its sole early nutrience. It was a mere descriptive phrase\u2014 sometimes \u201cplain view\u201d, sometimes \u201cplain sight\u201d, sometimes \u201copen view\u201d, sometimes \u201cvisible and accessible\u201d, and always in lower case \u2014 in the recurring ebb and flow of \u201csearch incident\u201d law. It was generally resorted to during the ebb tides to distinguish away and to minimize the significance of the preceding flood tides. Its tactical utility and its growth can only be understood by looking to the larger fortunes of that \u201csearch incident\u201d war.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Fourth Amendment law generally attracted little at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>tenti\u00f3n until the exclusionary rule made it a factor in criminal litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even then, the Supreme Court had infrequent occasion to concern itself with search and seizure questions until the adoption of laws in and immediately preceding the 1920\u2019s proscribing the sale and possession of narcotic drugs and of alcoholic beverages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Landynski, <em>Search and Seizure and the Supreme Court, </em>87-88; Lasson, <em>The History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution </em>(1937). With the coming of the Prohibition cases, however, the deluge began.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The common law right to search an arrestee as an incident of lawful arrest, be that arrest warrantless or pursuant to warrant, was early accepted as compatible with American concepts of reasonable search and seizure. See Judge Cardozo in <em>People v. Chiagles, </em>237 N. Y. 193, 196 (1923) ; <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56 (1950), 72 (dissenting opinion by Frankfurter, J.). The controversy that raged in the Supreme Court from 1927 through 1969 was over the permissible scope \u2014 the range in space \u2014 the search perimeter \u2014 of an admittedly proper \u201csearch incident.\u201d Five times in forty-two years, the Court reversed its field, producing six sharply juxtaposed phases of permitted scope to a \u201csearch incident.\u201d Three periods of broad scope \u2014 1927 to 1931,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 1947 to 1948 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>1950 to 1969 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 alternated with three periods of narrow scope \u2014 1931 to 1947,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 1948 to 1950 <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 1969 to present.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The very concept of \u201cPlain View\u201d is a by-product of that controversy, a notion that gradually evolved to help fill the interstice between the otherwise rigidly bipolar positions of \u201cbroad scope\u201d and \u201climited scope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The reasons of necessity which underlay the right to search an arrested person incidental to the arrest were 1) to protect the arresting officer and to deprive the prisoner of potential means of escape, <em>Closson v. Morrison, </em>47 N. H. 482 (1867), and 2) to avoid the destruction of evidence by the arrested person, <em>Reifsnyder v. Lee, </em>44 Iowa 101 (1876) ; <em>Holker v. Hennessey, </em>141 Mo. 527 (1897). See <em>Rabinowitz, </em>at 72-73 (dissenting opinion by Frankfurter, J.). Without analyzing the purpose of the rule, the Supreme Court, in a passing dictum, first acknowledged its existence in <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>supra,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> at 392:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201cWhat, then, is the present case? Before answering that inquiry specifically, it may be well by a process of exclusion to state what it is not. It is not an assertion of the right on the part of the government, always recognized under English and American law, <em>to search the person of the accused </em>when legally arrested, to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime. This right has been uniformly maintained in many cases.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Eleven years later, the Supreme Court again made passing reference to the \u201csearch incident\u201d rule in a dictum in <em>Carroll v. United States, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It cited its ear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Her dictum in <em>Weeks </em>but after the words \u201cupon his person\u201d added the words \u201cor in his control.\u201d The added words, however, were in accord with the common law tradition and were but an explicit statement of what was implicit in <em>Weeks. </em>The Court said, at 158:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cWhen a man is legally arrested for an offense, whatever is found <em>upon his person or in his control </em>which it is unlawful for him to have, and which may be used to prove the offense, may be seized and held as evidence in the prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The germ of later controversy appeared seven months thence as an uncritical dictum in <em>Agnello v. United States, supra. </em>Citing only <em>Weeks </em>and <em>Carroll </em>as authority, the Court loosely added to the proposition the words \u201cand to search the place where the arrest is made.\u201d It said, at 30:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201cThe right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime, <em>and to search the place where the arrest is made </em>in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits, or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted. See <em>Carroll v. United States, . . . Weeks v. United States.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">A close reading of the obvious purpose of the Court in referring to \u201cthe place where the arrest was made\u201d would have precluded undue significance being given to that phrase. <em>Agnello </em>was not dealing with the question of the permitted scope of a \u201csearch incident\u201d at the place where the actual arrest was made. Its clear holding, rather, was that an arrest at one place (whatever \u201csearch incident\u201d was there permitted) could in no event justify a \u201csearch incident\u201d at another place some blocks away. In such a factual and legal posture, the Court\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the word \u201cplace\u201d should not have been read overbroadly. Two years later, however, the Court did read <em>Agnello </em>overbroadly in <em>Marron v. United States, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In <em>Marr\u00f3n, </em>Prohibition agents were executing a warrant authorizing the search for and seizure of intoxicating liquors and articles used in their manufacture. They went to execute the warrant in a second-floor establishment containing six or seven rooms. While executing the warrant, they found violations of the liquor laws being perpetrated in their presence. In searching a closet for liquor, they noticed and seized a ledger which significantly inculpated the defendants. The government advanced two rationales to justify the seizure of the ledger. The Supreme Court rejected the first, but accepted the second. It specifically held that a proper search under a warrant could not justify the seizure of the ledger which had been inadvertently discovered in the course of the legitimate search because the ledger had not been particularly described. It went on, however, to assert a second and legitimate rationale. The discovery by the agents of violations being perpetrated in their presence justified arrests, which were made. The ledger, which was not seizable under the warrant, was seizable as an incident of the lawful arrest. In asserting a broad scope for a \u201csearch incident,\u201d the Court relied on <em>Agnello, Carroll </em>and <em>Weeks </em>and said, at 199:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\u201cThe authority of officers to search and seize the things by which the nuisance was being maintained <em>extended to all parts of the premises </em>used for the unlawful purpose.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">No mention was made of \u201cplain view.\u201d It was the clear holding of the Court, rather, that the scope of a \u201csearch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>incident\u201d extended to the entire premises in which an arrest is made.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Four years later, the Court turned a sharp \u201cabout face\u201d in <em>Go-Bart Importing Company v. United States, supra, </em>and remained steadfast a year later in <em>United States v. Lefkowitz, </em>285 U. S. 452 (1982). In both cases, arrests were made in places of business. Searches were made of the premises as incidents of the lawful arrests. In <em>Go-Bart, </em>defendants were compelled to open a desk and a safe, from which incriminating papers were seized. In <em>Lefkowitz, </em>two desks were searched which yielded incriminating evidence. Although both searches would appear to have been legitimate under <em>Marr\u00f3n, </em>they were held to be unconstitutional. Rather than frankly overrule <em>Marr\u00f3n, </em>the Court attempted to distinguish it in two respects.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It pointed out first that the ledger in <em>Marr\u00f3n </em>was an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of the crime, whereas the seized papers in <em>Go-Bart </em>and <em>Lefkowitz </em>were \u201cmere evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It then essentially rewrote the rationale of <em>Marr\u00f3n </em>by injecting for the first time the notion of \u201cplain view\u201d into <em>Marron\u2019s </em>reasoning. It condemned the \u201cgeneral exploratory search,\u201d \u201cthe ransacking,\u201d and \u201cthe rummaging\u201d of the <em>Go-Bart </em>and <em>Lefkowitz </em>searches and posited that, by way of contrast, <em>Marr\u00f3n </em>had not, in fact, authorized such general searches. <em>Go-Bart </em>pointed out that the seized ledger in <em>Marr\u00f3n </em>had been \u201cvisible and accessible;\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Lefkowitz </em>characterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the seized ledger in <em>Marr\u00f3n </em>as having been \u201cin plain view\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 this visibility was now offered as the j ustification for the seizure.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In 1947, the Court moved back into forward gear with its 5-4 decision in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>331 U. S. 145. It there permitted the most extensive and intensive \u201csearch incident\u201d in the history of Fourth Amendment interpretation. FBI Agents executed an arrest warrant for mail fraud in the living room of an apartment. As an incident of that arrest, the agents fanned out over the four-room apartment and conducted a painstaking five-hour search for two cancelled checks. They recovered from a bedroom bureau drawer a sealed envelope marked \u201cGeorge Harris, personal papers.\u201d They tore open the envelope and inside a smaller envelope recovered a number of Selective Service documents in no way related to the crime for which the arrest had been made. <em>Agnello </em>and <em>Marr\u00f3n </em>were cited as authority for the proposition that a \u201csearch incident\u201d may extend to the entire premises wherein the arrest is made.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The \u201cplain view\u201d limitation placed upon <em>Marr\u00f3n\u2019s </em>broad scope by <em>Go-Bart </em>and <em>Lefkowitz </em>was ignored. Instead of candidly overruling <em>Go-Bart </em>and <em>Lefkowitz, </em>the Court reinterpreted them as condemning simply a general rummaging for evidence as opposed to a search directed toward specific objects. The inadvertent recovery of the Selective Service documents in the course of the search for the cancelled checks was held to be legitimate. Any consideration of \u201cplain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>view\u201d was superfluous under the \u201cbroad scope\u201d approach of <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Justices Frankfurter, Murphy, Rutledge and Jackson dissented in three separate opinions. Justice Murphy, in the course of a discussion of the scope of a \u201csearch incident\u201d, made reference to \u201cplain sight\u201d seizure, at 186:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u201cSeizure may be made of articles and papers on the person of the one arrested. And the arresting officer is free to look around and seize those fruits and evidences of crime which are in plain sight and in his immediate and discernible presence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">As violent a swing as <em>Harris </em>represented in the one direction, it was followed a year later by a correspondingly violent swing in the opposite direction in <em>Trupiano v. United States, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Internal Revenue Agents arrested a violator in a barn which was then being used as an illicit distillery. The distilling equipment which was seized was not merely on the premises, but was 1) in \u201cplain view\u201d of the arresting officers and 2) in the immediate physical reach and control of the arrestee. The seizure would have been constitutional even under the more restrictive approach of the earlier <em>Go-Bart </em>and <em>Lefkowitz </em>decisions. In ruling it unconstitutional, however, the Court engrafted onto the search and seizure law a new requirement of \u201cinadvertence.\u201d It held that all exceptions to the warrant requirement grew only out of necessity and that, therefore, those exceptions would not apply where there had been an opportunity for the agents to obtain a search warrant.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The majority did contor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>tions to avoid having to overrule <em>Harris. </em>It reasoned that the finding of the Selective Service documents in <em>Harris </em>had been inadvertent, conveniently ignoring that the five-hour search for the cancelled checks (which led to the discovery of the Selective Service documents) had been the very antithesis of inadvertence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It added, almost apologetically, at 709:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">\u201cThese factual differences may or may not be of significance so far as general principles are concerned. But the differences are enough to justify confining ourselves to the precise facts of this case, leaving it to another day to test the <em>Harris </em>situation by the rule that search warrants are to be obtained and used wherever reasonably practicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The dissent of Chief Justice Vinson, joined by Justices Black, Reed and Burton, twice referred to the distilling equipment as having been \u201cin open view\u201d and twice referred to it as having been \u201cin plain sight.\u201d It articulated its rationale for the legitimacy of the seizure, at 714:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201cThe validity of the search and seizure as incident to a lawful arrest has been based upon a recognition by this Court that where law-enforcement agents have lawfully gained entrance into premises and have executed a valid arrest of the occupant, the vital rights of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment are not denied by seizure of contraband materials and instrumentalities of crime in open view or such as may be brought to light by a reasonable search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The swing of the constitutional pendulum continued unabated in <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>eminent agents arrested the defendant at his place of business for forging and altering postage stamps. As an incident of that arrest, they searched his one-room office for an hour and one-half. They recovered inculpatory postage stamps from a desk, a safe and file cabinets. The search would clearly have been unconstitutional under <em>Trupiano. </em>In articulating a new \u201ctotal atmosphere\u201d standard for Fourth Amendment reasonableness, the Court overruled <em>Trupiano. </em>It held that the relevant test is \u201cnot whether it is reasonable to procure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable.\u201d The Court boldly reasserted the proposition that an entire premises under the control of a person arrested may be searched as an incident of the arrest. It cited as its authority <em>Agnello, Carroll </em>and <em>Weeks </em>as well as <em>Marr\u00f3n, </em>which it characterized as not having been \u201cdrained of contemporary vitality by <em>Go-Bart Importing Company v. United States . . . </em>and <em>United States v. Lefkowitz,\u201d </em>and <em>Harris, </em>which it characterized as not having been \u201coverruled.\u201d Although not central to its holding, the Court at one point carelessly referred to the desk, the safe and the file cabinets as being \u201cwithin plain view,\u201d apparently not grasping that what significantly needs be \u201cin plain view\u201d is the thing to be seized, not the thing or place to be searched.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">If the birth of the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine had to await <em>Coolidge, </em>its Annunciation came through Justice Frankfurter in his series of dissents in <em>Rabinowitz, Harris </em>and <em>Davis v. United States, </em>328 U. S. 582 (1946). What had theretofore been at best inchoate was now formulated into a coherent rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Justice Frankfurter first cut the Gordian knot of alternating and intertwining citation of precedent by looking <em>pre-Weeks </em>to the original justifying rationale of a \u201csearch incident.\u201d He showed historically that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>necessary \u201cfirst, in order to protect the arresting officer and to deprive the prisoner of potential means of escape . . . and, secondly, to avoid destruction of evidence by the arrested person.\u201d <em>Rabinowitz, </em>at 72. \u201cFrom this it follows that officers may search and seize not only the things physically on the person arrested, but those within his immediate physical control.\u201d <em>Rabinowitz, </em>at 72. \u201cImmediate physical control\u201d and \u201cimmediate physical surroundings\u201d were defined as that \u201cwhich may fairly be deemed to be an extension of his person.\u201d <em>Rabinowitz, </em>at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Justice Frankfurter then demonstrated that the root of the present controversy lay in the \u201cloose use of language\u201d \u2014 the imposition of property law connotations onto such words as \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d irrelevantly to the necessities of the Fourth Amendment \u2014 the use of language \u201cnot with fastidious precision.\u201d <em>Rabinowitz, </em>at 72. He reasoned in <em>Harris, </em>at 164:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">\u201cFor some purposes, to be sure, a man\u2019s house and its contents are deemed to be in his \u2018possession\u2019 or \u2018control\u2019 even when he is miles away. Because this is a mode of legal reasoning relevant to disputes over property, the usual phrase for such non-physical control is \u2018constructive possession.\u2019 But this mode of thought and these concepts are irrelevant to the application of the Fourth Amendment and hostile to respect for the liberties which it protects. Due regard for the policy of the Fourth Amendment precludes indulgence in the fiction that the recesses of a man\u2019s house are like the pockets of the clothes he wears at the time of his arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Justice Frankfurter\u2019s statement of the necessity under-girding the common law right of \u201csearch incident\u201d found voice in <em>Preston v. United States, supra, </em>at 367. His total formulation of a \u201csearch incident\u201d rationale received the official imprimatur of the Court in <em>Chimel v. California, supra. </em>The majority opinion in <em>Chimel </em>reads like a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>statement of the Frankfurter dissent in <em>Rabinowitz, </em>to which <em>Chimel </em>gives full credit. <em>Chimel </em>recognized the necessities which gave rise to the law of \u201csearch incident\u201d and recognized further that the \u201cscope of [a] search must be \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Having thus constricted the search perimeter from an arrestee\u2019s total premises (that which is under his proprietary control) to the area within the arrestee\u2019s reach or grasp (that which is under his physical control), Justice Frankfurter then proceeded to fill the interstice. He provided the conceptual <em>sine qua non </em>for the later \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine by pointing out that, \u201cIt is important to keep clear the distinction between prohibited searches on the one hand and improper seizures on the other.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> He reasoned in <em>Davis, </em>at 612:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201cAnother factor enters. This language is sometimes used in cases involving the seizure of items properly subject to seizure because in open view at the time of arrest. But this last confusion is due to a failure to distinguish between the appropriate scope of a search on arrest and the very different problem as to the right of seizure where no search is in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Justice Frankfurter demonstrated that the Court\u2019s doctrinal confusion had been caused in large measure by its own bipolarity between a \u201climited scope\u201d view and a \u201cbroad scope\u201d view of \u201csearch incident\u201d law \u2014 not recognizing the middle ground of \u201cbroad seizure\u201d not tied to a \u201cbroad search.\u201d He cut the seizure rationale loose from the search rationale. He reasoned in <em>Rabinowitz, </em>at 75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">\u201cThis progressive distortion is due to an uncritical confusion of (1) the right to search the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>son arrested and articles in his immediate physical control and (2) the right to seize visible instruments or fruits of crime at the scene of the arrest with (3) an alleged right to search the place of arrest. It is necessary in this connection to distinguish clearly between prohibited searches and improper seizures. It is unconstitutional to make an improper search even for articles that are appropriately subject to seizure when found by legal means. . . . Thus, the seizure of items properly subject to seizure because in open view at the time of arrest does not carry with it the right to search for such items.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The intellectual spadework had been done for the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine. A \u201cPlain View\u201d seizure was not a search. The seizure perimeter was broader than the search perimeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Before the official birth of the Doctrine in <em>Coolidge, </em>however, a dimension was to be added. Until 1967, \u201cplain view\u201d had been discussed or alluded to exclusively within the framework of \u201csearch incident\u201d law. Beginning in 1967, two cases arguably suggested and one squarely held that the notion of \u201cplain view\u201d had a utility even beyond the confines of \u201csearch incident\u201d situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>Warden v. Hayden, supra, </em>policemen were in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of an armed and fleeing holdup man. They followed into the house which he was seen to enter. It turned out to be his own. They fanned out over all three floors. Hayden was arrested in an upstairs bedroom, feigning sleep. Meanwhile, an officer searching the cellar turned up an inculpatory jacket and a pair of trousers in a washing machine. The Supreme Court held that the warrantless entry of Hayden\u2019s house to search for him and the warrantless search of Hayden himself were valid since \u201cthe exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u201d In recognizing for the first time, in a square holding, the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement, the Court said, at 298-299:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others. Speed here was essential, and only a thorough search of the house for persons and weapons could have insured that Hayden was the only man present and that the police had control of all weapons which could be used against them or to effect an escape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In legitimating the basement search, the Court eschewed reliance on a \u201csearch incident\u201d theory, since \u201cthe seizures occurred prior to or immediately contemporary with Hayden\u2019s arrest.\u201d Independent of any \u201csearch incident\u201d theory, the Court held that the basement search for the fugitive, for possible confederates and/or for weapons was an integral part of the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception, reasoning that that search was \u201cpart of an effort to find a suspected felon, armed, within the house into which he had run only minutes before the police arrived. The permissible scope of search must, therefore, at the least, be as broad as may reasonably be necessary to prevent the dangers that the suspect at large in the house may resist or escape,\u201d at p. 299. The Court further reasoned that when the search of the washing machine for weapons turned up the inculpatory clothing, the seizure thereof was constitutional. Although the Court\u2019s opinion made no mention of \u201cplain view,\u201d <em>Coolidge </em>later read this case to be one involving \u201cplain view.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Within the year, <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 U. S. 234 (1968), invoked \u201cPlain View\u201d in explicit terms. The defendant\u2019s automobile had been seen leaving the scene of a robbery. The car was traced and the defendant was arrested as he was entering it, near his home. He was taken to the police station. The car was impounded as evidence and towed to the station. When it arrived at the station, its windows were open and its doors were unlocked. It had begun to rain. A departmental regulation required the police to search an impounded vehicle thoroughly, to remove all valuables from it, and to attach to the vehicle a property tag listing certain information about the circumstances of the impounding. Pursuant to this regulation, an officer searched the car and placed a property tag on it. He then proceeded to roll up the windows and to lock the doors. As he opened the front door on the passenger side in order to roll up the window, the officer saw an inculpatory registration card. The warrantless seizure was held to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The Supreme Court held that the discovery of the card was not the result of an investigative search but rather of a legitimate measure taken to protect the car while it was in police custody. It held, at 236:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201cOnce the door had lawfully been opened, the registration card, with the name of the robbery victim on it, was plainly visible. It has long been settled that objects falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The last of the intimations was <em>Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U. S. 731 (1969). One co-defendant gave the police permission to search the duffel bag shared by him and Frazier for incriminating evidence. The consensual search was aimed at this co-defendant. In the course of the search, the police came across certain clothing of Frazier\u2019s, which was seized. Citing <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 U. S., and <em>Warden v. Hayden, supra, </em>as its authority, the Court said, at 740:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cThe officers therefore found evidence against petitioner while in the course of an otherwise lawful search. Under this Court\u2019s past decisions, they were clearly permitted to seize it.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The utility of the \u201cPlain View\u201d concept having thus outgrown its \u201csearch incident\u201d origins, a broader formulation of its rule was called for. This was to be the. office of <em>Coolidge.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\n<em>The \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine Today The Prior Valid Intrusion Requirement</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In articulating the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine, <em>Coolidge </em>recognized at the outset that the use of \u201cplain view\u201d as a descriptive phrase is not coterminous with its use as a legal concept, at 465:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\u201cIt is well established that under certain cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>cumstances the police may seize evidence in plain view without a warrant. But it is important to keep in mind that, in the vast majority of cases, <em>any </em>evidence seized by the police will be in plain view, at least at the moment of seizure. The problem with the \u2018plain view\u2019 doctrine has been to identify the circumstances in which plain view has legal significance rather than being simply the normal concomitant of any search, legal or illegal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">It pointed out that the first condition precedent to a \u201cPlain View\u201d seizure is a justifiable prior intrusion. Although not purporting to exhaust the category, it listed four situations illustrating a prior valid intrusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">1. A \u201csearch incident\u201d to a valid arrest inside a \u201cconstitutionally protected area\u201d that is \u201cappropriately limited in scope.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In giving voice to the Frankfurter rationale, <em>Coolidge </em>stated, \u201cThe \u2018plain view\u2019 doctrine would normally justify as well the seizure of other evidence that came to light during such an appropriately limited search. . . . Where, however, the arresting officer inadvertently comes within plain view of a piece of evidence, not concealed, although outside of the area under the immediate control of the arrestee, the officer may seize it, so long as the plain view was obtained in the course of an appropriately limited search of the arrestee.\u201d <em>Coolidge, </em>465, n. 24.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">2. The \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d which justify a warrantless entry into a \u201cconstitutionally protected area,\u201d such as \u201chot pursuit.\u201d <footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">3. The valid presence inside a \u201cconstitutionally protected area\u201d for some legitimate purpose other than the search for evidence against the accused.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>4. The warranted search of a \u201cgiven area for specified objects ... in the course of [which] . . . [the searchers] come across some other article of incriminating character.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><em>Coolidge </em>points out that the common denominator of all these situations is that there has been a prior valid intrusion. The \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine then supplements that valid intrusion by extending the seizure perimeter to those things which are in \u201cPlain View\u201d from that legitimate vantage point. It explains, at 466:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201cWhat the \u2018plain view\u2019 cases have in common is that the police officer in each of them had a prior justification for an intrusion in the course of which he came inadvertently across a piece of evidence incriminating the accused. The doctrine serves to supplement the prior justification \u2014 whether it be a warrant for another object, hot pursuit, search incident to lawful arrest, or some other legitimate reason for being present unconnected with a search directed against the accused \u2014 and permits the warrant-less seizure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In enunciating the rationale for the \u201cPlain View\u201d excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tion, <em>Coolidge </em>sets out \u201cthe two distinct constitutional protections served by the warrant requirement.\u201d It protects against <em>\u201cany </em>intrusion in the way of search or seizure\u201d which is not justified by \u201ca careful prior determination of necessity.\u201d It then mandates that even \u201cthose searches deemed necessary should be as limited as possible.\u201d It reasons that the \u201cPlain View\u201d exception is not in conflict with the first objective because the plain view does not occur until after the valid intrusion has already been made and its purpose is already in progress. It then reasons that the plain view exception is consistent with the second objective \u201csince it does not convert the search into a general or exploratory one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">It becomes apparent that the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine comprehends only one variety of the ocular \u201cplain view\u2019s.\u201d It does not contemplate the non-intrusion visual observation, such as where evidence is in \u201copen view\u201d and therefore seizable in a \u201cconstitutionally non-protected area.\u201d See <em>Hester v. United States, supra, </em>wherein evidence was seen and was validly seized in an \u201copen field,\u201d notwithstanding police trespass upon the field. Nor does the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine contemplate the preintrusion visual observation of evidence in \u201copen view\u201d inside a \u201cconstitutionally protected area,\u201d such as a house, garage, automobile, etc., from a vantage point outside the \u201cconstitutionally protected area.\u201d Here the valid visual observation simply furnishes probable cause for 1) the issuance of a warrant, <em>Steele v. United States, </em>267 U. S. 498 (1925); or 2) the warrantless entry of a vehicle or vessel, provided exigent circumstances are also present, <em>United States v. Lee, supra; Scales v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 474; or 3) the warrantless entry to effect an arrest for a crime being committed in the officer\u2019s presence, <em>Agnello, </em>at 30; <em>Griffin v. State, </em>200 Md. 569. As a non-search, the visual observation itself is legitimate; but it may never, standing alone, justify an intrusion. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>286 U. S. 1 (1932). Thus, the formal \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine, as announced in <em>Coolidge, </em>is exclusively a post-intrusion phenomenon.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The chameleon-like quality of the phrase \u201cplain view\u201d stems from its loose employment to describe these visually similar but legally distinct situations. Although they share the common denominator of a non-searching, sighting of evidence in \u201copen view,\u201d the non-intrusion observation needs no further justification for a seizure; the pre-intrusion observation does need some additional legal predicate for the intrusion necessary to effect the seizure ;<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and the post-intrusion \u2014 or truly \u201cPlain View\u201d\u2014 observation has already validly surmounted the intrusion hurdle. It was the inadequacy of the vocabulary to keep separate these very different legal problems whereof we spoke in <em>Scales v. State, supra, </em>at 478, n. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cIn this context, we studiously avoid the phraseology \u2018in plain view\u2019 to avoid any implication that the so-called \u2018plain view doctrine\u2019 is being invoked. That doctrine is not here applicable. Needless confusion is frequently engendered by the employment in many opinions of the same phrase \u2014 \u2018in plain view\u2019 \u2014 to describe two visually similar but legally distinct situations. The \u2018plain view doctrine,\u2019 as described in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>29 L.Ed.2d 564, refers exclusively to the legal justification \u2014 the reasonableness \u2014 for the seizure of evidence which has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>been particularly described in a warrant and which is inadvertently spotted in the course of a constitutional search already in progress or in the course of an otherwise justifiable intrusion into a constitutionally protected area. It has no applicability when the vantage point from which the \u2018plain view\u2019 is made is not within a constitutionally protected area. It is, therefore, literarily discreet to use for such latter situations some alternative phraseology such as \u2018clearly visible,\u2019 \u2018readily observable,\u2019 \u2018open to public gaze,\u2019 etc., rather than to employ the words \u2018in plain view\u2019 in their purely descriptive capacity, lest the unwary reader read them in their other and talismanic capacity as an invocation of the doctrine of the same name in non-intrusive situations where it is not applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>The Inadvertence Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The second condition precedent to the invocation of the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine is that the \u201cPlain View\u201d discovery be inadvertent. This requirement is a direct legacy of <em>Trupiano </em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is stated simply in <em>Coolidge, </em>at 469-471:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201cThe second limitation is that the discovery of evidence in plain view must be inadvertent. The rationale of the exception to the warrant requirement, as just stated, is that a plain-view seizure will not turn an initially valid (and therefore limited) search into a \u2018general\u2019 one, while the inconvenience of procuring a warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>to cover an inadvertent discovery is great. But where the discovery is anticipated, where the police know in advance the location of the evidence and intend to seize it, the situation is altogether different. The requirement of a warrant to seize imposes no inconvenience whatever, or at least none which is constitutionally cognizable in a legal system that regards warrantless searches as \u2018per se unreasonable\u2019 in the absence of \u2018exigent circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The evil at which this requirement is aimed is the \u201cplanned warrantless seizure.\u201d The \u201cInadvertence\u201d re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>quirement is intended to prevent the police from using an entry into a \u201cconstitutionally protected area\u201d for purposes of making an arrest \u2014 or for any other ostensibly legitimate purpose \u2014 as a mere subterfuge for a \u201cPlain View\u201d reconnoitering. There may not be a contrived investigatory reconnaissance aimed at evading the warrant requirement for a search or seizure. There may not be a planned \u201cPlain View.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>The Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The appellant\u2019s key contention is that a warrantless seizure of inculpatory evidence violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment and that the trial judge committed prejudicial error when he failed to exclude that evidence from the trial. The State seeks to invoke the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine to justify the seizure. We hold that under that doctrine, the seizure here fails to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">During the early morning hours of March 4, 1970, a breaking and entering occurred at Parker\u2019s, Inc., a business establishment in Hurlock, Dorchester County, Maryland. Merchandise worth $194.09 was stolen \u2014 including a red toolbox, a quantity of flashlight batteries and a number of muffler clamps. The investigative trail led nowhere. Five months later, however, on August 13, 1970, a second breaking and entering occurred at the same establishment, with the same <em>modus operandi </em>having been employed. On this second occasion, a quantity of Safemark tires were stolen, a brand available only to Farm Bureau members. Local police departments, gasoline stations and garages were alerted to be on the lookout for Safemark tires, particularly where the possessors did not appear to be Farm Bureau members. One month later, on September 27, 1970, two Puerto Rican migrant laborers, then working at a labor camp in Bridgeville, Delaware, were involved in a motor vehicle accident in the town of Federalsburg, Caroline County, Maryland. Two Safemark tires were discovered in the trunk of their automobile. It developed that the tires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>had come from the August 13 breaking and entering at Parker\u2019s, Inc.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The version of their acquisition of the tires given by the two Puerto Ricans then led to the ostensible seller of those tires \u2014 the appellant, who was living and working in Bridgeville, Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">A three-man investigating team consisting of a Maryland State trooper, a Delaware State trooper and a Deputy Sheriff for Dorchester County, confronted the appellant on the street in Bridgeville, informed him that they wished to question him about the two Safemark tires and proceeded to give him the full recital of his rights under <em>Miranda. </em>The appellant initially claimed to have received the tires from two unnamed migrant workers from Florida. After a trip to several labor camps in the Bridgeville area failed to produce the two migrants, the appellant was arrested for receiving stolen goods and was transported to the Delaware State Police Barracks at Bridge-ville.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The Maryland State trooper there requested the permission of the appellant to search his residence. The appellant refused. The trooper advised the appellant that, if necessary, a search warrant could be obtained. The appellant still refused. The three investigators then proceeded, while the appellant was still in custody, to the home of Mrs. Mamie Hall, 109 First Street, in Bridge-ville. The appellant there rented a room from Mrs. Hall. The Deputy Sheriff, testifying that it was the intention of the three investigators to obtain a search warrant, explained that the purpose for the trip to Mrs. Hall\u2019s home was to obtain a description of the house for the drafting of the warrant and to confirm the fact that the appellant did reside there.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The three investigators approached the side door. After identifying themselves, they were cordially invited into the house by Mrs. Hall, \u201cWon\u2019t you please come in\u2014 watch your step.\u201d Inviting them to come into the front room, Mrs. Hall had to lead them along a narrow hall<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>way. The appellant\u2019s rented room was located just off that hallway. Its door wTas open. In passing, Mrs. Hall stated, \u201cThere\u2019s the room where Willie lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">From the hallway, the Deputy Sheriff looked into the room and saw a cardboard box, unremarkable in itself. The box was sitting on the floor approximately two feet inside the room. The Deputy Sheriff testified that he could see, \u201cin plain view,\u201d \u201cthe heavy-duty clamps, pipe clamps, and the batteries, which resembled the description of those which were stolen from Parker\u2019s, being the same make.\u201d Still from the hallway, he directed the attention of the other two investigators to the box. Without walking into the room, the Deputy Sheriff reached down and seized the box and its contents. The contents were, indeed, the stolen goods from Parker\u2019s and they were received in evidence, over his objection, at the appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In overruling the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence, the trial judge misconceived, we feel, the full implications of the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am familiar with what you are saying, but what about the fact that the testimony is all to the effect that this was in plain view from the hall. There was no search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">MR. SADOFF: But there was seizure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">THE COURT: But, no search. Something that was in plain view. In otherwords, the box was in plain view of the officers, and the officers were in a place that they had a right to be. It is similar, is it not, to the case where the officer walks down the street and sees something in an automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">MR. SADOFF: I agree on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">THE COURT: That is the way it appears to me, without getting into the question of consent, because they had already seen it. I understand what your argument is, and I think it is well taken. I do not think the landlady can authorize a complete search of your room or of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Defendant\u2019s room, I don\u2019t think she can do that. If his room was closed, his door was closed, I don\u2019t think the landlady could authorize the police to open that door and go in and search and seize. But here, I am linking this to an officer on the street who observed something in an automobile. It is in plain view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">There is no question but that Mrs. Hall could consent and did consent to the presence of the three investigators in her house. As they were standing in her hallway, they were unquestionably in a place where they had a right to be. From that legitimate vantage point, they were entitled to see whatever could be seen. <em>Steele v. United States, supra; United States v. Lee, supra; Taylor v. United States, supra; Ferguson v. State, </em>236 Md. 148; <em>Griffin v. State, supra; Minnick v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 81; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 300; <em>Mullaney v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 248. Simply seeing evidence in \u201copen view\u201d from a legitimate vantage point, however, is not dispositive of the question of ultimate seizability, as the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine clearly establishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">For purposes of this appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, his \u201cconstitutionally protected area\u201d \u2014 the legitimate boundaries of his \u201cexpectation of privacy\u201d \u2014 was the room he rented and not the entire house. The landlady could countenance a prior valid intrusion of police investigators into the house at large, but not into his room. <em>Stoner v. California, </em>376 U. S. 483 (1964) ; <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>342 U. S. 48 (1951) ; <em>Lustig v. United States, </em>338 U. S. 74 (1949) ; <em>McDonald v. United States, </em>335 U. S. 451 (1948) ; <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>365 U. S. 610 (1961). The threshold, therefore, that concerns us here \u2014 in measuring whether there was or was not a prior valid intrusion \u2014 is the threshold to the appellant\u2019s room, not the threshold to Mrs. Hall\u2019s house. In this case, the relevant threshold had not been crossed, and without a warrant it could not be crossed. The police were on the outside, looking in. There being no prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>valid intrusion, the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine is simply inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Notwithstanding the lack of a \u201cPlain View\u201d, what legal consequences flowed from the legitimate \u201copen view\u201d ? We will assume that that \u201copen view\u201d furnished the police ample probable cause to believe that the items openly viewed were stolen goods. <em>Cooliage </em>points out, at 468:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201c. . . plain view <em>alone </em>is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence. This is simply a corollary of the familiar principle discussed above, that no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent \u2018exigent circumstances.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The analogy to automobile cases, relied on by the trial court here, is not a valid analogy. The so-called \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement does not extend to fixed premises. Even under the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d an \u201copen view\u201d is never enough, standing alone. It simply furnishes the probable cause. There must always then be an additional factor \u2014 the exigent circumstance \u2014 present to permit the warrantless entry. <em>United States v. Lee, supra. </em>In <em>Seales, </em>we were careful to point out the two-step process, at 477-478:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\u201cWhen Detective Daniels was standing on the parking lot next to the appellant\u2019s vehicle, he was in a place where he and every other member of the public had a right to be. When Detective Daniels looked through the window into the interior of the car and directed his flashlight so as to facilitate that look, he was doing that which he and every member of the public had a right to do. As a result of that look, he saw, protruding from underneath the seat, a tire iron within clear visibility. At that point, there had been no intrusion, within the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment, into any constitutionally protected area. It is from that point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>that we measure the reasonableness of the ensuing search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al8i\">We feel that the search in this case was constitutionally proper under the so-called \u2018automobile exception\u2019 to the basic constitutional rule that \u2018searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">With respect to fixed premises, no amount of probable cause will justify an intrusion. This is the undisputed teaching of <em>Agnello, supra; Taylor v. United States, supra; Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U. S. 10 (1948), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>357 U. S. 493 (1958). As Coolidge said, at 468:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cIncontrovertible testimony of the senses that an incriminating object is on premises belonging to a criminal suspect may establish the fullest possible measure of probable cause. But even where the object is contraband, this Court has repeatedly stated and enforced the basic rule that the police may not enter and make a warrantless seizure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The more valid analogy to the instant case would be the combination of <em>Steele v. United States, supra, </em>and <em>Taylor v. United States, supra. </em>In <em>Steele, </em>police agents, conducting a discreet surveillance from a place where they had the right to be, looked into the interior of a garage and saw contraband whiskey in \u201copen view\u201d through an open doorway. This did not, <em>ipso facto, </em>justify an immediate entry and seizure. It rather furnished the probable cause for a warrant which was issued and executed. Conversely, in <em>Taylor, </em>police agents, again standing where they had a right to be, looked through a small opening into a garage and saw contraband in \u201copen view.\u201d They immediately entered and executed a war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>rantless seizure of the contraband. The seizure was held to be unconstitutional. See also <em>Pendleton v. Nelson, </em>404 F. 2d 1074 (9th Cir. 1968) ; <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>450 F. 2d 324 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The evidence should have been suppressed as unconstitionally seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In view of our disposition of the case on Fourth Amendment grounds, it is unnecessary to reach the other two contentions raised by the appellant. We note in brief, however, that there is no constitutional right to a preliminary hearing. <em>Gerstein v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 322; <em>Billings v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 31; <em>State v.

We conclude that on the subject of the \u201cPlain View\u201d Doctrine, Justice Stewart was speaking for five members of the Court and, therefore, announcing \u201cthe law of the land.\u201d Justices Douglas, Brennan and Marshall joined in the Stewart opinion. It is the cryptic concurrence of Justice Harlan, the necessary fifth vote, that necessitates textual exegesis to determine just what parts of Justice Stewart\u2019s opinion are constitutionally binding and what parts are merely constitutionally persuasive. The Stewart opinion is in three major divisions. Part I deals with the question of what governmental officer may issue a search warrant. Part III deals with the consent of a defendant\u2019s spouse to a search of their jointly-owned property. Neither of those parts concerns us here. Part II deals with exceptions to the warrant requirement for a valid search and is, in turn, subdivided into four sub-parts. II-A deals with the question of \u201csearch incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d II-B deals with the so-called \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d II-C deals with \u201cplain view.\u201d II-D is a rebuttal to the dissent of Justice White. After generally lamenting the continuing vitality of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, and <em>Ker v. California, </em>374 U. S. 23, which he would prefer to see overruled, Justice Harlan concurs in Parts I, II-D, and III of the Stewart opinion. He says nothing to disavow the positions taken in II-A, II-B or II-C, but pointedly omits to concur. Part II-D, in which Justice Harlan does concur, however, is a defense by Justice Stewart of the positions espoused in II-B and II-C from the attack made on those positions by Justice White in dissent. Albeit belatedly, Justice- Harlan is thereby in ranks for the reaffirmation of Justice Stewart\u2019s \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine.

S. 145 (and commanding the support of only four members of the Court on this point). <em>Hester </em>simply held that the Fourth Amendment does not extend its protection \u201cto the open fields,\u201d and that abandoned property was properly seizable therefrom. <em>United States v.

In most cases it would be difficult, if not impossible, for police in this situation to prove that they had no expectation of discovering evidence; whenever there is sufficient probable cause to arrest, there is usually at least a suspicion that some relevant evidence may be found in the open at the suspect\u2019s home. It is unlikely the plurality intended its inadvertence rule to penalize police who acted without the ulterior purpose of gaining a view of premises, even if they did have some slight suspicion that evidence might be found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">As the Note makes clear, the most probable interpretation for \u201cinadvertent\u201d will be that which simply prevents a <em>planned </em>warrantless seizure: \u201cFor evidence in plain view, the likeliest alternative is a narrow interpretation of the inadvertence rule, applying it only where it is clear that the police had probable cause to obtain a search warrant.\u201d Id., p. 250.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">.
