Goynes individually sued Burns and Blackburn claiming $60,000 for personal injuries and property damage, and with his wife, Agnes, sued them for loss of consortium, claiming $25,000. The cases went to trial before a jury on a general issue plea. At the close of all the evidence the defendants moved for a directed verdict in their favor as to each case, Maryland Rule 552 a, and the motions were denied. The plaintiffs moved for directed verdicts in their favor and the trial court reserved its decisions thereon. Rule 552 c. On 9 September 1971 the jury found for the defendants and judgment nisi was entered for them against the plaintiffs for costs. On 14 September the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment N.O.V. or in the alternative a new trial.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 563 a 1 and 3. On 1 October the motion was heard. The court said it felt \u201cit erred in not directing the matter of liability in favor of the plaintiff * * *. For that reason, the motion for a new trial will be granted.\u201d Counsel for the plaintiffs asked the court \u201cif the Motion for Directed Verdict which you have reserved upon has been granted and whether the new trial is for damages only?\u201d The court replied that the new trial will be for damages only. Counsel for the defendants inquired: \u201cNow, Your Honor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>you now are directing a verdict for the plaintiffs in this case \u2014 is that \u2014 my understanding?\u201d The court said: \u201cYes, Right.\u201d The ultimate result was as shown by the hearing sheet signed by the trial judge as of 29 October and reflected in the docket entries under that date: \u201cJudgment N.O.V. entered in favor of plaintiffs as of October 1, 1971. New trial awarded as to damages only.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Burns and Blackburn appealed. The question is whether the lower court erred in granting a judgment N.O.V. in favor of Goynes, et ux, and awarding a new trial as to damages only.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">There was evidence by stipulation that the accident occurred on 12 February 1968 about 3:56 o\u2019clock in the morning on Maryland Route 2 about 1000 feet south of Norfolk Road and involved an automobile driven by Goynes and a truck owned by Blackburn and driven by Burns as his agent and employee. There was evidence adduced by testimony of Goynes, Burns and Blackburn that Goynes was employed by the Baltimore City Department of Education as a maintenance man on the night shift. He was driving his 1964 Rambler to work when the accident occurred. Blackburn was a contract mail carrier with the U.S. Post Office. He furnished trucks and drivers to carry mail and had employed Burns about 4 or 5 years as such a driver. Burns drove \u201cthe Annapolis run\u201d six days a week, leaving the U.S. post <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>office terminal in Baltimore and stopping at Glen Burnie, Pasadena, Severna Park and Annapolis and on the return trip he would make additional stops for mail for the main post office in Baltimore. On 12 February 1968 Burns was driving the 2:20 a.m. shift. His vehicle was a 1966 G.M.C. ton and a half truck, van type body.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Goynes\u2019 version of the accident was in substance that on his way to Baltimore from his home in Annapolis he was driving about 45 or 50 miles per hour in the right lane of Route 2. At about Mountain Road he saw in his rear view mirror the lights of a vehicle which he thought was a heavy duty truck in the slow lane about 200 yards behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t try to outrun them so I kept my speed.\u201d The truck approached \u2014 \u201che was closing the gap in there too fast and I knew he was going over the limit.\u201d The truck came up to within 7 or 8 feet of the rear of Goynes\u2019 car and Goynes pulled over so his right wheels were on the shoulder of the road. The vehicles remained in this relative position for a distance estimated by Goynes as about 50 yards and for a time thought by him to be 4, 5 or 6 seconds. Then the impact occurred at the bottom of a hill. The truck\u2019s right front wheel \u201ccome over top of my bumper and over top the fender and over top [my left rear] wheel.\u201d Goynes\u2019 car was spun completely around, hit 4 guard rails and came to rest facing Annapolis \u201cnot quite\u201d on the right side of the road. The truck stopped in the median strip \u201cabout a hundred feet up.\u201d On cross-examination Goynes said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t know\u201d whether the truck was in the process of passing his car at the time of the accident. \u201cI know he hit me. Maybe he was trying to pass but I couldn\u2019t say \u2014 and he did hit \u2014 hit me and then he went on past me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Burns\u2019 version of the incident was that he was traveling in the right lane about 50 miles an hour in a 55 mile per hour zone just north of Mountain Road. \u201cWhen you meet Mountain Road you go up about a mile, a mile and a half and the road curves down, goes down in like a dip like in the road. * * * When this accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>happened I come over the top of the hill and Mr. Goynes he was down \u2014 almost down to the foot of the hill and there was some cars coming on * * * the left hand side of me and as they passed I started to pass by Mr. Goynes over there \u2014 I didn\u2019t get past him \u2014 to the \u2014 you know, to the left lane.\u201d Burns said two cars passed him in the left lane and \u201cas I said before and I\u2019ll repeat it, as I went to go past the man the kingpin snapped.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He explained: \u201cWhen I goes to pass * * * Mr. Goynes I hear a snapping noise, from then on that was it. * * * The truck veered, it hit the other man\u2019s car right when it snapped it throwed me up on the other man\u2019s car.\u201d When he heard the snap he lost a wheel. He had both hands on the wheel when he heard the snap and kept both hands on the wheel thereafter. Prior to the accident \u201cthere wasn\u2019t anything wrong with the steering * * * because it steered alright.\u201d After the accident \u201cI didn\u2019t see nothing but a wheel laying under that leaning truck. * * * It was laying underneath the truck with the tie rod still hooked to it \u2014 underneath\u2014up next to the gas tank \u2014 about middle ways of the truck.\u201d On cross-examination he said \u201cwhen the kingpin snapped in the truck it throwed it up. * * * After the kingpin snapped it throwed it up, then the truck dropped.\u201d He denied he heard the snapping at the same time the collision occurred. \u201cAll I can tell you is that I told you once before. When this snapping noise, that was first, and then when it popped it throwed it up and then it fell, the truck fell and the wheel went out underneath of it and it went up the road.\u201d He claimed he was traveling about a car and a half length back of Goynes\u2019 car. He said he was traveling that distance behind the car because of the two cars on the left hand side \u2014 \u201cI started to pass the man when the cars passed me.\u201d He did not know how long he had been traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>that close to the car in front. He was asked: \u201cYou didn\u2019t feel that it was necessary to allow some space to get in between you and the rear of Mr. Goynes\u2019 car before you attempted [to pass]\u201d, and he replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t think anything would happen.\u201d Pressed further he reiterated: \u201cLike I \u2014 as I say, his car was low, I didn\u2019t run up on him, and I was starting to hit when this \u2014 when the kingpin snapped and this wheel \u2014 it throwed it and the car hit and my truck fell. * * * That\u2019s what I say * * * to you awhile ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Blackburn testified he saw his truck in the median strip shortly after the accident. The right wheel was off and was underneath the truck about where the driver would sit. It was not attached to the axle but it was attached to the tie rod. The mileage on the truck was under 25,000 miles. He had the truck towed to his garage. About 8:00 o\u2019clock the same morning he had his mechanic, Thomas Bosley, jack up the truck to see the extent of the damage. \u201cWe saw that we had lost a kingpin and a right wheel and a brake hose had been cut in two * * The kingpin was about an inch and an eighth in diameter and six inches long made of \u201csolid steel.\u201d The kingpin was broken in half. He testified that the kingpins on the truck were periodically checked to see if they should be replaced. \u201cIf there\u2019s any break in the kingpins \u2014when a kingpin is extremely bad, the wheel will do this [indicating it wobbles] going down the road, which will wear the tire uneven. * * * If the kingpin is not too bad to show wear on the tire, you\u2019ll get it when the truck is jacked up by movement of the tire from the top portion to the bottom portion. Place your hand on the tire, if it\u2019s worn on the bottom you change it. If there\u2019s any looseness you know the kingpins are worn. The average life of kingpins are around one hundred thousand miles.\u201d The described procedures were a regular part of his truck maintenance program.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Thomas Bosley testified that he serviced the truck during the first week of February 1968. The servicing in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>eluded checking \u201cthe front end to see if there was <em>any </em>play in it or anything like that.\u201d He checked all the wheels. He found nothing wrong with the kingpin of the right front wheel. Also he had driven the truck in question the day before the accident on the 7:00 p.m. shift of the Annapolis run and it was in good condition. \u201cIt was operating properly * * * if there had been anything the matter with it I would have done something about it.\u201d It appeared that the truck had not been driven thereafter until Burns drove it. Bosley also testified that the truck was equipped with a governor that limited the maximum speed to 58 miles per hour. He also described and exhibited to the jury a spindle and kingpin assembly similar to one on the truck in question. He said he had inspected the truck the morning of the accident and corroborated Blackburn\u2019s observations. He disconnected the tie rod from the wheel of the truck. \u201cThe bottom part of the kingpin was in the spindle and the other part of the kingpin was in the axle of the truck.\u201d The kingpin was broken in two in the portion which was within the spindle. He was asked what the effect would be of the kingpin for the right front wheel breaking as the truck was driving down the road. He answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201cWell, it broke down here and that causes it to shut down \u2014 all the weight was on this top part and it pulled down here and pulled this up off of there and left this part \u2014 the big part of the kingpin in the axle. * * * The top one\u2014 this part of the spindle. * * * The small part was down in the bottom of the spindle. It broke there \u2014 about a quarter of an inch or a little more below this part here, and this big piece was still stuck in with the kingpin \u2014 there\u2019s a bolt goes through \u2014 under the axle \u2014 where the bolt goes through there and holds this kingpin in the axle. * * * There wasn\u2019t no way for that to get out. * * * It would throw it out. * * * T said the thing itself is one of the whole tire pulling out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>and pulling the spindle and bending the spindle out and pulling it off of the top of the kingpin. * * * And that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We gather from what he said that the wheel would come off when the kingpin broke.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He said the spindle was bent and that the bending was caused by the bottom part of the kingpin vibrating after breaking in two.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">We said in <em>Buchanan v. Galliher and Harless, </em>11 Md. App. 83, 87-88, <em>cert. denied </em>261 Md. 722:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cWhen a trial court is called upon by a motion for a directed verdict to rule upon the legal sufficiency of the evidence to require submission of any issue to a jury, the court must assume the truth of all credible evidence on that issue and of all inferences fairly deducible therefrom, and consider them in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made, and if such evidence and inferences lead to conclusions from which reasonable minds could not differ, then the issue is one of law for the court and not one of fact for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">This rule applies with equal force, whether the motion is made by a plaintiff or by a defendant; whether the moving party or the opposing party has the burden of proving the issue ; and whether the motion goes to the opposing party\u2019s whole case, or is partial, or is a request for a peremptory instruction on the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">The trial court is governed by the same considerations in determining a motion for a judgment N.O.V. <em>Miller v. Michalek, </em>13 Md. App. 16, 17, citing <em>Wheeler v. Katzoff, </em>242 Md. 431, 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>In the instant case, resolving all conflicts in the evidence in favor of Burns and Blackburn, and assuming the truth of all of the evidence favoring them, and the reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, there were facts which a jury might legitimately have concluded to be true which would have excused them from liability. Without entering into the realm of speculation, we think the jury may have concluded from the facts that the kingpin of the right front wheel of the truck broke as Burns pulled out to pass Goynes\u2019 car, throwing the truck onto the rear of the car, and that it was this mechanical failure, not chargeable to Burns and Blackburn, rather than any negligent act or omission on the part of either appellant, which was the proximate cause of the accident. As to the question whether Burns was following Goynes too closely, the Court of Appeals in <em>Rabinovitz v. Kilner, </em>206 Md. 455, 464, said: \u201cAll questions of fact, such as speed, diligence of observation and the relative position of the cars at various times are, of course, for the jury.\u201d See <em>Pettaway v. Washington, </em>255 Md. 202, 207-208 and <em>Ghiradello v. Malina, </em>238 Md. 498, 505, quoting this language. And see <em>Brehrm v. Lorenz, </em>206 Md. 500, 509 and <em>Mitchell v. Dowdy, </em>184 Md. 634, 642 concerning negligence with respect to one vehicle following in close proximity to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The lower court gave its reasons for granting the motion N.O.V. in favor of appellees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cThe court feels that it erred in not directing the matter of liability in favor of the plaintiff because it feels there was no evidence whatsoever that this so-called kingpin broke prior to the \u2014 the collision between the two \u2014 two vehicles. As a matter of fact, I \u2014 I am confident in my own mind that the driver of the truck was asleep when this happened. But be that as it may, the court feels that it committed an error in submitting \u2014 ah\u2014the matter of the prior failure to the jury because there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>that it did fail prior to the collision \u2014 popping sound could result in the bumpers hitting, and it was also testified that all the damage occurring to the truck could have occurred as a result of the collision and not having resulted in the collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We find no evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that Burns was asleep when the accident occurred. And we do not agree that there was \u201cno evidence whatsoever\u201d that the kingpin broke prior to the collision; Burns\u2019 testimony tended to show that it did break before the impact. In noting that the \u201cpopping sound\u201d could \u201cresult in bumpers hitting\u201d and in observing that there was testimony that \u201call the damage occurring to the truck could have occurred as a result of the collision and not having resulted in the collision\u201d, the lower court was not abiding by the firmly established rule that the evidence, in the correct posture of why it was being considered, namely whether or not to grant a motion N.O.V. in favor of the Goynes, must be considered, as above set out, in the light most favorable to Burns, resolving all conflicts in his favor. We cannot say that the evidence and all the inferences fairly deducible therefrom when so considered lead to conclusions from which reasonable minds could not differ. \u201cOnly in exceptional cases, where it is clear * * * that reasonable minds would not differ with regard to the facts, will the question of negligence pass from the realm of fact to that of law.\u201d <em>Altenburg v. Sears, </em>249 Md. 298, 304. Therefore the issue of appellants\u2019 negligence was not one of law for the court but one of fact for the jury. We hold the court erred in granting the motion N.O.V. in favor of appellees. The issue was properly submitted to the jury. See <em>Herbert v. Klisenbauer, </em>12 Md. App. 135. As the lower court did not conditionally order a new trial, we shall enter a judgment upon the original verdict. Rule 563 cl (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We feel it advisable to make several observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We entertain this appeal only because of the unusual circumstances existent. Normally we would dismiss it <em>sua sponte </em>because there is no final judgment, the issue of damages remaining unresolved. There was no express determination by the trial court that there was no just reason for delay and no express direction for the entry of a final judgment. Rule 605 a. See Rule 1035; Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 1; <em>Flores v. King, </em>13 Md. App. 270; <em>Knight v. Tolson, </em>10 Md. App. 311. The Court of Appeals has applied Rule 605 a in a series of opinions. In <em>Picking v. State Finance Co., </em>257 Md. 554, it discussed the purpose of the Rule, at 557:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\u201cThe purpose of this rule * * * is to prevent piecemeal appeals as far as possible, and thereby avoid the confusion, delay and expense which would be caused by having two or more appeals in the same suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">We determine the appeal here only because it would violate the expressed purpose of the Rule not to do so. We think it against the orderly administration of justice in the exceptional circumstances here to remand the case and have a jury impaneled to ascertain damages in the face of the jury\u2019s verdict for the defendants-appellants when we feel the case was properly submitted to the jury and would so hold on a subsequent appeal. But our action here is not to be construed as a viable exception to the principle that an appeal lies only from a final judgment or a reflection on the integrity of the previous opinions applying the Rule. It is simply that we do not believe there should be a war between the technical procedures of the law and common sense which strict adherence to the Rule would in this unique situation initiate. Cf. <em>Madden v. Clouser, </em>262 Md. 144. But see <em>Wheeler v. Katzoff, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">When the lower court, feeling it had erred in not directing a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs at the trial, subsequently granted the motion N.O.V. it spoke in terms of \u201cthe matter of liability.\u201d As opinions of the Court of Appeals and this Court have stated, there is a clearly delineated distinction between \u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201cliability.\u201d <em>Peroti v. Williams, </em>258 Md. 663; <em>Levin v. Arrabal, </em>11 Md. App. 89. The Court said in <em>Peroti, </em>at 669:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201cEven if the negligence of the defendant as a matter of law exists, this conclusion alone will not authorize the granting of a directed verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the question of liability. Liability is an obligation to pay, and arises only when all essential elements of an action are established. The basic elements necessary for a cause of action in negligence are a duty or obligation which the defendant is under to protect plaintiff from injury, a failure to discharge that duty, and actual loss or injury to the plaintiff proximately resulting from that failure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">\u201cDirection of a verdict that liability exists is improper unless all elements, including damages, are so convincingly shown that rational minds would not differ as to their existence.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">As we have decided that the grant of the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>N.O.V. here was improper in any event because the question of the defendants\u2019 negligence was properly for the jury, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether it could properly have extended to liability rather than being restricted to negligence. We do not have all the evidence presented in the case before us because the parties stipulated that the record on appeal would not include a transcript of all the testimony,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and it is not certain from the record we have that there were conceded damages sustained by the Goynes or such evidence regarding damages as to make a direction as to liability proper. We note that in instructing the jury the court said they were not to consider the pain, suffering, mental anguish and discomfort to which Goynes would be put in the future \u201cbecause there was no testimony as to that\u201d, nor could they consider the damage to his automobile \u201cbecause there was no before and after value testified, so although, apparently, he had an automobile which was damaged, since there was no testimony as to the value of the car at the time of the accident as opposed to junk value [Goynes said the car was a total loss and sold as junk], you may not consider that in arriving at damage for him if you do find in his favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The lower court awarded a new trial for damages only. It is well established that the action of a trial court on a motion for a new trial is not reviewable on appeal, at least when the trial court fairly exercised its discretion. <em>Murphy v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>13 Md. App. 497, 513 and cases therein cited. However, in the unique circumstances here existent, the grant of a new trial and the grant of the motion N.O.V. were indiscerptible. We have found the grant of the motion N.O.V. was er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ror. Therefore, it follows necessarily that the grant of the new trial was not fairly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The jury were fairly instructed by the trial court so as to put the question of appellants\u2019 negligence squarely before them. Its charge included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cNow in this connection, the law also is that the driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway. There again, it\u2019s a matter of the standards of reasonableness and prudence which is for your determination. You are instructed that it is the duty of the driver of a motor vehicle to have his automobile under control at all times, which means that he must have it under such control that it can be stopped before doing injury in any situation which is reasonably likely to arrive under the circumstances and therefore the motorist must drive in such a manner that he can bring his vehicle to a stop at a sign of danger, and if you find that the defendant in the case which you have just heard, drove his vehicle at a speed which was unreasonable and not commensurate with existing conditions, that he failed to observe in time the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle in front of him in order to decelerate sufficiently to avoid this collision, then your verdict should be for the plaintiffs. You are instructed also that if you find that this collision was caused by a combination of defendant\u2019s driver following too closely to the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle, coupled with an unforeseeable mechanical defect, that is, these two things were coincident and \u2014 ah\u2014not necessarily one as opposed to the other, then in that case also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>you should find for the plaintiff. You are likewise instructed that should you find that Mr. Burns was operating his truck in a careful and prudent manner under the existing road conditions and experienced a sudden and unexpected and unforeseeable mechanical failure which caused his truck to strike the vehicle of the plaintiff, and that the defendants had properly maintained and inspected the vehicle prior to the accident and found it to be in proper working order and that such mechanical failure was the sole proximate cause of the accident and injuries to the plaintiff, then you must find for the defendant. In other words, if there were proper inspection, if you find that there were proper inspection, and if you find further that a mechanical failure took place which could not be foreseen and would not ordinarily have been foreseen under the circumstances in spite of the \u2014the inspection made, then Mr. Burns and Mr. Blackburn cannot be held responsible for the injuries and damages sustained by the plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Judgment in favor of appellees reversed; grant of new trial vacated; judgment for costs below entered in favor of appellants upon the original verdict; appellees to pay costs of this appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">. The action of the lower court in reserving decision on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and submitting the case to the jury in itself operated as a motion for judgment N.O.V. Rule 563 a <em>2. </em>In any event, both the motion for judgment N.O.V. and the motion for a new trial were timely filed. Each were required to be filed within 3 days after the reception of the verdict. Rule 563 a 1 and 567 a. In computing the period of time, the day of the event after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included and when the time allowed is seven days or less, intermediate Sundays, Saturdays and legal holidays shall not be counted. Rule 8. 9 September 1971 was a Thursday so 14 September was the third day after the reception of the verdict for the filing of the motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. The docket entries of 1 October 1971 read that the court \u201cgranted motion for new trial as to damages, only, after ruling on directed verdict in favor of the Plaintiffs.\u201d They were corrected upon motion by the defendants suggesting the application of Rule 563 a 2. See <em>Morris v. Williams, </em>258 Md. 625, 627.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">. Bums and Blackburn, appellants-defendants, present the question thusly: \u201cWas there legally sufficient evidence to show that the accident occurred without negligence of either of the defendants contributing thereto? The trial court in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment N.O.V. answered this question in the negative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Goynes, et ux, appellees-plaintiffs, pose the question: \u201cWas there legally sufficient evidence to show that negligence of the defendants was the proximate cause of the damages sustained by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-5\">. Bums had said a short time before that as he started to pass Goynes there was \u201ca popping noise \u2014 the kingpin busted.\u201d Goynes\u2019 counsel objected and moved \u201cthat be stricken\u201d and the court said: \u201cAlright. Strike it out.\u201d When he later repeated that the kingpin snapped there was objection but the objection was not ruled on and the testimony stayed in.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\">. As it seems that this testimony was given while referring to a spindle and kingpin assembly actually exhibited to the jury, it would have been more comprehensible to the court and jury than is apparent from the bare record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b325-11\">. This does not mean, as pointed out in footnote 2, page 670 of <em>Peroti, </em>that the full amount of the damages must be agreed upon by the parties. \u201cIf negligence is established and some injury conceded, but the amount disputed, a verdict on liability may be directed, leaving for determination by the jury the amounts to be awarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">The Court went on to observe, at 671, that even when a directed verdict is granted, the amount of recovery may be quite minimal, but reiterated that \u201cactual damages are a prerequisite for liability in negligence cases, and nominal damages, or \u2018technical liability\u2019 do not exist.\u201d It then presented a caveat in note 3 at 671: \u201cNominal damages, however, mhy properly be awarded in certain classes of tort actions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">. It was stipulated that the record \u201cwill include only stipulations, the testimony of Howard William Goynes, plaintiff; Ernest James Bums and Royee Dean Blackburn, defendants; Thomas Bosley, and the court\u2019s rulings, instructions, exceptions by counsel, and the ruling on the motion for Judgment N.O.V. or in the Alternative a New Trial.\u201d See Rule 1026 c 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
