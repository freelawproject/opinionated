On March 19, 1970, appearance of his counsel was entered, he was arraigned, and he entered a plea of not guilty and elected a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Upon appearing for trial on August 12, 1970, appellant, according to a docket entry, withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to count 1 of the indictment. The court ordered a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The docket records that on October 1, 1970, the presentence report was filed, and \u201cBartlett is placed on probation under the supervision of the department of parole and probation for a period of 2 years without a finding of guilt.\u201d On that date appellant signed and filed a paper, addressed to the court, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201cI hereby consent to be placed on probation without a finding of guilt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under Article 27, Section 641, of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Probation period to be active (2 years).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">A petition asserting violation of certain conditions of probation was filed on September 23, 1971, and a warrant was issued that day for apprehension of appellant on that charge. A violation hearing was held on October 18,1971. At its conclusion the judge found that appellant had violated his probation, and sentenced him to serve one year, beginning September 29, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Appellant contended below and here that the court, having earlier placed him on probation \u201cwithout a finding of guilt\u201d could not, upon revoking the probation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> enter a verdict of guilt and impose sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">It appears that when the question was raised at the hearing below, there was some confusion as to whether the probation had been granted under Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 641, which applies generally to persons accused of crime, or under \u00a7 292, which applies exclusively to first offenders against the laws relating to controlled dangerous substances. The court noted that appellant\u2019s consent had referred to \u00a7 641, and said that he would so construe the probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>There was another and even more compelling reason. Section 292 was enacted as a part of Ch. 403, Laws of Maryland, 1970, effective July 1, 1970, which also contained provisions, \u00a7 302 (a) and (d), that it applied to violations which occurred following its effective date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The violation with which appellant was charged occurred on December 9, 1969. Section 302 (a) included a saving clause for prior violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The probation \u201cwithout a finding of guilt\u201d could have been imposed only under \u00a7 641. Neither in the docket entries nor elsewhere in the record before us can we find that the plea of guilty to count 1, entered by appellant on August 12, 1970, was either accepted or rejected by the court, or was thereafter withdrawn or stricken. At the time the probation was granted, the docket shows, \u201cNolle pros 2 and 2 as to Bartlett.\u201d This entry may have referred to counts 2 and 3 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">At the end of the evidence on the question of violation, the judge explained his approach as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cAccording to the docket entries in this case Mr. Bartlett entered a plea of guilty to the first count of the indictment, and I, as the Court, ordered a presentence investigation. Subsequently I placed him on probation for a period of two years without a finding of guilt. So it would seem that we have to make these determinations, and possibly in this order: First a finding that he was in violation of the conditions of his probation. If we find then that he was, it would seem that we would strike the probation and enter a verdict upon his plea of guilty, and then impose sentence. That is what the Court proposes to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">That is what the court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We think it was error to treat appellant\u2019s guilty plea as still on the bargaining table. The court\u2019s action in placing appellant on probation \u201cwithout a finding of guilt\u201d amounted, by necessary implication, to rejecting or striking his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The power of the courts to suspend sentences imposed upon persons convicted of crime, and to \u201cmake such orders and impose such terms as to costs, recognizance for appearance, or matters relating to the residence or conduct of the convicts as may be deemed proper\u201d was for many years derived from the statute which is now Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 639. Broader power was given in Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 .641, first enacted with limited application in 1955, and in 1957 made to apply to all courts of general criminal jurisdiction. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cThe circuit courts of the several counties in this State and the Criminal Court of Baltimore City, before conviction of any person accused of crime with the written consent of the person so accused, including persons appealing from convictions before trial magistrates or before the Municipal Court of Baltimore City, whether a minor or an adult, and after conviction or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, without such consent, are empowered, during the term of court in which such consent, conviction or plea is had, to :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">(1) Suspend the imposition of sentence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">(2) Place such person on probation without finding a verdict; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">(3) Make such conditions of suspension of sentence and probation as the court may deem proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">In holding that a Trial Magistrate<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had no power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>grant probation without verdict, the Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Jacob, </em>234 Md. 452, 199 A. 2d 803, said, at page 455:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201cThe power to suspend sentence can be exercised only when there has been a conviction and sentence thereon; probation without verdict, if granted, avoids any finding of guilt. Indeed, one of its primary purposes, where its use is deemed appropriate, is to avoid placing the stigma of a conviction on the accused. See Mutter, <em>Probation in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, </em>17 Md. L. Rev. 309, 314. The difference is further manifested by the fact that these two powers are separately mentioned and dealt with by several statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">See <em>Skinker v. State, </em>239 Md. 234, 239, 210 A. 2d 716. See also <em>Costello v. State, </em>240 Md. 164, 213 A. 2d 739, where the Court said, at page 167:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201cMaryland law authorizes probation only before verdict or upon the suspension of sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The Court of Appeals again considered the significance of probation without verdict in <em>Comm\u2019r of Motor Vehicles v. Lee, </em>254 Md. 279, 255 A. 2d 44. Lee had been charged with certain motor vehicle violations in the Municipal Court of Baltimore City. Their disposition was entered as \u201cprobation without verdict\u201d, but nevertheless fines were imposed. The imposition of fines was treated by the Department of Motor Vehicles as a conviction, and Lee\u2019s operator\u2019s license was revoked. The case reached the Court of Appeals by certiorari, and that Court said, at pages 284 and 285:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">\u201cAt the outset, we observed that, in our opinion, it is not proper for the municipal courts, the circuit courts for the counties or for the Criminal Court of Baltimore to make a finding of \u2018Probation without Verdict\u2019 as to a particular of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>fense charged and at the same time impose a pecuniary penalty or fine for that offense. The two actions are inconsistent with each other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">After further discussion of the subject, the Court said at page 287:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cIt is our opinion that a monetary fine, penalty or charge payable to the State may only be imposed upon an accused if there is a finding of guilt, either after a trial on the merits or upon valid pleas of guilty or <em>nolo </em>contendere. Such an imposition is inconsistent with the granting of probation without finding a verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">It is clear to us that \u00a7 841 authorizes the courts to make either of two dispositions of a case, not theretofore available to them, and with either disposition, to make such conditions as they may deem proper. The posture of the case appropriate to each of the two alternative dispositions is set forth in the preceding one-sentence paragraph of the section, but the two prerequisites are separable. The effect is as if the section were to be read, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">1. The courts, <em>before </em>conviction of any person accused of crime, with the written consent of the person so accused, are empowered to place such person on probation without finding a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">2. The courts, <em>after </em>conviction of any person accused of crime, or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, without his consent, are empowered to suspend the imposition of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">3. In either event, the court is empowered to make such conditions as it may deem proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Procedurally, when a judge concludes to place an accused on probation without finding a verdict, and the accused consents in writing, there must be in the case an indictment (Maryland Rule 702 a) or a charging document (Maryland District Rule 702 a) and there may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>a plea of not guilty, but there may not be a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere. Should there be either of the latter, the judge should grant leave to withdraw it, or should order it stricken. Only then is the case in proper posture for placing the accused on probation without finding a verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Should the probation thus granted be revoked at a subsequent hearing for that purpose, the case reverts to its status at the time the probation was granted, and determination of guilt, by plea or trial, must follow before any sentence may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">It follows that the order striking probation in this case should be aifirmed, but that the entry of a verdict on the plea of guilty must be reversed, and the sentence then imposed must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\n<em>Order of October 18, 1971 that probation be stricken is affirmed; the entry of a verdict on the plea of guilty is reversed; the sentence imposed is vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-11\">. The statute, <em>infra, </em>authorizes \u201cprobation without finding a verdict\u201d. We see no reason not to use the precise words of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-12\">. Appellant does not contend here that the finding of violation was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">. Appellant was entitled to and received the benefit of Ch. 237, Lq,ws of Maryland, 1970, effective April 15, 1970. The act reduced possession of marihuana from a felony to a misdemeanor, reduced the penalties and provided that it applied to any proceedings not finally adjudicated on its effective date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b258-11\">. Some but not all courts of limited jurisdiction exercised a similar power under other statutes. The District Courts now have such power under Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">. What we say here is applicable to proceedings under Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 641 and Art. 26, \u00a7 146, but is not applicable to the special proceedings under Art. 27, \u00a7 292.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
