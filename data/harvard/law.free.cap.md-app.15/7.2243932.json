And see also Code, Art. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 132-138. By order of the Court of Appeals of 6 December 1971 the appeal was transferred to this Court to be docketed and decided or otherwise disposed of. See Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 5B.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The prime point Montgomery makes in his attack on the judgment is that the sixth amendment right \u201cto have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense\u201d was denied him. It was not that he had no counsel representing him at the trial, nor was it that the counsel representing him was incompetent. It was that the case as conducted by the prosecution gave rise to an unusual circumstance, not only unexpected by the defense, but one which they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>not reasonably have foreseen, which, according to Montgomery, resulted in his counsel not affording him a genuine and effective representation. The circumstance arose by the State calling David Phillip Brown, who had prior thereto been convicted of the first degree murder of Greene, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>as a witness in its behalf in rebuttal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It seemed that he had not been called to testify at either of the two aborted trials of Montgomery. When the State called Brown, defense counsel, Phillip McKay Sutley, Esq., who, according to the transcript of the proceedings was the only attorney representing Montgomery at the trial, asked to approach the bench. He informed the court that he also represented Brown.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The transcript of the trial shows what transpired out of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">\u201cMR SUTLEY [Defense Counsel] : I have been placed in a position now which I think almost necessitates my withdrawing from this case. I represent Brown. I don\u2019t think I could ever cross-examine him about this case. I don\u2019t know what he is going to testify to. But there is a recent Maryland case which was somewhat like this, and I feel that my effectiveness as counsel at this time would be limited and somebody else would have to get in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know why you say that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">Mr. Sutley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">MR. SUTLEY: Well, I represented Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">MR. LUCAS [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] : No conflict here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">MR. SUTLEY: I think there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>MR. LUCAS: Where is the conflict? He is tried and convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">MR. SUTLEY: I represented him and there is a certain client and attorney privilege that I have between myself and Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">MR. LUCAS: That ended when the case was over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">MR. SUTLEY: I don\u2019t think so. This man still has an appeal pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">MR. LUCAS: The appeal is confirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">MR. SUTLEY: In the United States District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">THE COURT: In the United States District Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">MR. SUTLEY: I think it is. I feel I am put in a position right now when I can\u2019t be as effective as I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-12\">THE COURT: Why can\u2019t you, Mr. Sutley? Brown\u2019s case is over for all intents and purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-13\">You are not going to be in Brown\u2019s case any more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-14\">MR. LUCAS: That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-15\">THE COURT: Why is it that you can\u2019t effectively represent Mr. Montgomery? You have certainly done an outstanding job so far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-16\">MR. SUTLEY: I don\u2019t know what Brown is going to testify to. I certainly have a good idea, but I don\u2019t know what he is going to testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHk8\">THE COURT: Well, if you are dealing in the realm of the unknown, why don\u2019t you wait until that becomes known before you make this proffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-17\">MR. SUTLEY: I mean I had information gathered from representing Brown which I don\u2019t think would be fair to Brown. I don\u2019t know what the status is. I think he has a petition in front of the Federal Court right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-18\">THE COURT: Wouldn\u2019t that be true all along? Wouldn\u2019t your representation be dual ab initio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>if it is going to be dual when Brown takes the stand? Wouldn\u2019t it be conflicting from the start? You never felt this way before, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">MR. SUTLEY: Well, I never was really faced with this posture, I don\u2019t think. Why don\u2019t we see as we go along?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">THE COURT: Why don\u2019t we wait and see, Mr. Sutley. If you have an objection, raise it, please. Wait a minute. Come back. I think it is only fair to ask your feelings in the matter, Mr. Montgomery. Are you willing for Mr. Sutley to go ahead and represent you or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">THE DEFENDANT: I prefer having Mr. Sutley continue on the case, but if there is going to be some kind of conflict of interest wherein Mr. Sutley may possibly be endangered, I don\u2019t think that is advisable at all. As a matter of fact, defending a person as Mr. Sutley has done for both me and Brown is one thing, but defending me and then cross-examining against me would certainly be an exact opposite posture. And I don\u2019t know if he can effectively do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">THE COURT: All right, thank you. Go ahead. We will see what happens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">What happened was that Brown, after stating that he was serving a life sentence imposed on 11 September 1969 upon conviction of murder in the first degree, testified that he had known Montgomery since 1960 or 1961 when he met him at the Hagerstown penal farm. He pointed out Montgomery in the courtroom. He said that on the day of the murder he left work about 11:40 a.m. and went to Montgomery\u2019s house at Montgomery\u2019s request. At the time Brown was working as a bench press operator at a printing plant and Montgomery did not have a job \u2014 \u201che had one but then he got fired.\u201d They went to several places, including a Sonny Surplus store where Brown bought a blank pistol, and then drove to North Point Boulevard in Baltimore County. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cQ. What if anything did you do while you were on North Point Boulevard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">A. Stuck up a gas station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">Q.

Who did what when you went into the gas station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-15\">A. Well, I went in there to get some gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-16\">Q. Who was with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-17\">A. Jerry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-18\">Q. All right. You went in to get gas. What did Jerry do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-19\">A. He went to the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-20\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-21\">Q. What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-22\">A. Went to the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-23\">BY MR. LUCAS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-24\">Q. And after he was in the bathroom what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-25\">A. I was drinking a soda when he come back out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-26\">Q. When he came back out, Jerry came back out of the bathroom, where did you go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-27\">A. He said this looked like a good spot to hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-28\">Q. And?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-29\">A. Well, I had the blank pistol in my pocket. I said, \u2018Okay.\u2019 So we were going to stick it up. I don\u2019t know where he got his gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Q. Oh, he had a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">A. Yes, he had a real one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">Q. When did you see it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">A. When he stuck up the kid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">Q. What did he say or do when he stuck up the kid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">A. He just told the boy it was a stickup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">Q. What did the boy say or do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">A. He started to get up out of the chair, and that is when the gun fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">Q. Who fired the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-13\">A. Jerry, he had it in his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-14\">Q. Where did he shoot \u2014 did he shoot the boy? A. Well, I don\u2019t think he intentionally shot him, but he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-15\">Q. He did shoot him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-17\">Q. Where did he shoot him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-18\">A. Back here somewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-19\">Q. Back of the head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-21\">Q. All right, now, after he shot the boy in the back of the head, what did he say or do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-22\">A. The only thing he done was, after he grabbed the gun, picked the gun back up, then\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-23\">Q. Did he pick anything else up ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-24\">A. Yes, he picked the money up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-25\">Q. Where was the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-26\">A. In the shirt pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-27\">Q. And how was the money held together, if you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-28\">A. A large paper clip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-29\">Q. All right. So he took the money out of the boy\u2019s pocket while he was laying on the floor? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-30\">Q. Then what did he say or do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-31\">A. By that time I was gone. I was getting ready to get out of there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-32\">Q. Did he get in the car with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-33\">A. He caught up with me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>After the incident they went to Glen Burnie and then \u201cto a spot on Dorsey Road.\u201d Brown said the murder gun was thrown in Marley Creek. He asserted that no reward was offered him to testify, no one made any promises to him and gave him any inducements or threatened him. He had gotten in touch with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office on his own accord and made known that he had evidence to offer in the case. He also testified about being in the Anne Arundel County Jail on 27 May 1965 where he met Montgomery. They were placed in the same cell. Montgomery told Brown: \u201cWhatever you do, man, don\u2019t say nothing about the Dundalk job.\u201d Montgomery was \u201ca little excited\u201d when they were talking about the homicide. Brown remembered other inmates in the jail, among them Randall and Ryan. The cross-examination was limited in scope and substance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">\u201cBY MR. SUTLEY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">Q. You said you were represented \u2014 you were tried in September 1969?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">Q. And do you recall who represented you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">Q. Who was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">A. You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\">Q. And you have since appealed that case, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-13\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-14\">Q. Do you know the decision in that case, your appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-15\">A. Affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-16\">Q. What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-17\">A. Affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-18\">Q. What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-19\">A. That means they stopped it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-20\">Q. So your case is concluded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-21\">A. Temporarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-22\">Q. You testified in your prior trial, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Q. Did you tell a different story than you have told today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">MR. SUTLEY: That is all I have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">On redirect the State asked if, in his trial, he had been \u201cquestioned as to who committed the murder in this case? Was it ever asked of you who committed the murder?\u201d He replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But I am not sure.\u201d There was no recross-examination. The State rested. The defense offered no sur-rebuttal. Out of the hearing of the jury the court inquired whether the case should be argued that day or, because it was 8:10 P.M., to continue the trial the next morning. The State preferred the latter. The court asked Montgomery how he felt. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I think at this point I would prefer having someone else represent me here, because I am certainly not aware of what my rights are at this point. Since I haven\u2019t seen my counsel for quite a while, I am certain I don\u2019t know what procedures are proper here, what rights I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">MR. LUCAS: If he has any questions as to procedure, your Honor, I think he ought to consult with Mr. Sutley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">THE DEFENDANT: I can\u2019t recognize Mr. Sutley any longer as my attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\">MR. SUTLEY: I prefer to finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-12\">THE COURT: Finish tonight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-13\">MR. SUTLEY: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-14\">After discussion, the court ruled that the case would be finished that day. The jury were instructed, counsel argued to them, and at 5:02 P.M. the jury retired to deliberate their verdict. The verdict was rendered at 9:40 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-15\">We first observe that the testimony of Brown was an important part of the State\u2019s case, and we can only con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>elude that there was a reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the conviction. Montgomery had taken the stand and categorically denied any participation whatsoever in the robbery and murder of Greene.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before Brown\u2019s rebuttal testimony, proof of Montgomery\u2019s criminal agency depended in the main on the testimony of a police officer who had been planted in the Anne Arundel County Jail and overheard a conversation between Brown and Montgomery indicating their involvement in the murder and on the testimony of several criminals who had been incarcerated in the jail and testified they overheard Montgomery talk in a similar vein. The case would turn on whether the jury believed the prosecution witnesses or the defense witnesses. This was clearly brought out in the closing arguments to the jury by both prosecution and defense counsel. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>stressed Brown\u2019s testimony \u2014 \u201cAnd then we have, most of all, Mr. Brown, his friend, and his companion, who was good enough to drive his car to the gas station and participate in the robbery and killing of Richard Greene.\u201d Defense counsel urged that Montgomery presented a clear picture of what had actually happened and asked the jury to look at the evidence contradicting him. He argued that Brown was the only witness who really did contradict Montgomery. The question was who was telling the truth. The State came back in its final argument: \u201cSo we have Mr. Brown. No eye witness to this murder and robbery? We had an eye witness, David Brown. He was the eye witness to this robbery and murder. He participated in it, from his own testimony. He was convicted of it and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was the eye witness that was there and told under oath that Montgomery pulled the trigger, the .22 caliber pistol, and shot and killed Richard Greene. There is our eye witness. But Montgomery denies all this.\u201d We think it plain that if defense counsel was improperly precluded from making an effective attempt to impeach Brown\u2019s credibility, it would not be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We next observe that although Sutley represented Brown at his trial on the charge that he murdered Greene, it appeared that at the time of Montgomery\u2019s trial Brown was no longer his client. The records of this Court reflect that Brown was represented by Thomas G. Bodie, Esq. on his direct appeal to this Court from the judgment entered on his conviction of murdering Greene. Bodie also represented Brown in his petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals, see note 1 <em>supra. </em>And we think it obvious from Sutley\u2019s remarks at Montgomery\u2019s trial, see <em>supra, </em>that he did not represent Brown in whatever proceedings were pending in the federal courts. Thus no conflict of interest arose, as it often does, from the simultaneous representation of two persons by one attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">If there was a conflict of interest here it arose because of a lawyer\u2019s obligation to hold inviolate the confidences and secrets of his client. See <em>Code of Professional Respon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>sibility, </em>Canon 4, Ethical Considerations EC 4-1 to EC 4-6, inclusive; Disciplinary Rules, DR 4-101; Maryland Rule 1230.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cBoth the fiduciary relationship existing between lawyer and client and the proper functioning of the legal system require the preservation by the lawyer of confidences and secrets of one who has employed or sought to employ him.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> EC 4-1. \u201cA lawyer must always be sensitive to the rights and wishes of his client and act scrupulously in the making of decisions which may involve the disclosure of information obtained in his professional relationship.\u201d EC 4-2. \u201cThe obligation of a lawyer to preserve the confidences of his client continues after the termination of his employment,\u201d and even following the termination of the practice of the lawyer. EC 4-6. But a lawyer may reveal confidences or secrets with the consent of the client after a full disclosure of them. DR 4-101 (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Considering the substance of Brown\u2019s testimony and the free and voluntary manner in which he said he came to testify, we find a release by him to Sutley of any obligation Sutley may have had not to reveal confidences and secrets regarding the murder of Greene. In other words, we think that Brown consented implicitly within the contemplation of DR 4-101 (c) (1) to the revelation by Sutley of such confidences and secrets. The record does not show what confidences and secrets were imparted to Sutley by Brown during their professional relationship but Brown\u2019s testimony at Montgomery\u2019s trial may be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>sidered in two lights. Either it was the same in substance as that which he told Sutley or it was contrary to what he told Sutley. If it was the same, then what he told Sutley ceased to be a confidence or a secret because Brown himself voluntarily disclosed it publicly. Thereafter Sutley was under no obligation to preserve what was no longer confidential and secret. If it was contrary to what he had told Sutley, then Brown either lied to Sutley or his testimony at the trial was perjured. If he lied to Sutley then he could not expect his testimony to be accepted with no reference to his prior inconsistent statements and we believe that Sutley, in the interest of justice, could properly make inquiry of him. If his testimony was perjured \u201cThe Law and Disciplinary Rules prohibit the use of fraudulent, false, or perjured testimony or evidence. A lawyer who knowingly participates in introduction of such testimony or evidence is subject to discipline.\u201d <em>Code of Professional Responsibility, </em>Canon 7, EC 7-26. \u201cBecause it interferes with the proper administration of justice, a lawyer should not suppress evidence that he or his client has a legal obligation to reveal or produce.\u201d EC 7-27. See DR 7-102 (A) (3) and (6). Further, DR 7-102 (b) provides: \u201cA lawyer who receives information clearly establishing that: (1) His client has, in the course of the representation, perpetrated a fraud upon a person or tribunal shall promptly call upon his client to rectify the same, and if his client refuses or is unable to do so, he shall reveal the fraud to the affected person or tribunal. (2) A person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal shall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.\u201d The short of it is that we feel that in the circumstances there was no conflict of interest such as to preclude a full cross-examination of Brown by Sutley. However, this conclusion does not end our inquiry. \u201cThe issue of conflict of interests is substantially subsumed by the more critical consideration of effectiveness of counsel; once the latter is shown to have been denied, a prolusion that the former was its cause would seem to be mere academic surplusage.\u201d Note, <em>Conflict of In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>terests in Criminal Proceedings, </em>23 Arkansas Law Review 250, 251 (1969). The question is, therefore, does the record here show that effectiveness of counsel was denied Montgomery.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">When Sutley made known his views upon Brown being called by the State, he said he did not know what Brown\u2019s testimony would be but he \u201ccertainly had a good idea.\u201d The discussion concluded with Sutley saying: \u201cWell, I never was really faced with this posture, I don\u2019t think. Why don\u2019t we see as we go along?\u201d The court agreed: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we wait and see Mr. Sutley. If you have an objection, raise it, please.\u201d Montgomery said he did not know if Sutley could effectively cross-examine Brown. The examination of Brown then proceeded. Sutley raised no further objection. As Sutley waited and heard Brown\u2019s testimony without making further objection, we can only conclude that Sutley was satisfied that his fears voiced when Brown was first called by the State proved unwarranted in the light of the actual testimony given. From the record he was content to proceed with the case as Montgomery\u2019s attorney, making no further suggestion that his appearance be stricken. Nor did he move for a mistrial or challenge the proceedings on this issue in any other way. It is true that at the close of Brown\u2019s testimony Montgomery told the court he preferred having someone else represent him and said he could not recognize Sutley as his attorney any longer but he was in no position to judge fairly because it did not appear that he had any knowledge of what Brown had told Sutley. See <em>Davenport v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 89; <em>King v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 652. \u201cIt is for the lawyer in the exercise of his independent professional judgment to separate the relevant and important from the irrelevant and unimportant.\u201d EC 4-1. Viewed in this frame of reference, we think that the limited scope of the cross-examination of Brown may be deemed a trial tactic and perhaps not an unwise one. He elicited that Brown told a different story at his own trial than he told in Montgomery\u2019s trial. We cannot say that Sutley did not feel it was better not to take the chance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Brown remaining steadfast in the face of a vigorous and probing cross-examination, for if he did, such examination could only serve to emphasize and reinforce Brown\u2019s story in the eyes of the jury, and tend to strengthen rather than impeach his credibility. Brown had admitted giving a different version under oath before, giving Sutley the opportunity to argue to the jury, as he did, that Brown was simply not worthy of belief. But even a trial tactic which in retrospect appears to have been erroneous does not compel a conclusion that counsel was inadequate. <em>Hall v. Warden, </em>224 Md. 662, 665; <em>Gullion v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 263, 266. See <em>Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U. S. 443. We hold that Montgomery was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel. Compare <em>Kent v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 293; <em>Brown v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">On 27 May 1965 in the Annapolis Jail, Armond T. Elliott of the Baltimore County Police Department overheard a conversation between Montgomery and Brown which tended to establish their participation in the murder of Greene. The matter of the admissibility of Elliott\u2019s testimony regarding the conversation was heard out of the presence of the jury. The prelude to this activity by Elliott was shown by a stipulation <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> read into evidence by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">\u201cMay it please your Honors, after much work the State and defense have reached the point where we have a stipulation to offer to the Court, beginning with the receipt of a teletype to the Baltimore County Police Bureau, informing the Baltimore County Police that they had two subjects in the Anne Arundel County Jail in Annapolis, on an armed robbery charge, and that the description was similar to that that the Baltimore County Police had prepared from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>identokit during the investigation of this homicide that occurred on May 4th in Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">With this teletype, Lieutenant James Pierce, who is head of the Squad who is now considered the Major Crime Squad, assigned Sergeant Roemer to go to the Annapolis Police Jail to interview these two suspects. After a brief interview and return to Baltimore County Headquarters Sergeant Roemer reported to Lieutenant Pierce that in his opinion and from observing the two suspects, that one of the suspects matched the description of the suspect prepared in the identokit in relation to the homicide on May 4th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">With this information Lieutenant Pierce set a plan into action whereby he assigned Detective Sergeant Paul Hardesty along with Detective Tunney to the Annapolis Jail, as prearranged with Warden Bonar and Lieutenant Paley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">Sergeant Hardesty and Detective Tunney were committed to the Annapolis Jail on May 26, at approximately 3 P.M. They were placed in the cell with instructions from Lieutenant Pierce to obtain whatever information they could in reference to this homicide of May 4th in Baltimore County. The only additional information or instructions they were given were the names of these two suspects, one being the defendant, Montgomery, and the other defendant, Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">Sergeant Hardesty and Detective Tunney remained at the Annapolis Jail, well, let\u2019s start with Tunney. Tunney was removed from the jail the first evening. Sergeant Hardesty remained two days. The following day on the 27th Lieutenant Roemer withdrew Sergeant Hardesty and the replacement officer, Tunney, he assigned Corporal Armond Elliott to go to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>jail. He was committed on the 27th with the same instructions, to obtain whatever information he could concerning the homicide on May 4, 1965 in Baltimore County. Corporal Elliott remained in the jail until the 28th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">Now, Lieutenant Pierce also conceived a plan, I will have to go back to the 26th. Sergeant Hardesty, along with Detective Tunney, had overheard an admission by the defendant and co-defendant, Brown, as to their participation in this homicide in Baltimore County on May 4, 1965. Corporal Elliott along with Detective Tunney also heard admissions by the defendant and his co-defendant as to their participation in the homicide in Baltimore County. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">With this Lieutenant Pierce set up a line-up in Baltimore County Police Headquarters where the defendant and co-defendant were placed in the line-up. This line-up was held for the purpose, the first purpose was to see whether or not an identity could be obtained in reference to an armed robbery committed in Baltimore County of a bake shop. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">The line-up was held in the Annapolis Jail and the lineup was viewed by the woman that was operating the bakery at the time of the holdup. She had made a positive identification. Once this lady left the line-up Lieutenant Pierce, on a prearranged plan, sent in Detective Sergeant John Cox. Sergeant Cox was sent in there for the sole purpose to stimulate conversation between the defendant, Montgomery, and the co-defendant Brown. Sergeant Cox walked into the line-up room. The subjects in the line-up were given an opportunity to change their positions wherever they wished. Sergeant Cox walked in, merely pointed to the defendant Montgomery and to the co-defendant Brown, and without any word or comment left the viewing room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Well, this produced the conversation that they had anticipated and the defendant Montgomery and Brown were taken back to their respective cells, whereupon Corporal Elliott again overheard conversations between the defendant * * * and the co-defendant as to their participation in the homicide of May 4, 1965.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Montgomery gave the court his version of what occurred. On 21 May 1965 he was questioned about Greene\u2019s murder by Corporal Roemer and Officer Ruth. On 27 May in the Annapolis Jail he had a conversation with a man he thought was a fellow prisoner but who in fact was Officer William Turner who asked Montgomery what he was in for and how much time he was doing. Montgomery testified: \u201cOf course I mentioned the fact that I had just been recently interrogated about this murder charge, that I had been interrogated by Officer Ruth and Officer Roemer, and he said, \u2018Do you think there is anything serious in this?\u2019 and I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t see how there can be, I don\u2019t know anything at all about it.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, if they really get you up tight, which means kind of if they have a good case against you or something, you can always plead insanity. Most people get off that way very easily.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t plan on doing that, because I am innocent and I believe in the justice of the courts, and I think that justice ultimately will prevail.\u2019 \u201d Later that afternoon Brown came into the cell block. Elliott, posing as a prisoner named Saunders, was with Brown and they were talking. Montgomery recounted what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cSo I automatically thought, well, if my co-defendant knows him, is talking to him, the guy must be okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">So as soon as he entered the area I jumped up and ran toward my co-defendant, because we had been separated during this period of time, and threw my arms around him, said, \u2018Gee, what are we doing down here?\u2019 And no sooner had I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>said that than this person Elliott said to Brown, my co-defendant, Ts this the one you were talking about?\u2019 And Brown said, \u2018Yes, this is my co-defendant.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">So then this Officer Elliott asked me, he said, \u2018Boy, you are in pretty deep trouble, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 I said, \u2018No, sir. How do you get that?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">He said, \u2018Well, Brown was just telling me that you had been questioned on a homicide, and you are also waiting to be tried on kidnapping and some robberies. Seems you are in pretty bad trouble.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t know where you got your information, but if Brown told you that it is kind of mixed up.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">So this fellow Elliott wanted to kind of, you know, keep on talking. I wanted to get away from him and, you know, talk to my co-defendant. After all, this is the guy, we lived together, slept together, worked together, and I wanted to get alone with him in a cell and kind of talk things over and try to get our case together, which was a pretty serious matter. But this guy Elliott kept tagging along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">As we went into the cell he came right up to the cell door, stuck his head in, which is generally something you don\u2019t do in a prison or a jail area. And when he stuck his head in the door he said, trying to continue the conversation that he had originally began, \u2018Well, look, if you do have these charges, you know, maybe if you talk to somebody from the Police Department, man, maybe you can make some arrangements, some kind of a deal.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">Of course, being young and naive, I didn\u2019t think the courts operated that way, so I said, \u2018No, no use talking about it.\u2019 And eventually he kind of backed off, backed away from me, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the cell door a little bit, and Brown and I did have a chance to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">But later on during the same day this fellow Elliott kept trying to get me in the conversations, kept asking me what am I in for, how much time do you think you will get, and why don\u2019t you try and contact somebody from the Police Department, maybe they can help you. Why don\u2019t you try pleading insanity? The whole thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">This in essence is what occurred while we were on the tier together. And later on when they moved all of us off the tier, they put myself, Brown and this officer in a secluded area just next to the Warden\u2019s office, and again this Officer Elliott continued the conversation, still under the impression that he is an inmate. And again he continued the conversation asking me questions, trying to kind of probe into the thing. This turned me off right away. Because people who are too nosey about other people\u2019s business, there has to be some ulterior motive. Now, I did not suspect him as a police officer, but I did suspect that he was just a bit too nosey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Elliott gave the court his version of what happened. \u201cI was taken to the Ferndale Police Station, processed, handcuffed, and then taken to Annapolis Jail along with four or five other prisoners.\u201d His orders were \u201cjust listen to anything I could hear in regards to an offense.\u201d He was given a description of the two men he was to listen to but not their names. Nor was he told anything about the offense in which his superiors were interested. He was nearby when Brown and Montgomery met in the jail. He had no conversation with them; he did not interrogate them; no other police officer at the time talked to them. When Montgomery and Brown talked, Elliott simply listened. He did talk to them later that evening, but this was several hours after the conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tion between Brown and Montgomery about which Elliott testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Turner testified he was in the Annapolis Jail in the guise of a prisoner on 27 May 1965. About 5:13 P.M. he went in a cell block where Montgomery was playing cards with other prisoners. A short time later Turner joined the game. \u201cWe were talking about what we were in for, and I told them I was in for breaking and entering.\u201d About an hour later the guards came and changed prisoners ar\u00f3und. Brown was brought into the cell block and Elliott was brought in at that time also. \u201cBrown and Montgomery immediately took up company in Montgomery\u2019s cell.\u201d Turner continued to play cards. To that point he had no direct conversation with Montgomery other than saying to him and to the other inmates that he was in for breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The lower court held that the conversation overheard by Elliott was admissible. We had considered the admissibility of the conversation in <em>Brown v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 462. We found, 469-474, that there was no compulsion involved so as to violate the fifth amendment clause against self-incrimination, that there was no unreasonable search and seizure in derogation of the fourth amendment guarantee, and that there was no invasion of the right of privacy so as to deny due process of law. But Montgomery urges that the principles of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 apply to bar the admission of the challenged evidence. In making its ruling the lower court found as a fact that Elliott and Turner did not question Montgomery prior to the time the conversation ensued between Montgomery and Brown. Montgomery recognizes that the credibility of the witnesses was for the trial court. Thus, as far as those two police officers were concerned, there was no custodial interrogation within the contemplation of <em>Miranda </em>and its exclusionary rules were not invoked to bar the challenged conversation. But, Montgomery argues, the inculpatory statements he and Brown made were \u201cstimulated\u201d by the line-up held some 21 hours before when Sergeant Cox simply pointed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Montgomery and Brown. The lower court found that this was not within the contemplation of <em>Miranda </em>and we agree. Even if the line-up tactic be deemed to have primed the pump it did not force the flow. The <em>Miranda </em>holding was that \u201cThe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d 384 U. S. at 444. The statements here challenged simply did not stem from a custodial interrogation of Montgomery. <em>Miranda </em>spelled out the meaning of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d : \u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Ibid. Of course, Montgomery was in custody within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>but he was not \u201cquestioned\u201d within its contemplation. As was said in Miranda: \u201cThe fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated.\u201d Id., at 478. And we observe it was made clear in <em>Miranda </em>that \u201cVolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\u201d Ibid. We do not believe that the line-up procedure of which Montgomery now complains was the type of \u201ccompelling influence\u201d <em>Miranda </em>intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We conclude that in the circumstances the challenged evidence could properly be used by the prosecution without demonstrating the use of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>procedural safeguards. We hold that the lower court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\">. The history of the case began when the 17 year old Greene, who was employed at a gas station, was found by the manager of the station on the afternoon of 4 May 1965 on the floor of the station\u2019s office. There was a bullet hole in the back of Greene\u2019s head and he was dead. About $37 had been stolen from the safe. The Medical Examiner classified the death as homicide; the manner of death was a gunshot wound in the head. Montgomery and David Phillip Brown were indicted for the murder on 18 April 1966 by the grand jury for Baltimore County. The indictment survived two motions to dismiss it on the ground that a speedy trial had been denied, the first by both of the accused, see <em>Brown and Montgomery v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 141, decided 26 April 1968, cert. den. as to Montgomery, 251 Md. 751, and the second by Brown alone, see <em>Brown v. State, </em>No. 412, September Term, 1968 filed 12 June 1969, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Brown was granted a severance and on 11 September 1969, upon trial before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, was found guilty of murder in the first degree and on 19 March 1970 was sentenced to life imprisonment. The judgment was affirmed by this Court on 1 December 1970. <em>Brown v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 462, cert. den., 1 March 1971, 261 Md. 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">On 3 March 1970, upon suggestion, Montgomery\u2019s trial was ordered removed to the Circuit Court for Talbot County. He came to trial before a jury in that court on 18 May 1970 and on 21 May was found guilty of murder in the first degree. On 11 August 1970 upon a hearing on a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, the court granted the motion. The docket entries under that date read: \u201cJury called to box to sit as they sat during the trial, all answered present. Jury sworn en banc as witnesses. Lois Johnson, Grace McQuay and Dora Pahlman to remain as witnesses \u2014 Other members of panel excused. Motion for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>is granted.\u201d On 24 September 1970 the Circuit Court for Talbot County ordered the case removed to the Circuit Court for Cecil County for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">On 18 January 1971 the trial of Montgomery began before a jury in the Circuit Court for Cecil County. On the third day of the trial the court declared a mistrial. The docket entries under date of 21 January 1971 read: \u201cJury retires: 2:17 P. M. Jury returns: 3:43 A. M. Jury could not agree. Court declared a mis-trial.\u201d The retrial resulting in the judgment before us now commenced on 20 April 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"pAtK\">. Cf.
