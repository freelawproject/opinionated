The sole question he presents on appeal concerns the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On 10 June 1971 Boyd was incarcerated in the Maryland House of Correction serving an 18 month sentence for non-support to which had been added a 9 month sentence for escape. He was working in the laundry in the industrial compound, which is inside the fence but outside the main building, and it was prison routine to search under a spot check procedure the inmates working in the laundry upon their return to the main building. Lt. Thad Oppert, the assistant commander of the industrial compound testified: \u201c[W]e give them a body search, check their laundry bags and any other articles they may have on them.\u201d He explained that the inmate would have a bag containing his laundry \u201cplus [at times] his customer\u2019s [bag] he\u2019s doing laundry for.\u201d On the day in question Boyd was searched and two plastic tubes containing \u201ctwo 26 gauge % inch hypodermic needles\u201d were found in a laundry bag Boyd was carrying. They were in the bottom of the bag under Boyd\u2019s laundered clothing. Boyd \u201cstated it was his clothes and his bag.\u201d Oppert said it was against the Institution\u2019s rules to have hypodermic needles in possession. He also asserted that hypodermic needles were used \u201cfor injections, of fluids, drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Trooper First Class William F. George, a member of the Maryland State Police for eight years, testified by reason of experience gained in investigating controlled dangerous substance violations he was familiar with such substances and the means by which they were injected. He said that the needles found on Boyd were of the type used for \u201cinjecting of a drug into the body, usually a heroin derivative.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Through his some fifty investigations of violations of the controlled dangerous substances laws at the House of Correction he had found that heroin and other narcotic controlled dangerous substances \u201cexisted illegally\u201d in that Institution. Boyd offered no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>We have no difficulty in determining that the direct evidence before the court was sufficient in law to establish that hypodermic needles were in the possession of Boyd, and that they were adapted for the administration of controlled dangerous substances by hypodermic injections. We further find, interpreting and construing the provisions of \u00a7 287 (d) (i) so as to effectuate their expressed general purpose in accordance with the Legislative dictate, it was a rational inference providing evidence sufficient in law under the circumstances to indicate reasonably that Boyd possessed the needles with an intention to use them for purposes of illegally administering a controlled dangerous substance, particularly in the light of his failure to meet the statutory burden imposed on him to show that he possessed them lawfully. Thus the judgment of the lower court on the evidence was not clearly erroneous and we may not set it aside. Maryland Rule 1086. <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. For designation of other \u201ccontrolled paraphernalia\u201d see \u00a7 (d) (ii) and (iii). Subsection (iii) was added by ch. 493, Acts 1971, effective 1 July 1971. For definition of \u201ccontrolled dangerous substance\u201d see \u00a7 277 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The former law, Art. 27, \u00a7 297, proscribed the possession of paraphernalia in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">\u201cNo person except a manufacturer or a wholesaler or a retail dealer in surgical instruments, pharmacist, physician,. dentist, veterinarian, nurse or interne, shall at any time have or possess a hypodermic syringe or needle or any instrument or implement adapted for the use of habit-forming drugs by hypodermic injections and which is possessed for the purpose of administering habit-forming drugs, * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Both the former law and the present law prescribe that the paraphernalia be \u201cadapted\u201d for the use of prohibited substances \u201cby hypodermic injections.\u201d But while the old law required proof that such paraphernalia \u201cis possessed for the purpose of administering\u201d the substances, the new law imposes the lesser burden on the State of showing possession of the paraphernalia \u201cunder circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention\u201d to so use it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">.
