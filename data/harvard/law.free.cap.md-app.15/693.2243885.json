The appellant was sentenced to a term of five years for distributing hashish and a five year sentence for possession of methadone, both sentences to be served concurrently. Sentence as to the other counts was generally suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The appellant attacks the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on the grounds that:</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">1. His motion to quash the search and seizure warrant, and to suppress the evidence obtained thereunder, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">2. The evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a finding of guilty under the addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Trooper J. T. Kelly, of the Maryland State Police, testified that at approximately 1:30 a.m. on April 6, 1971, he was on a parking lot adjacent to a night club on Harford Road in company with one James Donaldson. At that time a late model Volkswagen came onto the lot. Donaldson excused himself and went over and talked with the driver of the Volkswagen. A short time later, Donaldson returned to where he had left the trooper, and after a brief conversation the two of them, Donaldson and the trooper, went to the appellant\u2019s home at 1706 Glen Keith Boulevard, in Baltimore County, Maryland. Soon after their arrival, the appellant obtained a pipe and a quantity of suspected hashish from a bedroom in the apartment in which he resided. The pipe was lit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>passed among the three persons, that is, the trooper, Donaldson and the appellant. The appellant also obtained from a closet in the bedroom a quantity of hashish which he placed in an empty Kool cigarette package. The appellant placed the Kool cigarette package close to Trooper Kelly\u2019s feet and Trooper Kelly handed appellant $25.00. On April 8, 1971, the suspected hashish was delivered to the United States Customs laboratory for chemical analysis and later identified to be hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Trooper Kelly further testified that as a result of what had occurred on April 6, 1971, he applied for a search warrant to Judge Kenneth C. Proctor, of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The warrant was executed on May 17, 1971, at which time Trooper Kelly and other State police officers seized from appellant\u2019s apartment a set of weighing scales, a gray metal box containing pipes and seeds, one large water pipe, incense and an incense burner, a small box containing suspected marijuana, one bent-handled spoon, a set of Maryland temporary auto license plates, a telephone bill, and 2 bottles containing suspected methadone. As a result of the seizure of the marijuana and methadone, appellant was charged with the possession of both substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On cross-examination, Trooper Kelly testified that he applied for the search warrant on the 7th day of May, 1971 \u2014 31 days after the purchase of hashish from the appellant. The trooper explained that the reason he did not arrest Mr. Campofreda in April, 1971 was because he was working as an undercover officer and his investigation had not been completed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">We quote from pertinent parts of the testimony concerning the warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">\u201cQ When did you apply for the warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">A I applied for the warrant on the 7th of May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">Q How many days after you had been\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">A Ten days \u2014 oh, after the execution of the warrant or prior to the execution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">Q No. How many days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>A From April 6th to May 7th, approximately thirty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">Q And when did you execute the warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">A On May 17th.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Earlier, the trooper had testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cAs a result of the undercover investigation on April 6th a search and seizure warrant was signed by Judge Proctor for the residence 1706 Glen Keith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">According to the trooper, a list of the inventory seized pursuant to the warrant was returned to Judge Proctor for filing on May 22, 1971. The trooper stated that he left a copy of the list \u201cwith Mr. Campofreda or his mother, I can\u2019t remember which; I think Sergeant Mazzone filled it out, or left it there * * On cross-examination the trooper was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">\u201cQ You wouldn\u2019t happen to have a copy of that warrant, would you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">A In my case folder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">MR. DeWATERS (Assistant State\u2019s Attorney) I\u2019ve got a copy here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">Q MR. KAPLAN Who made application for the warrant, you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">A I did, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">Q And everything in the application is based upon the alleged sale back on April 6th, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-15\">MR. DeWATERS Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdU\">THE COURT: The warrant speaks for itself, doesn\u2019t it, counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\">MR. KAPLAN: Yes, your Honor. Would your Honor care to see a copy of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjYx\">THE COURT: I will look at anything that comes into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>MR. KAPLAN: Sir, could we have a copy of the original warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">MR. DeWATERS: It\u2019s all right to use this if you want to, I have no objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">THE COURT: Well, he has identified it as being a copy of the search warrant issued by Judge Proctor. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">THE COURT: And the application for the warrant ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">WITNESS: That\u2019s the application and affidavit here. I think the warrant \u2014 the return is not attached to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">MR. KAPLAN: No, it\u2019s just the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ano\">WITNESS: This is the application and the warrant, yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">Counsel then moved to quash the warrant and all evidence obtained thereunder. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-18\">Art. 27, \u00a7 551 of the Maryland Code provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-19\">\u201cWhenever it be made to appear to any judge of the * * * circuit courts in the counties of this State, or to any justice of the peace in this State, by <em>a written application signed and sworn to by the applicant, accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits </em>containing facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant or affiants, that there is probable cause, the basis of which shall be set forth in said affidavit or affidavits * * *, then such judge or justice of the peace may forthwith issue a search warrant directed to any duly constituted policeman, constable or police officer authorizing him to search * * (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>One of the paper writings received into evidence was an \u201cAPPLICATION &amp; AFFIDAVIT FOR SEARCH &amp; SEIZURE WARRANT\u201d addressed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">\u201cThe Honorable .........................., ......................, ......................, Baltimore County, State of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The body of the \u201cApplication and Affidavit\u201d followed thereafter. At the conclusion of the paper writing appears the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">\u201cSUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO, this....... day of ...................., in the year of Our Lord, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">Before me, a ........................ of the State of Maryland, in and for .................... County, this ........ day of ........................, 1971, personally appeared ................................, personally known to me or properly identified, and he made oath that the contents of the aforegoing document are true and correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">It is patent that the affidavit was not subscribed, or notarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-16\">The \u201cSEARCH &amp; SEIZURE WARRANT\u201d which was offered into evidence simultaneously with the \u201cApplication &amp; Affidavit\u201d was addressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-17\">\u201cSTATE OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE COUNTY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-18\">TO: ................................ Maryland State Police, or any other police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-20\">GREETINGS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-21\">WHEREAS, it appears to me, the subscriber,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-22\">The \u201cwarrant\u201d authorizes the Maryland State Police or any other police officer to search the premises known as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>1706 Glen Keith Boulevard, Baltimore County, Maryland, and to seize any and all \u201cevidence, paraphernalia and money used in or incidental to the conduct or operation of controlled dangerous substance and narcotic violations, found in or upon said premises, persons.\u201d This \u201cwarrant\u201d then concluded: \u201cGIVEN under my hand this day of ... , in the year of Our Lord, 1971\u201d and was <em>unsigned.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We fail to perceive how the trial judge could pass upon the validity of the search when neither the warrant nor a completed copy was offered into evidence. The \u201ccopy\u201d which the court read appears to us to be no more than a blank copy which may have been completed by Judge Proctor. It may be that Judge Proctor made deletions, alterations, modifications or interlineations on the original warrant, which deletions, alterations, modifications or interlineations could have materially affected the resultant warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It also is possible, as counsel for the appellant suggests, that the date of the warrant was different than that stated by the trooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In <em>Giles v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 593, 271 A. 2d 766 (1970), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cA valid search warrant properly executed, may produce evidence sufficient to convict a person accused of crime. A defective and invalid search warrant produces confusion, waste and injustice, to an accused or to society, or to both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Here, the paper writing offered as the \u201cwarrant\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>defective and as a result has produced confusion, waste and injustice. There is nothing in the record before us, other than the trooper\u2019s testimony, that the warrant was actually issued, and the trooper\u2019s testimony is not sufficient to elevate an unsworn, unsigned copy to the status of an original warrant. It is also within the realm of possibility, as proposed by counsel for the appellant, that the warrant was not executed within the time prescribed by Art. 27, \u00a7 551, of the Maryland Code, and, is thus, null and void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, we cannot say that such is the case. The record is simply devoid of sufficient information upon which to draw such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In <em>Duggins v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 486, 256 A. 2d 354 (1969), this Court was confronted with a situation wherein the State, after proper demand, declined to produce an arrest warrant on the ground that the testimony of Federal agents that they had a valid warrant in their possession when they made the arrest was sufficient to demonstrate the validity of the arrest. The trial court agreed with the State\u2019s position. We reversed and remanded the matter on the ground that the best evidence rule was applicable in criminal cases, and as such the original warrant, itself, was the best evidence of the true contents of the warrant. In the instant case, we are not presented directly with the question of the best evidence rule since it was appellant who offered the \u201ccopy\u201d of the warrant and no objection was made to its introduction. We observed in <em>Duggins </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s attack on the legality of the federal warrant was not limited to an assertion that its recitals failed to show the existence of probable cause. Rather, his challenge was more broadly based and encompassed, <em>albeit </em>in general terms, an assertion that if the warrant ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>isted at all, it quite possibly was not properly completed and was therefore legally defective. Under these circumstances, we think it evident that the State cannot overcome the challenge by producing only the testimony of those who procured the warrant to the effect that it did exist and that it was a lawful warrant. Of course, whether the warrant was lawful or not is a matter of law for the determination of the trial judge, a function which he manifestly cannot perform unless he reviews the warrant in light of the objections made to it or, if the warrant is shown to be unavailable for proper reasons, by considering secondary evidence of its existence and contents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">See also <em>Brooks, Keaton &amp; Patterson v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 151, 282 A. 2d 516 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">It was impossible for the trial judge to have determined as a matter of law that the search warrant involved in the instant case was legally proper when he did not see the warrant. It is true that the trial judge had the opportunity to review what was purported to be a \u201ccopy\u201d of the original, and perhaps under proper circumstances that \u201ccopy\u201d could, by sufficient other secondary evidence, be held to be a proper substitute for the original. <em>Duggins v. State, supra; Anderson v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 532, 267 A. 2d 296 (1970). In the posture in which this record reaches us, however, it is apparent that the appellant\u2019s rights have been violated by the failure of the State to produce the original warrant for the trial court\u2019s review, and the violation has been compounded by the trial judge\u2019s error in accepting the \u201ccopy\u201d in lieu of the original, absent sufficient explanation that the original was lost or destroyed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Anderson v. State, supra; </em>2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence, </em>\u00a7 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>It may well be that on a retrial of this case the State will produce the original warrant, or the \u201ccopy\u201d made sufficient by other secondary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In view of our holding, it is unnecessary for us to discuss the finding of guilty of the multiple offender charge stated in the addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the County Council of Baltimore County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-10\">. In Cornelius, <em>The Law of Search and Seizure, </em>\u00a7 185, \u201cDuty of prosecution to introduce search warrant in evidence,\u201d (1926), it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-11\">\u201cA conviction cannot be sustained where a search warrant, under which the evidence has been obtained, is not introduced^ in evidence, where it appears from the evidence that the discovery and seizure * * * was attempted to be justified by the officer\u2019s possession of a search warrant the validity of which, though objected to and attacked, was not established by the introduction of the warrant itself, or by proof of its contents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">See also <em>Cline v.
