State, </em>224 Md. 186 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at 192 that although it is said that there was no common law crime of disorderly conduct, nevertheless it was a crime at common law to do many of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>things that constitute disorderly conduct under present day statutes. There are three statutes in this State making various acts of a disorderly nature a criminal offense \u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 121, 122 and 123 of Art. 27 of the Code. We look at such of the provisions of them as may be relevant to the matter at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Section 121 makes it a crime for any person \u201cwilfully [to] disturb any neighborhood\u201d in any city, town or county of this State \u201cby loud and unseemly noises, or profanely [to] curse or swear * * * upon or near to any [public street or highway in any such city, town or county] within the hearing of persons passing by or along such highway * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Section 122 makes it a crime for any person to act \u201cin a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace,\u201d or \u201cwilfully [to] act in a disorderly manner by making loud and unseemly noises or by profanely cursing, swearing or using' obscene language * * * on or about any public place * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Section 123 (c) makes it a crime for any person to \u201cact in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace, upon any street, highway, alley, park or parking lot, or in any vehicle that is in or upon any street, highway, alley, park or parking lot, in any city, town, or county in this State * * *.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The terms employed by the statutes are not defined therein, so. we consider them in their common meaning. \u201cLoud\u201d is \u201ccharacterized by high volume and intensity of sound * * * clamorous and insistent.\u201d \u201cUnseemly\u201d and its synonyms such as \u201cimproper\u201d, \u201cindecorous\u201d, \u201cindelicate\u201d mean \u201cin violation of accepted standards of what is right or proper.\u201d Within the contemplation of the statutes, \u201ccurse\u201d and \u201cswear\u201d are synonymous \u2014 \u201cto use profane oaths\u201d, \u201cabuse profanely\u201d, \u201cto invoke evil, calam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ity, or injury upon\u201d, \u201cto damn.\u201d Although a synonym for \u201cprofane\u201d is \u201cblasphemous\u201d, it is better here considered in its secular sense of being \u201cabusive, vulgar, or irreverent language.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>State v. West, </em>9 Md. App. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Interpreting the statutes, by the express provisions of \u00a7 121, other persons must be within hearing of the disturbing noises. So a person standing on a county highway making loud and unseemly noises and profanely cursing and swearing would not be committing the crime proscribed by \u00a7 121 unless within the hearing of others passing by or along the highway. We do not believe it necessary that the State prove such other persons in fact heard the noises; it would be sufficient if they were passing by or along the highway so that reasonably they may have heard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We next look at \u00a7 123 because we think the judicial construction given subsection (c) thereof with which we are here concerned,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is germane to an interpretation of \u00a7 122. Section 123 prohibits acting \u201cin a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace\u201d in certain public places.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Drews v. State, supra </em>at 192 discussed the nature of disorderly conduct under \u00a7 123 (see note 3 supra). It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cThe gist of the crime of disorderly conduct under Sec. 123 of Art. 27, as it was in the cases of common law predecessor crimes, is the doing or saying, or both, of that which offends, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>turbs, incites, or tends to incite, a number of people gathered in the same area. 3 Underhill, <em>Criminal Evidence, </em>Sec. 850 (5th Ed.), adopts as one definition of the crime the statement that it is conduct \u2018of such a nature as to affect the peace and quiet of persons who may witness the same and who may be disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">It pointed out that it was a crime at common law to make loud noises so as to disturb the peace of the neighborhood, to collect a crowd in a public place by means of loud or unseemly noises or language, or to disturb a meeting assembled for religious worship or any other lawful purpose. And it noted that it has been held that failure to obey a policeman\u2019s command to move on when not to do so may endanger the public peace is within the contemplation of disorderly conduct. We think it patent that disorderly conduct within the contemplation of <em>Drews </em>requires the actual presence of other persons who \u201cmay witness\u201d the conduct or hear the language and who \u201cmay be disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby.\u201d The <em>Underhill </em>quotation was simply authority for the statement as to the gist of the offense set out immediately before \u2014 that the conduct or language offends, disturbs, incites or tends to incite \u201ca number of people gathered in the same area.\u201d Such construction is consistent with our opinions in <em>Luthardt v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 251 and <em>Streeter v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 435. In <em>Heinze v. Murphy, </em>180 Md. 423, the Court held that an arrest and charge of disorderly conduct were not justified by evidence that the arrestee used profane language on the lawn of his home and refused to give an officer information regarding an automobile accident where there was no evidence that the language was heard by any person other than the officer or beyond the premises. At 428-429. Cf. <em>Sharpe v. State, </em>231 Md. 401, in which Mar-bury, J. filed a dissenting opinion concurred in by Bru\u00f1e, C. J. and Hammond, J., and Hammond J. filed a concurring dissent in which Bru\u00f1e, C. J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Section 122 proscribes two general courses of conduct on or about any public place. The first, \u201cacting in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace\u201d may be committed silently as by one indecently exposing his person, explicitly prohibited, or by failing to obey a lawful order of the police, such as a command to move on, when not to do so may endanger the public peace, implicitly prohibited by judicial construction of comparable provisions in <em>Drews, supra. </em>The second, as does \u00a7 121 explicitly and \u00a7 123 implicitly, contemplates noises made, either loud and unseemly, or by profanely cursing, swearing or using obscene language. Prior to the enactment of ch. 520, Acts 1967, the two courses of conduct applied to persons \u201con or about any steamboat wharf, dock or public waiting room, or in or about the station grounds of any railroad in the State, or in or about any steamboat, streetcar, electric car, railroad car, passenger train or other public conveyance.\u201d The 1967 amendment made the section applicable to public places generally by inserting the phrase \u201cany public place\u201d immediately preceding the other places designated. So we have no difficulty whatsoever in finding that the legislative intent was directed toward conduct which tended to disturb the public peace. Section 122 appears under the subtitle \u201cDisturbance of the Public Peace\u201d; its first proscription is disorderly conduct \u201cto the disturbance of the public peace\u201d; its other proscriptions designate places where the public is entitled to be and normally would be, and patently are intended to run to the benefit of the public. We feel that the section contemplates the actual presence of other persons who may be affected by the conduct or language proscribed, and that the construction given \u00a7 123 (c) is apposite to \u00a7 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Although the constitutionality of the statutes is not here challenged, the application of certain facets of them have constitutional connotations. The statutes punish spoken words, but they cannot apply to speech, although vulgar or offensive, that is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Terminiello v. Chicago, </em>337 U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>S. 1, 4-5. The Court said in <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U. S. 518, 10 Cr. L. 3137 at 3138:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cThe constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech forbid the States from punishing the use of words or language not within \u2018narrowly limited classes of speech.\u2019 <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U. S. 568, 571 (1942). Even as to such a class, however, because \u2018the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated, suppressed, or punished is finely drawn,\u2019 <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U. S. 513, 525 (1958), \u2018[i]n every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom,\u2019 <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U. S. 296, 304 (1940).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The State has the power to punish obscene expression, but to be obscene such expression must be, in some significant way, erotic, so as to conjure up such psychic stimulation in anyone likely to be confronted with it. <em>Cohen v. California, </em>91 S. Ct. 1780, 1785. And the State is free to ban the simple use, \u201cwithout a demonstration of additional justifying circumstances, of so-called \u2018fighting words,\u2019 those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction.\u201d Ibid, quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U. S. 568. So a statute must be carefully drawn or be authoritatively construed to punish only unprotected speech and not be susceptible of application to protected expression. Only the courts of a State can supply the requisite construction of its State\u2019s statutes; the Supreme Court lacks \u201cjurisdiction authoritatively to construe state legislation.\u201d <em>United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs, </em>402 U. S. 363, 369. We deem the language prohibitions of the statutes here considered, as construed by <em>Drews, </em>to embrace only unprotected speech and not to apply to protected expression. The short of it is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the \u201cobscene language\u201d prohibited by the statute means obscene in the constitutional sense. The \u201cprofanely cursing [or] swearing\u201d prohibited by the statutes and the \u201csaying\u201d aspect of the gist of the crime of disorderly conduct as set out in <em>Drews, </em>mean \u201cfighting\u201d words. <em>Gooding </em>gives us guidance with respect to \u201cfighting\u201d words by quoting with approval the discussion of them by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in the <em>Chaplinsky </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">\u201c* * * [\u2018fighting\u2019 words] have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed * * * The test is what men of common intelligence would understand would be words likely to cause an average addressee to fight * * * Derisive and annoying words can be taken as coming within the purview of the statute [proscribing offensive, derisive and annoying words] * * * only when they have the characteristic of plainly tending to excite the addressee to a breach of the peace * * * The statute, as construed, does no more than prohibit the face-to-face words plainly likely to cause a breach of the peace by the addressee * * 91 N. H. 310, 313, 320-321, 18 A. 2d 754, 758 762 (1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">We note that whether the \u201cloud and unseemly noises\u201d prohibitions of the statutes are within the ambit of protected expression depends on the nature and content of them, a question to be determined on the facts of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The petition filed against Nawrocki, born 25 January 1955, alleged that he was delinquent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">\u201cFor the reason that on July 4th, 1971, 0355 hrs in the City aforesaid Jerry Walter Nawrocki charged with Disorderly Conduct by using pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>fane language and threatening a prisoner and failing to obey a lawful order. This offense occurred 2327 Essex Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzX\">Jerry Walter Nawrocki unlawfully did Resist the arrest of one Officer Raymond Smith by jumping out of the cruiser and running. He was caught by Officer Allen Brenton. This offense occurred in the 2400 block Fait Avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The evidence before the juvenile court at the time the court made its decision on the merits was scant. Officer Raymond Smith of the Baltimore City Police Department testified that on 4 July 1971 about 3:40 a.m. he was in front of 2327 Essex Street \u201creturning a juvenile home for his parents to sign a custody release report.\u201d The juvenile prisoner was still in the police cruiser when Nawrocki, known to the officer only as \u201cDog\u201d, \u201ccame over * * * and started an argument with the suspect I had in my car, began using profane language and threatened the suspect I had in my custody. * * * He was going to work him over and do him in and everything right down the line * * * was going to get even with him.\u201d Smith testified: \u201cI got out of the car to place him under arrest for being disorderly. He took off running.\u201d On cross-examination Smith made clear that \u201cWhen I got to the point where I heard [Nawrocki] threaten my prisoner and using profane language * * * I was going to place him under arrest.\u201d It was as the Officer was getting out of the cruiser to do so that Nawrocki fled. \u201cI was going to get out of the car to place him under arrest for disorderly conduct.\u201d This was the extent of the evidence adduced pertinent to the offense of disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Smith further testified that after Nawrocki fled he released his juvenile prisoner (\u201cthe people had him sign off\u201d) and cruised in the immediate area. He received certain information and returned to 2327 Essex Street. He saw Nawrocki standing in front of the premises, \u201chis right hand shoved down inside his pants waistband as if holding something. * * * I pulled up to the curb and ordered him to stop, and he took off running. He ran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>east in the 2300 block of Essex Street, north on Montford Avenue, and east again in the 2400 block of Foster Avenue where he was stopped. He was placed under arrest and put in the cruiser.\u201d A back-up cruiser responded to the scene (\u201ca man alleged to be armed\u201d call had been put over the police radio) and as it pulled up Nawrocki jumped out of Smith\u2019s cruiser and attempted to flee. The officer in the back-up cruiser stopped him and he was taken to the Southeast Police Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The allegation of resisting arrest in the petition could have no direct bearing on the question of Nawrocki\u2019s delinquency. If the evidence was sufficient to show that Nawrocki was guilty of the crime of disorderly conduct, this alone would support the finding of delinquency whether or not he resisted the arrest. But if the evidence was not sufficient to establish that Nawrocki was guilty of the crime of disorderly conduct, then he would not be guilty of the offense of resisting arrest because his arrest would be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>refusal to submit to lawful arrest and resistance to an officer of the law in the performance of his duties constitutes an offense at common law * * and is an offense in this State.\u201d <em>Preston v. Warden, </em>225 Md. 628. See <em>Lyles v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 265, 268; <em>McGee v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 239, 241; Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed., 1969) 494-496; 4 Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Procedure </em>(Anderson) \u00a7 1617. In the 1957 edition of Perkins <em>Criminal Law </em>it is stated at 424:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201cOne is privileged to use reasonable force to prevent the unlawful deprivation of his liberty. * * * Since he is in no way interfering with any <em>lawful </em>activity of the officer he is not guilty of obstructing justice even if he so far exceeds his privilege as to be guilty of some other offense. In other words resisting an unlawful arrest is not in itself a crime, whether it is by the intended arrestee or by others who come to his aid.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>This State follows the view that if an arrest is illegal, the arrestee is justified in using any reasonable means, even force, to effect his escape. <em>Williams v. State, </em>204 Md. 55, 64; <em>Sugarman v. State, </em>173 Md. 52, 57.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We do not find the evidence sufficient in law to show that Nawrocki was making loud and unseemly noises; there is nothing to indicate that he was talking other than quietly or in a normal tone of voice. Nor do we find it legally sufficient to prove that he was profanely cursing, swearing or using' obscene language. The officer\u2019s statement that Nawrocki was \u201cusing profane language\u201d was a conclusion and in the absence of evidence setting out the language the officer concluded was profane there was not enough for the trier of fact to determine that the language was \u201cprofane\u201d within the ambit of the statute. What the officer felt was \u201cprofane\u201d may not have been profane within the contemplation of the statute. It was for the trier of fact, not the officer, to ascertain whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the language was profane <em>vel non. </em>A bald statement by the officer characterizing the language as profane is simply not sufficient in law. \u201cIt is * * * often true that one man\u2019s vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric.\u201d <em>Cohen v. California, supra, </em>at 1788. In any event, profanity <em>per se </em>would not amount to disorderly conduct. The words used by Nawrocki would have to be \u201cfighting\u201d words to be punishable. If they were, then he acted in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace upon a public street in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It is clear that Nawrocki directed threats to the person the officer had in custody and that those threats were that he was going \u201cto work [the prisoner] over, and do him in and everything right down the line * * * was going to get even with him.\u201d We feel the lower court could have decided on the evidence, spare as it was, that Nawrocki\u2019s words had a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the prisoner, that is that they had the characteristic of plainly tending to excite the prisoner, inciting him to a breach of the peace. And because the prisoner was in the legal custody of the officer, charged with the duty of his safekeeping, the directing of the words to the prisoner was in effect the directing of them to the officer who also may have been disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby, culminating in violence. Thus, the lower court properly could have found that the words used by Nawrocki were \u201cfighting\u201d words and concluded that he was guilty of disorderly conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Although the proceedings of a juvenile court are not criminal in nature and its dispositions are not punishment for crime, see <em>In re Hamill, </em>10 Md. App. 586, 591, the rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>delinquency hearings, Maryland Rule 912 c, and a determination that a child is delinquent must be based upon allegations proved beyond a reasonable doubt, Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-18 (a). Therefore the sufficiency of the evidence is to be tested as in criminal causes tried without a jury.* 2345678*<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See Rule 1086; <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450. We cannot say that the lower court was clearly erroneous in its judgment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Our determination that the evidence was sufficient in law to establish that Nawrocki was a delinquent child disposes of the first eight questions presented on this appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The ninth question is \u201cThe trial judge in hearing testimony from the two witnesses as to the facts of this case, after a finding of delinquency was made, violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>appellant\u2019s right to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\u201d This question is prompted by a general confusion shared at various times below by the defense, the prosecution and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">When the Legislature revised the general law governing juvenile causes by ch. 432, \u00a7 2, Acts 1969, the Act, as implemented and supplemented by ch. 900 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, effective 1 July 1969, clearly spelled out the principles to be observed and the procedures to be followed by the juvenile courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction. See <em>In re Hamill, supra. </em>When a petition under Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 is filed alleging delinquency, see \u00a7 70-6, \u00a7 70-7, Rule 902 and Rule 903, the court shall hold an adjudicatory hearing, after which, if the allegations are sustained, it shall hold a disposition hearing. Art. 26, \u00a7 70-17; Rules 908, 912, 913. However, before the adjudicatory hearing the court may hold a waiver hearing after proper notice, and waive its exclusive jurisdiction. Art. 26, \u00a7 70-16; Rule 911. See <em>Matter of Brown, </em>13 Md. App. 625. In a delinquency case the State\u2019s Attorney ordinarily prepares and presents the testimony in behalf of a petitioner, Rule 912 b, and a party is entitled to representation by legal counsel at all stages of any juvenile proceeding, Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-18 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In the instant case petition 149893, made by Officer Smith, authorized by in-take consultant T. Wise, was filed in the juvenile court on 6 July 1971. The petitioner prayed that the court make a finding and pass an order or decree as the law provides. Hearing set for 21 July was postponed so an attorney could be appointed for Nawrocki. An attorney was appointed for him the next day and the petition came on for a hearing on 28 July on a plea of \u201cnot delinquent.\u201d Rule 904. After the close of the testimony offered by the State through its one witness, the petitioner Officer Smith, the State rested and Nawrocki offered no evidence. He made a motion for judgment of acquittal and it was denied. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cWalter, I am going to find you delinquent for the reasons stated in this petition which means in effect that I am finding you guilty of the charges against you. You just have a seat a moment, please. I will try to find out some other information before I make a disposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">There is no doubt that at this point there had been an adjudicatory hearing and a determination of delinquency by the court. The court made this clear during a further inquiry it then made of Smith and its questioning of two witnesses summoned by the State but not called to testify on the merits. During inquiry of them by the court, defense counsel said: \u201cWith all due respect I would like to offer an objection to the court. This amounts to testimony again in this case.\u201d The court replied: \u201cIt is all in disposition. I have made my finding. I am trying to learn as much as I can about the background of this boy.\u201d The inquiry of the two witnesses continued. It appears from the record that neither was sworn. The court read into the record Nawrocki\u2019s past juvenile record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Requesting Nawrocki to stand, the judge said the two incidents alleged in the petition, although \u201cserious in themselves\u201d, did not concern him \u201cas much as the total circumstances which surround you.\u201d He then referred to those circumstances, noting that he had read \u201cthe very extensive folder that we have in your case and there are some serious matters to be concerned with. You are a very heavy user of drugs. * * * You have been literally the terror of Southeast Baltimore * * *.\u201d The judge felt that \u201cthe problems here run very deep\u201d with no simple answer. He explained that he had a two-fold purpose: \u201cone, to try to take those steps, those measures which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>might be of value to you which try to touch upon the roots which have caused these difficulties really for a period of years \u2014 years, not months. * * * And the second purpose of mine is to protect the security of the community because the community certainly has a right to expect that protection and must have it.\u201d He desired Nawrocki to be examined and evaluated by the court psychiatrist and psychologist so he could have the benefit of their judgment. \u201cI am going to order you to be detained at the Maryland Training School pending these examinations and evaluations. When these are completed you will then be brought back into court and I will make a final disposition at that time.\u201d The docket entries with respect to the hearing of 28 July read: \u201cHearing before Judge Hammerman. Plea: General Denial. Finding: Delinquent.\u201d And on 28 July the court issued an order to the Superintendent of the Maryland Training School for Boys empowering him to keep Nawrocki under his care and custody. The order recited that Nawrocki had been \u201cduly adjudged after hearing before Robert I. H. Ham-merman\u201d to be \u201ca delinquent child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Nawrocki was brought back before the court on 1 September 1971. The court clerk correctly thought that Nawrocki was there for disposition: \u201cWe have before the Court this morning Petition Number 149893, Jerry Nawrocki, reset for disposition.\u201d The court observed that it had \u201cread the various reports that have been submitted to me prior to today on Walter as well as the fact that I have read previous reports that have been made in past years about the boy.\u201d Defense counsel, however, told the court that at the conclusion of the hearing of 28 July \u201cYour Honor held the matter sub curia insofar as the delinquency or non-delinquency of Mr. Nawrocki went and requested a medical report in the case.\u201d The court did not dispute this statement but entertained two arguments by counsel in support of a motion for judgment of acquittal, advanced as in addition to those presented at the prior hearing. The court denied the motion without comment. Counsel then told the court that while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Nawrocki had been in the Maryland Training School awaiting the instant hearing there had been a riot. Nawrocki and several others not involved in the fight were told by \u201cthe people at the school * * * to get out of the area and just to get away for their own safety.\u201d So Nawrocki left. He called counsel several days later, stating he was in fear of his life at the school and that he had been beaten up on several occasions. He was reluctant to go back \u201cbecause he feared for his own health and safety.\u201d He did not go back to the school but promised to appear in court and did so. The court in an extended discourse said it was disturbed by the fact Nawrocki had left the training school, although \u201cit could very well have happened exactly as you say * * The court expressed the thought that \u201ca training school setting would not be particularly good for you over a long term if you are having these serious difficulties and where you have had difficulties before in adjustment there.\u201d But it was \u201cfar from convinced that probation is the best thing for you either.\u201d The court continued: \u201c[Q]uite frankly I am giving serious thought at this particular moment to whether or not jurisdiction should be waived in your case to the adult criminal court in view of all the materials that I have read and what I am going to do right now is I am going to order you detained at the Maryland Children\u2019s Center for a period of thirty days for purposes of evaluation there * * * and at the next hearing it will be for the purpose of and it should be set in for purposes of determining waiving jurisdiction in'this matter.\u201d An order detaining Nawrocki at the Maryland Children\u2019s Center pending hearing on 1 October was issued the same day. Before the hearing of 1 September concluded, however, defense counsel told the court that one of the boys who had given the court' information not under oath at the hearing of 28 July had voluntarily come to court and wished to make a statement. Steve Dowling thereupon told the court he had lied at his previous appearance before the court. \u201cI made it a big thing which it wasn\u2019t.\u201d He then recounted what he alleged were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>true circumstances of the incident relating to the petition alleging Nawrocki\u2019s delinquency. The judge felt that if Dowling\u2019s new version was correct, Nawrocki \u201cwould still be guilty of the charges against him.\u201d He said: \u201cI am asking the State\u2019s Attorney to see to it that you are prosecuted for perjury.\u201d Defense counsel pointed out that Dowling was not under oath and Dowling observed that he had not been under oath when he was interrogated by the court on his previous appearance either. The court stated it would still like the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office to look into prosecuting Dowling on possible charges. It asked Dowling if he was willing to take a lie detector test and Dowling said he was willing. The court said: \u201cAll this will go on the lie detector test. Then we will find out. * * * We will find out and we will get to the bottom of it but, as I said, even though this has no bearing on the guilt or innocence of these particular charges.\u201d Defense counsel did not agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cI would just like to have, say, one other thing in behalf of Mr. Nawrocki. If in fact what this young man says is true, then the lawful order that the police officer gave, if he gave one, would not have been a lawful order. He would have no reason to order Mr. Nawrocki to do anything if that fact were true. Also, then Mr. Nawrocki could not have been guilty of resisting arrest because he could resist if the police officer didn\u2019t have a right to arrest him initially. I\u2019d advance that argument now in view of the testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The court replied: \u201cThe testimony of the officer was sufficient to sustain my finding.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Counsel said: \u201cWell, if that is the Court\u2019s ruling, in any event I would like to advance the argument on behalf of my client, sir.\u201d The court answered: \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">By letter dated 20 September 1971 the State\u2019s Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ney\u2019s Office informed Nawrocki\u2019s counsel that it was requesting a waiver of jurisdiction with respect to petition 149893 and that a hearing on the request would be held on 1 October before Hammerman, J. Rule 911 a. A waiver hearing at this stage was patently improper because in our opinion there had already been an adjudicatory hearing. <em>Matter of Brown, supra. </em>What occurred at the beginning of the hearing of 1 October is best described in the words of the transcript of the proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cTHE BAILIFF: Jerry Walter Nawrocki, please stand. Your Honor, we have before the court this morning petition number 149893 the respondent, Jerry Walter Nawroeki, set for disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">THE COURT: Now, Mr. Kareeski, you represent the respondent in this matter, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">MR. KARCESKI: That is correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">MR. SEIDEL [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, this case was marked for a waiver and a waiver notice was sent out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">THE COURT: What case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">MR. SEIDEL: I believe it to be in error. The case was tried on the merits and is in for disposition. I thought we had better clear that up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">THE COURT: Did I indicate that I was going to consider this for waiver of jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">MR. KARCESKI: If Your Honor please, I think</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">THE COURT: What happened on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-14\">MR. KARCESKI: At the end of the last hearing you decided that you would delay any finding until such time as you received a report from the Maryland Children\u2019s Center and then you would make an appropriate decision at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">THE COURT: Including the question of jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>MR. KARCESKI: If I can remember I am sure Your Honor did say that. I am sure the record reveals it but I think that was the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">THE COURT: Yes, that is the situation. Mr. Seidel, the case was set in for a delinquency hearing but at the conclusion of it there was a question of whether the matter ought to truly be waived to the criminal court. So, that question is before us also. Mr. Karceski, do you wish to be heard at this time before I make any finding in this matter?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Counsel renewed the arguments made on the motion for judgment of acquittal at the prior hearings, and then addressed himself at length \u201cto the problem of Mr. Nawrocki himself.\u201d At the conclusion of his argument the court said: \u201cWell, I am going to retain jurisdiction in this matter. I am going to find Walter delinquent for the reasons stated in the petition. * * * I am going to commit you to the Department of Juvenile Services for commitment to the appropriate institution and I am sure that they will give weight to the recommendation that you be sent to the forestry camp. It is my hope and desire that our probation department will be able to work out something that is a lot more effective, that will hold out good promise, and if that can be done I would be very happy to be able to authorize your release. That will conclude the hearing then.\u201d Under date of 1 October the court issued an order to the Superintendent of the Maryland Training School for Boys empowering and directing him to receive Nawrocki to be kept in his care and custody, subject to the further order of the court. The predicate of the order as recited therein was that \u201cit has been duly adjudged after hearing before Robert I. H. Hammerman, Judge of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes, that Walter Nawrocki is a delinquent child and is by reason thereof in need of care and treatment.\u201d As pointed out above, this was the second order issued by the court stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that Nawrocki had been adjudged a delinquent child, the first being the order of 28 July.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Despite the confusion as to the fact of the determination of delinquency, we find it patent that Nawrocki was found to be a delinquent child at the close of the evidence offered on the merits at the hearing of 28 July. At that point the only evidence before the court was the testimony of Officer Smith and we have decided the propriety of the court\u2019s finding of delinquency solely on his testimony. The testimony of the two witnesses about which Nawrocki now complains, as well as what thereafter came before the lower court, washes out in any event as relating only at the most to the disposition phase of the proceedings and has no bearing on the adjudication that Nawrocki was a delinquent child. We hold that in the circumstances there was no violation of due process of law because of the challenged testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Nawrocki also argues that the trial judge \u201cwas predisposed to find [him] delinquent\u201d and thereby violated his constitutional rights to due process of law. He observes that after the finding of delinquency on 28 July the judge remarked that he had \u201cread the very extensive folder\u201d concerning Nawrocki and he urges that to that point the judge had no opportunity to read the folder except prior to the hearing. He also points out that on the petition before the court was noted under the designation of \u201cprevious appearance\u201d the numbers of four previous petitions and the year in which they were filed. He concludes that the trial judge \u201cmay refer to this information and form an opinion adverse to the youth very early in the proceedings, thereby denying the youth his right to an unbiased trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">We are not persuaded by such speculation that the lower court was predisposed to a finding of delinquency, or that its finding was based on other than the evidence properly before it on the issue of delinquency <em>vel non. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>We see no denial of due process of law on the reasons advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Adjudication of 28 July 1971 of appellant as a delinquent child and disposition order of 1 October 1971 affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Note: <em>Certiorari </em>denied, Court of Appeals of Maryland, June 28, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-13\">. \u201c \u2018Delinquent Child\u2019 means a child who commits a delinquent act and who requires supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-1 (h). \u201c\u2018Delinquent Act\u2019 means * * * an act which would be a crime if done by a person who is not a child.\u201d Id., at \u00a7 70-1 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">In the Eighth Judicial Circuit, consisting of Baltimore City, a division of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City known as the division for juvenile causes has exclusive original jurisdiction over children alleged to be delinquent.

In the 1969 edition, however, Perkins repeated that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>common law theory an officer undertaking an arrest which was in fact unlawful was neither discharging the duties of his office nor attempting to do so and that therefore the intended arrestee was privileged to use reasonable force to prevent the unlawful deprivation of his liberty. He then observed: \u201cBut the problems involved are so complicated that'<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is easy for either the officer or the arrestee to be mistaken in regard to the lawfulness of the arrest and it seems wise to require such issues to be decided in court rather than by force and the present trend, by statute, is to provide that there is no privilege to resist an arrest which the arrestee knows is being made by a peace officer, even if the arrest is unlawful.\u201d At 496. Maryland has no such statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">. \u201cWhile it is the duty of the citizen to submit to lawful arrest, mere flight to avoid apprehension does not constitute resisting an officer because there is a distinction between avoidance and resistance or obstruction. Jerking away from an officer is obstructing him but cursing him is not, and if an arrestee while being taken to the police station struck the officer for the sole purpose of venting spleen upon him, this constituted an assault but not resistance to arrest. On the other hand, any force wilfully employed to prevent the success of the officer\u2019s effort is an obstruction of justice whether by the one to be arrested or by another.\u201d Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed., 1969) 496-497. <em>Wharton, supra, </em>says, \u00a7 1618: \u201cGenerally, some overt act is necessary; and in order that words alone may constitute the offense of wrongfully resisting arrest, it seems that they should be spoken under circumstances affording the person making the arrest reasonable grounds to believe that he cannot proceed with the arrest without incurring evident risk of serious injury. Merely being impertinent to an officer or daring him to make an arrest has been declared insufficient to amount to interference with him in the performance of his duties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">.
