Domingue argues that the administrative law judge (ALJ) failed to articulate the proper standard under <em>Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 391-92 (5th Cir.2000), when the ALJ determined that Domingue\u2019s alleged depression was not a severe impairment. Domingue also contends that the district court erred by not addressing two of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The ALJ did not misapply the standard for identifying a non-severe impairment because the ALJ concluded that the alleged depression was no impairment at all. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion is fully supported by substantial evidence in the record. At the administrative level Domingue did not contend that depression was an impairment, and, in the courts, she pointed to no evidence indicating that her alleged depression affected her ability to work. <em>See Pierre v. Sullivan, </em>884 F.2d 799, 803 (5th Cir.1989) (\u201cisolated comments\u201d about claimant\u2019s intellectual functioning, viewed within whole record, were insufficient to raise suspicion of mental retardation); <em>Shave v. Apfel, </em>238 F.3d 592, 596 (5th Cir.2001) (no evidence that an alleged impairment precluded employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Domingue is correct that the district court failed to address two of her claims. However, remand is unnecessary because this court reviews the record under the same standard as the district court, and the record contains substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Martinez v. Chater, </em>64 F.3d 172, 173 (5th Cir.1995) (avoiding remand and affirming where there was \u201csubstantial evidence in the record to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">The record reveals substantial evidence that Domingue\u2019s intellectual functioning was \u201cborderline\u201d and did not fit within the listed impairment of mental retardation combined with other impairments as provided by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpt. P., App. 1, \u00a7 12.05(C). In addition, the ALJ posited an adequate hypothetical question to the vocational expert, taking into account all the restrictions reasonably warranted by the evidence, and properly relied on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that Do-mingue is able to perform work in the national economy. <em>See Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 336 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
