He said, that in all cases where certioraris were directed to tribunals which were of an extraordinary and special character, in contradistinction to the ordinary and common courts, they could be allowed only at bar, and relied upon the case of <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Executors of Ludlow, </em>(1 <em>South. </em>387, 392.) as governing this.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-9\"><em>R. StocHon, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFY\">said he never understood the rule to go the length contended for by the adverse counsel. Eor twenty years after the Revolution, the practice in every case was, for the judge to make the <em>allocatur </em>at chambers; and though the case cited from <em>Southard </em>might establish a different general rule, he did not think that it disrobed the judge of the power of granting a certiorari under special and pressing circumstances, *by this side bar rule. The words, \u201ccommissioners to lay out roads,\u201d made use of in the case cited, did not mean the mere common case of applying to the court to appoint surveyors to lay out roads. It must mean commissioners specially appointed as such, by some particular law: as therefore a certiorari to the surveyors was not embraced in the words of the case cited, and as the ancient practice had been the other way, he thought the <em>allocatur </em>by the judge at chambers was sufficient.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b56-10\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AcT\">We are of opinion, that the case in <em>Southard </em>extends to surveyors; and the great reason why certio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>raris of this kind could not be allowed at chambers, was, that public proceedings should not be interrupted by the <em>allocatur </em>of a single j udge.</p>\n<author id=\"b57-5\">Ford J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">I am satisfied that the <em>allocatur </em>was not within the rule laid down in <em>Southard. </em>How far that rule ought to be modified, is another question.</p>\n<author id=\"b57-6\">EosselIj J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-6\">had no objection to reconsider that rule, and modify it if thought advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Certiorari quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
