On the trial before the Court of Common Pleas, the note produced was signed with a cross, and tint instrumental ^'witness, who was offered to prove the notes, had also signed his cross, instead of writing his name : the witness proved the fact of testatrix signing a note of that description, but said that the only time he ever witnessed a note was in the spring, but the note bore date in January. It appeared, besides, that both the witness aud the testatrix could write. Under these circumstances, the counsel for the defendants objected to the reading the note in evidence. The court, however, admitted the note to be read in evidence to the jury. The defendants then offered two witnesses who wore legatees of specific parts of the moveable property, under the will of the testatrix; and also\"devisees having contingent remainders in a part of the real estate; the will directing, that in case the estate should not be sufficient to pay their legacies, that each legatee should receive only a proportionate part. To these witnesses the executors had giveii a release, and had paid over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>their specific legacies. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of these witnesses, and the court sustained the objection. To these opinions of the court the counsel for the defendant took a bill of exceptions, and brought a writ of error to this court, and assigned for error\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">1.

And that the payment of the legacy by the executor could not render the witnesses competent; for though the executor could release his own right, he could not that of the creditor.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b94-14\">Eoed, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7J\">William Boyle recovered judgment in the Court of Oommbn Pleas, for the county of Morris, against the executors of Sarah Hedges, deceased, upon a promissory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>note against the testatrix, and on a subsequent book account against her for medicine and attendance. The executors took a bill of exceptions on the trial, and assign for error ; that the note was permitted to go in evidence to the jury without proof of its having been executed by the testatrix. \u25a0On examining the bill of exceptions, it appears otherwise. The boy who made a <em>mark </em>for his name as instrumental witness, swore distinctly to the identity of the instrument, to his knowledge and remembrance of the mark, and to the .signature o\u00ed the testatrix in his presence; he says the testatrix sent him into another room for paper to draw the note upon, and that she made him read it over loud to her after she had executed it. On this the court ordered the note to be read in evidence, and very properly left the jury to judge of the credit of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">They further assign for error, that the court rejected two persons, offered as witnesses on behalf of the executors. These persons wore <em>legatees </em>of specific parts of the <em>moveable </em>property; and also <em>devisees, </em>having contingent, remainders in a considerable part of the <em>real estate; </em>and, in case the estate should not be sufficient to pay their legacies, the will directed that each legatee should receive only a proportionate part: the <em>debts </em>might be sufficient to absorb the whole personal and real estate, and thereby would defeat them of their legacies; and the debt in dispute was a large demand, far exceeding eleven hundred dollars ; the witnesses had therefore an immediate and strong interest in both branches of the estate, which would naturally influence them to guard and defend it against being impaired and diminished by persons calling themselves creditors. The case was likened to the remote interest of a parishioner liable to be rated for support of the poor, and others of that description, to which it bears no resemblance, .as the pauper may die, or the parishioner remove his domicil; but this interest is near and immediate. The record ^ of a creditor\u2019s recovery is good evidence against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>these legatees to impair the amount of their legacies, or wholly to defeat them. And the release of the executors cannot discharge the <em>lien </em>which is given to creditors on both the real and personal estate, for payment of debts; nothing but a <em>sale </em>can discharge it; therefore I do not consider these, legatees competent witnesses to invalidate demands against property in which' they have an immediate interest, and that the court committed no error in refusing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Another error assigned depends on the third section of the act of February 10, 1818, whereby a physician is required to deliver his account, or \u201c bill of particulars, in plain English words, or as nearly so as the articles will admit.\u201d This account was received in evidence, and yet it does not seem to have been made out in conformity to the statute, for it abounds with <em>eontraetions, </em>initials and <em>symbols, </em>that are not <em>words, </em>and at any rate are not <em>English words ; </em>and for this error I am of opinion that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-5\">Bossell, J., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">N.
