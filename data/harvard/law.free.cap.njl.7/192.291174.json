Jeffers, </em>in pursuance of a rule to shew cause, taken at the last term, applied for a <em>mandamus, </em>to be directed to the township committee of Lower Penn\u2019s Heck, in the county of Salem, to compel them to assign and appoint, in writing, to the overseers of the highways, respectively, their several limits and divisions of the highways within such township, for opening, clearing out, working and amending the same, as by law they were bound to do under the act <em>(Dev. Laws </em>621, <em>see. </em>14); and he read a statement of facts, agreed upon by the adverse counsel, upon which his application was founded; but as the application was refused upon a collateral objection, it is unnecessary to state the facts. \u2014 To shew that the court had the power to grant a <em>mandamus </em>in a case of this kind, he cited <em>Com Dig. Mand. litle </em>22; 4 <em>Bac. Abr. title Mand. letter C. </em>500; <em>Jac. Law Diet, title Mand.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-8\"><em>Dayton, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcKP\">objected to the application, because he had no notice of it. He said, that the copy of the rule to shew cause, which had been served upon the township committee, was, that they should shew cause why a <em>mandamus </em>should not issue against them to compel them to <em>open </em>the road. He had come prepared to resist a <em>mandamus </em>of that kind, upon the ground, that it was not their .duty to <em>open </em>a road; but of the present application, <em>viz., </em>to compel the committee to <em>assign </em>the road, the committee had notice, and therefore he should resist the application on that ground.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b242-9\">Kirkpatrick, O.

The rule is, to shew cause why they should not <em>open </em>the road *and the application is, to compel them to <em>assign, </em>&amp;c.; therefore the <em>mandamus </em>in this case cannot, for that reason, be granted, although that the court have a right to grant a <em>mandamus </em>in a subject matter of this kind, there can be no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><em>Mandamus </em>refused.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-12\">See the form of a <em>mandamus </em>to the overseers of highways, 1 <em>Cow.
