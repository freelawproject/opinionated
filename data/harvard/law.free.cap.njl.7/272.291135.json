It will be recollected that the foundation of it is a certain sealed bill or note, with a stipulation endorsed, that the defendant stands security thereon until paid. The defendant sets up three grounds of defence, and if either of them are sanctioned by law the j ury must find a verdict in his favor. 1st. He says that the plaintiff, in his declaration, sets out the instrument under seal, and that the instrument produced does not appear to be sealed. If it be not a sealed bill your verdict will be for the defendant. What then is a seal ? By the common law it must be- either wax, or wafer, or some glutinous substance; but by our statute it may be a scroll. If a man makes use of a scroll, <em>by way of seal, </em>upon any instrument for the payment of money, it shall be taken and adjudged to be of the same force and obligation as if it were sealed with wax. Here there is a scroll. The question is, was it put there by the defendant, <em>by way of seal ? </em>The defendant demands evidence that the scroll was intended for a seal, but there needs no other proof than the instrument itself saying \u201c witness my hand and seal.\u201d In this state of things, the court and jury are bound to treat it as a sealed bill. 2d. The second defence is, that the defendant\u2019s name was endorsed in blank, and that the plaintiff wrote a special guaranty over it, without the defendant\u2019s knowledge, privity, or consent. If this were so, the defendant should have proved it, and it would have formed a valid defence; but, as far as I know, he has given no proof whatever of this charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Proof of the defendant\u2019s own proper signature is evidence of the assignment, as it stands, until the contrary appears ; and if the law were otherwise, more than half of the commercial paper in the country might be put afloat, and destroyed by presumption. I think that the jury well have no difficulty in saying they cannot defend Mr. Force upon this ^ground. 3d. The last defence is, that the plaintiff' did not use due diligence to obtain payment of the bill when it became due from the maker; that Brown lived three years in full credit and prosperity after the money was payable before he gave up his property to his creditors. But the plaintiff was under no obligation in law to demand payment with due diligence in the case of a sealed bill. The law upon negotiable notes is, that the endorser will pay on condition that the endorsee cannot obtain payment at the day, it does not, however, extend to a sealed bill. The defendant promises, under his hand, to be security till the money is paid ; no condition for due diligence is expressed in the assignment, none is implied in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">Then if this is a sealed bill, and this endorsement made at the time it purports to have been made, and the name subscribed thereto is the name of the defendant, it follows, of course, that your verdict must be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff. To the charge delivered by the court the defendant excepted, and brought a writ of error, upon the return of which the following errors were assigned for the reversal of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\">1. That the justice charged the jury, among other things, in the words following : \u201c The defendant demands evidence that the scroll was intended for a seal, but there needs no other proof than the instrument itself saying, ' witness my hand and seal.\u2019 \u201d In this state of things, the court and jury are bound to treat it as a-sealed bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-8\">2. That the justice charged the jury, that they were bound to treat the said instrument as a sealed bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>3. That the justice charged the jury in the words following : \u201c The second defence is, that the defendant\u2019s name was in blank, and the plaintiff wrote a special guaranty over it without the defendant's knowledge, privity or consent. If this were so, the defendant should have proved it, and it would have formed a valid defence, but, as far as I know, he has given no proof \u25a0 whatever of this charge, and a court and jury are not at liberty to presume the existence of \u25a0fraud without evidence. Proof of the defendant\u2019s own proper signature is evidence of the assignment, as it stands, till the contrary appears, and if the law were otherwise more than half of the commercial paper in the state might be put afloat and destroyed by presumption.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqG\">*4. That the justice charged the jury in the words following: \" The last defence is, that the plaintiff did not use due diligence to obtain payment 6f the bill when it became due from the maker ; that Brown lived three years in full credit and prosperity after the money was payable, before he gave up his property to his creditors. But the plaintiff was under no obligation in law to demand payment \u2022with due diligence in the case of a sealed bill. The law upon negotiable notes is, that the endorser will pay on condition that the endorsee cannot obtain payment-at the day; it does not, however extend to a sealed bill. The defendant promises under his hand to be security till the money is paid; no condition for due diligence is expressed in the assignment \u2014 none is implied in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-6\">5. That the declaration is insufficient in law to maintain the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\">6. That judgment was given for David 8. Craig against the said Henry Force, when by the law of the land it should have been given for the said Henry Force against the said David S.

That the instrument upon which the action was brought was not a sealed bill, but a promissory note, and that the flourish under the name of the drawer was not a scroll or device by way of seal, in the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-5\">2. That the words in the body of the note, <em>\u201c </em>witness my hand and seal,\u201d were no evidence that the flourish under the name was meant for a seal. <em>Hay.

That if the words \u201c witness my hand and seal \u201d were any evidence that the flourish under the name was meant for a seal, yet they wtere not conclusive evidence; but the jury should have been left to judge from the appearance of the note itself, and from the whole evidence in the cause, whether the flourish was meant as a seal or not. <em>Hay.

That proof of Henry Force\u2019s signature on the back of the *note was not proof of the special assignment written above it, without proving that the special assignment wa.s written at the time the name was signed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">5. That the circumstance of the writing above the name ol\u2019 Force being proved to be the handwriting of Craig was some evidence from which the jury might judge whether the assignment was with the knowledge and consent of Force or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">6. That the defendant, Craig, was bound to use due diligence m demanding the money of the drawer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-10\">7. That the neglecting to demand payment until three years after the note became due, and until after the drawer broke, was such gross negligence on the part of the holder that the endorser, Force, was discharged. 3 <em>John.
