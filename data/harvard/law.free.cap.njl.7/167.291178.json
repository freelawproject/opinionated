This <em>(Vanarsdale </em>said) was not such a special note'of the commencement of the action as the law required ; because it did not state what the penalty was for,, or on what statute it accrued. _</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-5\">3. Because the state of demand contains no legal cause of action. It did not state that the defendant was the driver of any'carriage or other vehicle, nor upon what kind of road he was travelling, whether a turnpike, a public or private road, nor that the-, plaintiff was hindered or obstructed in his passage; but that the penalty was forfeited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b214-6\">Per <em>Ctiriam.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Akb\">Take a reversal on both the reasons assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"AA6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
