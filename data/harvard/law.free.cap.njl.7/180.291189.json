That Randal Rickey was not seized of such an estate in the premises in question as could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>taken and sold, by virtue of an execution, in the lifetime of the widow. The estate of Randal Rickey was only an estate in remainder, which could not vest in possession until the death of the widow. The statute making lands liable for the payment of debts <em>{Rev. Laws </em>431, <em>see. </em>6) enacts, \u201cThat if sufficient goods and chattels of the said party cannot be found in his county, that then the sheriff shall cause the whole, or the residue, as the case may require, of the said debt, damages and costs or sum of money to be made of the lands, tenements, hereditaments and real estate, whereof the said party was <em>seized </em>on the day when the said lands, &amp;c., became liable to such debt,\u201d &amp;c. The question is, what kind of seizin is meant ? Is it a seizin in deed or a seizin in law ? The word <em>seized, </em>as here used, meant possessed, not merely <em>entitled </em>to, but an actual pernancy of the profits. The whole object of the legislature was to sell the property of which the defendant was in the actual possession, the property of which he was seized in deed, and not that in which he had merely a prospective estate, which might or might not come into possession during his life. If any other construction was given '\"Ho this act, the interest of the remainder man must in all cases be sacrificed, for it would seldom bring any thing at sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\">2. That the execution reaching the hands of the sheriff fifteen days after Randal Rickey\u2019s death, was altogether void, and furnished no authority for the sheriff to proceed and sell the property. Randal Rickey died on the 3d of December, 1802. On the first day of the same mouth, the attorney drew the execution, and sent it to the clerk to be sealed. On the 18th of the same month it reached the sheriff. The defendant was then dead, and other persons had become entitled to the premises. There are cases which decide, that an execution issued after the death of the defendant binds from the teste of the writ. But this principle does not apply to real estate, for if any difficulty arises as to writ priority, if is determined by ascertaining the time when the sheriff received it. In this case, the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>on which the writ was sealed is unknown \u2014 when it reached the clerk\u2019s office does not appear, and the time of recording is also unknown. It was incumbent on the party claiming under the execution to shew that the execution was actually sealed before the death of Randal Rickey, if it was not sealed till after his death it was void : all the common law doctrine as to judgments entered after the death of the party, has been put down by the case of <em>Wood </em>v. Hopkins, <em>Pen. Rep. </em>689.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\">3. Inasmuch as it appears that Randal Rickey died possessed of more goods and chattels than were sufficient to satisfy the execution, the sheriff had no right to take the real estate in execution. When the execution reached the hands of the sheriff there was more personal property in the county than was sufficient to pay Randal Rickey\u2019s debts. On the last of December, 1802, Benjamin Hornor took out letters of administration, and an inventory was made out by him on the 31st of December, by which it appears, that there was personal property to the amount of \u00a315(J, and the execution was only for 150 dollars; the execution might, therefore, have been levied on the personal property, and it was the duty of the sheriff to have taken the personal property first, for, by the very words of the writ, he is commanded first to take the personal property, and <em>\u201c </em>if there is no personal property, <em>then </em>(to take to the real estate. And it is only by a provision in a late statute, <em>(Pev. Laws </em>671, <em>sec. </em>2) that the defendant can elect to have his real estate sold first. The sheriff *had disobeyed' the precept \u2014 he had passed by the personal property and seised the real\u2014 and in so doing he had done wrong. It is no answer to say, that here no injustice had been done, for .that the whole of the property put together was not sufficient to pay the debt. But if the administrator had sold, instead of the sheriff, there would have been enough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">4. That Hornor being the administrator, and having property in his hands sufficient to pay the execution, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>purchase by him of the lands sold at sheriff\u2019s sale was fraudulent and void. Benjamin Hornor, whose duty it was to pay this execution, who was a trustee for the creditors and the children of Bandal Bickey, himself became a purchaser of this property; this the administrators cannot do, and the sale is void. It was the duty of the administrator to pay off this execution; this was the only execution which was a lien upon the land : there was a judgment in the county of Burlington, but that was no incumbrance upon the land in the county of Hunterdon, nor upon the personal estate in the hands of Hornor, who resided in the city of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\">The sale of the personal estate by the administrator took place on the 19th January, 1803, and at that time he had property in his hands sufficient to pay this execution, which was not incumbered by any other lion, and which ought to have been applied to the payment of it, and having the money in his hands, he suffers the real estate to be sold. If the administrator was the only purchaser there is no doubt the purchase would be void, but other persons joining with him cannot better it; they chose to embark their fortunes with him, and they must sink or swim together.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-6\"><em>Ewing, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmCV\">The first question is, whether the estate was liable to be sold ? In England the mode of proceeding is entirely different, as it regards lands, from that in this state. What was the nature of the estate of Bandal Bickey ? It was a vested remainder in fee-simple in Bandal Bickey. This position will not be disputed. Can such estate be seized and sold by the sheriff under an execution ? Of this there can be no doubt, for it is an absolute estate, and the person in whom it is vested has the actual control over it, in every respect, except as to the pernancy of the profits. How it would be an anomaly that there should be in this state an estate which a man may convey away *by deed or devise, and yet it could not be taken by execution. 1 It is said, that the defendant must be seized; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>but the term seizin applies as fully to an estate in remainder as in possession ; and if it depends upon this term, an estate in remainder is as fully within the act of the legislature as an estate in possession. See 1 <em>see. aet, Rev. Laws </em>433. By this section, all lands, tenements, and hereditaments may be seized. But if it is to be confined to such lands, tenements, &amp;c., whereof a man seized, still a remainder would be embraced; for whether it is a seizin in fact or in law makes no difference. But what kind of seizin had the defendant ? I contend he had a seizin in fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-5\">2. Judgment having been obtained against Bandal Bickey in his lifetime, a sale made upon that judgment was regular and valid. The judgment was signed on the 1st September, 1802; on the 1st of December, the attorney drew the execution, and sent it to the sheriff; on the 3d, Bandal Bickey died, and on the 18th, the sheriff i-eceived it. Now it does not appear that the execution was issued after the death of Bandal Bickey. It may have been sealed and recorded before the death of Bandal Bickey, and, in the absence of direct proof, the court will presume that it was done before : the maxim is, <em>omnia prcesumuntur rite aeta, ut res magis valeat quam pereat. </em>But if the execution was issued after the death of Bandal Bickey, yet the land was bound, and the sale regular. <em>Theft. fa. </em>was issued during the vacation subsequent to the term in which this judgment was entered. The settled doctrine of the common law is, that an execution thus issued is good, although the party is dead, and there is no statute in this state altering it. By our act, lands are bound from the entry of the judgment on record. <em>Rev. Laws </em>431, <em>see. </em>2. Personal property is bound from the time of the delivery of the writ to the sheriff. <em>Ibid, see. </em>3. An execution may be issued after the decease of the person against whom it purports to be issued. <em>Parson </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>1 <em>Ld. Ray. </em>695; 3 <em>P. Wms. </em>399, 408; <em>Strange </em>882; 4 <em>Ld. Ray. </em>849. The conduct of administrator was not fraudulent, but fair, honest, and praiseworthy, for there was not property sufficient to pay the\"judgments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Randal Rickey died after the passage of the \u201c act for the distribution of the estates of persons who die, not leaving sufficient property to pay all their just debts.\u201d <em>Pat. </em>435. Hornor did not receive the whole of his debt. He did no injury to the heirs. It *is said, that if the property could have been sold by administrator it might have brought more; yet this is merely problematical. The sale by the sheriff was attended by less expense than if Hornor had applied to the Orphans\u2019 Court for an order for sale, which \u25a0would have been expensive, and the interest of the debts would have been accumulating in the meantime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-5\">But, it is said, that the sale is invalid, because the administrator is one of' the purchasers; but the case to which the gentleman has made allusion does not apply to this case; for if the sheriff had a right to sell then, Hornor, the adminstrator, might become a purchaser. The rule to which the gentleman alludes is, that an administrator cannot sell and purchase at the same time; he cannot be both seller and purchaser: but that does not apply here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-6\">Although there was personal estate, yet the administrator could not make any application of the personal estate so as to have prevented this sale. His duty was plainly marked out by the act of the legislature. Here were certain debts, which were entitled to be first paid. Coe and son, although they had a judgment and execution, stood upon no better ground than any of the other creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-7\">It is said, the sheriff ought to have levied upon the personal property; and, not having done so, this sale of real estate is invalidated. To this there are two answers. 1. When this execution was given to the sheriff, there were no personal chattels upon which he could levy: for (goods being bound from the delivery) the goods, at that time, were the property of the administrators. Because the sheriff, in his return, makes no mention of personal property, it does not make the sale of the real property void: and his saying nothing about personal property, is the same as if he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>declared that no personal property was to be found. It has been expressly determined, that the want of a return, that there was no personal property, will not vitiate the sale <em>Coxe Rep. </em>39. 2. Although Hornor\u2019s judgment was in the county of Burlington, yet he was equally entitled to be preferred as if it was in this county; \u2014 it was entered of'record in the lifetime of Randal Rickey.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b236-7\">Eokd, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AId\">The lessors of the plaintiff claimed the premises in question, as heirs at law of Raudal Rickey, their father, who *died seized, and contested the legality of a sale of the premises made by the sheriff, under an execution against their father, Randal Rickey, after his decease. If the sale was valid, it, of course, destroyed the title of the heirs at law, a\u00fcd if not valid, their title must, of consequence prevail. All depends on the legality or illegality of the s\u00e1le.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">It is objected to it, in the first place, that the estate of the ancestor was of such a nature that it could not b'e seized and sold under the statute making' lands liable to be sold for the payment of debts. Randal Rickey claimed under a devise that was made t'o the widow \u201cfor and during her natural life, and after her decease to Randal Rickey, his heirs and assigns forever;\u201d and under this devise he took a <em>vested interest' </em>in the remainder, <em>a present fixed right of future enjoyment, </em>depending on no dubious or uncertain event. The possession of the tenant of the particular estate is construed to be the possession of him in remainder, so that' the remainder man is held to be <em>seized </em>of his remainder.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>166. Hence he had an estate that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>could sell, convey, devise or transmit to his heirs by descent. \u25a0Now the statute makes any real estate liable to be taken on execution whereof the defendant was <em>seized </em>on the day of entering judgment; and as this was real estate in the <em>seizin </em>of the defendant, it was liable to be taken and sold for the payment of his debts.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">*In the second place, it is objected, that the execution against Eandal Bickey was <em>not, sealed till after his death, </em>and therefore that it was void.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The fact of its being sealed before his death, is not agreed upon so clearly as every fact ought to be in a case that is stated, or in a special verdict. ' The execution was <em>draion and transmitted to the clerk </em>on the <em>first </em>day of December, and if he sealed it on the day he received it, the sealing was in sufficient time, as Eandal Bickey did not die till the <em>third </em>day of the same month. Now it was not only as easy for the clerk to seal it on the clay it came to hand, as to postpone it to a future day, but in point of duty he had no <em>right or discretion </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>delay the process of the court. If one fact <em>might </em>therefore be established by inference from another, the legal inference or presumption would be, that the officer <em>did his duty </em>when nothing appeared to the contrary. Default, like guilt, is never to be presumed ; and in this point of view the execution was sealed in time. But suppose it were otherwise, I think at this day, and supported by so many adjudged cases on the point, both ancient and modern, it may be safely asserted, that if an execution be <em>tested in the defendant\u2019s lifetime, </em>it may be taken out and executed after his death. See <em>Tidd\u2019s Prae. 915, </em>and the eases there collected. The execution thus sued out will not bind the goods, so as to defeat <em>bona fide </em>purchasers thereof before its delivery to the sheriff; nor will it be affected by the statute giving priority to judgments entered up in the lifetime.of persons dying insolvent, because that statute was not intended to interfere with executions lawfully sued out; it relates only to judgments, *and the case of <em>Wood </em># <em>Hopkins, Pen. Pep. </em>689, has no perceivable bearing on executions. If the inability of a person deceased to make the election provided for defendant in the eleventh section of the act <em>(Pev. Paws </em>433) were a Sufficient reason for destroying the exigency of a writ, it would follow that -the death of any defendant twenty days before sale would paralyze executions in all cases. It would be much safer to hold, that under the equity of the statute this privilege of election might be exercised by the heir or executor of a defendant deceased, than to make it an engine to destroy the execution which it professes only to regulate. <em>Pev. Paws </em>433, <em>see. </em>11.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The last objection is, that the administrator committed a fraud in purchasing the real estate himself, seeing, he acted in the character of a trustee, and had assets of the personal estate wherewith he might have paid off this execution, without suffering the lands to be sacrificed at a sale by the sheriff. The answer which has been given to both branches of this objection seems to obviate them entirely. His being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>a trustee of the personal fund did not disqualify him to bid for the landed property, he not being the person intrusted to sell it. It is not analagous to the cases where a trustee has sold to himself, or employed an agent to bid for him. As to withholding the personal assets in order to force the real estate to a sale, the conclusion is not warranted by the case as stated. There were a number of judgments entitled by statute to be paid <em>ratably </em>according to their amount, and the moveable estate in the hands of the administrator was not sufficient to pay them all; if, therefore, he had paid otherwise than ratably it would have been in contravention of the statute, and an act of mal-administration. On the whole case, therefore, let judgment be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-5\">Kirkpatrick, O.

The particular estates and the reversion or remainders over, form, in law. but <em>one ('date; </em>and, consequently, by delivering the possession to the person first taking, it extends to all. All therefore, may be said to be <em>seised, </em>as they are all placed in the tenancy, and as the property is fixed in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u2022* But, on the other hand, when the seizin is divided into a seizin in deed and a seizin in law. we confine it merely to the present <em>corporeal possession of </em>the premises; not extending it to the future of an interest which is to come into actual enjovment on a future event. The seizin, not strictly in its technical sense, but in its primitive and vulgar acceptation, <em>i. e. </em>the corporeal or visible possession, must in the last case be really expectant upon, and postponed to the determination of the particular estate. And in this sense the reversioner cannot be seized, either in deed or in law.\u201d See further, on this subject, p. 44, 46,47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> A remainder or reversioner expectant on an estate of freehold will admit of no mesne seizin while it continues in a course of descentand this principle presents a solution of the question, whether a remainder or reversion shall be subject to the debts of the mense remainder man or reversioner? In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>TonyeVAI3. Wins.) </em>it is said of an advowson, that \u201c as it may be sold and comes to the heir by descent it is reasonable it should bo assets.\u201d Now though a reversion or remainder on a freehold may be sold, yet it may not come to the heir by descent from the very person who contracted the debt; and therefore a distinction should be made between extending it in the debtor\u2019s lifetime fas he has power over it) or in the handy of his devisee (as the remainder or reversion is devisable, and the devisee claims under him who contracts tlie debt) And it should seem that if judgment be had iu the debtor's lifetime, it will bind the property, though no execution be taken out till the property descend toothers. But where no judgment bo liad in the debtoi\u2019s lifetime and the stock of descent bo not changed by such mesne, it should seem that the person faking such remainder by descent would wot be subject to the debts o\u00ed a mine- ' remainder man or reversioner: as he would not take by descent from him, but from the original donor, and so paramount the mesne\u2019s charges. <em>Watkins Ess. 140-1. </em>Bro.
