To this information, the defendant pleaded, \u201c that he ought not to be impeached or impleaded by reason of the premises in the said information, because he says, that by the constitution and laws of the state of New Jersey, the right, power, and authority *to appoint to the said office of clerk, is vested, without appeal or control, jointly in the legislative council and general assembly of the said state; and that the right-,, power, and authority to commission the persons so appointed to said office jointly by the said legislative council and general assembly, are, by the said constitution and laws of said state, vested absolutely in the governor of the said state; and that at a joint meeting of the said legislative council and general assembly of said state, on the 27th of October, 1821, the said legislative council and general assembly did,, by a majority of votes, jointly elect and appoint the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u25a0Jeremiah J.

Poster was duly commissioned by his excellency the governor - of this state, as in the plea of this defendant alleged and stated, which are the same election and appointment mentioned in the plea and replication aforesaid; wherefore the s.aid Jeremiah J. Poster saith, that the said Ephraim Miller-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>was not then and there appointed to be clerk as aforesaid, and entitled to be commissioned as such clerk, and to claim, use, and enjoy the said offices of clerk of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas of Gloucester, and to have and enjoy all. the powers, privileges, and emoluments thereto of right appertaining, for the time limited in the constitution of said state, as he hath done, and as it was and is lawful for him,, the said Jeremiah J. Foster, is ready to verify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">To this rejoinder there was a demurrer and joinder in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-6\"><em>Wall, </em>for the relator,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATa\">and in support of the demurrer, contended \u2014 1. That a majority of the votes of the members of the council and assembly, <em>present </em>in joint meeting, was all that was required to make an appointment to any <em>office; </em>and that it wms not necessary that there should be a majority of the whole number of both houses, present and absent; that Ephraim Miller, having received the votes of twenty-eight members of the joint meeting, which was a majority of the fifty-three members present, was duly appointed to-the office of clerk ; and that the decision of the chairman of the joint meeting, declaring that a majority of the whole number of members of both houses, present and absent,. <em>(viz: </em>the majority of fifty-sis members) was requisite *to make an appointment, was unconstitutional and illegal, and that the subsequent proceedings of the joint meeting, in proceeding to vote again for a clerk, were void.. <em>Constitution of New Jersey, sec. </em>7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">-2. That- when a majority of votes had been given for any candidate, the power of the joint meeting over that appointment was at an end; the officer became absolutely entitled to the office, and was not removable by the joint meeting, but only in the manner pointed out by law. But if the-joint meeting could rescind or recall their vote after it had been given, they might turn out an officer w-ho had been once duly appointed. 1 <em>Cranch </em>157,. 153, 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>3.

In this case, so long as the joint meeting were in session, they had a right to reconsider *any question which had been before them, or any vote which they had made. They did reconsider the vote they had first given, and they voted 'that there should be a re-balloting. In this view of the subject, we are inclined to believe that there was nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>'(illegal or unconstitutional in the proceedings of the joint meeting, and that the information cannot be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-5\">Eoud, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATL\">That is my impression. The joint meeting were deliberating and discussing the question which was before them. The chairman of the joint meeting, who is the mouth-piece of the whole body, declared, after the first vote was taken, that there was no election; and it is so-stated on their minutes. They then proceeded to ballot again for the clerk. I do not see how this court can interfere to prevent their so doing. We hold our proceedings under revision during- the term; and we do not know that we can withhold the same right from them. I think that .there is no ground for the information.</p>\n<judges id=\"b141-6\">Rossell, J. concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
