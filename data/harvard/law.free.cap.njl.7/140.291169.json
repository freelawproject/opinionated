A general acknowledgment, that the defendant is indebted, will not authorize the justice in entering judgment for a specific sum.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\">The transcript sent up by the justice was as follows: (after stating the court and the parties) \u2014 \u201c In debt, demand $62, Ja.D. 6, 1823.
