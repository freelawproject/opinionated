Stockton, </em>for the defendant, and by <em>Woodruff, </em>(attorney general,) for the state.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-5\">\n<em>*Jfor the defendant.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1ep\">The facts set forth in this indictment contain no matter of an indictable nature ; it is not a crime against the public, but a private trespass, to remove a corner-stone from a boundary line between two neighbors. An injury of a private nature, unless it in soma way affect the public, cannot be indicted. 2 <em>Hawk. </em>301, <em>c. </em>25, <em>see. </em>4. An indictment will not lie for an attempt to defraud, if neither by false tokens nor by conspiracy. <em>Strange </em>793, 866. 6 <em>Mod. </em>105. This is an injury of a private character altogether, and in whicli the public have no kind of interest; an action may be sustained at the suit of the person injured, <em>(Co. Int. </em>200, <em>b.) </em>but there is no precedent to be found of an indictment for such an act. Until some precedent can be found to warrant this proceeding, the doctrine of <em>Lord Coke </em>is to be regarded, \u201c that non-usage, where there is no example, is a great intendment that the law will not bear.\u201d <em>Co. Ini. </em>81, <em>b.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">In <em>Rex v. Wheatly, (2 Bur. </em>1127) <em>Lord Mansfield </em>states the law on this point. \u201c The offence that is indictable must be such a one as affects the public, as if a man use false weights and measures, and sells by them to all or many of his customers, or uses them in the general course of his dealing,\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> &amp;c. And in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Storr, </em>(3 <em>Bur. </em>1698) where the indictment was for a mere civil trespass, though laid to be with force and arms, the Court of King\u2019s Bench quashed the indictment. The same law was established in <em>Rex. </em>v. <em>Atkyns, </em>3 <em>Bur. </em>1706.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-7\">\n<em>For the State.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiT\">The general principle is not questioned, that to make an act an indictable offence at common law, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>must be of a public nature : the general doctrine is, that all misdemeanors whatsoever, of a public evil example, may bo indicted. 3 <em>Bao. Abr. </em>549.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">This offence has, however, been enumerated among this description of misdemeanors since the time of Edward II. In the statute for the view of frankpledge, (17 <em>PJdward </em>2, <em>sec. </em>9) it is inserted, and considered as a public offence. This statute confers this authority on the court leet to inquire of the removal of boundaries, but the business of this court hath insensibly devolved *on the quarter sessions. .By the act of Hovember, 1794, <em>seo. 2, (Paterson </em>130) the quarter sessions has cognizance of all offences of an indictable nature.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> But an offence is indictable, which in its nature, and by its example, tends to the corruption of morals, although it be not committed in public. 2 <em>Scry. &amp; Haw. </em>91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b522-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZ4d\">The judgment of the sessions must be reversed. The offence charged is exclusively a private injury, and in no way concerns the public farther than any other private wrong. The cases cited from <em>Burrows </em>are strongly in point, and on the authority of them we are for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
