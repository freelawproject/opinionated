Ford, upon lands and premises occupied by him, by virtue t&gt;f and in pursuance of the command of a writ of execution of <em>fieri facias de bonis </em>issued out of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas of the county of Sussex, aforesaid, at the suit of Frederick Shirts, the other defendant in this suit, and against the said John O.

Rep. </em>782, <em>note, </em>to shew that the court would rather consult the convenience of the plaintiff than of the defendant, in relation to the <em>venue.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Vanarsdale,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKMh\">on the same side. This is a transitory action, and the plaintiff has laid the <em>venue </em>in the county where he lives, and the court will not change it unless under very special circumstances. 1 <em>South. '30, 363; </em>2 <em>Ibid. </em>718. The circumstance of the defendant being deputy sheriff of Sussex, is not a sufficient reason to change the <em>venue ; </em>on the contrary, from the known influence which sheriffs and deputy sheriffs have in their own county, it strengthens the belief set forth in the affidavit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>*tho plaintiff, that he cannot have, an impartial trial in that county. In England the rule is, that if the plaintiff undertakes to give material evidence in the county where the action is brought, the court will not change the <em>venue. </em>Here the plaintiff states, that he has material witnesses in the county of Morris, which is in substance the same thing ; there was no reason why the convenience of the defendant should be consulted any more than that of the plaintiff, and therefore the court ought not to change the <em>venue.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-5\"><em>Lwing, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiZ5\">The English rule, as to changing the <em>venue, </em>has been changed by the course of decisions growing out of the statute. <em>Rev. Laws </em>453, <em>see. </em>4. But,, according to either rule, the <em>venue </em>ought to be changed. The English rule was, \u201c that if the plaintiff bring a transitory action in any other county than that in which the cause of action arose, the defendant, upon application to the court founded upon an affidavit \u201c that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action (if any) arose in the county of B. and not in the county of A., or elsewhere out of the county of B.,\u201d can have the <em>venue </em>changed to the county where the cause of action really arose. The plaintiff may, it is true, retain the <em>venue </em>in the county where ho has laid it. But how is he to do it? Not by an affidavit stating that ho haft material witnesses in that county, but by undertaking to give material <em>evidence </em>of some matter in <em>issue arising </em>in such county. 2 <em>Arch. Rrac. 177. </em>Here the plaintiff does not undertake to do this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">But we are not to be governed by the English rule, for_ 1. We shew the court that this is an action of trespass, and that all the circumstances arose in the county of Sussex.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiK\">2. That all the acts done by the defendant were done by him as a public officer of the county of Sussex. If the plaintiff may sue an officer for an act done in the discharge of his official duty, and may take him out of his own county, they may be subjected to great inconvenience. An officer might be sued in the county of Gape May for an act done in Sussex county, which ought not to be tolerated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b254-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A0J\">We are of opinion that the <em>venue </em>must be changed; and principally upon the ground, that the defendant is a civil officer, and the act for which he is sued was done in the *performance of his duty as such, and it would be a great hardship to take him out of his county.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">After this opinion of the court, <em>Vanarsdale </em>said, that since he addressed the court he had met with the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Pemberton, </em>reported in 2 <em>Halst. </em>350, which he thought would rule the present, and which he begged permission to read to the court, to shew that the <em>venue </em>should be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><em>Pwing. </em>There is nothing in the case.read by the gentleman to induce the court to change the opinion which they unanimously gave this morning. That case is not at all in point; the ground relied upon by the counsel for the defendant in that case was, that an action for an escape was a local action, which the court denied. But the point upon which the court have decided our case was not taken in the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Pemberton.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b254-7\">Kirkpatrick, O. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8n9\">The decision of that case was made pretty soon after the passage of the act. <em>Pev. Laws </em>453; <em>sec. </em>4. Chief Justice Kinsey was an excellent English lawyer, but he did not take as great a latitude in the construction of our statutes as the courts have since done; and since the intermediate decisions which have been made upon this subject, we should not consider that case as binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Ford, J. The ease of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Pemberton </em>was an action for an escape, which is a mere non-feasance; this is an action against a civil officer for doing a positive act. The case cited does not militate against this; it does not decide the point upon which our opinion was placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Rossell, J., said, he saw no reason to change the opinion thoy had given this morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Rule to change <em>venue </em>granted.*</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">*Note. \u2014 Seo 1 <em>Coweris Hep. </em>196, where it is said \u2014 \u201cThat it is a general rule, that in actions arising <em>ex delicto </em>the <em>venue </em>will be changed to the county where the action arose, unless the plaintiff stipulate to give material evidence in the county where the <em>venue </em>is laid.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
