The constable had seized the goods as the property of Ephraim Applegate, the plaintiff\u2019s father. On the trial of the appeal before the Common Pleas, the plaintiff produced a paper writing purporting to be a list of articles purchased at the sale of Ephraim Applegate\u2019s property, on execution at the suit of James Clark, and purchased by Eliza Applegate on the 6th of May, 1820, signed by the constable, John Skillman. The defendant objected to this writing being read in evidence, without the production of the judgment under which the sale was made. The Court of Common Pleas overruled the objection and admitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>writing. The defendant then offered the record of the judgment in the suit of James Clark against Ephraim Apple-gate, under which the sale of the goods to the plaintiff had been made, in order to shew that the judgment was void, being a judgment by confession, without process, and without affidavit. The plaintiff Objected to the admission of this \u25a0evidence, and the court sustained the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The defendant then offered to prove, that the goods were found in the possession of Ephraim Applegate; that he furnished his daughter Eliza the money to purchase the goods, and a variety *of facts, which went to shew that the sale was fraudulent. This evidence was objected to on the' part of the plaintiff, and the court sustained the \u25a0objection and rejected the evidence, and gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-6\"><em>Vroom, </em>for the plaintiff in certiorari,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVN\">Skillman, relied upon two reasons for the reversal of this judgment \u2014 1. Because the Court of Common Pleas rejected proper and \u25a0competent evidence, to wit: a copy of the judgment of \u25a0James Clark against Ephraim Applegate, by virtue of which .the property was sold. 2 <em>South. </em>479.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">2. Because the said court would not permit the defendant to give evidence that the said sale was fraudulent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b86-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A-f\">Take a reversal.
