Surveyors had been appointed, who laid out a road, and made their return to this court\". Against the recording this return, a <em>caveat </em>was entered, and\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-11\"><em>Vroom, </em>now moved to set aside the proceedings, because the application, as contained in the petition, was too indefi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>nite; it was made in the alternative to lay out a road either in one place or another place, stating two distinct routes. This, he contended, could not be done. See <em>Rev. Laws, </em>615, <em>see. </em>2.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-5\"><em>Hartwell </em>$ <em>Southard, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATF\">said there was no reason why two different routes might not be put in the same application. That the same petitioners might apply for different roads at the same time, and therefore, with the same propriety, might the same petition point out as many different routes as the petitioners might think eligible for a road. Besides, this objection, if it *availed anything, ought to have been made upon tho application to lay out the road, and was too late now.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b55-6\">Kiekpateick, O. J.</author>\n<p id=\"APP\">There is an error in the petition. The petitioners are not to designate to the surveyors the route they are to run. They are to designate only certain points, otherwise they may, by their description, limit tho surveyors to a particular line, and prevent any variation from it.</p>\n<author id=\"b55-7\">Bossell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARuS\">thought that the description of the route was a necessary part of the application.</p>\n<author id=\"b55-8\">Foed, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">Though an application may be made for two or three distinct roads in the same application, there is nothing in the statute which authorizes the application for <em>one </em>road, to be laid out in one or another of two designated routes.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Proceedings set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
