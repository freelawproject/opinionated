A <em>mandamus </em>will not lie to compel the Court of Common Pleas to receive a defendant\u2019s plea.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\"><em>White </em>applied to the court for a <em>mandamus, </em>to be directed to the Common Pleas of Cumberland, to compel them to receive the defendant\u2019s plea of justification; and stated, as the ground of his application, that an action of trespass had been commenced against the defendant, to-which he had pleaded \u2014 1. The general issue; and \u2014 2. A justification. That the plaintiff\u2019s attorney declined replying to the plea of' justification, but gave notice to the defendant\u2019s attorney, that he would apply to the Court of Common Pleas to strike out the said plea; which, upon motion, the court ordered accordingly'.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">He contended \u2014 1. That the Court of Common Pleas were-wrong in ordering the plea to be struck out; that the only proper course for a party to pursue, when he thinks a plea frivolous, was, to take judgment as if there was no plea, or reply, or demurrer to it, and that he could not apply to the court to strike it out; because, if the plea was struck out, the defendant could have no remedy by writ of error, anu no mode of bringing the question before a higher court for revision, and cited 3 <em>John. </em>547.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">2. That a <em>mandamus </em>was the proper remedy in this case. 4 <em>Bae.

That if a <em>mandamus </em>was the proper writ, yet the proceedings taken by the court below wore right. The case cited from <em>Johnson\u2019s Reports </em>only proved that the plaintiff might demur to a frivolous plea, or treat it as a nullity. If he may treat it as a nullity, <em>a fortiori, </em>may he apply to the court for that purpose, and obtain their order to strike it out.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b205-6\">KmK.PATB.iOK:, O.

It is right and proper that they should possess the power, in order to prevent their records from being unneessarily encumbered.
