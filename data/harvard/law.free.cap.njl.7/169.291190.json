Stockton,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD_W\">in reply, said, that the great object of this statute was to get these corporations into court; until this .statute, there was no way of bringing them into court if their officers chose to keep out of the reach of the sheriff. But it was evident, *in this case, that all the purposes of this act had been answered for here; the corporation had counsel in court to object to the proceedings; but no one had a right to object to any motion until he was regularly in court. The court would first compel him to enter an appearance before they would listen to him. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>error will be cured by the entry of the appearance, it is such a one as ought to be cured, and the court would order an appearance for the very purpose of curing it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b214-13\"> Note. \u2014 This case overruled in <em>Skillman </em>v. <em>Coolbaugh, </em>4 <em>Halst. </em>246.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam,.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ANx\">We think that \u00e1 person has no right to come into court and make an argument without entering an appearance; because what is he? Oan the crier of the-court or a bystander come in and make an argument before the court? It must appear, by the record, that the person making the objection is either the attorney or party, or some\u2022way connected with the cause : therefore the court refuse to hear any objection to <em>Mr. White\u2019s </em>motion until an appearance is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>Ewing </em>entered his appearance, and then said, that as an appearance was now entered, there was no necessity for Mr, <em>White\u2019s </em>motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
