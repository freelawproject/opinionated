Latos </em>685) by William Warwick against Abraham Matlack. The bond upon which the judgment had been entered was dated the 22d of January, 1821, and conditioned for the payment of $1,400, in three years from the date thereof, with interest annually. The affidavit, which was made by the plaintiff at the time of confessing the judgment, in pursuance of the directions of the fifth section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the act, stated, that the true consideration of the bond was for lands sold, and that the debt was jusrly due and owing. The warrant of attorney authorized the confession of the judgment for the amount of the penalty of the bond, and was drawn in the usual form. The judgment was entered for the penalty of bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">* <em>Wall, </em>upon the behalf of Mahlon Lewis, (who, he said, was a purchaser without notice of the judgment of certain lands upon which it operates as a lien,) now moved to set this judgment aside, because it had been entered before' the debt became duo. The bond bearing date on the 22d January, 1822, and having three years to run, and the judgment being entered on the 15th of May, 1822, was long before the day of payment mentioned in the condition of the bond, and therefore erroneous. The words of the first section of the statute were, \u201c that it should be lawful for the obligee, at any time after the day of payment mentioned in said bond or obligation, to apply to a justice of Supreme-Court,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>And the fifth section of the statute required that the plaintiff should produce, at the time of confessing such judgment, to the court or judge before whom such judgment should be confessed, an affidavit, stating that the debt for which judgment is confessed, is justly <em>due </em>and1 <em>owing. </em>Whatever might have been the practice at common law, he apprehended that under this act of the legislature a judgment could not be entered until after the day of payment mentioned in the bond.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-6\">Ewing, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHN\">The only question is, whether the day of payment mentioned in the condition of the bond has passed ? The bond is conditioned for the payment of $1400-in three years, with interest annually. At the end of one year the interest became duo, and if it was not paid at the day, the penalty of the bond became forfeited. The debt then, in point of law, became due, and judgment might be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>entered for the penalty, on failure of payment of the interest. In all these cases, where money is to be paid by instalments, the course is, upon the failure of payment of any instalment, to take judgment for the whole penalty, and to issue execution for the instalment. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Fouchet, </em>2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>706. In the present case, although the judgment was taken for the penalty, yet the execution was issued only for the interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">The fifth section of the act was merely meant to place a -check -upon the conscience of the party, and to provide against the entering of improper and fraudulent judgments. But here the money was legally due, although the time of payment of the whole of it had not arrived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-6\"><em>Wall, </em>in reply, said, that this case was not at all affected \u25a0by the one read from <em>Blackstone, </em>for our statute contemplated only *a default in the payment of the money mentioned in this obligation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b212-7\">Kirkpatrick, O.
