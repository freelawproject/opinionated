The single question therefore is, whether an account composed of different items can be legally proved by the plaintiff\u2019s book, so as to charge the defendant with money lent ? It is not contended, that testimony of this kind is conclusive, or entirely free from objection, but that when transactions are proved to have taken place between tho parties in the way of business, the parties are in the habit of entering every item in the book, and not being aware that different kinds of testimony will be required to prove that goods were purchased, work performed, or money lent, they enter them all in the same manner. There does not appear any particular ground upon which evidence of this kind can be objected <em>to </em>in this instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-8\">The general rule of law relating to this description of evidence is laid down in 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>388, 369, hut no exception of this kind is pointed out or alluded to. Nor is any stated in <em>Trials per Pais </em>455, 456, 457, where the decisions are collected, or in <em>Bull. N. P. </em>305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-9\">It is well known to be the uniform custom in this state, to admit this species of evidence, and no distinction of the kind now taken was ever before urged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>Maddox, (Salk. </em>690,) <em>Holt </em>said, that the proof of the handwriting of a deceased servant, by whom the entries were made, was as good as the proof of a witness\u2019 hand to an obligation; and the same evidence was admitted, as equally effective, in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Torrington, (Salk. </em>285).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ADKq\">*Boudinot, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUW-\">A man\u2019s own books are not evidence of money lent, not being in the usual course of business.</p>\n<author id=\"b424-6\">Kirkpatrick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_gG\">The rule is, that shop-books are evidence in the course of business, but not of money lent.</p>\n<author id=\"b424-7\">Kinsey, G. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AESW\">When a book contains various charges, though some of the items are for money lent, it is usual to suffer it to go to the jury. In this case we are somewhat in the dark, for want of a transcript of the account, which has not been transmitted by the justice. You may take a rule to have it brought up.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">On a subsequent day, the transcript having been produced, judgment was affirmed <em>una voce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-13\"> See the American cases on the subject of the admission of the party\u2019s books in evidence collected. 2 <em>Bac.
