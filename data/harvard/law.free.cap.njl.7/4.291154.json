(See 1 <em>Hals. </em>169.) The attorney for Hopewell made out his bill of costs, and inserted therein the same charges for attorney\u2019s fees in the Sessions and in the Supreme Court, as are allowed, in all civil cases, by the statute regulating fees, <em>{Bem.

He had examined the bill of costs on file from 1782 to 1818, and could find but two bills of costs in pauper cases, (and the reason, he presumed, was that the attorney did not file his bill, unless it was necessary to issue execution); but both those bills contained the same charges as the present bill; the one was in the case of the <em>Township of Trenton </em>v. <em>Maidenhead, </em>and the other <em>Northampton </em>v. <em>Stafford. </em>The words of the act are, <em>\u201c </em>reasonable expenses,\u201d and under these words reasonable counsel fees have been allowed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b16-6\">Eord, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">The practice in the Sessions has been to allow no taxed costs, according to the items of the fee bill. But fees have been allowed the attorney as counsel, and counsel fees have been allowed besides.</p>\n<author id=\"b16-7\">Kirkpatrick, O. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">I do not think that the court could be governed by a more <em>reasonable </em>rule than the fee bill. <em>Rev Laws </em>481.
