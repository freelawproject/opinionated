He argues that: (1) his sentence is unreasonable because the district court (a) improperly considered the disparity between the sentence Andre could receive in federal court versus state court, and (b) the district court failed to give adequate consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (2) the district court erred in denying his request for a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-21\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first must \u201censure that the district coui\u2019t committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After we determine that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the district court bases the sentence on impermissible factors or fails to consider pertinent 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191-92 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of the district court, and [this Court] will not substitute [its] judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Since we review the totality of the circumstances, a district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 n. 8; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in Section 3553 is sufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The appellant has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. While a sentence within the United States Sentencing Guidelines range (\u201cGuideline\u201d) is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\n<em>A. Andre\u2019s State and Federal Sentence Comparison Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Andre argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court gave undue weight to the sentence he could have received in state court while discussing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). In support of his argument, Andre cites to our opinion in <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>132 F.3d 1421 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (holding that the district court did not err when it \u201crefused to depart from Searcy\u2019s applicable [G]uidelines range on the basis of the punishment that would be imposed in state court\u201d). <em>Searcy </em>however, does not specifically prohibit a district court from simply mentioning a state court sentence. <em>See id. </em>We have not held that any reference to a state court sentence is completely forbidden. Additionally, the record does not suggest that the district court imposed a sentence based on state court requirements. Rather, the record reflects that Andre\u2019s sentence was based on the large quantity of cocaine involved, Andre\u2019s \u201csupervisory responsibility\u201d over another drug smuggler\u2019s cocaine, Dwayne Nash (\u201cNash\u201d), and the fact that Andre had \u201cobstructed justice.\u201d Tr. 80-81. Therefore, Andre has failed to establish that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\n<em>B. Andre\u2019s Section 3553(a)(6) Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Andre argues that the district court failed to adequately consider the disparity between his sentence and Nash\u2019s sentence. He argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that because it undisputed that Nash and Andre were convicted of the exact same crime, the district court erred when it imposed a more harsh sentence on Andre than Nash.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), one of the factors the sentencing court must consider is the \u201cneed to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Because the \u201cavoidance of unwarranted [sentencing] disparities was clearly considered by the Sentencing Commission when setting the Guidelines ranges,\u201d a district court necessarily gives weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities when it correctly calculates and carefully reviews the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 54, 128 S.Ct. at 599. \u201cThere is no unwarranted disparity when the sentence the cooperating defendant receives is substantially shorter\u201d than sentence of a defendant who does not provide assistance to the government. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">The district court accurately determined the applicable Guidelines range, and sentenced Andre within that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">Next, we consider whether Andre\u2019s sentence is reasonable. After review, the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ord does not support Andre\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable in comparison with Nash under 3553(a)(6). In light Section 3553(a)(6), the district court expressly found that Andre and Nash are not similar, but exemplified different conduct because Nash provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the government during the investigation. Tr. 79-80. Whereas Nash cooperated with the government and helped law enforcement build the case against Andre, the district court noted that Andre did not provide any assistance to the government. In consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a)(6) factor, the district court articulated the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">there are differences between Mr. Nash and Mr. Andre. Mr. Nash did perform substantial assistance. But for his naming Mr. Andre as a mule on the plane, the [government very well may not have charged Mr. Andre, may not have held onto him long enough for the surveillance photos and the janitors to come up with other evidence that made the ease against Mr. Andre overwhelming. Tr. 79-80.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the transcript reflects that the government explained that without Nash\u2019s cooperation, it \u201cwould never have arrested Mr. Andre because he had dumped all of the cocaine\u201d that he was carrying into the trash. Doe. 44 at 14. Because Nash and Andre did not engage in similar conduct, Andre has failed to show that there is a true disparity. The record illustrates that the district court specifically relied upon these differences in imposing a higher sentence upon Andre. Indeed, Andre\u2019s within-range sentence is expected to be reasonable, and Andre has failed to show that it was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Accordingly, we find that the district court gave adequate consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and any sentencing disparity that resulted between Nash\u2019s and Andre\u2019s sentences was not unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). \u00a7 3B1.2 of the Guidelines, if a defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, a two-level reduction applies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). The defendant bears the burden of proving a mitigating role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. A final determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is the only specific factual finding that a district court is required to make. <em>Id. </em>at 940. Notwithstanding our deference to the district court\u2019s discretion, the district court\u2019s ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense should be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable at sentencing, and (2) his role compared to that of other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940, 945. Relevant conduct is the conduct that was used to determine the base offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Andre argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a minor role reduction. A review of the record illustrates that the district court did not commit clear error when it concluded that Andre played more of a role than Nash in a common plan or scheme to smuggle 8 kilograms of cocaine into the United States from Haiti. Tr. 75-77. The district court particularly noted that it believed \u201cMr. Andre\u2019s role was a little more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>than a typical mule.\u201d Tr. 77. Subsequently, it overruled Andre\u2019s objection to a lack of a minor role reduction. Tr. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying Andre\u2019s request for a minor role reduction because it found that Andre had a supervisory role over Nash.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Andre has failed to meet his burden to show that his within-range sentence was unreasonable, and the district court did not clearly err in failing to apply a minor role reduction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
