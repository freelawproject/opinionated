INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The immigration judge found that Poly-carpe failed to prove that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground or a probability of future persecution or torture if he returns to Haiti, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that decision without opinion. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-22\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Polycarpe did not suffer past persecution on account of his political opinion. After Polycarpe and 300 members of his village stole building supplies from government trucks, the government issued a warrant for his arrest. Prosecution for a crime does not constitute persecution unless the prosecution is based on a protected ground and the punishment is sufficiently extreme to constitute persecution. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>445 F.3d 1311, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2006). Prosecution is not a disproportionate punishment for theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-23\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Polycarpe would not be singled out for mistreatment on account of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>political beliefs if he returned to Haiti. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Polycarpe argues that members of Lavalas \u201ccame shooting and looking\u201d for him and the government cannot protect him from mob violence, but Poly-carpe evaded arrest with the assistance of a friend who was a member of Lavalas. Polycarpe\u2019s concerns about widespread lawlessness do not establish a fear of persecution on account of protected ground. Polycarpe\u2019s wife and children have relocated within Haiti without incident. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We DENY Polycarpe\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
