Alb\u00edn, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office ND/AL, Joyce White Vance, Birmingham, AL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b97-23\">Before TJOFLAT, BARKETT and WILSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-24\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">Charles Eugene Knight appeals the sentences resulting from his conviction for possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (count one), possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae (count two), and possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (count three).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-26\">Although Knight first argues that the district court erroneously denied his post-conviction motion under Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Criminal Procedure 35(a) to correct his sentence, we have no jurisdiction to consider this claim under the facts of this case. See <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must dismiss Knight\u2019s claim pertaining to the denial of his Rule 35(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Knight also argues that the oral pronouncement of the sentences by the district court and the written judgment of sentence were unlawfully inconsistent, ambiguous, vague, and uncertain. We do not find reversible error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">At sentencing, the Judge orally stated: I specifically find that ... the three federal sentences that I\u2019ve given you are to run consecutive to any other state sentence <em>or any other sentence out there </em>.... [Y]ou may have state sentences that you might either be serving[,] or I don\u2019t know what time you are going to get for <em>anything else that might be up here, </em>if anything, but it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I am ordering it [to] run <em>consecutive to all those times.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Doc. 52 at 17 (emphasis added). The written judgment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u201cThis sentence shall run consecutively to sentences imposed in Jefferson County Alabama cases DC02-634, DC02-1018, CC05^4816, and <em>any other sentences in state comt.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Doc. 42 at 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Knight argues that his sentence is ambiguous because \u201cany other sentence\u201d could refer to state or federal sentences, whether previously imposed, pending, or to be imposed in the future. In considering the totality of this record, we find no inconsistency or ambiguity. Upon questioning from Knight regarding the relationship between the federal sentence and Knight\u2019s existing state sentence, the judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">I don\u2019t intend for it to being running until he gets back to federal custody.... I have ordered it to run consecutive to his state sentence.... I have no control over state judges, what they do as far as running any time concurrent with my time, but I am not running my time concurrent with their time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">Doc. 52 at 19-20. After more colloquy on the same issue, the judge again repeated that the federal sentences would \u201crun consecutive to state time, not concurrent to state time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. This record makes clear that the district judge intended the federal sentences he imposed to run consecutive to <em>state </em>sentences. Knight\u2019s sentence was therefore neither vague, ambiguous, nor uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-10\">. Knight followed the same erroneous procedure as did the defendant in <em>Cartright: </em>he filed his appeal and his Rule 35(a) motion on the same day. He then neglected to amend (or file anew) his notice of appeal to include the order denying his motion. Knight has therefore never appealed the denial of his Rule 35(a) motion, and therefore we have no jurisdiction over this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
