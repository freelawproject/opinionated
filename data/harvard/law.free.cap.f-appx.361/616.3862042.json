The Government moves for summary affirmance, arguing that Williams was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced not under the crack guidelines but as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Because Williams\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Williams argues that the district court should have the authority pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his term of imprisonment notwithstanding his status as a career offender in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The argument is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2009). Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a Guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Williams concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Doublin </em>but seeks to preserve the argument for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summaiy affirmance is GRANTED, and the appeal is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
