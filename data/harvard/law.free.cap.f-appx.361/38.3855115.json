The district court found Dean\u2019s petition to be untimely under the one-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). After review, we vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>district court\u2019s dismissal of Dean\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">A. 2002 State Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">On November 16, 2001, a Florida jury found Dean guilty of two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, one count of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, and one count of fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer with lights and siren activated. The Florida circuit court sentenced Dean to life imprisonment. Dean appealed his convictions and sentence to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal, which summarily affirmed on November 19, 2002, 833 So.2d 152. The ninety-day period for Dean to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court expired February 17, 2003. Without a tolling event, Dean\u2019s time for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition expired on February 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">B. State Collateral Rule 3.800(a) Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">This appeal concerns only Dean\u2019s Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a) \u201cmotion to correct illegal sentence\u201d and whether it tolled the statute of limitations for filing Dean\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dean avers he put his Rule 3.800(a) motion in the hands of prison officials for mailing to the Florida circuit court on June 24, 2003. Dean has filed a copy of the motion that contains a certificate of service signed by Dean and dated June 24, 2003, in which Dean declared under penalty of perjury \u201cthat this motion to correct illegal sentence was delivered to jail officials for mailing on June 24th, 2003.\u201d The Rule 3.800(a) motion does not contain a prison mail stamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Under Florida\u2019s inmate \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d Florida courts \u201cwill presume that a legal document submitted by an inmate is timely filed <em>if it contains a certificate of service showing that the pleading was placed in the hands of prison or jail officials for mailing on a particular date, </em>if ... the pleading would be timely filed if it had been received and file-stamped by the Court on that particular date.\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>761 So.2d 324, 326 (Fla.2000) (emphasis added). Once the inmate meets his burden, the presumption of timely filing \u201cshift[s] the burden to the State to prove that the document was not timely placed in prison officials\u2019 hands for mailing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to Florida\u2019s mailbox rule, Dean contends his Rule 3.800(a) motion should be deemed filed as of June 24, 2003. <em>See Griffin v. Sistuenck, </em>816 So.2d 600, 601 (Fla.2002) (\u201cUnder the mailbox rule, a notice is deemed filed when it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">During 2003 to 2006, there was no ruling on Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion that he avers he gave to prison officials on June 24, 2003. Dean has filed copies of three \u201cletters of inquiry,\u201d dated August 14, 2003; October 5, 2004; and August 28, 2006, that Dean allegedly sent to the Florida circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>court to inquire as to the status of his Rule 3.800(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Ultimately, on September 29, 2006, Dean filed in the Florida circuit court a pleading entitled \u201cExpress and Specific Demand for Performance.\u201d In this pleading, Dean requested that the Florida circuit court rule on his pending Rule 3.800(a) motion to correct illegal sentence. Dean alleged that his Rule 3.800(a) motion was deemed filed on June 24, 2003 pursuant to Florida\u2019s mailbox rule, and that more than three years had passed without any ruling on the motion. Dean attached a copy of the Rule 3.800(a) motion, which contained the June 24, 2003 certificate of service, to his pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On November 1, 2006, the Florida circuit court issued an order striking Dean\u2019s \u201cExpress and Specific Demand for Performance\u201d because \u201cneither the case files nor the Clerk\u2019s computer contains any indication that Defendant ever filed such a [Rule 3.800(a) ] motion\u201d and \u201cthere are currently no pending matters before the Court for which Defendant\u2019s present demand could properly be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On November 13, 2006, Dean moved the Florida circuit court to accept his Rule 3.800(a) motion <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of June 24, 2003. Dean again argued that the certificate of service on his Rule 3.800(a) motion established a filing date of June 24, 2003, pursuant to Florida\u2019s mailbox rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">On December 18, 2006, the Florida circuit court \u2014 without ordering or receiving a response from the State \u2014 denied Dean\u2019s motion to accept his Rule 3.800(a) motion, which was <em>actually received by the court </em>only on November 22, 2006, as filed with the court <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of June 24, 2003. The Florida circuit court concluded that because Rule 3.800(a) motions \u201care not subject to any time constraints, and may even be filed many years after the judgment and sentence becomes final, the Court accepts Defendant\u2019s Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence, the instant Motion, as properly filed November 22, 2006\u201d with the court. The Florida circuit court pointed out that there was \u201cno date stamp from any corrections facility indicating the date it was provided to corrections officials for mailing,\u201d and that the \u201conly date the motion contains is Defendant\u2019s handwritten date.\u201d The Florida circuit court\u2019s order made no mention of Florida\u2019s mailbox rule, which focuses on the certificate of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">After accepting Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion as properly filed on November 22, 2006 with the court, the Florida circuit court then turned to the merits of Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion. The Florida circuit court denied the Rule 3.800(a) motion on the merits. Dean appealed, and on March 20, 2007, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal summarily affirmed. <em>Dean v. State, </em>951 So.2d 853 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007) (table). The mandate issued on May 21, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">C. Federal Habeas Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">On September 7, 2007, Dean filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida a \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The State moved to dismiss Dean\u2019s petition as barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s one-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dean\u2019s response asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d), </em>his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Rule 3.800(a) motion should be deemed \u201cproperly filed\u201d on June 24, 2003 under the Florida mailbox rule, and that it therefore tolled the federal one-year statute of limitations. Dean also filed his three letters to the Florida circuit court inquiring about the status of his Rule 3.800(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The district court concluded that Dean\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely because it was filed in 2007 \u2014 after the limitations period expired on February 17, 2004 \u2014 and Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion did not toll the limitations period. As to the latter finding, the district court relied both on the Florida circuit court\u2019s refusal to file Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion <em>nunc 'pro tunc </em>as of June 24, 2003, as well as what it found to be a lack of diligence by Dean in following up on the status of his Rule 3.800(a) motion:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">[Gjiven the state court\u2019s explicit finding that Petitioner\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was not filed until November of 2006 and the circumstances surrounding Petitioner\u2019s alleged delivery of his Rule 3.800(a) motion to prison officials, including his lack of diligence in following up on the status of the motion, the Court concludes that Petitioner\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d on June 24, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The district court dismissed Dean\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition with prejudice. This Court granted Dean a certificate of appealability as to \u201c[wjhether the district court erred by finding that Dean\u2019s petition for a writ of habe-as corpus was untimely.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) established a one-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas corpus petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 410, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 1810, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). This one-year period begins on the latest of four dates. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The one that applies here is \u201cthe date on which the judgment [being challenged] became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). However, \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). But once the limitations period expires, no state collateral proceedings filed thereafter will toll the statute of limitations, because there is no longer anything left to toll. <em>Sibley v. Culliver, </em>377 F.3d 1196, 1204 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The parties agree that the AEDPA limitations period began to run for Dean on February 17, 2003. Thus, unless the period was tolled, it expired on February 17, 2004. The parties do not dispute that Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion qualifies as an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The issue is whether, <em>for purposes of \u00a7 2244.(d)(2)\u2019s calculations, </em>Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was \u201cproperly filed\u201d on June 24, 2003 or November 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>2006. <em>See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). If the </em>former date applies, then Dean\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was timely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the latter date applies, Dean\u2019s \u00a7 2254 is barred by AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">In determining whether \u2014 or when \u2014 a state court pleading was \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), we look to state procedural rules. <em>Wade v. Battle, </em>379 F.3d 1254, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 364, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000), the Supreme Court stated that \u201can application is <em>\u2018properly filed </em>\u2019 when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Under Florida law, there is no time limit for filing Rule 3.800(a) motions. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.800(a) (providing that, once the time for filing a Rule 3.800(b)(1) motion to correct sentencing error has expired, a party may file a Rule 3.800(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence \u201cat any time\u201d). And the Florida courts accepted and ruled on the merits of Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion. Thus, there is no question that Dean\u2019s motion was properly filed under Florida law. In this case, the question is what date of filing should this Court use for purposes of applying AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations. More specifically, should we apply Florida\u2019s mailbox rule and use the June 24, 2003 date that is on the certificate of service and on which Dean avers he gave his Rule 3.800(a) motion to prison officials, or should we use the November 22, 2006 date based on the Florida circuit court\u2019s refusal to grant Dean <em>nunc pro tunc </em>status and accept his Rule 3.800(a) motion as received <em>by the court </em>on June 24, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Here, according to Florida\u2019s mailbox rule, Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) is presumed to be timely filed as of June 24, 2003, because Dean\u2019s motion \u201ccontain[ed] a certificate of service showing that the pleading was placed in the hands of prison or jail officials for mailing on [June 24, 2003], [and] the pleading would be timely filed if it had been received and file-stamped by the Court on that particular date.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>761 So.2d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The Florida circuit court\u2019s order never mentioned the mailbox rule, nor did it have to. It was not necessary for the Florida circuit court to address the mailbox rule or to grant Dean <em>nunc pro tunc </em>acceptance of his Rule 3.800(a) motion because for purposes of the state court proceeding, Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was timely even if received by the court only on November 22, 2006. But none of that changes the fact that for purposes of applying \u00a7 2244(d)(2) statutory tolling, where the Florida mailbox rule does come into play, Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion is presumed to have been properly filed as of June 24, 2003.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The State argues that the Florida circuit court made a factual finding that Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was not filed until November 22, 2006, that this factual finding is presumed correct, and that Dean has not rebutted this finding with clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (stating that \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct\u201d and the petitioner has \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence\u201d). The State\u2019s characterization of the Florida circuit court\u2019s order is incorrect. The Florida circuit court made no factual finding. Instead, it merely reached the legal conclusion that Dean was not entitled to <em>nunc pro tunc </em>acceptance of his Rule 3.800(a) motion. As the Florida circuit court stated, \u201cDefendant seeks to have the Court accept his motion to correct illegal sentence as filed June 24, 2003. This, the Court cannot do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">More importantly, this is not a case where the state court refused to consider the petitioner\u2019s state collateral petition, either because of untimeliness or any other reason. The Florida circuit court, after stating that it would not accord Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion <em>nunc pro tunc </em>status, considered and denied the Rule 3.800(a) motion on the merits. Again, whether Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was filed on June 23, 2004 or November 22, 2006 did not matter, as the Florida circuit court noted in its order denying Dean\u2019s motion. In sum, while Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was properly filed as a Rule 3.800(a) motion on November 22, 2006 because no Florida statute of limitations applied, it was also properly filed as of June 24, 2003 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d) because of Florida\u2019s mailbox rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dean\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Upon remand, the State should be given the opportunity, if it wishes, to try to overcome the presumption that Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was timely filed as of June 24, 2003 by showing that the motion was not timely placed into prison officials\u2019 hands for mailing on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">. Dean filed two other state post-conviction motions that do not affect the timeliness of Dean\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. On December 1, 2004, Dean filed in the Florida circuit court a Rule 3.850 motion. The Florida circuit court denied Dean's Rule 3.850 motion on March 3, 2006, and denied Dean's motion for rehearing on March 22, 2006. Dean appealed, and on August 8, 2006, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">On December 6, 2004, Dean also filed in the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal a habeas corpus petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel during his direct appeal. On February 4, 2005, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal summarily denied the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">. The State argued that the one-year limitations period expired on February 17, 2004, one year after Dean's judgment became final by the expiration of the time for seeking cer-tiorari review; that Dean\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion did not toll the statute of limitations because it was filed after the limitations period expired; and that Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion did not toll the statute of limitations because the Florida circuit court determined it was filed on November 22, 2006 instead of June 24, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\">. The district court acknowledged that the diligence requirement it applied to Dean was borrowed from a case, <em>Allen v. Culliver, </em>471 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir.2006), that applied the <em>federal </em>mailbox rule, not Florida\u2019s, and that \"it is not clear whether <em>Allen </em>is applicable in determining whether a legal document was filed in a state court.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b67-12\">. Our review is <em>de novo. See Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000) (\"We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's determination that the petition for federal habeas corpus relief was time-barred under section 2244(d).\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b68-6\">. Dean\u2019s convictions became final on February 17, 2003. If Dean's Rule 3.800(a) motion was properly filed as of June 24, 2003, then 127 days of Dean's AEDPA limitations period had run until it was tolled, and the tolling continued until May 21, 2007, the date the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal issued its mandate following its affirmance of the Florida circuit court's denial of Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion. <em>See Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that, in Florida, postconviction motions remain pending for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) until issuance of mandate by Florida appellate court). From May 21, 2007 until Dean filed his \u00a7 2254 petition on September 7, 2007, another 109 days ran. Thus, if Dean\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion was properly filed on June 24, 2003, then only 236 days of Dean's limitations period ran between the date his convictions became final and the date he filed his \u00a7 2254 petition, which is well within the one-year limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b68-11\">. We also find that the district court\u2019s importation of a diligence requirement into the \u2018\u2018properly filed\u201d analysis, under these circumstances, is misplaced. Florida\u2019s mailbox rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>does not contain any diligence requirement and, as noted above, we look to state law in determining whether a pleading was \"properly Bled.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>379 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
