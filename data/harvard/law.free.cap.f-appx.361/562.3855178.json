He was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment and to thee years of supervised release. Delgado argues that the factual basis was insufficient to support his guilty plea to the charge of possession of a machine gun and that his plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea for clear error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o)(l), the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed a machine gun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the arraignment hearing Delgado admitted to the allegation set forth in Count Five of the indictment: that he \u201cknowingly possessed a machine gun\u201d on or about February 21, 2006. Delgado also stipulated to the truth of the facts contained in the factual resume which he acknowledged signing. The factual basis, which reflects that Delgado placed a machine gun in the trunk of his car, is sufficient to support all of the elements of the offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Delgado also asserts his guilty plea was involuntary because he was entrapped into receiving automatic weapons in exchange for marijuana or alternatively the product of sentence factor manipulation. However, the record establishes that Delgado\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the record shows that Delgado understood his plea agreement and he had no questions regarding the appeal waiver provision. As such, Delgado waived any right to assert a defense of entrapment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
