Lincoln General Insurance Co. (\u201cLincoln General\u201d), an insurance company, never received insurance premium payments from certain policyholders (the \u201cPolicyholders\u201d). AMGRO, Inc. (\u201cAMGRO\u201d), an insurance premium financing company, paid the Policyholders\u2019 premiums to David MacGregor Co. (\u201cMacGregor\u201d), the Policyholders\u2019 retail insurance broker, which retained its agreed upon commission and then sent the remaining funds to Northern Financial Group, Inc. (\u201cNorthern Financial\u201d), Lincoln General\u2019s wholesale insurance agent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the transactions. Under normal circumstances, Northern Financial would then have sent payment to Lincoln General. But the insurance premium payments never arrived at Lincoln General and this litigation ensued. Lincoln General, MacGregor, and MacGregor\u2019s risk management consultant, Mark Grossbard, now seek review of the District Court\u2019s determinations of several motions for summary judgment. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the District Court correctly decided the summary judgment motions and will affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) and we review its grant of summary judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise \u201cplenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Shuman ex rel. Shertzer v. Penn Manor Sch.

Northern Financial entered into an agreement with MacGregor whereby MacGregor would sell insurance on its behalf, and around February 2004, MacGregor began selling Lincoln General insurance for Northern Financial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In exchange for selling the insurance, MacGregor received a ten percent commission on premiums generated by its sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">MacGregor sold Lincoln General insurance to the Policyholders and AMGRO provided insurance premium financing for those transactions. Northern Financial issued insurance binders to the Policyholders and Lincoln General later issued the corresponding policies. MacGregor, as its agreement with Northern Financial provided, retained a ten percent commission on premiums generated by those sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">AMGRO\u2019s payments to MacGregor on behalf of the Policyholders were made through a Draft Authorization Agreement that permitted MacGregor to issue AMG-RO checks to itself to pay the Policyholders\u2019 insurance premiums. Under normal circumstances, MacGregor would draft payment to itself from AMGRO, subtract its ten percent commission, and then forward the remaining premium payment to Northern Financial. Northern Financial would then forward payment to Lincoln General. This was not what happened, however. Somewhere along the way, the premium payments disappeared and Lincoln General never received them. As a result, Lincoln General cancelled all the Policyholders\u2019 policies for non-payment of premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">After Lincoln General cancelled the policies, AMGRO sought a refund from Lincoln General for the premium payments it had made on behalf of the Policyholders. Lincoln General refused to refund any money to AMGRO because it never received the premium payments. This litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">On February 1, 2006, AMGRO filed suit against Lincoln General for its refusal to refund the premium payments AMGRO made on behalf of the Policyholders. On August 23, 2006, Lincoln General filed a third-party complaint against Grossbard and MacGregor alleging (1) tortious inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ference with contract, (2) unjust enrichment, and (3) civil conspiracy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">AMGRO moved for summary judgment on its claim against Lincoln General for the premium payments. That motion was granted and Lincoln General was ordered to return the premium payments and pay AMGRO a statutory penalty. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:290-4.1 (providing statutory penalty where insurer retains unearned premiums). Grossbard and MacGregor also moved for summary judgment on Lincoln General\u2019s claims of civil conspiracy against Grossbard, tortious interference with contract against MacGregor, and unjust enrichment against both Grossbard and MacGregor. The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of Grossbard on the civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment claims and in favor of MacGregor on the tortious interference with contract claim. It denied MacGre-gor\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Lincoln General\u2019s unjust enrichment claim. Shortly after the District Court decided the summary judgment motions, the parties entered into a Consent Order and Final Judgment (the \u201cConsent Order\u201d). In the Consent Order, the parties clarified the scope of their appeals and the amounts at stake in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Lincoln General appeals the statutory penalty awarded to AMGRO and the entry of summary judgment on its tortious interference with contract claim against MacGregor, and its unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy claims against Grossbard. MacGregor cross-appeals the denial of summary judgment on Lincoln General\u2019s unjust enrichment claim against it. Each of these issues will be discussed in ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">Lincoln General\u2019s first issue on appeal pertains to the statutory penalty awarded to AMGRO under N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:29C-4.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>under New Jersey law, Lincoln General must pay a penalty of five percent \u201cof the gross unearned premium,\u201d computed on a monthly basis for each month or part thereof past the final date on which the refund was due. <em>Id. </em>The District Court also looked to N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:16D-14(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for confirmation that New Jersey law places the obligation of returning unearned insurance premiums following a policy cancellation solely on the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Lincoln General raises three arguments against the statutory penalty: (1) that the two statutes, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:29C-4.1 and N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:16D-14, do not apply to AMGRO, (2) that AMGRO is equitably estopped from receiving the statutory penalty, and (3) that AMGRO would be unjustly enriched by the statutory penalty because it was not damaged by Lincoln General\u2019s failure to return the insurance premium payments. None of these arguments is availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Lincoln General argues that N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:290-4.1 is inapplicable because it only applies to premiums paid by the insured \u2014 not premiums paid by a premium financing company such as AMGRO. This argument fails. While the statute identifies \u201cthe insured\u201d as the entity permitted to seek statutory penalties from the insurer, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:29C-4.1, an insurance \u201cpremium finance company [may] step[ ] in[to] the shoes of the insured for all payments and setoffs[.]\u201d <em>Sheeran v. Sitren, </em>168 N.J.Super. 402, 403 A.2d 53, 58 (NJ.Super. Ct. Law Div.1979); <em>see also id. </em>at 61 (stating that \u201cunearned premiums ultimately belong to [the] insureds ... or those who stand in their shoes, such as [insurance premium] financing companies\u201d). Here, AMGRO contracted for the right to \u201cany and all unearned premiums ... which may become payable under the [Policyholders\u2019] policies\u201d in its financing agreements with the Policyholders. <em>See, e.g., </em>Qualified Transportation &amp; Logistics Premium Finance Agreement \u00b6 1 (assigning AMGRO \u201cany and all unearned premiums\u201d). Thus, AMGRO, standing in the shoes of the Policyholders, was properly permitted to seek the statutory penalty provided in N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:290-4.1. <em>Sheeran, </em>403 A.2d at 58; <em>see also id. </em>at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">According to Lincoln General, an interpretation of N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:290-4.1 that permits insurance premium finance companies to seek statutory penalties under that statute renders N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:16D-14(a) superfluous because those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>companies could always seek relief under N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:29C-4.1 as agents of the insured. This argument is beside the point. AMGRO\u2019s ability to stand in the shoes of the Policyholders stems not from a statutory interpretation of N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:290-4.1, but instead from the assignment of rights to the unearned premiums from the Policyholders to AMGRO. <em>See Sheeran, </em>403 A.2d at 58; <em>A.J. Armstrong Co. v. Janburt Embroidery Corp., </em>97 N.J.Super. 246, 234 A.2d 737, 743 (N.J.Super. Ct. Law Div.1967) (explaining that \u201cunder general principles of law of assignment, the assignee succeeds to all the rights of his assignor\u201d); <em>N.J. Higher Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Carlock, </em>247 N.J.Super. 471, 589 A.2d 671, 673 (N.J.Super. Ct. Law Div.1991) (same).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Lincoln General argues that AMG-RO should be equitably estopped from receiving statutory penalties because it enabled Northern Financial to carry out the insurance premium scam by failing to timely notify Lincoln General of its premium financing arrangements with the Policyholders and granting considerable authority to MacGregor to draft checks. According to Lincoln General\u2019s brief, AMGRO \u201cunjustifiably relied upon [Northern Financial] or failed to take the necessary precautions to avoid suffering from [Northern Financial\u2019s] bad acts.\u201d Thus, Lincoln General argues, AMGRO should be punished for its failure to \u201ctake the necessary precautions to avoid suffering damage as a result of the bad acts of another party of which it should [have] be[en] aware[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The doctrine of equitable estoppel is \u201cdesigned to prevent injustice[.]\u201d <em>Knorr v. Smeal, </em>178 N.J. 169, 836 A.2d 794, 799 (2003). Here, Lincoln General\u2019s agent, Northern Financial, profited from its fraudulent scheme at the expense of Lincoln General <em>and </em>AMGRO. Indeed, most of Lincoln General\u2019s accusations against AMGRO could also be leveled against itself. It, too, failed to sniff out Northern Financial\u2019s fraudulent scheme. In fact, Lincoln General set the fraud in motion by permitting Northern Financial to act as its agent. Under these circumstances, in that AMGRO was duped by a fraudulent scheme, we cannot say that estopping AMGRO\u2019s claim would prevent injustice. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the doctrine of equitable estoppel is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Lincoln General also argues that it need not reimburse AMGRO for the commissions that MacGregor kept from the sales of insurance policies to the Policyholders. This argument fails for two reasons. First, Lincoln General waived this argument in the Consent Order. It agreed that it \u201cw[ould] not appeal [the] part of the [District] Court\u2019s Opinion and Order concerning [its] obligation to pay AMGRO the unearned premiums for the policies at issue[.]\u201d Consent Order Background \u00b6 5; <em>see Keefe v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>203 F.3d 218, 222-23 (3d Cir.2000) (explaining waiver in the context of consent judgments). Lincoln General agreed to return the entire amount of the unearned premiums, not the unearned premiums less MacGregor\u2019s commissions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Second, even if this argument was not waived, the statute demands fall payment of \u201cgross unearned premiums\u201d by the insurer. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:29C-4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Lincoln General argues that the statutory penalty should not apply because AMGRO did not suffer damages from its failure to return the insurance premium payments. Awarding the statutory penalty, Lincoln General argues, would unjustly enrich AMGRO. The text of the statute belies Lincoln General\u2019s assertion that AMGRO must produce evidence of damages to avail itself of the statutory penalty. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:290-4.1 (stating that \u201cthe insurer <em>shall, </em>as a penalty, ... return to the insured an additional amount equal to 5% of the gross unearned premium computed on a monthly basis for each month or part thereof past the final date on which the refund was due\u201d) (emphasis added). The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in a statute \u201cnormally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion,\u201d <em>Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, </em>523 U.S. 26, 35, 118 S.Ct. 956, 140 L.Ed.2d 62 (1998) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Yungkau, </em>329 U.S. 482, 485, 67 S.Ct. 428, 91 L.Ed. 436 (1947)), and Lincoln General produces no compelling authority suggesting that this statute should be interpreted otherwise. Accordingly, Lincoln General\u2019s argument fails because the plain meaning of the statute does not support its interpretation. <em>Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981). In sum, Lincoln General\u2019s arguments against the statutory penalty award are unavailing and we conclude that the District Court properly awarded AMG-RO the statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Lincoln General challenges the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for MacGregor on Lincoln General\u2019s tor-tious interference with contract claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It asserts that MacGregor tortiously interfered with its contract with Northern Financial by issuing unauthorized temporary identification cards. According to Lincoln General, had MacGregor not issued those cards it would have quickly discovered that Northern Financial was not delivering insurance binders and premium payments to it in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Lincoln General has not shown evidence that MacGregor interfered with its contract with Northern Financial. As the District Court explained, \u201c[e]ven if MacGregor did[ ] as Lincoln General asserts[,] ... such conduct may constitute inappropriate or negligent business practices but it in no way \u2018interfered\u2019 with the contract between Northern Financial and Lincoln General.\u201d Moreover, in effect, Lincoln General seeks to hold MacGregor responsible for Northern Financial\u2019s nonpayment of premiums and for this reason, it must fail: \u201c[T]he rule of tortious interference was not meant to upset the rales governing the contractual relationship itself.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, </em>563 A.2d at 38. \u201cWhere a person interferes with the performance of his or her own contract, the liability is governed by principles of contract law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Lincoln General\u2019s allegations are essentially based on Northern Financial\u2019s non-payment of insurance premiums\u2014an issue that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cgoverned by the principles of contract law,\u201d not tort law. <em>Id. </em>In other words, Northern Financial was \u201cinterfering] with the performance of [its] own contract\u201d by engaging in its fraudulent scheme. <em>Id. </em>Even if MacGregor interfered with Lincoln General\u2019s contract with Northern Financial, its actions do not rise to the intentional infliction of harm \u201cwithout justification or excuse\u201d needed to show malice. <em>Velop, Inc., </em>693 A.2d at 926 (quoting <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, </em>563 A.2d at 39). Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that Lincoln General\u2019s tortious interference with contract claim cannot survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Lincoln General also appeals the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Grossbard on its unjust enrichment claim against him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It appears that Lincoln General is arguing that Grossbard was unjustly enriched both as an agent of Northern Financial and in his individual capacity. Under either theory, Lincoln General\u2019s claim fails to survive summary judgment. First, to the extent that Lincoln General\u2019s claim is based on Gross-bard\u2019s actions as a Northern Financial officer, any such claim would be governed by the express contract between Northern Financial and Lincoln General. <em>See C.B. Snyder Realty Co. v. Nat\u2019l Newark &amp; Essex Banking Co., </em>14 N.J. 146, 101 A.2d 544, 553 (1953); <em>Moser v. Milner Hotels, Inc., </em>6 N.J. 278, 78 A.2d 393, 393 (1951); <em>Winslow v. Corporate Express, Inc., </em>364 N.J.Super. 128, 834 A.2d 1037, 1046 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2003). \u201cIn light of this express contract, there is no basis ... for [Lincoln General] to pursue a ... claim for unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Winslow, </em>834 A.2d at 1046. As for an unjust enrichment claim against Grossbard in his individual capacity, after examining the record, and in light of Lincoln General\u2019s failure to identify evidence suggesting otherwise, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that Grossbard received no benefit from Lincoln General. Grossbard cannot be held liable for unjust enrichment when he received no benefit. <em>VRG Corp., </em>641 A.2d at 526. Thus, we agree with the District Court that summary judgment on this claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Lincoln General also appeals the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Grossbard on its civil conspiracy claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This claim fails to survive summary judgment because Lincoln General never sets forth any evidence showing that Grossbard and Pisacane entered into an \u201cagreement ... to inflict a wrong against ... another.\u201d <em>LoBiondo, </em>970 A.2d at 1029. \u201cAn unwitting party[, like Gross-bard,] may not be liable under a conspiracy theory.\u201d <em>Banco Popular N. Am. v. Gandi, </em>184 N.J. 161, 876 A.2d 253, 263 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>(2005). Grossbard\u2019s undisputed testimony shows that he had extremely limited interactions with Pisacane.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He had almost no knowledge of the day-to-day dealings between MacGregor and Northern Financial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, at best, Grossbard was an \u201cunwitting party\u201d to Northern Financial\u2019s fraudulent scheme. <em>See Banco Popular N. Am., </em>876 A.2d at 263. Lincoln General points to nothing in the record suggesting a conspiratorial agreement between Gross-bard and Pisacane. As such, we agree with the District Court that Lincoln General\u2019s conspiracy claim against Grossbard cannot survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Having disposed of Lincoln General\u2019s appeal, we now turn to MacGregor\u2019s cross-appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment on Lincoln General\u2019s unjust enrichment claim against it. MacGregor argues that it lacked a direct relationship with Lincoln General and therefore could not have been unjustly enriched. <em>See Callana v. Oakwood Park Homes Corp., </em>91 N.J.Super. 105, 219 A.2d 332, 335 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1966). But MacGregor\u2019s own Statement of Undisputed Material Facts filed in support of its motion for summary judgment states otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-17\">\u2022 MacGregor contacted Lincoln General directly when Northern Financial \u201cfailed to respond to [its] efforts to procure the final policy [for a Policyholder.]\u201d Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Mark Grossbard and Bancar Associates, Inc. d/b/a David MacGregor Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment \u00b6 107.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-18\">\u2022 MacGregor and Lincoln General directly communicated to resolve discrepancies in insurance coverage created by Northern Financial\u2019s actions. For example, on February 26, 2005, MacGregor wrote Lincoln General, outlining discrepancies in coverage between Northern Financial\u2019s binders purporting to provide Lincoln General insurance and Lincoln General\u2019s actual insurance policies. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 115. MacGregor asked Lincoln General to \u201chonor the binders issued by [Northern Financial].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMacGregor [also] ... sent a number of subsequent letters to [Lincoln General] concerning problems with [Northern Financial].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 117.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-19\">\u2022 Lincoln General directly contacted MacGregor to inform MacGregor that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>it had not received premium payments from Northern Financial. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 12 1. MacGregor responded by sending Lincoln General copies of its checks to Northern Financial. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 122.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u2022 Lincoln General notified MacGregor that it had cancelled several policies MacGregor procured for its clients through Northern Financial. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 123.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Given these facts, the relationship between Lincoln General and MacGregor was sufficient enough for the unjust enrichment claim against MacGregor to survive summary judgment. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Callano, </em>Lincoln General repeatedly communicated with MacGregor and both parties recognized that they were in some form of business relationship. <em>See Callano, </em>219 A.2d at 335. MacGregor expected the Lincoln General policies to be issued to its clients and Lincoln General expected to be paid for those policies. While both companies undoubtedly had relationships with Northern Financial, they also had a relationship with each other that could give rise to an objective expectation that MacGregor should return the commissions it earned in connection with Northern Financial\u2019s fraud. <em>See Insulation Contracting &amp; Supply v. Kravco, </em>209 N.J.Super. 367, 507 A.2d 754, 760 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1986). MacGregor\u2019s retention of commissions for sales of policies that were never delivered to the Policyholders could be viewed as the receipt of an unjust benefit. <em>See Callano, </em>219 A.2d at 334 (\u201cThe key words are <em>enrich </em>and <em>unjustly.\u201d) </em>(emphasis in original). Indeed, Lincoln General\u2019s agreement to return all unearned premiums to AMGRO, Consent Order Background \u00b6 5, makes MacGre-gor\u2019s retention of the commissions seem unjust. The amount Lincoln General has agreed to pay includes the commissions that MacGregor has retained. In other words, the Consent Order requires Lincoln General to reimburse AMGRO for the cash that MacGregor is retaining as commissions for sales of insurance policies that were never delivered. Any recovery Lincoln General would receive from MacGre-gor would merely offset the amount that it must already pay AMGRO. As such, we agree with the District Court and conclude that denial of summary judgment on this claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Lincoln General has failed to show that the statutory penalty awarded to AMGRO was improper. Except for the unjust enrichment claim against MacGregor, Lincoln General has also failed to identify genuine issues of material fact that would permit its claims against Grossbard and MacGregor to survive summary judgment. For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-17\">. Wholesale insurance agents do not sell directly to the public.

MacGregor's sales of Lincoln General insurance were made under this agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b368-5\">. Northern Financial and its CEO, Richard Pisacane, were also named as defendants in Lincoln General\u2019s third-party complaint. Lincoln General charged Northern Financial with breach of contract and unjust enrichment and Pisacane with fraud, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment. On August 8, 2005, Lincoln General had filed a similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania against Northern Financial, Pisacane, Gross-bard, and MacGregor. That complaint charged Northern Financial with breach of contract and Pisacane with fraud, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment. On May 25, 2006, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania entered default judgments against Northern Financial on the breach of contract claim and Pisacane on the fraud claim. On July 14, 2006, the Middle District of Pennsylvania action was transferred to the District of New Jersey and consolidated with the case now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">.
