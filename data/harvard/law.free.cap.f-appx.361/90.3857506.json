Upon review, we conclude Nieves abandoned her argument by failing to raise the issue in her appellate brief. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-17\">Nieves, a native and citizen of Venezuela, entered the United States in 2002. In 2004, she filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, alleging she was persecuted on account of her participation in the Democratic Action Party. She further alleged that she had been kidnaped and beaten by members of Venezuelan President Chavez\u2019s regime. After a hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied relief, finding that the asylum application was untimely and that Nieves was not entitled to withholding of removal or CAT relief. Nieves appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred in finding her application was untimely and that her credible testimony established past persecution. The BIA adopted the Id\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-18\">Instead of filing a petition for i\u2019eview in this court, Nieves filed a motion to reconsider. In her motion, Nieves asserted that the IJ erred in finding the application was untimely. She further reiterated that she established past persecution based on her credible testimony and that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA denied the motion. This petition for review followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-19\">\u2018We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). If a petitioner does not raise an argument in an opening brief before us, the argument is considered abandoned. <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). We have observed that a \u201cgeneral reference\u201d to a BIA action will not suffice to preserve an issue for appeal. <em>Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1330 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In her opening brief, Nieves argues the merits of her asylum and withholding claims and makes only a passing reference to the denial of the motion for reconsideration. Because Nieves has not raised a substantive argument regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider, she has abandoned any argument that the BIA erred. To the extent that she raises arguments on appeal that she raised in her motion to reconsider, those arguments merely reiterated issues that the BIA already had considered and rejected. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-13\">. Nieves family members Oswaldo Ibrahim Hurtado, Beriozka M. Hurtado, and Liubov N. Hurtado proceeded as derivative beneficiaries on her application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-14\">. Because Nieves did not file a petition for review within thirty days of the BIA\u2019s affir-manee of the IJ\u2019s removal order, the merits of the underlying order of removal are not properly before us. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Our review is limited to the BIA's denial of the motion for reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
