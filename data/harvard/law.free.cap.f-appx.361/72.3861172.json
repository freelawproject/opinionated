On appeal, Singleton argues that, given the facts of her case, which includes her <em>de minimis </em>involvement in an overall drug conspiracy, the district court erred when it sentenced her to a term of imprisonment, rather than probation. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-18\">We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-19\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c\u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not state on the record that it explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient\u201d under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Id. </em>When the district court imposes a within-guidelines sentence, it need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1191. Thus, we will reverse a procedurally proper sentence only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation omitted). A sentence within the guidelines range is ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">As an initial matter, and as noted by the government, Singleton is essentially challenging the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. Singleton has not shown, however, that her sentence is procedurally unreasonable. The district court did not err in calculating Singleton\u2019s applicable guideline range, and did not treat the guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Nor has Singleton shown that her sentence is substantively unreasonable. Before announcing her sentence, the court noted that it had considered the statements of the parties, the facts of the case, and the presentence investigation report, which contained the recommended, but not mandatory, guideline range, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court then sentenced her to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment, 24 months less than the recommended guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>line range. In explaining its reasoning for varying from the recommended sentence, the court observed that it had considered Singleton\u2019s minimal role in the offense, the sentences of her coconspirators, and the lack of benefit that she received as part of the conspiracy, unlike her co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">However, the district court also noted that it was \u201cnot naive enough to believe that [Singleton] did not willfully have a pretty good idea of what was going on in this case.\u201d Nonetheless, the court explained that a 36-month sentence reflected the seriousness of the offense, would promote respect for the law, would provide just punishment for Singleton, and would afford adequate deterrence for any further criminal conduct. Although a sentence of probation may have been available pursuant to the statute under which Singleton was convicted, there is no indication that the \u201cdistrict court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case,\u201d and Singleton\u2019s argument that she should have been sentenced to probation, rather than imprisonment, fails to demonstrate that her sentence was unreasonable. <em>See McBride, </em>511 F.3d at 1297-98. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-5\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
