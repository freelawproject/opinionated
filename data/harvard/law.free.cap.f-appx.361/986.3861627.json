Clark, appointed counsel for Ronald Mathis in this appeal of the denial of a motion for a reduced sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282(c)(2), has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant, because, in his opinion, the appeal is without merit. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s denial of Mathis\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
