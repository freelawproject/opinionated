The district court sentenced Villa to concurrent sentences of life and 240 months in prison, and in addition, ordered Villa to pay a $500,000 fine for each count. Following an unsuccessful direct appeal and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, Villa filed a motion requesting the district court to set a payment schedule for his fine. Villa now challenges the district court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Villa has filed an unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Segler, </em>37 F.3d 1131, 1136 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1990). Thus, he has appealed from the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion. <em>Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. Although the district court denied the motion, it should have dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>However, we can and do affirm on that basis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
