On September 29, 2006, he was released from custody and began serving his term of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2008, while on supervised release, appellant was arrested by the Orange County, Florida Sheriffs Office and charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of drugs. Due to the arrest, the district court issued a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest for violation of conditions of his supervised release and scheduled a revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">Meanwhile, a Middle District of Florida grand jury indicted appellant in one count for possession by a convicted felon of firearms and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) and (e)(1), and, as a consequence, the state offenses for which he had been arrested were dismissed. Appellant then moved the district court to continue his revocation hearing pending the resolution of the Middle District of Florida case. The court granted his motion. Appellant thereafter pled guilty to the Middle District of Florida indictment and was sentenced to prison for 180 months. The judgment provided that the term would \u201crun concurrent with the violations in the Northern District of Florida.\u201d The court subsequently reduced the sentence to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>suant to the government\u2019s Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">At his revocation hearing, appellant did not contest that he had violated conditions of his supervised release, and asked the district court to impose a sentence concurrent with the sentence he had received in the Middle District of Florida. The district court denied his request and sentenced him to a prison term of 60 months, to run consecutively to the 100 months\u2019 sentence imposed by the Middle District of Florida court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellant now appeals his 60 months\u2019 sentence, raising three issues: (1) the sentence he received in the Middle District of Florida bound the district court to impose a concurrent sentence; (2) the district court\u2019s statements during the revocation hearing suggest that the court, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), treated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) as mandatory; and (3) the conflict the two judgments have created will confuse the Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The first issue presented \u2014 whether one district court may require that a sentence it imposes run concurrently with a sentence yet to be imposed by a different federal district court \u2014 raises a pure question of law that we normally would review <em>de novo. See United States v. McDaniel, </em>338 F.3d 1287, 1288 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1505 (11th Cir.1993). The doctrine of invited error, however, applies \u201cwhen a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Under that \u201ccardinal rule of appellate review,\u201d a party that invites an error may not later challenge that error on appeal. <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201c[wjhere invited error exists, it precludes a court from invoking the plain error rule and reversing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">In this case, not only did appellant fail to object to the district court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence, but his attorney agreed with the court that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) directed the court to impose a consecutive sentence. In short, the invited error doctrine precludes our consideration of the first issue appellant raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">A district court commits <em>Booker </em>error if it applies the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (holding that a district court\u2019s treatment of the Guidelines as mandatory renders a sentence procedurally unreasonable). While U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) states that any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release be made consecutive, the statement is not binding. <em>See also United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWhile the district court is required to consider the policy statements [of Chapter 7], it is not bound by them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Here, despite making some ambiguous statements early in the revocation hearing, the district court explicitly clarified that it was not treating \u00a7 7B1.3(f) as mandatory. As a result, appellant\u2019s second issue fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">In light of what we have said in disposing of appellant\u2019s first two issues \u2014 that he will be serving his 60 months\u2019 sentence after completing his 100 months\u2019 sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>fence \u2014 the Bureau of Prisons should not be confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">. In 1997, the district court reduced appellant's prison term to 144 months due to his substantial assistance in the government\u2019s investigation and prosecution of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
