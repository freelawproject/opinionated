We agree with the BIA that he has not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, and we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Polanco, a longtime member of Colombia\u2019s Conservative Party, worked for a senator as a political organizer and also helped with President Uribe\u2019s election campaign. Early in 2002, FARC sent three written death threats to his home. Polanco initially paid no attention, but began to fear for his life after two further incidents in 2003 and 2004 when FARC guerrillas showed up at two different farms he owned. On each occasion, a truckload of armed men in FARC uniforms drove up and told the foreman they were looking for Polanco and intended to kill him. Polanco was not present at the time, and the men left without incident. No one ever attempted to carry out the threat, or even confronted Polanco in person. Nevertheless, Polanco left the country and entered the United States on a six-month tourist visa in October 2004. In July 2005 Polanco was arrested in Georgia when INS agents, who were looking for one of his roommates, checked his papers and found that his visa had expired. At that point, Polanco announced his intention to apply for political asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">The IJ denied Polanco\u2019s application both on the merits and on credibility grounds. The BIA disagreed with the credibility finding, but agreed that the threats Polan-co described did not rise to the level of persecution necessary to support an asylum claim. We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Since the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we accept Polanco\u2019s testimony as credible and review his claims on their merits. <em>See Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">The meaning of \u201cpersecution\u201d for asylum purposes is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). We review factual determinations by the BIA and the IJ under a substantial evidence test, and we will affirm their decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may not reverse unless we find that the record \u201cnot only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">To qualify for asylum, Polanco has the burden of presenting specific and credible evidence showing either (1) past persecution, or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of his political opinion. <em>See Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)-(b). Persecution is an \u201cextreme concept,\u201d requiring \u201cmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mere threats generally do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (threatening letter and phone calls were not persecution); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (menacing phone calls to applicant\u2019s home and office, and in-person threat to her brother, did not rise to level of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">On the other hand, threats may help support a finding of persecution when they are combined with physical injury. <em>See, e.g., De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1009-10 (11th Cir.2008) (persecution found where applicant received numerous threats, was dragged from her car, beaten, and kidnapped, and her groundskeeper was tortured and killed); <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257-58 (persecution found where applicant, who had disregarded threatening graffiti and phone calls, was pulled out of his car by men who struck him with a rifle butt and broke his nose). It is not always necessary that an attack cause physical harm; attempted murder is enough. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1233 (11th Cir.2007) (being shot at is persecution, even if the bullets miss). Nothing of the sort happened in this case, however, and we agree with the BIA and the IJ that the threats Polanco received do not establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Because Polanco has not shown past persecution, he is not presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1); <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007. To obtain asylum, Polanco must show that his fear of future persecution based on a protected ground is not only subjectively genuine but also objectively reasonable. <em>See Al Naj-jar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. We take Polanco at his word that he genuinely fears persecution. <em>See De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007 (applicant\u2019s credible testimony satisfies subjective prong). To determine whether an applicant\u2019s fears are reasonable, the factfinder may consider factors such as the fate of family remaining in the native country and the length of the applicant\u2019s absence. <em>See, e.g., Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006) (applicant\u2019s fear was not reasonable because his son and parents remained unharmed in the same region of Colombia where he had supposedly been threatened); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (applicant\u2019s fear was unreasonable because her student activism was unlikely to be remembered after a four-year absence).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The BIA noted that Polanco has at least one brother still living in Colombia, and\u2014 more significantly \u2014 that Senator Gallo, the same prominent politician for whom Polan-co worked, has not been harmed. Polanco has now been away from Colombia for more than five years. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he has not established a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">To be granted withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), Polanco would need to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted or tortured on account of a protected ground if he is returned to his native country. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. This is a more stringent burden than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d showing required for asylum. <em>Id. </em>Because Polanco has not met the asylum standard, he cannot qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">. Polanco also sought and was denied relief under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c), but his brief does not address that issue. Therefore, he has abandoned it. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
