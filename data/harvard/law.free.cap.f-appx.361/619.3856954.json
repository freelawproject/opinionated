Peak sought a reduction in sentence pursuant to the amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine. The district court determined that Peak did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>qualify for a reduction because his offense involved over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.lO(D)(ii)(I)). Peak argues that he qualified for a two-level reduction in his base offense level because his offense involved less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and that the district court\u2019s reliance on the estimate in the presentence report that the conspiracy involved 16 kilograms of crack cocaine was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Although the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, we review the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2009); <em>United States v. Mimms, </em>43 F.3d 217, 220 (5th Cir.1995). Because the trial evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that the amount of crack cocaine involved in the offense exceeded 4.5 kilograms, the district court did not err in denying Peak\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.l0(D)(ii)(I)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
