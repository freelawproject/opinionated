Brown, </em>586 F.3d 1342, 1349 (11th Cir.2009) (an individual may \u201ccomply with SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by registering through the state\u2019s sex offender registry, even if that jurisdiction has not implemented SORNA\u2019s administrative procedures\u201d); O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-l-12(e)(6). Second, SOR-NA does not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause, because, although Beasley traveled to Georgia in the gap period between SORNA\u2019s enactment in 2006 and the Attorney General\u2019s February 28, 2007 determination that SORNA applies retroactively, Beasley\u2019s duty to register in Georgia arose on March 5, 2007, <em>after </em>the Attorney General\u2019s announcement that SORNA applies retroactively. <em>See United States v. Dumont, </em>555 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2009) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 66, 175 L.Ed.2d 49 (2009). Third, the Attorney General\u2019s retroactive application of SORNA does not violate the non-delegation doctrine. <em>See United States v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202, 1205 (11th Cir.2009). Fourth, Beasley\u2019s SORNA conviction did not violate his procedural due process rights, <em>see Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1351, or his substantive due process rights, <em>see Ambert, </em>561 F.3d at 1208-09. Finally, SORNA\u2019s registration requirement and penalty provision constitute a proper exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. <em>See Ambert, </em>561 F.3d at 1210-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\">. Beasley was convicted of a sex offense in Mississippi in 1985 and was sentenced to 15 years in prison and required to register as a sex offender for life. After his release from prison in 2002, he registered as a sex offender in Jackson County, Mississippi. He traveled to Georgia in January 2007 and did not register as a sex offender. On March 8, 2007, after a warrant was issued for his arrest in Jackson County, U.S. Marshals arrested Beasley in DeKalb County Georgia, where he was working for a carnival.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-11\">. Beasley filed a motion to dismiss his indictment with the district court on the same grounds he raises in this appeal. The district court denied that motion. Beasley subsequently pled guilty and accepted a plea agreement but reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss for constitutional violations. We review a district court's denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Seher, </em>562 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2009). However, we review de novo \"issues concerning statutory interpretation and constitutional law.\u201d <em>United States v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202, 1205 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
