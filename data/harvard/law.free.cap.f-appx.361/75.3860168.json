For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">In his <em>pro se </em>complaint, Holt asserted that, on July 18, 2005, he obtained an order of probation sheet from his probation officer, Mac Glenn. The sheet provided that Holt was to serve a term of three years\u2019 probation. Holt contended that, sometime after an August 15, 2005 hearing, Glenn altered the original order of probation sheet to reflect that Holt was to serve a period of nine years\u2019 probation. Holt noted that the state court revoked his probation on October 30, 2006 and sentenced him to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The magistrate issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), recommending dismissing Holt\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, because the complaint was filed after the applicable two-year statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">Holt filed objections to the R &amp; R, arguing that he had filed his complaint within the statutory period and asserting that Glenn \u201ccontributed to the false imprisonment of the plaintiff through [his] perjured testimony ... and the altered government record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">The district court determined that it did not need to determine the statute of limitations issue, because the facts set forth in Holt\u2019s complaint failed to state a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983. It found that Holt faded to plead facts showing that Glenn\u2019s actions resulted in a violation of Holt\u2019s constitutional rights, because Glenn\u2019s amendment of the probation report to reflect a different length of probation would not have resulted in the revocation of Holt\u2019s probation. The court noted that Holt asserted for the first time in his objections to the R &amp; R that Glenn had offered perjured testimony, \u201cpresumably at the revocation hearing.\u201d The court determined that this allegation failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, because, under \u00a7 1983, \u201cwitnesses are granted absolute immunity for their testimony at trial.\u201d Based on these findings, the district court dismissed Holt\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-18\">Holt argues that Glenn should be held liable under \u00a7 1983, because he altered the order of probation sheet on August 15, 2005, and this alteration led to his imprisonment. He contends that Glenn\u2019s action violated his Equal Protection and Due Process rights and caused his false imprisonment. Holt also asserts that Glenn\u2019s actions caused him to be sentenced to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court s decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, a district court must dismiss the complaint of a prisoner if the complaint \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). A <em>pro se </em>complaint is held to a \u201cless stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u201cTo establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove (1) a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Holmes v. Crosby, </em>418 F.3d 1256, 1258 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe first inquiry in any \u00a7 1983 lawsuit ... is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 140, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2692, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979) (quotations omitted). The Fourteenth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d U.S. Const., Amend. XIV \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Holt\u2019s complaint appears to allege that Glenn deprived Holt of a liberty interest without due process of law. However, \u201csection 1983 requires proof of an affirmative <em>causal connection </em>between the official\u2019s acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Zatler v. Wainwright, </em>802 F.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir.1986) (emphasis added). The district court correctly found that Holt\u2019s complaint failed to show a causal connection between Glenn\u2019s act \u2014 the alleged alteration of the order of probation \u2014 and the alleged deprivation of Holt\u2019s liberty interest \u2014 the revocation of his probation. In his complaint, Holt acknowledged that his probation was revoked after an October 30, 2006 hearing. Thus, Holt was provided with due process of law before he was deprived of his liberty interest. Furthermore, Glenn\u2019s act of amending the probation order to reflect a nine-year period of probation rather than a three-year period did not result in the revocation of the probation. Accordingly, because Glenn\u2019s actions did not cause Holt to be deprived of his liberty interest, Holt has failed to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In his objections to the R &amp; R, Holt argues that Glenn deprived him of his liberty interest by falsely testifying at his probation revocation hearing. However, we have held that \u201cparole officers enjoy [quasi-judicial] immunity for testimony given during parole revocation hearings when they act within the scope of their duties.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>418 F.3d at 1258; <em>see also United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 113 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that \u201ccourts treat revocations the same whether they involve probation, parole, or supervised release\u201d). Thus, any claim arising from Glenn\u2019s testimony at Holt\u2019s probation revocation hearing lacks merit, because Glenn was entitled to immunity. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Holt\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
