He was sentenced to 210 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. More than 40 days after the entry of judgment, Alvarez filed a notice of appeal and a motion for an extension of time to file an appeal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>district court denied the motion per Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Counsel appointed to represent Alvarez has filed a motion to withdraw. In his response to counsel\u2019s motion, Alvarez moves for the appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">This court can dismiss an appeal during consideration of an interlocutory motion if the appeal \u201cis frivolous and entirely without merit.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Alvarez did not file a notice of appeal within 10 days after the entry of the criminal judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)\u00ae. His motion for an extension of time to file an appeal was filed beyond the 30-day time limit for extending the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). Thus, the district court did not err in enforcing the time limitations set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 4(b), and this court may not reverse its decision to do so. <em>See United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir.2006). Because the instant appeal is without arguable merit, the appeal is dismissed as frivolous, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, and Alvarez\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel is denied. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
