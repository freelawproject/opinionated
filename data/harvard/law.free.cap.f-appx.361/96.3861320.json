After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AGg\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">This case arises out of a drug investigation by the Sarasota Police Department in Sarasota, Florida, leading to the May 29, 2008 arrest of five individuals: defendant Sawyer, Diogenes Balbuena, Jimmy Morales-Gareia (\u201cGarcia\u201d), Gilberto Montas, and Henry Guzman. Defendant Sawyer went to trial alone, and his trial showed the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">A few months before the arrests, Guzman told Garcia that he had a friend (Sawyer) who wanted to buy some cocaine. Garcia contacted Montas about purchasing cocaine through Montas.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">Approximately a week before the arrests, Garcia learned that Montas had located a source for the cocaine. Garcia agreed to buy two kilograms of cocaine from Montas at a price of $23,500 per kilogram. Garcia informed Guzman, and Guzman indicated that his friend (Sawyer) was interested in purchasing the cocaine at this price.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">On May 29, 2008, the day of the arrests, Balbuena attempted to buy cocaine from an undercover police officer, Detective Derrick Gilbert. Balbuena was arrested and agreed to cooperate with the police. Balbuena led Detective Gilbert and a confidential source for the police (\u201cCS\u201d) to a restaurant where the Garcia/Montas deal was to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">On that same day, Garcia went to Guzman\u2019s apartment. Defendant Sawyer arrived at the apartment later on, after which Garcia noticed that there was a plastic bag containing money in the apartment. Garcia spoke with Montas by telephone about the cocaine deal and agreed to meet Montas at a gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">Defendant Sawyer, along with Guzman, Garcia, and a female driver, drove to the gas station in a sport utility vehicle (\u201cSUV\u201d), during which time a plastic bag containing the money was at Sawyer\u2019s feet. At the gas station, they met Montas and followed him to a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">At the restaurant, Montas went inside to met with Balbuena and the CS. The three then exited the restaurant and approached the SUV. Defendant Sawyer showed the money to Balbuena and the CS.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-19\">Either Balbuena or the CS asked who was going to test the cocaine. Defendant Sawyer got out of the SUV and was led by Balbuena and the CS into Detective Gilbert\u2019s undercover vehicle, parked nearby. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Defendant Sawyer entered the front passenger-side compartment of the undercover vehicle, and Balbuena and Montas boarded the rear passenger area, while the CS waited outside the undercover vehicle. Detective Gilbert, who was in the driver\u2019s seat and had placed a bag containing two kilograms of cocaine on the console, asked Montas who the drugs were for. Montas indicated that he and Sawyer intended to purchase the cocaine. Detective Gilbert opened the bag and placed it in Sawyer\u2019s lap. Sawyer sampled the cocaine and approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Defendant Sawyer then told Gilbert that Sawyer was going to retrieve the money to purchase the cocaine, and Sawyer next returned to the SUV. Once at the SUV, Sawyer asked its occupants whether they knew the drug sellers and whether the sellers were \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d A short time later, a police team arrived at the scene and arrested Sawyer, Garcia, Montas, and Guzman. The police found a plastic bag containing $44,720 in cash inside the SUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">B. Indictment and Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">A grand jury indicted defendant Sawyer, Balbuena, Garcia, and Montas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with a single count each of knowingly and willingly conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, from at least April 29, 2008 to May 29, 2008, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Montas pled guilty to the single drug conspiracy count in the indictment; Garcia pled guilty to misprision of a felony; and Balbuena initially signed a plea agreement as to the drug conspiracy count in the indictment, but failed to appear for his plea hearing and is a fugitive. Defendant Sawyer proceeded to trial alone and was convicted. The district court sentenced Sawyer to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. Sawyer timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">A. Prior Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">Sawyer first contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting these prior drug convictions under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b): (1) a 1997 conviction in Florida for possession of cocaine; (2) a 1998 conviction in Florida for possession of cocaine with intent to sell; and (3) two 1999 convictions in Florida for sale and possession of cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sawyer argues that these prior convictions were not admissible under Rule 404(b) because (1) none of these prior convictions is for <em>conspiracy </em>to possess cocaine, and (2) they were too remote in time (each at least ten years old) to be probative of his intent to commit the offense for which he was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-16\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). We use this three-part test to determine whether prior bad acts, including convictions, are admissible under Rule 404(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>First, the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; Second, the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; Third, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><em>United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Under the first prong, \u201cin every conspiracy case, a not guilty plea renders the defendant\u2019s intent a material issue. Evidence of such extrinsic evidence as may be probative of a defendant\u2019s state of mind is admissible unless the defendant affirmatively takes the issue of intent out of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). We have held that convictions for non-conspiracy drug offenses are admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b) for the purpose of demonstrating a defendant\u2019s intent to conspire to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Butler, </em>102 F.3d 1191, 1196 (11th Cir.1997) (upholding admission of a prior conviction for possession of cocaine for purposes of demonstrating defendant\u2019s intent in the charged conspiracy for possession with intent to distribute); <em>see also United States v. Cardenas, </em>895 F.2d 1338, 1341-45 (11th Cir.1990) (upholding admission of testimony regarding defendant\u2019s prior use of and trafficking in cocaine, where defendant was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Here, under this Court\u2019s binding precedent, Sawyer put his intent at issue by pleading not guilty and failing to take any affirmative step to remove intent as an issue. <em>See Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1311. And Sawyer\u2019s prior cocaine-related convictions are relevant to his intent to commit the charged offense. Thus, the first prong was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">As to the second prong, Sawyer does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence showing the prior convictions or the extrinsic acts underlying those convictions. Thus, the second prong is not at issue. <em>See Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1311 n. 14 (concluding that where the defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the extrinsic act, the second prong need not be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Under the third prong, whether the probative value of Rule 404(b) evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect calls for a \u201ccommon sense assessment of all the circumstances surrounding the extrinsic offense, including prosecutorial need, overall similarity between the extrinsic act and the charged offense, as well as temporal remoteness.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1282 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[C]ir-cuit precedent regards virtually any prior drug offense as probative of the intent to engage in a drug conspiracy....\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1311. \u201c[Tjemporal remoteness is an important factor to be considered as it depreciates the probity of the extrinsic offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). However, we \u201cha[ve] refrained from adopting a bright-line rule with respect to temporal proximity because decisions as to impermissible remoteness are so fact-specific that a generally applicable litmus test would be of dubious value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Thus, a defendant \u201cbears a heavy burden in demonstrating an abuse of the court\u2019s broad discretion in determining if an extrinsic offense is too remote to be probative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Here, three of Sawyer\u2019s prior convictions were for sale of cocaine or possession with intent to sell, and one of the convictions was for possession of cocaine. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>convictions are similar to the cocaine conspiracy charge for which Sawyer was tried. <em>See Cardenas, </em>895 F.2d at 1344 (\u201cEvidence of prior drug dealings is highly probative of intent to distribute a controlled substance, as well as involvement in a conspiracy.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Further, although the earliest of Sawyer\u2019s prior convictions occurred approximately eleven years before the offense conduct in the present case, this Court has held that longer periods did not render admission of such Rule 404(b) evidence improper. <em>See United States v. Lampley, </em>68 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir.1995) (determining that a time period of approximately fifteen years was not too remote). Moreover, in Sawyer\u2019s case the district court instructed the jury that his prior convictions must be considered only to determine Sawyer\u2019s state of mind or intent with respect to his commission of the charged offense. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Lizaraza, </em>981 F.2d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir.1993) (concluding prejudice could be mitigated by giving a cautionary instruction on the limited use of such evidence). Given these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the probative value of Sawyer\u2019s prior convictions was not substantially outweighed by any prejudicial effect and in admitting Sawyer\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">B. Government\u2019s Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"Aug\">Defendant Sawyer next claims the district court abused its discretion in granting the government\u2019s motion to reopen its case-in-chief to admit Sawyer\u2019s prior convictions, because this placed \u201cundue emphasis\u201d on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u201c\u2018[I]t is well established that a trial court may permit the reopening of a case in order that omitted evidence may be presented. Considerable latitude in discretion is vested in the trial court in such matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Molinares, </em>700 F.2d 647, 652 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Maggard v. Wainwright, </em>432 F.2d 941, 942 (5th Cir.1970)). \u201c[W]e will not disturb the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion unless the circumstances of the case show that [the defendant] suffered actual prejudice in the conduct of his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Marino, </em>562 F.2d 941, 944 (5th Cir.1977)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Here, on October 1, 2008 \u2014 fourteen days before trial \u2014 the government filed a notice of prior convictions, listing Sawyer\u2019s 1997 conviction in Florida for possession of cocaine and a 2000 conviction in Florida for possession of cocaine with intent to sell. On October 8, 2008, the government submitted an amended notice of prior convictions that omitted the 2000 conviction, but included Sawyer\u2019s 1997,1998, and two 1999 drug convictions. At a hearing the day before trial, the court ruled that the convictions were admissible. Sawyer was tried on October 15, 2008, but the government did not introduce the prior convictions during its case-in-chief. After both the government and the defense rested, the government moved to reopen its case to introduce the prior convictions pursuant to Rule 404(b). The district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion to reopen. First, Sawyer does not contest that he was in fact convicted of the offense in each conviction. Second, Sawyer had notice that the government was intending to introduce the convictions as early as October 1, 2008 (for the 1997 conviction) and October 8, 2008 (for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>1998 and 1999 convictions). Consequently, that the government intended to introduce the prior convictions was not a surprise to Sawyer, and Sawyer has shown no reversible error as to the timing of their admission. <em>See United States v. Wilcox, </em>450 F.2d 1131, 1143-44 (5th Cir.1971) (finding no abuse of discretion where district court permitted government to reopen its rebuttal case to recall defendant for purpose of asking whether defendant had ever been convicted of a felony, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s claim that this would place \u201cundue emphasis\u201d on defendant\u2019s felony conviction). Third, Sawyer\u2019s argument of undue emphasis is also undercut by the fact that the district court gave a limiting instruction that the jury was to consider the prior convictions only as to state of mind or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">C. Admission of Hearsay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Sawyer next argues that the district court erred in admitting hearsay testimony. Specifically, Sawyer claims the district court should have excluded on hearsay grounds Garcia\u2019s testimony that Guzman had a friend (referring to Sawyer) who was asking about buying cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">During Garcia\u2019s direct examination, the government elicited this testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: How long before the events of May 29th of 2008 did you have knowledge of a potential cocaine transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">[GARCIA]: A few months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Who presented this idea to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">[GARCIA]: A friend. His name is Henry Guzman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: What did Henry Guzman tell you or ask you when you first learned about a potential cocaine transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-13\">[GARCIA]: What is the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: What did Henry Guzman ask you or tell you about this potential cocaine transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-16\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: You may answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-18\">[GARCIA]: That he had a friend and acquaintance \u2014 that he had a friend that was asking him about the cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlJ\">The government asked Garcia if Guzman identified the friend, and Sawyer objected. The district court concluded the testimony was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). The government continued to question Garcia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: Who did Henry Guzman identify as his friend who wanted the cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-20\">[GARCIA]: He said they were black, like black from St. Pete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-21\">[PROSECUTOR]: And did you meet this friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-22\">[GARCIA]: We all met on the 29th at Guzman\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-23\">[PROSECUTOR]: That\u2019s May 29th, the day you were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-24\">[GARCIA]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-25\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you see this friend in court today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-26\">[GARCIA]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-27\">Garcia then identified Sawyer in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-28\">Hearsay is inadmissible unless it meets one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802. Under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), statements made by a cocon-spirator in furtherance of a conspiracy are not hearsay. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). For a statement to constitute non-hearsay by a coconspirator, the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>(1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the conspiracy included the declarant and the defendant against whom the statement is offered; and (3) the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. In determining the admissibility of co-conspirator statements, the trial court may consider both the co-conspirator\u2019s statements and independent external evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1264 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 561, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 562, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014, and \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 568, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Hasner, </em>340 F.3d 1261,1274 (11th Cir.2003)). The district court\u2019s factual determinations that the conspiracy existed and that the statement was made in furtherance of that conspiracy are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Tokars, </em>95 F.3d 1520, 1538 (11th Cir.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Allison, </em>908 F.2d 1531, 1533-34 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Here, the evidence reflected that a conspiracy to purchase cocaine existed between the declarant, Guzman, and the defendant, Sawyer, at the time of Guzman\u2019s statement. First, the very statement made by Guzman to Garcia, \u201cthat [Guzman] had a friend that was asking him about the cocaine,\u201d shows that Guzman and his friend (Sawyer) already had discussed a potential cocaine transaction before Guzman made the statement to Garcia. Second, other evidence presented at trial shows that Guzman and Sawyer had agreed to participate in. a cocaine transaction at the time Guzman\u2019s statement to Garcia was made. For example, Garcia testified he knew about a potential cocaine deal \u201c[a] few months\u201d before the deal, when Guzman requested cocaine on his friend\u2019s behalf. \u201c[A] week\u201d before the transaction, Garcia learned that Montas had found a source for the cocaine, and Montas and Garcia agreed on a purchase price for two kilograms of cocaine. Garcia shared the price with Guzman, and Guzman indicated that his friend (Sawyer) was still interested in purchasing the cocaine. Finally, Sawyer arrived at Guzman\u2019s apartment and participated in the cocaine transaction. As a result, the trial evidence shows that a conspiracy existed between Sawyer and Guzman at the time Guzman\u2019s statement to Garcia was made. Because Sawyer and Guzman were coconspirators when the challenged statement was made, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Garcia\u2019s testimony that Guzman\u2019s friend was interested in purchasing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">D. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">Sawyer\u2019s final argument challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">Conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c(1) that a conspiracy existed; (2) that the defendant knew of it; and (3) that the defendant, with knowledge, voluntarily joined it.\u201d <em>United States v. Molina, </em>443 F.3d 824, 828 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Lopez-Ramirez, </em>68 F.3d 438, 440 (11th Cir.1995)). The agreement forming the basis of the conspiracy can be proved \u201cby circumstantial evidence, through \u2018inferences from the conduct of the alleged participants or from circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>stantial evidence of a scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Obregon, </em>893 F.2d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Tamargo, </em>672 F.2d 887, 889 (11th Cir.1982)). \u201cWhere the government\u2019s case is circumstantial, reasonable inferences, and not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>97 F.3d 1391, 1392 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cMere presence, guilty knowledge, even sympathetic observation\u201d and close association with a coconspirator are insufficient, without more, to support a conviction for conspiracy to distribute drugs. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>53 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.1995). Yet, such factors may raise a permissible inference of participation in a conspiracy, which the jury may consider as a \u201cmaterial and probative factor ... in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>896 F.2d 513, 518 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s knowing participation in a conspiracy may be established through proof of surrounding circumstances such as acts committed by the defendant which furthered the purpose of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Bain, </em>736 F.2d 1480, 1485 (11th Cir.1984). The evidence of prior drug activity may establish intent. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>619 F.2d 379, 383-84 (5th Cir.1980) (concluding that a prior conviction increases the likelihood that the defendant intended to conspire to commit similar subsequent criminal conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We readily conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that Sawyer was a part of the charged conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. The evidence showed that Garcia and Guzman negotiated to purchase two kilograms of cocaine on Sawyer\u2019s behalf, that Sawyer traveled with others to purchase the cocaine, that Sawyer had $44,720 in cash to buy the cocaine in his possession during the drive to the site where the deal occurred, that coconspirator Montas indicated to Detective Gilbert that he and Sawyer wanted to buy the cocaine, and that Sawyer tested the cocaine and then returned to the SUV to retrieve the money, asking if the sellers were \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d Furthermore, the government offered evidence of Sawyer\u2019s four prior convictions for cocaine-related offenses. The evidence amply supported Sawyer\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm Sawyer\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">.
