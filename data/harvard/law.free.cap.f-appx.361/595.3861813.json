Martinez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his guidelines offense level for obstruction of justice and denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">A defendant\u2019s offense level may be increased by two levels if he willfully obstructed or impeded the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the offense of conviction and the obstructive conduct related to the offense of conviction and any relevant conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. A district court\u2019s findings are reviewed for clear error, and a \u201cfactual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 363 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We conclude that the district court\u2019s attribution of threats made against a codefendant and the codefen-dant\u2019s family to Martinez was not clearly erroneous. We also find that, contrary to Martinez\u2019s assertion, the district court did not attribute a threat to cut a codefen-dant\u2019s throat to Martinez. The district court did not clearly err in finding it was a reasonable inference that these threats were intended to obstruct justice by dissuading a codefendant from further cooperation with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">A defendant\u2019s offense level may be reduced by as many as three levels if the defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Conduct resulting in an enhancement for obstruction of justice \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 4. However, a defendant can receive adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 in an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case. <em>Id. </em>We review a determination of acceptance of responsibility with even greater deference than under a clearly erroneous standard; the district court\u2019s ruling on acceptance of responsibility \u201cshould not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Contrary to Martinez\u2019s assertion, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court mistakenly believed that an obstruction of justice enhancement required it to deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Instead, the district court stated that it was denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for the same reasons it had imposed an enhancement for obstruction of justice. Martinez has not shown that his was an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 4. We conclude that the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>denial of the reduction was not without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
