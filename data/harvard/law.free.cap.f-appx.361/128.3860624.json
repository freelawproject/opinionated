After reviewing the record, and reading the parties briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly denied both motions and affirm its order and the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">This appeal stems from a breach of contract action brought by Appellees Camellia and Rufus Prater against Appellant Allstate. Allstate provided the Praters with homeowner\u2019s insurance coverage during a period that included June 3, 2006, the day on which fire damaged a structure covered by the policy. After receiving no definitive answer about the status of their claim, the Praters sued Allstate on May 31, 2007, to adjudicate its liability on the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">At trial, Allstate contested the accuracy of the inventory list submitted by the Praters that sought to itemize household items destroyed by the fire. Allstate alleged that the Praters breached the insurance contract by making material misstatements in their claim of loss. Additionally, Allstate alleged that the Praters breached the insurance contract by withholding from Allstate access to an off-site storage facility where Rufus Prater stored household items after the fire. Allstate claimed that the Praters\u2019 refusal to grant access violated their duty of cooperation under the policy and thwarted Allstate\u2019s attempts to properly adjust the claim of loss. A jury rejected Allstate\u2019s arguments and awarded the Praters recovery under the policy for damages to the structure and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>Chaney v. City of Orlando, </em>483 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007). We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>McWhorter v. City of Birmingham, </em>906 F.2d 674, 677 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Our review of motions made under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 \u201cis squarely and narrowly focused on the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Chaney, </em>483 F.3d at 1227. Allstate contends that it presented overwhelming evidence from which no reasonable jury could conclude that the Praters had fulfilled them contractual obligations or met their burden of production at trial. Specifically, Allstate claims that the Praters materially misrepresented their damages in their proof of loss form, that they failed to cooperate with Allstate it its adjustment of their claim, and that the Praters failed to produce evidence from which a jury could award damages without undue speculation. All parties agree that Georgia law governs this contract dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">After our thorough and independent review of the record, we conclude that the district court correctly denied Allstate\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, and, consequently, did not abuse its discretion in denying Allstate\u2019s motion for a new trial. First, the evidence presented at trial showed a legitimate factual dispute about the existence and materiality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Praters\u2019 alleged misrepresentations. Under Georgia law, it is generally \u201ca jury question as to whether a misrepresentation may have actually affected the action of the insurer with respect to settling or adjusting a claim.\u201d <em>Ga. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Richardson, </em>217 Ga.App. 201, 457 S.E.2d 181, 184 (1995). Although the Praters admitted that some of the items included in their proof of loss form were not actually damaged by the fire, it was up to the jury to decide whether those particular items \u2014 most notably a set of wall clocks and neon lights \u2014 were material with respect to the Praters\u2019 overall claim, in excess of $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Second, the Praters\u2019 compliance with the contract\u2019s cooperation requirement was a factual question appropriately reserved for the jury. Under Georgia law, a \u201ctotal failure\u201d to cooperate under the policy\u2019s terms may preclude recovery as a matter of law, but if \u201cthe insured cooperates to some degree or provides an explanation for its noncompliance, a fact question is presented for resolution by a jury.\u201d <em>Diamonds &amp; Denims, Inc. v. First of Ga. Ins. Co., </em>203 Ga.App. 681, 417 S.E.2d 440, 441-42 (1992). Here, Mr. Prater\u2019s single refusal to allow Allstate to inspect the storage facility, when considered in context with his decision to move the contents of the facility back to the damaged property before Allstate\u2019s inspection and his other acts of cooperation during the adjustment period, does not amount to a \u201ctotal failure\u201d of cooperation that precludes recovery under the policy as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Finally, the damage estimates presented to the jury allowed it to arrive at its verdict with the \u201creasonable certainty\u201d required by Georgia law. <em>See Crankshaw v. Stanley Homes, Inc., </em>131 Ga.App. 840, 207 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1974). Testimony about the amount of damages by the party claiming loss is sufficient evidence from which to calculate an award. <em>See id. </em>at 243-44. Here, the amount of damage to the Praters\u2019 structure is undisputed, and the Praters\u2019 testimony about the contents of the inventory list and value of those items was sufficient evidence from which the jury could make an award with reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The district court correctly denied Allstate\u2019s motions made under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. The district court properly submitted to the jury questions about the materiality of the errors on the Praters\u2019 proof of loss form and the sufficiency of their cooperation with Allstate under the policy\u2019s terms. Finally, it was permissible for the jury to credit the Praters\u2019 testimony about their damages in calculating the damage award. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order and its judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
