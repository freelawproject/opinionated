The district court\u2014 upon the magistrate judge\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A recommendation \u2014 dismissed Jackson\u2019s case for failure to state a claim. Jackson appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Jackson and another inmate \u2014 James Hayes \u2014 got into a cellblock scuffle on the night of November 2, 2008. The guards broke it up by tackling Jackson off of Hayes. Jackson requested emergency medical care to treat some swelling, but the prison officials made him wait until morning to see a doctor. He also demanded an immediate transfer to a safer prison' \u2014 one closer to his hometown.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In the aftermath of the fight, both Jackson and Hayes admitted to fighting in violation of jailhouse rules. The prison, however, assigned an investigator to take a closer look. Hayes eventually cracked during interrogation, explaining that he and Jackson had staged the fight. Jackson wanted to move to a prison closer to his home, so he offered Hayes $100 to put on the show. According to Hayes, Jackson hit himself \u2014 causing the swelling \u2014 to make the dramatic altercation more authentic.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">His jailors issued Jackson a disciplinary report, charging self-mutilation, fraud (lying), and bribery. At a hearing Jackson denied the charges but offered no substantive defense. The disciplinary chairwoman found him guilty on all counts. The punishment included eight dollars of restitution, no phone for two months, and loss of 55 days of good-time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Jackson filed this \u00a7 1983 claim in federal court. He alleged that the guards: (1) had failed to protect him during the fight; (2) wrongfully had delayed medical treatment; (3) had prosecuted him maliciously at the disciplinary hearing; (4) had denied him adequate procedures at the hearing; and (5) have since retaliated against him for filing a complaint. Jackson also attached several pendent state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, <em>Heck v. Humphrey</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>barred Jackson from recovering damages on the failure to protect claim, unless he first overturned the disciplinary conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The other claims had no merit. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">Jackson appeals, urging that <em>Heck </em>does not bar all of his allegations. According to Jackson, the Supreme Court has silently overruled the 5th Circuit case applying <em>Heck </em>to prison disciplinary convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jackson misreads the district court order, which held that <em>Heck </em>bars only one of his six claims. This court, however, liberally construes pro se filings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Read fairly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Jackson\u2019s brief contests the negative outcome on all of his claims. We understand Jackson not only to question <em>Heck\u2019s </em>applicability to the failure to protect claim but also to challenge the district court\u2019s order as a whole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Our caselaw is inconsistent as to whether we must review a district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915A dismissal de novo or for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We need not resolve the discrepancy, though, as Jackson\u2019s appeal fails under any standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">A. Failure to Protect</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Jackson alleges that the guards did not break up the fight fast enough, causing him injury. To succeed on this damages claim, Jackson would have to show that inmate Hayes attacked him. Jackson\u2019s prison disciplinary proceeding found that Jackson had staged the phony fight. Therefore, a victory on Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 damages claim necessarily would imply the invalidity of his otherwise undisturbed disciplinary conviction. As our en banc court explained in <em>Clarke v. Stalder: </em>\u201cA prisoner ... cannot bring a \u00a7 1983 action seeking damages ... based on a \u2018conviction\u2019 until that \u2018conviction has been ... declared invalid ... if a favorable judgment would \u2018necessarily imply\u2019 the invalidity of the prisoner\u2019s \u2018conviction\u2019 ....\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Of course, \u201c[a] \u2018conviction,\u2019 for the purposes of <em>HecJc, </em>includes a ruling in a prison disciplinary proceeding that results in a change to the prisoner\u2019s sentence, including loss of good-time credits.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">Jackson contends that the Supreme Court decision in <em>Wilkinson v. Austin</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>silently overturned our <em>Clarke </em>rule. He is wrong. Among other reasons, <em>Wilkinson </em>involved neither a prison disciplinary proceeding of this kind nor a damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">B. Failure to Treat</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">Jackson alleges that the prison staff delayed treatment of his serious injuries. The Eighth Amendment forbids prison officials from displaying deliberate indifference toward prisoners\u2019 medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>needs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mere negligence, though, is not enough.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, \u201cthe legal conclusion of deliberate indifference ... must rest on facts clearly evincing wanton actions on the part of the defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Jackson makes no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The guards had Jackson wait until morning to see the doctors. After examining him, the medical team noted Jackson\u2019s swollen cheek, sore wrist, and bruised knee. X-rays of his face, back, and knee revealed no breaks or other serious damage. A doctor at a follow-up exam explained that the patient would need no treatment. Jackson has not demonstrated \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, in any event, a prisoner cannot recover for mere delay in medical treatment unless harm results.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">C. Malicious Prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Jackson suggests that the prison officials maliciously and without cause instituted disciplinary proceedings against him. \u201cThere is no federal constitutional claim based on the tort of malicious prose-ration.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the disciplinary board found Jackson guilty, <em>Heck </em>likely would bar the claim anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">D. Inadequate Procedure at Disciplinary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">Jackson baldly states that \u2014 in losing his good-time credits at the disciplinary hearing \u2014 he did not receive constitutionally required procedural protections: written notice of the evidence against him and the right to call witnesses in his defense. This court has suggested that prisoners may bring a \u00a7 1983 claim for damages for the deprivation of civil rights relating to disciplinary procedures, as long as the prisoner does not challenge the substantive result of the hearing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The damages sought must not \u201cencompass the injury of being deprived of good-time credits, and must stem solely from the deprivation of civil rights.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A fine line, to be sure, but one that we need not in this case negotiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">Even if Jackson could state a cognizable claim, he does not do so here. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>conclusory declaration that his jailors create an atmosphere where a prisoner may be deprived of procedural due process does not \u201craise [his] right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although not necessary to our decision, the record reflects that Jackson\u2019s claim is factually frivolous: he did receive advance notice of both the charges and evidence against him; and he did not seek to call witnesses at his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">E. Post-Incident Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Jackson claims that the prison guards have retaliated against him since he filed a complaint about their handling of the fight. He says they search his cell, steal from him, and verbally threaten him. Of course, prison officials \u201cmay not retaliate against or harass an inmate for ... complaining to a supervisor about a guard\u2019s misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Jackson, though, \u201calleges no factual basis for that mere conclusionary allegation. Standing alone, the contention is frivolous.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Nor does Jackson have a valid constitutional claim for underlying searches, thefts, or threats. First, \u201cprisoners have no legitimate expectation of privacy,\u201d so\u2014 absent cruel or unusual circumstances\u2014 the Constitution does not prohibit even unreasonable cell searches.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Second, as long as the state provides for a meaningful post-deprivation remedy (which Louisiana does<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>), then no constitutional violation occurs when a state employee negligently or intentionally deprives a prisoner of property.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And third, freestanding \u201cclaims of verbal abuse are not actionable under \u00a7 1988.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">F. State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">Because Jackson states not one valid federal claim, the district court properly declined jurisdiction over his Louisiana causes of action.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">Jackson\u2019s complaint has no legal merit. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of all claims. Jackson\u2019s motions to supplement his brief and for appointment of counsel<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u2014 as well as any other outstanding motions \u2014 are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

FBI, </em>2 F.3d 642, 643 n. 2 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">. Jackson has sought leave of the court to supplement his brief in order specifically to challenge the entire district court order. By instead liberally construing Jackson's original submission, the court effectively reaches the same result as if we had granted leave to supplement. In other words, any supplement would be redundant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\">. We have held that \u201cwe will ... employ the ... <em>de novo </em>standard to review dismissals pursuant to \u00a7 1915A.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). Two months previously, though, we had held that \u201c[w]e review the magistrate\u2019s determination that [the] complaint is frivolous [under \u00a7 1915A] for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998). Subsequent cases have alternated between the two standards. <em>See, e.g., Velasquez, </em>329 F.3d at 421 (\u201cThe standard of review of dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A ... is de novo.\u201d); <em>White v.

Our earlier decision <em>(Martin), </em>though, took the standard of review for granted, whereas the later decision (Ruiz) embarked on a lengthy analysis to determine the proper review.
