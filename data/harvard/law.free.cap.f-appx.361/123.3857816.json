We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(e)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions concerning the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) a district court may not reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant unless that defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a guideline range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. In addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis: (1) by recalculating the sentence based on the amendment, \u201cleaving] all other guideline application decisions unaffected;\u201d and (2) by exercising its discretion, based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to impose a new sentence or to retain the original. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l); <em>see also United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u201c[A] reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u2018the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g. a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Francis was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendments 591, 599, or 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 591 clarified that \u201cin order for the enhanced penalties in \u00a7 2D1.2 to apply, the defendant [must have] been convicted of an offense referenced to \u00a7 2D1.2, rather than simply have engaged in conduct described by that guideline.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C. amend. 591, \u201cReason for Amendment\u201d (2003); <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219 (\u201cAmendment 591 requires that the initial selection of the offense guideline be based only on the statute or offense of conviction rather than on judicial findings of actual conduct not made by the jury.\u201d). Section 2D1.2 of the sentencing guidelines provides heightened base offense levels for drug offenses \u201coccurring near protected locations or involving underage or pregnant individuals.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2. Francis\u2019 base offense level was not increased on that basis, and therefore Amendment 591 does not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">\u201cAmendment 599 was enacted in order to clarify under what circumstances a weapons enhancement may properly be applied to an underlying offense when the defendant has also been convicted for the use or possession of a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1179 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 599. Francis was not convicted under \u00a7 924(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>and therefore Amendment 599 also does not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u201cAmendment 706 allows a defendant to seek a reduction in his sentence if that sentence was based on the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cEffective 1 November 2007, Amendment 706 adjusted downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to each threshold quantity of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.\u201d). Francis was sentenced to a mandatory minimum life sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because he had two earlier felony drug convictions. Since Francis\u2019 sentence was based on a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence, he is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 because the amendment would not have lowered his guidelines range. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339 (\u201c[T]he operation of ... [a] statutory provision such as a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment would prevent Amendment 706 from hav[ing] the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted) (third alteration in original). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Francis\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Francis also argues that the district court erred by failing to expressly mention Amendments 591 and 599 in its order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Any error by the district court was harmless because those amendments did not apply to him. <em>See Rabalais v. Dresser Indus., Inc., </em>566 F.2d 518, 520 n. 2 (5th Cir.1978) (district court\u2019s failure to address exception to exhaustion requirement in its memorandum opinion was harmless because the exception did not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Francis also challenges his sentence enhancement. He contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enhance his sentence based on his earlier felony drug convictions because the government\u2019s \u00a7 851(a)(1) information contained inaccuracies. Francis\u2019 argument is without merit. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. As we explained in <em>Moreno, </em>\u201c[sjection 3582 only provides a district court with the discretion to reduce a sentence following the lowering of a sentencing range by the Sentencing Commission .... All original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, the district court lacked the authority to reduce Francis\u2019 sentence based on any inaccuracies in the government\u2019s \u00a7 851(a)(1) information. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
