Because Patterson\u2019s offense involved 501.5 grams of powder cocaine, he was subject to the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). He was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>On appeal, Patterson argues that imposition of the statutory minimum sentence violated his Eighth Amendment guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment and his Fifth Amendment right to due process. As he has failed to show that his sentence is grossly disproportionate to the severity of his crime, his Eighth Amendment claim fails. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 942 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, despite Patterson\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the statutory minimum sentence was not based upon an arbitrary distinction that resulted in a violation of his due process rights. <em>See United States v. Rojas-Martinez, </em>968 F.2d 415, 420 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cnt. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
