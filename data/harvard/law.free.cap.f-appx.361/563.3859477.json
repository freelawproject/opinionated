The district court granted a Certificate of Appeal-ability (COA) on this question with respect to the prosecution\u2019s striking of Juror # 15, Cynthia Richard. We granted a COA on the same question as to Juror # 16, Linda Jackson. Our review is limited to these questions under the applicable AEDPA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deferential review standards. For the reasons set forth below, we REVERSE and REMAND with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">In 2002, Hayes was tried in a Dallas County state district court on the charge of aggravated robbery. During the jury selection process, Hayes objected to the prosecution\u2019s use of eight of its eleven peremptory strikes to remove all eligible African-American venire members from the panel that was ultimately seated. Following a <em>Batson </em>hearing, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>judge sustained the <em>Batson </em>challenge regarding the striking of one potential juror, Juror # 6, Gertrude Hashaway, but overruled it as to the remaining jurors, including the two in question here, Richard and Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">With respect to Hashaway, the prosecutor contended that she was sleeping during voir dire and was \u201cgrandmotherly and careless in her appearance.\u201d The trial court concluded that she was not sleeping and that being \u201cgrandmotherly\u201d and careless in one\u2019s appearance was not a \u201cproper reason\u201d for a peremptory strike. She was then reinstated to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">With respect to Richard, the prosecution claimed that she was struck for five different reasons: (1) she was \u201chostile\u201d; (2) she failed to respond to the judge\u2019s questions; (3) she had a \u201cbad juror rating\u201d; (4) she was employed as a teacher; and (5) she selected \u201crehabilitation\u201d as an important goal of the criminal justice system. During the <em>Batson </em>hearing, the trial judge dismissed the assertion that Richard was non-responsive and focused on the \u201chostility\u201d prong. The trial judge concluded that, while he noticed no such hostility, hostility is a legitimate reason for striking a juror. Notably, the prosecution did not strike two people who were white teachers and served as jurors nor did it strike a white juror who also had a \u201cbad juror rating\u201d; additionally, Richard actually did not mention rehabilitation as a goal of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">With respect to Jackson, the prosecution claimed that she was struck for three reasons: (1) she had a cousin with a pending criminal case in the same county; (2) she allegedly gave conflicting answers about whether she would need to see the gun that was used in the robbery; and (3) she chose rehabilitation as a goal of the criminal justice system. In response, the defense noted that other individuals were selected for the jury who also had relatives with criminal cases and who chose rehabilitation as a goal of the criminal justice system. The defense also pointed out that Jackson\u2019s seeming \u201cconflicting answers\u201d about the gun actually reflected confusion about the original question; once clarified, she indicated she did not need to see the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Following his conviction, Hayes appealed the denial of his objections to the state\u2019s intermediate court of appeals, as well as the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Both affirmed. <em>Hayes v. State, </em>No. 11-02-00348-CR, 2003 WL 22064066 (Tex.App.-Eastland Sept. 4, 2003) (unpublished), <em>aff'd, </em>No. PD-16556-03 (Tex.Crim.App. March 3, 2004) (unpublished). The record does not indicate that a petition for writ of certiorari was filed in the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Having thus exhausted his state court appeals, Hayes sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court. The magistrate judge conducted two hearings and first recommended denial of habeas relief before subsequently recommending granting habeas relief with respect to the strike of Richard. After hearing oral argument, the district judge concluded that relief should not be granted and denied Hayes\u2019s petition. Both judges expressed concern about the fact that 100% of the African-American venire members were struck by the State and opined that this was a difficult case. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Our standard of review in an AEDPA case is well-established: deference must be given to factual findings of the state court in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Because the <em>Batson </em>claims were adjudicated in state court, the district court, as well as our court, must defer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the state court\u2019s resolution unless its determination was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Hill v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 481, 485 (5th Cir.2000). A state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it \u201capplies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), or \u201cif the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme Court] and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [the Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 120 S.Ct. 1495. A state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court \u201ccorrectly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 120 S.Ct. 1495. The Supreme Court has articulated the governing standards for evaluating whether peremptory strikes were race-based in several cases, including <em>Batson </em>and <em>Miller-El v. Dretke (Miller-El II), </em>545 U.S. 231, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005). The most recent Supreme Court pronouncement on this subject was <em>Snyder v. Louisiana, </em>552 U.S. 472, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">While AEDPA review is highly deferential, we note that it is not perfunctory. The Supreme Court has stressed that \u201c[e]ven in the context of federal habeas, deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review. Deference does not by definition preclude relief.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell (Miller-El I), </em>537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>see also Panetti v. Quarterman, </em>551 U.S. 930, 953, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007) (AEDPA does not \u201cprohibit a federal court from finding an application of a principle unreasonable when it involves a set of facts different from those of the case in which a principle is announced. The statute recognizes, to the contrary, that even a general standard may be applied in an unreasonable manner.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. at 377, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (AEDPA \u201cdirects federal courts to attend to every state-court judgment with utmost care, but it does not require them to defer to the opinion of every reasonable state-court judge on the content of federal law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Mindful of these precedents, our coui't addressed the application of <em>Batson </em>in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding in <em>Reed v. Quarterman, </em>555 F.3d 364 (5th Cir.2009) and <em>Haynes v. Quarterman, </em>561 F.3d 535 (5th Cir.2009). These cases further inform our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A06\">\n<em>A. Standards for a Batson Inquiry</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from challenging potential jurors solely on account of their race. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712. <em>Bat-son </em>outlined a three-step process for evaluating claims that a prosecutor used peremptory challenges in a manner that violated the Equal Protection Clause: (1) a defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised his peremptory challenges on the basis of race; (2) the burden then shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral reason for striking the juror in question; and (3) the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <em>Snyder, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The Supreme Court explained the third step in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">Step three of the <em>Batson </em>inquiry involves an evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s credibility, and the best evidence of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>criminatory intent often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge. In addition, race-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often invoke a juror\u2019s demeanor (e.g., nervousness, inattention), making the trial court\u2019s first-hand observations of even greater importance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1208 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The ultimate conclusion of discriminatory intent is a factual finding. <em>Ladd v. Cockrell, </em>311 F.3d 349, 356 (5th Cir.2002). \u201c[T]he critical question in determining whether a prisoner has proved purposeful discrimination at step three is the persuasiveness of the prosecutor\u2019s justification for his peremptory strike. At this stage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Miller-El I, </em>537 U.S. at 338-39, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[T]he ultimate inquiry for the judge is not whether counsel\u2019s reason is suspect, or weak, or irrational, but whether counsel is telling the truth in his or her assertion that the challenge is not race-based.\u201d <em>United States v. Bentley-Smith, </em>2 F.3d 1368, 1375 (5th Cir.1993). The \u201cdecisions of this court have made it plain that the process of choosing a jury may be influenced by the \u2018intuitive assumptions\u2019 of the attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1374. \u201cWe have recognized that these determinations of credibility and demeanor lie peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province, and we have stated that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, we would defer to [the trial court].\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1208 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \"When reviewing a <em>Batson </em>ruling, because \u201call of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted,\u201d this court may consider the strike of one juror for any relevance it might have regarding the strike of another juror. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Our review is further informed by various <em>post-Batson </em>Supreme Court decisions. In <em>Miller-El II, </em>a Texas defendant sought federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that the trial court should have sustained his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s discriminatory use of peremptory strikes against African-American jurors. 545 U.S. at 236-37, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The Supreme Court conducted \u201cside-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The Court noted that \u201c[i]f a prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblaek who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination to be considered at <em>Batson\u2019s </em>third step.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Miller-El II </em>majority rejected the dissent\u2019s assertion that \u201c \u2018similarly situated\u2019 does not mean matching any one of several reasons the prosecution gave for striking a potential juror-it means matching <em>all </em>of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247 n. 6, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">None of our cases announces [sic] a rule that no comparison is probative unless the situation of the individuals compared is identical in all respects, and there is no reason to accept one.... A <em>per se </em>rule that a defendant cannot win a <em>Bat-son </em>claim unless there is an exactly identical white juror would leave <em>Batson </em>inoperable; potential jurors are not products of a set of cookie cutters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The Court then considered two specific African-American jurors who had been struck by the prosecution: Billy Jean Fields and Joe Warren. <em>Id. </em>at 242-52, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for striking Fields was that he had concerns with Fields\u2019s statements indicating that he could not impose the death penalty because the defendant could possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>bly be rehabilitated. <em>Id. </em>at 243, 125 S.Ct. 2317. After that strike was challenged by defense counsel, the prosecutor added that Fields was struck because his brother had a prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The Court noted that the prosecutor mischaracterized Fields\u2019s statements and that the prosecutor accepted several non-African-American venire members who expressed reservations about imposing the death penalty on a person who could be rehabilitated. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The Court discredited the prosecutor\u2019s secondary basis for the strike because it \u201creekfed] of afterthought,\u201d as Fields stated that he was not close to his brother, and the prosecutor did not ask whether his brother\u2019s criminal history would influence him if he were to serve as a juror. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 125 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The prosecutor in <em>Miller-El II </em>provided three reasons for striking Joe Warren: (1) Warren provided inconsistent responses and implied that the death penalty may be a more lenient punishment than imprisonment for life; (2) Warren was struck when the State still had ten peremptory challenges left and could afford to be more liberal in striking potential jurors; and (3) Warren had a brother-in-law who had been convicted of a crime involving food stamps. <em>Id. </em>at 248-52, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The Court noted that three unstruck venire members expressed similar opinions regarding the death penalty being more lenient than life imprisonment and that one of those un-struck members was accepted before Warren was struck, thereby obviating the prosecutor\u2019s second proffered reason. <em>Id. </em>at 248-49, 125 S.Ct. 2317. As for the third justification, the Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to ask any questions about Warren\u2019s brother-in-law undermined the validity of that reason. <em>Id. </em>at 250 n. 8, 125 S.Ct. 2317. The Court further noted that other unstruck panel members also had relatives who had criminal histories. <em>Id. </em>In light of these comparisons, the Court found the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral reasons to be implausible, thereby supporting the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 251-52, 125 S.Ct. 2317. However, the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that a <em>Batson </em>violation had occurred was also supported by the Court\u2019s determinations that (1) the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination by shuffling the jury panel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and posing contrasting questions to the jurors regarding minimum sentences and (2) the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s office manual<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> advocating the exclusion of minorities from jury service had been made available to at least one of the prosecutors in Miller-El\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 253-66, 125 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In <em>Snyder, </em>a Louisiana defendant argued on appeal that the trial judge erred in rejecting his objection to the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>tor\u2019s discriminatory use of peremptory strikes against African-American jurors. 128 S.Ct. at 1207. Although the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim centered on two African-American venire members, the Supreme Court upheld the claim as to one, Jeffrey Brooks, and therefore found it unnecessary to consider the claim as to the other African-American panelist. <em>Id. </em>at 1208. The prosecutor in <em>Snyder </em>provided two reasons for striking Brooks: (1) he looked very nervous throughout the questioning; and (2) he was a student teacher who expressed concern about missing class and the prosecutor was worried that Brooks might vote for the defendant\u2019s guilt on a lesser verdict in order to avoid a penalty phase. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The Court noted that, although deference is due to a trial judge\u2019s finding regarding a panelist\u2019s demeanor, the trial judge did not make any explicit determination as to Brooks\u2019s demeanor and simply overruled the <em>Batson </em>objection without explanation. <em>Id. </em>at 1209. It therefore held that \u201cwe cannot presume that the trial judge credited the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that Mr. Brooks was nervous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s second proffered reason for striking Brooks was implausible because (1) Brooks was one of more than fifty venire members (many of whom were accepted as jurors by the prosecution) who expressed concern that jury service could interfere with their other obligations, (2) the prosecutor\u2019s outlined scenario was highly speculative, and (3) Brooks\u2019s concern regarding his teaching requirements was resolved by the trial judge during voir dire. <em>Id. </em>at 1209-12. The Court held that \u201c[t]he prosecution\u2019s proffer of this pretextual explanation naturally gives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1212. The Court held that the prosecution would only be able to salvage the strike against Brooks by showing that the pretextual factor was not determinative, but that, in light of the circumstances at issue in that case, \u201cthe record does not show that the prosecution would have preemptively challenged Mr. Brooks based on his nervousness alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the <em>Snyder </em>Court upheld the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge and vacated the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In <em>Reed, </em>we recently granted federal habeas relief in a case that was very similar to <em>Miller-El II. </em>Reed argued that the State\u2019s race-neutral reasons for excluding African-American jurors were pretextual because the State had accepted many white jurors who had the same characteristics as the excluded African-American jurors. <em>Reed, </em>555 F.3d at 368. We first concluded that, based upon Texas case law, Reed\u2019s comparative analysis argument was not procedurally barred in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and, hence, was subject to review by this court. <em>Id. </em>at 369-71. We then decided that, even though a comparative analysis argument had not been considered by the state courts, it could be considered in a federal habeas proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 371-75. This court supported its conclusion by reviewing the procedural history of <em>Miller-El II. Id. </em>at 370-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The <em>Reed </em>court stated that we had recently agreed that <em>Miller-El II </em>requires us to consider a comparative analysis in a <em>Batson </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 373 (citing <em>United States v. Brown, </em>553 F.3d 768, 797 (5th Cir.2008) (direct appeal)); <em>cf. United States v. Guerra-Marez, </em>928 F.2d 665, 673 n. 9 (5th Cir.1991) (when considering an allegation of pretext, defendant must convince the district court that the prosecution\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual by introducing \u201cevidence of comparability\u201d). Specifically, the <em>Reed </em>court noted that the <em>Brown </em>court determined \u201cthere [was] some indication that both the prosecution and the court failed to take the compara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>tive features of two venire members into account,\u201d and it concluded, after comparing those two members, that, under <em>Miller-El II, </em>a further explanation from the prosecution for the dismissal of the excluded juror was necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 373-74. The <em>Reed </em>court ultimately concluded, after considering, among other things, Reed\u2019s comparative juror analysis, that Reed was entitled to habeas relief with respect to his <em>Batson </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 375-82. This court therefore reversed the district court\u2019s decision denying relief and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to grant the writ. <em>Id. </em>at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">When reviewing a <em>Batson </em>ruling regarding purposeful discrimination, the Supreme Court has initially considered statistical evidence when considering whether the prosecution used its peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner. <em>See Miller-El I, </em>537 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 1029; <em>Miller-El II, </em>545 U.S. at 240-41, 125 S.Ct. 2317. In <em>Miller-El I, </em>prosecutors used ten of their fourteen peremptory strikes against African-American venire members, thereby excluding ninety-one percent of the eligible African-American venire members. <em>Miller-El I, </em>537 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 1029. The Court concluded that \u201c[hjappenstance is unlikely to produce this disparity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, the prosecutor used eight of his eleven peremptory strikes against African-American venire members, thereby excluding 100% of the eligible African-American venire members. While we agree with the district and magistrate judges that this fact alone is not dispositive, <em>see Fields, </em>588 F.3d at 281, it is unlikely to be the product of happenstance and is indicative of discriminatory intent. <em>Miller-El I, </em>537 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\u201cMore powerful than these bare statistics, however, are side-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to serve.\u201d <em>Miller-El II, </em>545 U.S at 241, 125 S.Ct. 2317. \u201c[Wje are also cognizant that the Supreme Court has made plain that appellate review of alleged <em>Batson </em>errors is not a hollow act.\u201d <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>533 F.3d 269, 274 (5th Cir.2008) (addressing a <em>Batson </em>challenge on direct criminal appeal). Sometimes the reasons given for striking jurors are \u201crace-neutral\u201d when \u201c[vjiewed in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. \u201cHowever, the explanation^] [may] falter[] upon closer examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to engage in the appropriate analysis, we will examine both jurors and then compare them to other non-African-American jurors who were not struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">B. <em>Prospective Juror Jackson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">After Hayes objected that all eligible African-American venire members were struck in a discriminatory manner in violation of <em>Batson, </em>the prosecutor proffered numerous \u201crace-neutral\u201d explanations. With respect to Juror #16 Jackson, the prosecutor asserted the following explanations: (1) Jackson gave inconsistent answers to questions regarding whether she would require the State to introduce a firearm into evidence to convict Hayes, thus indicating she might hold the State to a higher burden of proof; (2) Jackson stated that a primary goal of the criminal justice system was rehabilitation; and (3) at the time of the trial, Jackson had a cousin who was out on bond in a pending criminal case in Dallas County, Texas. Hayes\u2019s defense counsel responded that the State\u2019s reasons for striking Jackson were pretextual. He argued that the State used hypothetical questions regarding the need to see a weapon as a cover for impermissibly striking jurors by presenting a slanted one-sided explanation of the weapon requirement without fully exploring it. The prosecutor argued that she presented the questions fairly; that all of the jurors who gave inconsistent an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>swers regarding the firearm were struck; that punishment was the major focus in this case; and that those jurors who responded that punishment and rehabilitation were important were not struck because the State had only ten strikes and that was all the State had to justify striking those jurors. The state trial court overruled Hayes\u2019s objection as to Jackson, finding that Jackson gave inconsistent answers regarding whether she would require the State to introduce a firearm into evidence to convict Hayes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In the federal district court, Hayes focused on a comparative analysis of the pool. He argued that non-African-American Juror # 5 Newsome, who was not struck by the prosecution, also gave inconsistent answers concerning the need to introduce a firearm to convict. Hayes argued that several non-African-American jurors, who were not struck, stated that rehabilitation was one of the important goals of the criminal justice system (Stanton # 7, Stevens # 18, Fain # 25, Sapp # 27, Olivares # 28, Ryan # 41, Doyle # 42, Crump # 44, and Noble # 45). Hayes also argued that several non-African-American jurors, who were not struck, had relatives who had been prosecuted for crimes and had stated that they believed that their relatives had received excessive sentences (Keeble # 29, Artieschoufsky # 40, Ryan # 41), whereas Jackson stated that her cousin had been treated fairly by the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The district court rejected these arguments and found that the reasons the State gave for striking Jackson were distinguishable from the characteristics of the seated jurors. Specifically, the district court determined that the State struck Jackson in part because she had a cousin who had pending criminal charges in Dallas County, and none of the seated jurors had a relative with pending criminal charges in Dallas County. The district court determined that the record indicated that Jackson did give inconsistent answers when asked if she would require the State to introduce a firearm in order to convict Hayes. The district court also determined that Jackson was distinguishable from Juror # 5 Newsome because, in the district court\u2019s view, Jackson gave arguably inconsistent answers concerning the need to produce a firearm even after the law was explained. The district court did not address the prosecutor\u2019s third reason for striking Jackson, her statement that rehabilitation was an important goal of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">We disagree with the conclusions of the district court. Hayes has shown that the State\u2019s reasons for striking Jackson were implausible or invalid and, therefore, were pretexts for discrimination. First, regarding the alleged inconsistency, Jackson initially stated that she thought the State should produce a firearm in order to convict Hayes. After the trial court explained the law to the jury, the State did not question Jackson further concerning introduction of the firearm. In response to defense counsel\u2019s questions, Jackson at first stated that she would need to see the firearm if she did not believe the eyewitness; she then stated that the State need not produce a firearm if she believed the eyewitness testimony. Accordingly, Hayes has shown that Jackson\u2019s answers to the questions were not inconsistent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that she ultimately answered that the State would not need to produce a firearm if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>presented credible eyewitness testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the prosecutor attempted to challenge Jackson for cause on precisely these grounds before using a peremptory strike and the trial court ruled that Jackson remained qualified for the jury due to the fact that she affirmatively stated she would accept testimony in lieu of physical evidence. As such, any misperception that Jackson was inconsistent was put to rest by the trial court well before the prosecutor advanced inconsistency as the justification for the State\u2019s strike. Nonetheless, even if the \u201cinconsistency\u201d justification was plausible notwithstanding all of the above, Hayes correctly notes that the trial court failed to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s clearly established <em>Batson </em>protocol. The required comparative analysis would have demonstrated that non-African American Juror Newsome also gave inconsistent answers to the same series of questions. In short, a proper application of <em>Miller-El II </em>in the broader context of this voir dire would have required Jackson\u2019s reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">Second, the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpending charges\u201d justification similarly lacks credibility, and the trial court\u2019s contrary conclusion runs afoul of clearly established federal law under the required comparative framework. Although Jackson had a cousin with pending criminal charges, she also stated that she believed her cousin was being treated fairly in the criminal justice system. Moreover, Jackson stated that her cousin\u2019s pending case would not affect her jury service. Although no other jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>had family members or friends with pending criminal cases, numerous jurors had family members or friends who had criminal convictions. As Hayes pointed out, some of these non-African-American potential jurors had relatives that the potential jurors believed were treated unfairly by the system or received harsh sentences (Keeble # 29, Artieschoufsky # 40, and Ryan # 41). While the district court divorced the question of pendency from the question of fairness/severity, we find that these two concerns are inextricably intertwined because the quality of each juror\u2019s prior experience directly informs the credibility of using that experience as a justification to strike. Viewed in that way, the decision to strike Jackson, with her favorable view of the justice system, rather than Keeble, Artieschoufsky, or Ryan, who had personal objections to that same system, cannot be justified under comparative analysis. Again, properly applying <em>Miller- El II, </em>the trial court had clear Supreme Court guidance mandating Jackson\u2019s reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Hayes has thus shown that the reasons given by the State for striking Jackson also applied to non-African-American jurors who were not struck. In particular, Juror # 5 Newsome, a non-African-American prospective juror, gave inconsistent answers concerning the need to see a firearm to convict. Numerous non-African-American jurors, who were not struck, stated that rehabilitation was a primary goal of the criminal justice system. (Stanton # 7, Stevens # 18, Fain # 25, Sapp #27, Olivares #28, Ryan #41, Doyle # 42, Crump # 44, and Noble # 45). Several non-African-American jurors, who were not struck, had relatives who had been prosecuted for crimes. (Keeble # 29, Artieschoufsky # 40, Ryan # 41). When these non-African-Americans were questioned further concerning their relatives with criminal convictions, they stated that they believed their relatives received harsh sentences. (Keeble # 29, Artieschoufsky # 40, Ryan # 41). Juror # 41 Ryan was ultimately chosen to serve on the jury. In view of these comparisons, Hayes has shown that the state trial court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in examining the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking Jackson. <em>See Miller-El II, </em>545 U.S. at 247, 251-52, 125 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">C. <em>Prospective Juror Richard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">With respect to Juror # 15 Cynthia Richard, the district court erred in deferring to the state court\u2019s decision to a greater degree than directed by <em>Miller-El </em>and <em>Snyder. </em>The district court stated that \u201cbased on all of the circumstances, a trial court could have found that the prosecutor lacked credibility in her explanation of why she struck Richard. However, the Court does not agree that the trial court was obliged to so find.\u201d The district court\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with the analysis in <em>Miller-El II, Snyder, </em>and <em>Reed </em>in its approach to reviewing the state court\u2019s determination in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">The prosecutor advanced three allegedly race-neutral subjective explanations for striking Richard: (1) she was \u201chostile,\u201d (2) she failed to respond to the judge\u2019s questions <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; and she had a \u201cbad juror rating.\u201d The prosecutor also offered two \u201cobjective\u201d justifications: (1) Richard was employed as a teacher and (2) she selected \u201crehabilitation\u201d as an important goal of the criminal justice system. The \u201cobjective\u201d factors are quickly dispatched: two white jurors were teachers and served on the jury; other persons who selected rehabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tation served on the jury and, notably, Richard did not in fact select the \u201crehabilitation\u201d option.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The state trial judge also did not appear to credit these reasons but, instead, focused on the \u201chostility\u201d prong.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While <em>Snyder </em>requires deference to a state trial court\u2019s finding of credibility, the state trial judge here did not expressly find that the explanation was truthful. <em>See Snyder, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1209. Instead, the trial court focused on the concept that hostility is a valid basis for striking a juror. But the state trial judge stated that he observed no such hostility from Richard. More importantly, he never made any finding regarding whether \u201chostility\u201d was the prosecutor\u2019s true motive. Taken against the trial court\u2019s statements with respect to both Juror Hashaway and Juror Jackson, it appears that the trial judge\u2019s analysis was based upon whether the proffered explanation was a \u201cvalid\u201d reason to strike a juror peremptorily, not on whether the reason given was \u201ctrue\u201d or, more pointedly, whether the prosecutor was telling the truth. In this respect, then, the state trial judge unreasonably failed to apply clearly established law to the facts by failing to examine not just the validity of the reason but the credibility of the prosecutor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is particularly a problem because neither the judge nor defense counsel observed this supposed hostility. Thus, while it is true that hostility towards a lawyer could be a valid race-neutral reason to strike a prospective juror, we have no clear answer to the question of whether Richard was actually hostile. The answers to the voir dire questions evince no hostility. The judge saw none. The judge did not affirmatively find the prosecutor\u2019s testimony credible, only the reason given to be one that, if true, is a valid reason to strike. This case is thus similar to <em>Snyder </em>where no finding as to demeanor was made, and the United States Supreme Court found no deference could thus be given. 128 S.Ct. at 1209. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s failure to overrule the strike of Richard represents an unreasonable application of clearly established law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The district court correctly noted the highly deferential AEDPA review standard for this case. However, as numerous cases from the Supreme Court and our court have made clear, the deference is not unlimited. Where, as here, the state court unreasonably applied Supreme Court precedent to the facts, the federal courts must act to correct the error. Therefore, we REVERSE and REMAND with instructions to grant the writ, set aside Hayes\u2019s conviction and sentence, and order Hayes\u2019s release from custody unless the State grants Hayes a new trial within a reasonable time to be set as a date certain by the federal district court in its order on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Ap-pellee claims we are barred from considering this information as it was not presented to the state appellate courts. This argument is without merit. We have held that we will consider additional information where evidence presented supplements but does not fundamentally alter the claim presented to the state courts. <em>Anderson v. Johnson, </em>338 F.3d 382, 386-87 (5th Cir.2003). Hayes has consistently argued that the prosecutor offered pretextual justifications for striking the African-American jurors. In providing the juror cards and printouts, Hayes merely added evidentiary support to the claim he has raised in every court to address his case. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88 (holding that presenting a habeas claim in a \"stronger evidentiary posture\u201d does not trigger an exhaustion dismissal where the petitioner does not seek to advance \"a ground [for relief] that is entirely independent of the grounds presented in the state courts.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).

Any sense that the state trial judge implicitly found the prosecutor to be generally credible and free from race-based bias is undermined by the sustaining of the <em>Batson </em>challenge as to Hashaway.
