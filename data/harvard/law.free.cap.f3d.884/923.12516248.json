We conclude that it isn't. Because the district court never entered a separate judgment, Rule 58(c) 's alternative provision for entry of judgment kicked in after 150 days. Plumb didn't file his notice of appeal until more than 30 days thereafter. Consequently, his appeal of the special verdict is untimely, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Harrison Orr was driving five miles per hour below the highway's posted limit. He was 76 years old, and his license plates indicated that he had a disability. California\n   Highway Patrol (\"CHP\") officer Jay Brame observed Orr's vehicle drift halfway into the next lane. Brame pulled him over, suspecting that he was driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Although Orr was cooperative and answered Brame's questions, his pupils were constricted, his speech was slurred, and he couldn't maintain his balance unassisted. Orr explained that his trouble balancing was due to a brainstem stroke that he had suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A second officer, Plumb, came to assist. A breath test ruled out alcohol intoxication. Orr agreed to go with the officers to the station for drug testing but told them he couldn't be handcuffed because he needed the use of his hands and arms for balance and control. Orr passively resisted being handcuffed by folding his arms across his chest and twisting his upper torso back and forth. When Brame wasn't looking, Plumb punched Orr in the stomach. Orr fell to the ground, and the officers handcuffed him. At the station, they determined he wasn't under the influence of drugs. Orr was charged with resisting arrest but later released. The district attorney declined to prosecute Orr due to insufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Orr sued the two officers and the CHP on various federal and state law grounds regarding the arrest, the amount of force used, and defendants' alleged failure to accommodate his disability. On June 17, 2015, the jury returned a special verdict that was entirely favorable to Brame and the CHP. But the jury found that Plumb used excessive force in arresting Orr and awarded $125,000 in damages. The same day, the clerk entered the special verdict into the docket along with a minute order stating, \"verdict returned, read and filed in favor of plaintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following week, Plumb moved for judgment as a matter of law (\"JMOL\") under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). The district court denied the motion in a July 8, 2015 order. Plumb filed a notice of appeal later that month. The notice specified that he was appealing the JMOL ruling and gave no indication that he intended to appeal anything else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August 2015, Orr moved for attorneys' fees. In December, while the fee motion was under submission, Plumb submitted his opening brief in the appeal of the JMOL order. Like the notice of appeal, the opening brief contained no hint that Plumb planned to appeal anything else. In fact, Plumb stated that the JMOL order \"was the district court's final one on the issues of [his] liability.\" On December 22, 2015, the district court partially granted Orr's request for attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plumb filed a second notice of appeal on January 4, 2016, stating that the appeal was \"from Judgment based on the Special Verdict.\" He asserted that the judgment \"was entered as a matter of law pursuant to [ Rule] 58(c)(2)(B) 150 days after the [JMOL order].\" Orr appealed the order regarding attorneys' fees on January 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 1, 2016, the district clerk signed and entered a document captioned \"Judgment in a Civil Case.\" The clerk's judgment ordered \"that judgment is hereby entered in accordance with the jury verdict rendered 6/17/2015.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the briefing in Plumb's appeal of the JMOL order was complete, we consolidated the three appeals. The parties then submitted a second round of briefing addressing this appeal and Orr's appeal of the fee order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Unless the district court extends the deadline within the prescribed time,\n   \"the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowles v.

Since its adoption in 1938, the rule has been consistent in two respects. It requires prompt entry of judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it distinguishes between the \"uncomplicated\" judgments that are normally issued by the clerk without further direction from the court and the more complex ones that require the court's involvement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, advisory committee's note to 1963 amendment. In particular, judgments on general jury verdicts may be entered by the clerk without the court's direction, but the court must \"approve the form of the judgment\" on a jury special verdict. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Notwithstanding this consistency, Rule 58 has undergone two significant changes. In 1963 it was amended to require that every judgment \"be set forth on a separate document.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a).

Prior to this amendment, parties frequently had difficulty ascertaining whether a court's ruling contained all of the elements of a judgment and thus whether it started the time limits for post-trial motions and appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, advisory committee's note to 1963 amendment. The confusion could have harsh consequences, particularly with the rule then in effect that a premature notice of appeal was ineffectual if certain post-decision motions were also filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(a) (1946);\n   <em>\n    Otis v.

Courts often neglected to enter judgment on a separate document, with the result that the time to appeal never began to run. To address the \"many and horridly confused problems\" created by these lapses, Rule 58 was amended in 2002 \"to ensure that appeal time does not linger on indefinitely.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, advisory committee's note to 2002 amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Currently, for purposes of appeal and post-decision motion deadlines, final judgments are entered \"the earlier of\" the date that the decision is set out in a separate document and 150 days after it is entered in the docket. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(c)(2). In other words, if both \"court and clerk fail to comply with [the] simple requirement\" of entering final judgment on a separate document, then judgment is constructively entered on the 150th day. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, advisory committee's note to 2002 amendment. For orders resolving certain separately appealable post-decision motions, including JMOL motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), no separate document is required; \"judgment\" on these orders occurs when they are entered in the docket.

Rule 4(a)(4)(A) pertains to six post-decision motions, including one for JMOL under Rule 50(b). Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(i). It provides that if a party timely files one of these motions, then \"the time to file an appeal runs ... from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663269\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/189/#p196\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 4(a)(4)(A). Rule 58 is in accord. It provides that \"an order disposing of a motion\" for JMOL under Rule 50(b) does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   require a separate document setting out the judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1), and judgment on the JMOL order therefore occurs \"when the judgment [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the order] is entered in the civil docket.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663269\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/189/#p196\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 58(c)(1). There is no basis for imputing entry of an unnecessary separate judgment 150 days after entry of the JMOL order. Moreover, Plumb's theory conflicts with our previous holding that when the district court rules on a Rule 50(b) motion before entering final judgment in the case, the time to appeal runs from the entry of final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ABF Capital Corp. v.

There are several problems with this theory. To begin with, \"[t]he rules plainly provide that judgment is entered when it is set forth on a separate document\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   when 150 days have run, whichever is earlier.\"\n   <em>\n    Stephanie-Cardona LLC v.

Unfortunately, Plumb's \"untimely\" appeal was the result of a procedural morass not of Plumb's making, and should not result in the loss of his right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A chronology of the pertinent proceedings provides context for my analysis. On July 8, 2015, the district court denied Plumb's motion filed pursuant to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On July 27, 2015, Plumb filed a notice of appeal from the district court's denial of his Rule 50(b) motion. On December 22, 2015, the district court entered its order awarding Orr attorneys' fees and costs. On January 4, 2016, Plum filed a notice of appeal of the jury's special verdict. Almost thirty days subsequent to the filing of Plumb's notice of appeal, the district court belatedly entered final judgment \"in accordance with the [special] jury verdict rendered 6/17/2015.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Every judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document, but a separate document is not required for an order disposing of a motion ... for judgment under Rule 50(b)...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1). Consequently, the court was not required to separately enter judgment for its order denying Plumb's motion filed pursuant to Rule 50(b). However, the same is not true as to the special\n   verdict. Addressing that \"form of judgment,\" Rule 58 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [T]he\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   must\n   <em>\n    promptly\n   </em>\n   approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when ... (A) the jury returns a special verdict with answers to written questions ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b)(2) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This provision is in stark contrast to Rule 58(b)(1), which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [T]he clerk must,\n   <em>\n    without awaiting the court's direction\n   </em>\n   , promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment when ... (A) the jury returns a general verdict ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thus, the federal rules direct the clerk to promptly enter judgment without any action on the part of the court if a general verdict is rendered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b)(1). In contrast, if a special verdict is rendered, the clerk may enter \"the form of judgment\" only after approval by the court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b)(2). The heading for Rule 58(b)(2) says it all: \"\n   <strong>\n    Court's Approval Required.\n   </strong>\n   \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is undisputed that a special verdict was rendered in this case on June 17, 2015. It is also undisputed that the district court failed to promptly approve the special verdict form, belatedly approving the special verdict form on February 1, 2016, after Padgett filed two notices of appeal, including one challenging the special verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although Padgett's notice of appeal was filed prior to the district court's approval of the special verdict, the majority nevertheless concludes that Padgett's appeal was untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Majority Opinion\n   </em>\n   , pp. 930-31. To reach this result, the majority maintains that judgment on the jury special verdict was \"\n   <em>\n    constructively entered\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Majority Opinion\n   </em>\n   , p. 929 (emphasis added). However, the rule governing special verdicts makes no allowance for the \"constructive\" entry of judgment. Rather, the rule imposes an affirmative requirement on the judge to approve the special verdict before it is filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Interestingly, the majority seeks to subtly shift the blame to Plumb by suggesting that he could have \"requested that judgment be set out in a separate document.\"\n   <em>\n    Majority Opinion\n   </em>\n   , p. 931 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(d) ). There are two problems with the majority's suggestion: 1) compliance with Rule 58(d) does not eliminate the court's failure to comply with Rule 58(b)(2), and 2) it should not be the responsibility of a party to remind the court to adhere to the rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The majority's reliance on the Fifth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Burnley v. City of San Antonio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663269\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/189/#p196\">\n    470 F.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2006) is misplaced in my view. In its analysis, the Fifth Circuit completely ignored the language of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(b)(2), which explicitly references a special verdict and relied instead on the language of Rule 58(b)(1), which addresses only general verdicts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 195. This faulty analysis is singularly unpersuasive and encourages noncompliance with the procedural rules. In the twelve years since this case was decided, no other circuit has adopted this wayward analysis of Rule 58, which completely reads Rule 58(b)(2) out of the procedural rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because the district court failed to approve the special verdict form before Plumb filed his notice of appeal, the appeal\n   was timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We should decide Plumb's appeal of the special verdict on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    This interpretation of the facts gives the district court the benefit of the doubt. If, as the majority notes, the district court judge was required to sign the judgment, Rule 58(b)(2) is yet unsatisfied.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Majority Opinion\n    </em>\n    , pp. 930-31.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    As the majority noted, \"[t]here's no penalty for filing a premature notice of appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     Majority Opinion\n    </em>\n    , p. 931.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
