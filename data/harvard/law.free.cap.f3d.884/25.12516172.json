Rivera's sentence in this respect is less forgiving than the life-without-parole sentence that\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   deemed disproportionate.

And that is because I read\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   to require judges to undertake such a further inquiry if the question whether the sentence gives rise to an inference of gross disproportionality-when viewed abstractly-is at least fairly debatable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This more holistic approach accords with the approach that is often taken in applying the Eighth Amendment.

Rivera was involved in a series of putative drug transactions with, among other people, a group of FBI agents who were merely pretending to be drug traffickers. That the only person other than Rivera who was involved in each of the fake transactions was an FBI agent conducting a sting rather than an actual drug trafficker hardly makes Rivera's course of conduct\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   concerning than if he had been dealing with the same actual drug trafficker in each transaction. Yet, due to a quirk of conspiracy law and the way that it interacts with \u00a7 924(c), his involvement in an FBI-engineered sting rather than a true drug trafficking conspiracy dramatically increased his sentencing exposure under \u00a7 924(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Specifically, under our precedent, Rivera could not have been charged with participating in a single overarching conspiracy due to the way the FBI staged the sting.

It helped to pave the way for the more-than-century-long mandatory\n   prison sentence that he received under \u00a7 924(c). Each of his six \u00a7 924(c) convictions was predicated on one of the underlying drug conspiracy convictions that corresponded to Rivera's participation in one of the six fake drug transactions that the FBI staged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Notably, though, if Rivera had participated in the same type of extended conspiracy with a real drug trafficker standing in the stead of the FBI agent who was present for each of the six transactions, and if Rivera had then been charged with participating in a single, extended conspiracy for his course of conduct, he could have been sentenced under \u00a7 924(c) to a prison term of only five years for possessing a firearm in furtherance of that conspiracy. And that is because a single conspiracy conviction may not serve as the predicate for multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582422\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/85/#p111\">\n    525 F.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars multiple \u00a7 924(c) offenses predicated on the defendant's conviction for participation in a single conspiracy), no matter how large or extended that predicate conspiracy happens to be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this way, then, \u00a7 924(c) itself appears to treat the very same course of conspiratorial conduct in which Rivera engaged far more leniently depending on how that course of conduct happens to be charged. After all, Rivera received a mandatory sentence that is more than twenty-five times greater than the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   received. And Rivera received that sentence, even though, just like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , Rivera was found to have committed multiple acts of gun possession in the course of committing a predicate offense and even though these acts were as a functional matter part and parcel of a single-somewhat extended-criminal conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera-Ruperto II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277076\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1/#p17\">\n    852 F.3d at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582422\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/85/#p111\">\n    525 F.3d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To be sure, in addition to his conspiracy convictions, Rivera was also convicted of six counts of attempted drug possession with intent to distribute, and those convictions independently served as predicates for his \u00a7 924(c) convictions. But the conduct underlying those predicate attempt convictions was itself part and parcel of the conduct that could have supported charging Rivera with participating in one extended conspiracy, had an FBI agent not been the only other party to the whole of it.

The consideration of these last two criteria reveals that Rivera's severe sentence is most unusual when compared to the sentences that have been imposed for crimes that would seem to be no less serious.

His crimes are more serious than the minor one that triggered the sentence that\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   struck down. But, Rivera received the harshest of prison sentences for crimes that\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   does not treat as being of the most serious kind. Moreover, comparative analyses reveal that his sentence is an outlier. I thus conclude that, if\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   were the last word, then Rivera's sentence would be grossly disproportionate.

And, for that reason, it is less clear to me that simply because it might be rational for a legislature to think that Rivera's conduct warranted punishment as severe as the punishment that Harmelin received, a court should not proceed to assess how much of an outlier such a sentence is before determining whether that sentence violates the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence noted, the life-without-parole sentence in that case was mandated pursuant to a carefully calibrated and graduated penalty scheme in which the Michigan legislature specially singled out only a subset of precisely defined large-quantity drug possession crimes for such harsh punishment.

And thus, perhaps, in such a circumstance, there is less need to check the judicial intuition about the proportionality of a mandatory life-without-parole sentence for a large-quantity drug possession offense against actual legislative practice than the dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   thought there was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But even if, in light of the legislative care taken in Michigan, the sentence at issue in\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   warranted such deferential review, uninfluenced by real-world sentencing practices, I cannot see what the case would be for applying the same limited form of review here. In contrast to the focused sentencing scheme considered in\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   , which targeted only carefully specified large-quantity drug possession\n   crimes, \u00a7 924(c) criminalizes much conduct that-given that statute's famously ambiguous scope-is in its nature not similarly precisely knowable to legislators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Moreover, \u00a7 924(c) imposes a sentence as harsh as the one that Rivera received only because the statute requires the stacking of various individual \u00a7 924(c) sentences. As explained above, under \u00a7 924(c), a first conviction leads to a mandatory sentence of five years, and each \"second or subsequent conviction\" mandates an additional twenty-five year prison term that must be served consecutively.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(i), 924(c)(1)(C)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In consequence, life-without-parole sentences may be required under \u00a7 924(c) for an astoundingly wide array of possible offense combinations, including mixes potentially of both state and federal offenses and various combinations of predicate drug offenses, whether or not paired with \"crime[s] of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). For this reason, too, it is pure fiction to imagine that Congress, in requiring a sentence of imprisonment for more than 100 years with no chance of parole, was focused on the type of drug-related conduct at issue in this case in the way that the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence understood the Michigan legislature to have been focused on the much more precisely defined type of drug-related conduct singled out for harsh punishment in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nor is there anything in \u00a7 924(c)'s legislative history to indicate that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 924(c), gave the kind of focused consideration to potential sentencing implications in a case of this sort that the concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   plainly thought that the Michigan legislature had given to the type of case presented there.

Nor was any mention made of the draconian results that could follow from the \"stacking\" of \u00a7 924(c) sentences, let alone of the Eighth Amendment implications of doing so when multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions are handed down at a single trial or across a pair of trials and thus before the defendant has served time for any of them and demonstrated that punishment will not deter him from future criminal conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The concern that Congress did not give focused consideration is not allayed by the text of \u00a7 924(c).

And there is nothing to indicate that Congress has subsequently ratified that previously sharply-contested conclusion about what \"second or subsequent\" means in any way that would suggest that Congress did so while focused on the type of conduct that is at issue here, given that Rivera's acts were part and parcel of a single, albeit extended, course of conspiratorial conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Moreover, unlike the scheme at issue in\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 924(c) subjects offenders to mandatory life-without-parole sentences even for predicate drug offenses that-like ones for conspiracy-are inchoate.

It seems to me quite another to do so when that sentence does not appear to have been the product of such serious and careful legislative thought and may in fact have been the result of an exercise of a prosecutor's decision to break one course of conduct into many discrete offenses. For, in that event, the judge in rejecting a challenge to the sentence's proportionality is deferring to a hypothesized legislative choice, notwithstanding that there in fact may be no legislature-not even the one\n   imposing the sentence-that has both thoughtfully focused on the need for such a sentence for such conduct and then carefully chosen to mandate it as a proportionate response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   There is a second reason for my concern about applying the constricted form of the analysis that the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence requires in this case.\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   was decided at a time at which, on the concurrence's own account, a state was trying out a new means of responding to a serious crime problem that was causing great concern.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107767\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/957/#p1006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that circumstance, the concurrence expressed its understandable wariness about the federal Constitution's proportionality requirement being construed in a manner that would invalidate one state's \"bold experiment\" and thereby stifle the kind of innovation that our federal system invites.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107767\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/957/#p1006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107767\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/957/#p1006\">\n    at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107767\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/957/#p1006\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , the minimum sentence that a defendant can receive must be based on the minimum conduct criminalized by a statute, that is, the elements of that crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would thus seem that, in evaluating the proportionality of a particular mandatory sentence, we must likewise look to the least of the conduct criminalized by the elements of the offense. Consideration of anything further-like conduct alleged in the indictment or found at sentencing to have occurred-would impermissibly permit the assessment of the sentence's proportionality to be based on conduct that had not been found by a factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt, even though under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   the mandatory sentence may not be imposed based on such conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   did not have the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   . But, insofar as\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   indicates that the focus must be on the least of the conduct criminalized in evaluating a sentence's proportionality, the potential consequences of following the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence's extremely deferential approach in the context of \u00a7 924(c) become even more concerning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Consider in this regard that, seemingly contrary to\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   's logic, the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence reasoned that the sentence there at issue was not disproportionate because Harmelin \"possessed\" 672.5 grams of \"undiluted cocaine\" as well as assorted drug paraphernalia,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107767\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/957/#p1006\">\n    501 U.S. at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107767\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/957/#p1006\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Kennedy, J.).

But, of course, such a mixture could contain a much smaller amount of the actual drug.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Puertas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2231046\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/122/626/\">\n    122 Mich.App. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=332%20N.W.2d%20399\">\n    332 N.W.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (1983). And thus the least of the conduct criminalized there could not have caused the same harm that the concurrence attributed to the defendant's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Still, there is no doubt that the Michigan legislature did intend to mandate a life-without-parole sentence for even that \"mixture\" crime, given how clearly the statute at issue set forth that penalty scheme. By contrast, it is less clear to me that Congress would have been fully aware of just how minimal the conduct could be that would result in a \"forever\" sentence under \u00a7 924(c). As I have explained, \u00a7 924(c)'s scope is notoriously ambiguous, the statute encompasses even inchoate crimes, and it requires the \"stacking\" of mandatory sentences even for related conduct that results in multiple convictions at a single trial due to a prosecutorial choice to divvy up the conduct. Thus, in light of how\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   suggests proportionality review must now proceed, there is additional reason to doubt that Congress, in enacting this sentencing regime, contemplated the full implications of its mandate, even if that mandate does encompass a range of cases involving more serious conduct that Congress no doubt had in view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The second line of post-\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   cases that I have in mind further gives me pause about applying the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence's\n   more limited form of\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   review here.

He was, after all, an adult, not a child, when he committed his crimes. And judges are not entitled to second-guess the wisdom of the penal judgments of legislatures. Instead, judges are supposed to accord them deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   But, at least in a case involving a sentence this harsh for crimes of this type, one would think that such deference would stem from confidence that the legislature has in fact made a considered penal judgment to impose such an unforgiving sentence and from careful consideration of the way in which offenders more generally are punished for comparable or even worse conduct. For such confidence and consideration would ensure that judges in deferring to a legislative judgment are recognized to be engaged in an understandable, rather than an unforgivable, means of carrying out their duty to say what the constitutional prohibition against \"cruel and unusual\" punishment is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Thus, in light of the concerns that the Court has recently expressed about the imposition of life-without-parole sentences, I do not see how the kind of abstract review that is contemplated under the first\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   criterion-and that the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence requires us to treat as dispositive here-can suffice to permit us to determine whether Rivera's sentence is grossly disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment. In my view, a comparative assessment, grounded in actual legislative practice, should be required to inform the judge's assessment of proportionality in such a case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Such a requirement would prevent judges from simply substituting their own preferences for legislative ones in evaluating whether a mandatory life-without-parole sentence is cruel and unusual. Such a requirement would also ensure that the judicial assessment of a mandatory life-without-parole sentence for drug-related offenses of the sort at issue here does not unduly discount the defendant's Eighth Amendment right to be protected from grossly disproportionate punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Rivera faces the longest and most unforgiving possible prison sentence for conduct that, though serious, is not of the most serious kind. He does so not because the legislature had authorized its imposition and a judge had then considered all of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and determined that this sentence was appropriate. He does so only because Congress has been deemed to have made a blanket judgment that even an offender like Rivera-who has no prior criminal record and whose series of related crimes resulted in no harm to an identifiable victim-should have no hope of ever living free. And he does so even though virtually every comparable jurisdiction punishes comparable criminal conduct less harshly, and even though the federal government itself punishes nearly the same or seemingly worse conduct more leniently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Almost three decades have now passed since the concurring Justices in\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concluded, without reference to real-world comparative benchmarks, that the Eighth Amendment afforded the Michigan legislature the scope to try out what at the time was viewed as a permissible sentencing experiment to address a newly concerning crime problem. In those intervening decades, virtually no jurisdiction has been willing to replicate that state's experiment. In fact, even the state that the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence permitted to try it has abandoned it. And yet the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   concurrence still controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In my view, a consequence as grave as the one that\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   requires in a case like this should have the imprimatur of more than only a nearly three-decade old, three-Justice concurrence. I thus urge the Supreme Court to consider whether the Eighth Amendment permits, at least in a case such as this, the mandatory stacking of sentences under \u00a7 924(c) that-due to their cumulative length-necessarily results in the imposition of a mandatory sentence of life without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    LIPEZ,\n    <em>\n     Circuit Judge\n    </em>\n    , statement regarding the denial of rehearing\n   </strong>\n   .

In his petition for rehearing in each case, Rivera likewise challenges the proportionality of his sentence cumulatively. I note that, even considering only the sentence that Rivera received in\n    <em>\n     Rivera-Ruperto II\n    </em>\n    , he still faces an inherently greater-than-life sentence-105 years-solely on the basis of his \u00a7 924(c) convictions.\n    <em>\n     Rivera-Ruperto II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277076\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1/#p17\">\n     852 F.3d at 13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, because that more-than-100 year sentence was imposed before Rivera was sentenced in\n    <em>\n     Rivera I\n    </em>\n    for his sixth \u00a7 924(c) conviction, his additional twenty-five year sentence for that sixth \u00a7 924(c) conviction was necessarily a sentence that would extend his already-imposed 100-year-plus \u00a7 924(c) sentence another twenty-five years. Thus, it makes sense to consider those two sentences cumulatively for purposes of addressing his Eighth Amendment challenge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Prior to\n    <em>\n     Rummel\n    </em>\n    , in\n    <em>\n     Weems\n    </em>\n    ,\"the Court had struck down as cruel and unusual punishment a sentence of\n    <em>\n     cadena temporal\n    </em>\n    imposed by a Philippine Court.

That being the case, I find it hard to credit that Congress made a considered judgment that such a course of conspiratorial conduct merits a sentence of this extreme length, unless the defendant conspires with real drug traffickers and the prosecutor chooses to treat the entire course of conduct as a single extended conspiracy, in which case a prison sentence of five years will do just fine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Nor is my concern about how considered the congressional judgment was for conduct like that at issue in this case diminished by the fact that Rivera's \u00a7 924(c) convictions were predicated not only on his underlying conspiracy convictions but also on his underlying convictions for attempted possession with the intent to distribute a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine.
