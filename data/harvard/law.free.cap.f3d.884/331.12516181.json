The specific question in these appeals is whether convictions under a portion of the Wisconsin burglary statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20943.10\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 943.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1m)(a), qualify as convictions for violent felonies under the federal Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The outcome of these appeals depends on whether the Wisconsin statute is \"divisible\" or not, which depends in turn on the sometimes slippery distinction between a crime's \"elements\" and \"means.\" In short, if the burglary statute is divisible, then we must affirm; if it is not divisible, we must reverse. We find that the statute is divisible, so we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Both defendants in these consolidated appeals, Dennis Franklin and Shane Sahm, pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a felon. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The district court found that both men had three prior burglary convictions that were violent felonies under the ACCA. The court therefore sentenced them both to the mandatory minimum of fifteen years in prison. See \u00a7 924(e)(1). On appeal, Franklin and Sahm contend that their prior convictions for burglary in Wisconsin are not violent felonies under the ACCA so their sentences could be no more than ten years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Franklin was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. On Thanksgiving Day in 2014, Madison police responded to a report of a residential burglary in progress and arrested Franklin at the scene. When searching the area, police found a gun that Franklin had hidden nearby. Franklin pleaded guilty to possessing a gun unlawfully. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A probation officer recommended in the presentence report that Franklin be sentenced as an armed career criminal. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The report explained that he had at least three convictions for violent felonies under the statute: armed burglary in 1994, two burglaries and an attempted\n   burglary in 2001, and burglary in 2003, all in Wisconsin. Franklin argued that he should not be sentenced as an armed career criminal because Wisconsin's burglary statute is broader than the generic crime of burglary under the ACCA. The district court ruled that Franklin was an armed career criminal and imposed the mandatory minimum 180-month sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sahm's story is similar. He stole three guns and sold them. Sahm too was a convicted felon, and he was also charged with and pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a felon. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Sahm had three relevant prior convictions: burglary in 1997, and two burglaries in 2008, all in Wisconsin for burglarizing \"a building or dwelling.\" See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20943.10\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 943.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1m)(a). Sahm argued that his burglary convictions were not for \"generic burglary\" and thus should not count as violent felonies under the ACCA. The district court disagreed and imposed the mandatory minimum 180-month sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The framework for our analysis is familiar because of the volume of similar cases. Under the ACCA, a conviction for \"burglary\" counts as a violent felony.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii). In\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p598\">\n    495 U.S. 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 598,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p598\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p598\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), the Supreme Court held that the federal statute requires a conviction for \"generic burglary,\" which is defined, regardless of labels under state law, as \"an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" In evaluating a conviction under the ACCA definition,\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   further explained, a sentencing court must use the \"categorical approach,\" which focuses on the elements of the statutory offense, not the particular facts of the defendant's crime.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 601-02,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p598\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, if a state burglary statute is broader than \"generic burglary\" by applying, for example, to unlawful entries into vehicles as well as buildings or structures, then a conviction does not count under the ACCA definition even if the defendant in fact committed the prior offense by unlawfully entering a building. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2250,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Descamps v.

It provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Whoever intentionally enters any of the following places without the consent of the person in lawful possession and with intent to steal or commit a felony in such place is guilty of a Class F felony:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (a) Any building or dwelling; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (b) An enclosed railroad car; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (c) An enclosed portion of any ship or vessel; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (d) A locked enclosed cargo portion of a truck or trailer; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (e) A motor home or other motorized type of home or a trailer home, whether or not any person is living in any such home; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (f) A room within any of the above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because the Wisconsin statute extends to several types of vehicles, it is broader than \"generic burglary\" under\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and the ACCA. That does not end the inquiry, though. If the statute is \"divisible\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   among portions that are within the scope of generic burglary and those that are outside it, then the sentencing court may apply the \"modified categorical approach.\" That allows the court to look at court records to determine whether the defendant was convicted under a portion of the statute within the scope of generic burglary.\n   <em>\n    Shepard v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/\">\n    544 U.S. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). If he was, then the conviction may count as a violent felony under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   That's how the notion of divisibility takes center stage in these appeals. So how do we decide divisibility? The key is to figure out whether the different locations in the Wisconsin statute signal different elements and thus different crimes (equals divisible) or are merely different means for committing the same crime (equals not divisible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The most extensive guidance from the Supreme Court on this question appears in\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"Elements\" are a crime's \"constituent parts,\" which a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt or a defendant must admit when pleading guilty. \"Means\" are extraneous to the crime's constituent parts; they are different factual scenarios that do not create legal consequences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A crime counts as \"burglary\" and thus as a violent felony under the ACCA if its elements-not the means of satisfying the elements-are the same as or narrower than the generic definition of burglary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, any ruling from the state supreme court on the means v. elements question is dispositive, as it was in\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   itself.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, though, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has not addressed the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, the statute on its face may resolve the issue. For example, if the alternatives carry different punishments, they are elements of different crimes,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., but that is not the case here. On the other hand, if the statute \"offer[s] illustrative examples,\" then it lists means of committing the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The Wisconsin burglary statute does not use such language. The statute could also \"itself identify which things must be charged (and so are elements) and which need not be (and so are means).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, if the question is still unresolved, a court may \"peek\" at \"the record of a prior conviction itself\"-such as indictments and jury instructions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n    at 2256-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the documents charge the alternatives collectively, they may be means, but if they charge one alternative to the exclusion of others, they are likely elements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We recently applied\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   to just one subsection of Wisconsin's burglary statute in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354409\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/831/#p838\">\n    836 F.3d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838 (7th Cir. 2016), where we held that a prior burglary conviction for violating \u00a7 943.10(1m)(a), the first subsection, did not count as a \"crime of violence\" under the Sentencing Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). At the time, the Guidelines included burglary only of a \"dwelling,\" not burglary of other buildings, as a crime of violence. (In this way, the old guideline definition differed from the generic burglary definition used under the ACCA.) The first subsection of the Wisconsin statute, which covers burglary of \"any building or dwelling,\" is too broad to qualify as a crime of violence under the older guideline\n   definition unless the subsection itself is divisible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We held in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   that subsection (a) is not divisible, explaining that the structure of the entire burglary statute and the phrasing of the subsections indicate that any particular subsection is not divisible. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354409\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/831/#p838\">\n    836 F.3d at 837-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That holding in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   does not answer the question before us. First, subsection (a) covering burglary of \"any building or dwelling\" fits within the definition of generic burglary under the ACCA, which refers to \"a building or other structure.\" Second, the issue here is whether the Wisconsin burglary statute\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   is divisible among its subsections, not whether a particular subsection itself is divisible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the absence of a definitive holding from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, we start, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , with the statute's text and structure. In the statute, all burglary crimes are classified as \"Class F\" felonies, meaning that the subsections carry the same punishment and thus are not necessarily distinct elements. The statute opens by defining those crimes as entering without consent \"any of the following places\" and with intent either to steal or commit a felony, and then has six subsections enumerating locations. These subsections cover dwellings, railroad cars, ships, mobile homes, and cargo portions of trucks. The last subsection, \u00a7 943.10(1m)(f), is a little different, covering \"a room within any of the above\" locations, so it overlaps each of the other subsections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We put aside subsection (f) for these appeals since they present no issue under it. We conclude that the remaining subsections in \u00a7 943.10(1m) are distinct and divisible. Each subsection can be delineated from the others (i.e., buildings, railroad cars, ships, motor homes, cargo portions of trucks). The alternatives within each subsection overlap a great deal (i.e., building v. dwelling, ship v. vessel, truck v. trailer, motor home v. trailer home). As a result, we are not concerned as we were in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   that a prosecutor could charge two burglary counts under different subsections for one act. One might conceive of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   overlap between subsections at the margins-for example, a houseboat could be both a dwelling and a ship. But we think that the defendants overstate the concern about double-charging. No subsection duplicates another in principle. And the greater variety among the subsections, as compared to within each of them, satisfies us that the subsections signal distinct locations that are intended to be enumerated alternative elements rather than mere \"illustrative examples.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As compared to the Iowa burglary statute in\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , the Wisconsin burglary statute's structure reinforces our conclusion. The Iowa statute applies to burglarizing an \"occupied structure\" and defines that term in a separate section. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20713.1\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 713.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702.12. By contrast, the Wisconsin statute does not use a generic term for the locational element; instead, it enumerates each potential location. This enumeration means that Wisconsin prosecutors usually charge a specific subsection for each burglary offense-something that would be impossible under the Iowa statute. And indeed Wisconsin courts nearly always report the subsection under which the defendant was charged or convicted. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Scruggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279262\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/373/312/\">\n    373 Wis.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279262\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/373/312/\">\n    891 N.W.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789 (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

We have trouble imagining a case in which a jury could convict a Wisconsin defendant of burglary where six jurors were convinced that the defendant burglarized a retail store (a \"building\" under subsection (a) ) while the other six were convinced that he burglarized a motor home parked behind the store (under subsection (e) ).
