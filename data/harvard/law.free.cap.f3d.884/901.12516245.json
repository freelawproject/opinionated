FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Olympic Forest Coalition (\"Olympic Forest\") brought suit against Coast Seafoods Company (\"Coast\") under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\" or \"Act\"), contending that discharges from Coast's oyster hatchery through \"pipes, ditches, and channels\" require a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") permit. Coast moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that its hatchery is an aquatic animal production facility that can be regulated as a \"point source\" under the CWA only if it is a \"concentrated aquatic animal production facility\" (\"CAAPF\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court denied Coast's motion to dismiss, holding that pipes, ditches, and channels that discharge pollutants from its hatchery are point sources within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14).

Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We recount the facts as alleged in the complaint and as supplemented by a letter from the Washington State Department of Ecology of which we have taken judicial notice. The complaint alleges that Coast owns and operates a cold-water oyster hatchery adjacent to Quilcene Bay, near the north end of Hood Canal in Washington State. Coast's hatchery is the world's largest shellfish hatchery, capable of producing over 45 billion eyed oyster larvae per year. As part of its operation, the hatchery discharges pollutants into Quilcene Bay through pipes, ditches, and channels, including the following: \"suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorous, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, Chlorophyll\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   , Phaeoshytin\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   , heat, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaint further alleges that Coast hired a consulting firm, Rensel Associates Aquatic Sciences (\"Rensel Associates\"), to assess the effluent discharged from the hatchery. After sampling the effluent, Rensel Associates produced a report on February 7, 2013, that documented the presence of certain pollutants in the effluent. However, Rensel Associates did not sample all sources of effluent from the hatchery and did not test for the presence of chlorine. The complaint alleges that water quality samples taken from Quilcene Bay on June 25, June 29, July 2, July 9, July 11, July 16, and July 17, 2014, indicated discharges of chlorine from Coast's hatchery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 27, 2016, Olympic Forest filed a citizen suit under \u00a7 505 of the CWA, alleging that discharges from the hatchery through pipes, ditches, and channels violate \u00a7 301(a) of the Act because the hatchery has not obtained a NPDES permit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1311(a). Pipes, ditches, and channels are \"point sources\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 19, 2016, six months after Olympic Forest filed its complaint, Coast wrote a letter to the Washington Department of Ecology (\"Ecology\"), referencing the 2013 Rensel Report and asking \"whether the Department of Ecology's (Ecology) view, communicated in 2013, that Coast's Quilcene shellfish hatchery does not require a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, is still applicable.\" On July 29, 2016, ten days later, Ecology responded that an NPDES permit was not required. Ecology gave two reasons for its conclusion. First, the hatchery did not meet the criteria for automatic designation as a CAAPF under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.24\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Appendix C. Second, \"[an] Ecology surface water monitoring specialist had reviewed the report and concurred with Dr. Rensel's findings that discharge from facility was unlikely to alter the Quilcene Bay water quality.\" We have taken judicial notice of Ecology's July 29 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Coast moved under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the complaint, contending that despite the hatchery's use of pipes, ditches, and channels to discharge pollutants into Quilcene Bay, a NPDES permit was not required. Coast argued to the district court, and argues here, that its hatchery can be required to obtain an NPDES permit only if it is a CAAPF. A CAAPF is a subcategory of the statutory category \"concentrated animal feeding operation\" (\"CAFO\"), which is a point source under \u00a7 1362(14). Coast argues that an aquatic animal production facility-including any pipes, ditches, and channels associated with the facility-is a point source only if it\n   is a CAAPF. Thus, it argues, pipes, ditches, and channels that discharge pollutants from an aquatic animal production facility cannot themselves be point sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court denied Coast's motion to dismiss. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.

EPA Definitions of CAFOs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Coast contends that the text of the CWA is unclear, and that we should defer under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   to the interpretation of the CWA by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The EPA is not a party to this litigation and has taken no position in this litigation on the question before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Coast points to EPA regulations defining CAFOs, contending that the regulations provide clarity that is lacking in the text of the statute. According to Coast, the regulations require us to hold that an aquatic animal production facility, and any pipes, ditches, and channels discharging pollutants from that facility, can be regulated as a point source only if it is a CAAPF. That is, according to Coast, pipes, ditches, and channels are not point sources if they discharge pollutants from an aquatic animal production facility that is not a CAAPF. A description of the EPA's CAFO regulations shows why Coast is right in contending that the text of the CWA is unclear with respect to CAFOs, but wrong in contending that the lack of clarity is relevant to the question before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As indicated above, a \"concentrated animal feeding operation,\" or CAFO, is listed in \u00a7 1362(14) as a point source. There are two subcategories of the statutory category CAFO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The first subcategory is a CAFO for land-based animals. This subcategory, called a CAFO in EPA regulations, is defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.23\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The criteria specified in the regulation are quite elaborate, and it is not necessary to describe all of them here.

This subcategory, called a CAAPF in EPA regulations, is defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.24\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There are two ways in which an aquatic animal production facility may be designated a CAAPF. First, a facility is a CAAPF if it meets the criteria set forth in Appendix C to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.24\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). For cold-water aquatic animals such as salmon and oysters, a facility must meet the following criteria. The facility must \"discharge at least 30 days per year\"; it must produce at least 9,090 \"harvest weight kilograms ... of aquatic animals per year\"; and it must feed at least \"2,272 kilograms ... of food during the calendar month of maximum feeding.\" Appendix C (a). Second, a facility that does not meet the criteria of Appendix C may be designated a CAAPF by the Director of the EPA, or by an authorized state official, on a case-by-case basis after\n   an in-person inspection of the facility.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.24\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 122.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)-(c), 122.25(a). Factors to be considered in making such a designation are: \"(i) The location and quality of the receiving waters of the United States; (ii) The holding, feeding, and production capacities of the facility; (iii) The quantity and nature of the pollutants reaching waters of the United States; and (iv) Other relevant factors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 122.24(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We agree with Coast that the EPA's CAFO regulations resolve a lack of clarity in the CWA. Section 1362(14) provides that a \"concentrated animal feeding operation\" is a point source, but the words \"concentrated\" and \"operation\" are not self-defining. The regulations just described provide a precision that is lacking in the statutory language. However, the lack of clarity in the statutory term \"concentrated animal feeding operation\" is irrelevant here, for the meaning of that term is not the question before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The question is whether \"pipes, ditches, [and] channels\" and \"concentrated animal feeding operations\" are all point sources. Sections 122.23 and 122.24 of the EPA regulations tell us only what a CAFO is. These regulations do not purport to tell us whether pipes, ditches, and channels that discharge effluents from non-concentrated aquatic animal production facilities are point sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   C. Practical Sense of the Permitting Scheme\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It makes practical sense that a CAFO is itself a point source. A CAFO can discharge pollutants through pipes, ditches, channels, or similar conduits; but it often discharges pollutants directly, without using any such conduit. For example, a CAFO for land-based animals such as a cattle feeding lot can discharge pollutants from a manure storage \"lagoon\" into navigable waters through direct seepage into the earth or through overflows from the lagoon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Waterkeeper All., Inc. v. E.P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546929\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/486/#p494\">\n    399 F.3d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"[P]ollutants can infiltrate the surface waters in a variety of ways including ... overflows from storage 'lagoons[.]' \"). A CAFO for aquatic animals, such as a salmon farm, often discharges pollutants directly into navigable waters. Since a CAFO requires an NPDES permit, the permit covers all discharges from the CAFO however the discharges are made, including through pipes, ditches, and channels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Cmty. Ass'n for Restoration of the Env't v. Henry Bosma Dairy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11392154\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/943/#p955\">\n    305 F.3d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 955 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"[F]ields where manure is stored and ditches therein are part of the CAFO and thus, point sources\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It also makes practical sense that pipes, ditches, and channels that discharge pollutants from a non-concentrated aquatic animal production facility are point sources. If the facility is not a CAAPF, it cannot be required to obtain an NPDES permit as a CAAPF. But the fact that an aquatic animal production facility is not a CAAPF does not mean that the facility does not discharge pollutants through pipes, ditches, and channels. To the degree that such a facility discharges pollutants through pipes, ditches, and channels, those pipes, ditches, and channels are point sources. If they were not point sources, a non-concentrated aquatic animal production facility would be free to pollute at will, exempt from any regulation under the CWA and the NPDES system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Coast disagrees, arguing that a non-concentrated aquatic animal production facility is necessarily not a significant contributor of pollution. That is, if the facility does not satisfy the criteria of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.24\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Appendix C, and has not been designated a CAAPF by the Director or an authorized state official applying the factors\n   listed in \u00a7 122.24(c), the facility is necessarily not a significant polluter. Therefore, argues Coast, it does not make sense to characterize as point sources pipes, ditches, and channels that discharge pollutants from non-concentrated aquatic animal production facilities. Coast's argument is refuted in the very case before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As described above, on July 19, 2016, after Olympic Forest filed its complaint in this case, Coast wrote a letter to Washington's Department of Ecology (\"Ecology\"), asking whether its oyster hatchery was required to obtain an NPDES permit. Three years earlier, based on the Rensel Report, Ecology had concluded that Coast's hatchery did not need an NPDES permit. On July 29, Ecology responded to Coast's letter, stating that a permit was not required and giving two reasons. First, Coast's hatchery did not satisfy the criteria of Appendix C for a CAAPF. Second, based on the Rensel Report, the hatchery did not otherwise qualify as a CAAPF. Ecology wrote, referring to its earlier decision, \"[an] Ecology surface water monitoring specialist had reviewed the report and concurred with Dr. Rensel's findings that discharge from facility was unlikely to alter the Quilcene Bay water quality.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ecology thus determined that Coast's hatchery did not meet the criteria of a CAAPF specified in \u00a7 122.24, Appendix C. That factual determination is not disputed. Ecology further determined that the hatchery did not meet the criteria for designation as a CAAPF under \u00a7 122.24(c). The manner in which Ecology made this second determination reveals the flaw in Coast's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In concluding in 2013 and again in 2016 that Coast's hatchery is not a CAAPF under \u00a7 122.24(c), Ecology relied on the Rensel Report, which was commissioned and paid for by Coast. There is no indication in Ecology's July 29, 2016, letter to Coast that Ecology ever conducted its own assessment of pollutants discharged from the hatchery, or that it considered any other source of information than the Report. According to the complaint, significant amounts of chlorine are discharged from Coast's hatchery through pipes, ditches, and channels. However, Rensel Associates failed to test for chlorine, and the Report upon which Ecology relied accordingly reported no chlorine discharges. Assuming, as we must, that the allegations in the complaint are true, there are discharges of chlorine from the hatchery's pipes, ditches, and channels that require an NPDES permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    APHETI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, citing\n   <em>\n    Ass'n to Protect Hammersley, Eld, &amp; Totten Inlets v.

In the passage from\n   <em>\n    APHETI\n   </em>\n   upon which Coast relies, we were responding to a different argument, one that addressed two kinds of \"facilities.\" We therefore conclude, contrary to Coast's contention, that we did not in\n   <em>\n    APHETI\n   </em>\n   decide the question before us today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We affirm the district court.
