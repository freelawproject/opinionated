Although our prior\n   <em>\n    Boaz\n   </em>\n   decision predates\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's invalidation of the residual clause, the decision supports the proposition that we should treat the Missouri and Arizona statutes similarly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Boaz's responses are unpersuasive.

Boaz suggests that the quoted language indicates that the statute criminalizes any conduct \"likely to endanger\" others and that his conviction therefore does not \"necessarily\" involve the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1232091\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/22/338/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275344\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/750/#p752\">\n    870 F.3d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
