Because Mitchell had a history of mental health issues and displayed \"agitated behavior, elevated and irritable mood,\" and had \"delusions,\" a state court judge ordered a competency evaluation. That evaluation found that Mitchell \"was an appropriate candidate for the [state's] Jail Diversion Program.\" Mitchell, however, \"refuse[d] to accept [those] services.\" As a result, instead of transferring Mitchell to a mental health facility, the state sent him to Hampton Roads Regional Jail (\"the Regional Jail\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While at the Regional Jail, a psychologist again evaluated Mitchell and found him \"both manic and psychotic.\" The psychologist concluded that Mitchell \"lacked the capacity to assist counsel in preparing\n   a defense\" and \"urged\" the court \"to commit Mitchell to the Department of Behavioral Health [&amp; Developmental Services] for inpatient treatment to restore his competency.\" The state court accordingly issued a Competency Restoration Order (\"Competency Order\"), which, \"in an effort to restore him to competency,\" directed that Mitchell \"be treated at Eastern State Hospital\" (\"the Hospital\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mitchell never received such treatment. The clerk of the court did not notify the Hospital of Mitchell's Competency Order for two months. When the Hospital did receive the Competency Order, the person responsible for processing it \"put the fax [containing the Competency Order] in her desk drawer and took no further action.\" As a result, no one ever entered Mitchell's name into the list of individuals waiting for beds at the Hospital. Instead, Mitchell remained at the Regional Jail, where he did not receive necessary medical care and guards denied him food and water, allowed him to live in a cell covered by feces and urine, and physically abused him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 19, 2015, Mitchell died from \"wasting syndrome\" or severe malnutrition. Months after Mitchell's death, the Office of the State Inspector General reported that the Hospital almost never operated at capacity, and that state-wide, there were more empty beds available at state mental hospitals than there were inmates waiting for beds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During these events, Debra K. Ferguson served as the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health &amp; Developmental Services, the agency responsible for overseeing state mental health hospitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Adams alleges that Ferguson \"had a statutory duty ... to transfer Mitchell and other incompetent individuals to appropriate hospitals and to provide them restorative inpatient health care.\" Instead, Ferguson \"deliberately failed to comply with [the Competency Order] concerning Mitchell, thus impeding Mitchell's access to adequate medical care.\" Accordingly, Adams sued Ferguson under Virginia law for \"negligence, gross negligence, and willful and wanton negligence,\" and under \u00a7 1983 for constitutional violations resulting from \"denial, delay, and withholding of medical care\"; \"deprivation of civil rights\"; and \"deliberate indifference.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ferguson moved to dismiss all counts against her, claiming sovereign immunity, qualified immunity, and that the complaint did not state a claim under \u00a7 1983 or state law. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, who recommended dismissal of all claims alleged against Ferguson. Adams objected to that recommendation, and on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the district court denied Ferguson's motion to dismiss in its entirety. The court found that neither sovereign nor qualified immunity protected Ferguson from suit and that Adams had sufficiently pled all of her claims against Ferguson. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before we can address the substantive issues in this case, we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In general, we have jurisdiction only to review final judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we ordinarily lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suarez Corp. Indus. v. McGraw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910650\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/222/#p225\">\n    125 F.3d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225 (4th Cir. 1997). One exception to this general rule is the collateral order doctrine. That doctrine permits appellate review of a \"small class\" of orders \"that are conclusive,\n   that resolve important questions separate from the merits, and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.\"\n   <em>\n    Mohawk Indus., Inc. v.

Thus, pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, we have jurisdiction over Ferguson's claimed immunity defenses to Adams's \u00a7 1983 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ferguson contends that the collateral order doctrine also grants us jurisdiction to review the district court's decision not to dismiss the state law claims asserted against her. In her reply brief, she maintains that this is so because the Virginia \"public duty doctrine ... affords public officials immunity from suit\" under state law. Appellant Reply Br. at 16. This argument fails. As an initial matter, Ferguson has waived the right to assert this argument. In moving to dismiss her state law claims, she maintained only that she was \"entitled to sovereign immunity\"; she did not mention the public duty doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castendet-Lewis v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276776\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/253/#p259\">\n    855 F.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259 (4th Cir. 2017). Moreover, it is not at all clear that the \"public duty doctrine\" constitutes an immunity from suit. As Ferguson herself admits, the Supreme Court of Virginia has never so held. Appellant Reply Br. at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Alternatively, Ferguson maintains that we have pendent jurisdiction to review the sufficiency of Adams's state law claims. Appellant Reply Br. at 20-21. But \"pendent appellate jurisdiction is available only (1) when an issue is 'inextricably intertwined' with a question that is the proper subject of an immediate appeal; or (2) when review of a jurisdictionally insufficient issue is 'necessary to ensure meaningful review' of an immediately appealable issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Rux v.

Whether Ferguson owed Mitchell a duty under state negligence law is neither \"inextricably intertwined\" with the question of whether Ferguson owed Mitchell a duty under the United States Constitution, nor is it \"necessary\" to resolve these state law issues to \"ensure meaningful review\" of Ferguson's claimed federal constitutional immunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the district court's denial of Ferguson's motion to dismiss Adams's state law claims and remand those claims to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We next turn to Ferguson's assertion that the Eleventh Amendment provides her with absolute immunity from suit. \"We review questions of the applicability of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Harter v.

This is true even with respect to an inmate subject to a Competency Order or equivalent court order directing treatment of the inmate's mental health needs. Adams has not identified any case law that holds that mentally ill prisoners housed in state prisons, including those subject to Competency Orders or the like, must be transferred to state mental health hospitals to escape an excessive risk to their health. Nor have we found any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Virginia law requires prisons to provide mental health services to inmates. Va. Code \u00a7 53.1-32(A) (\"It shall be the general purpose of the state correctional facilities to provide ... medical and mental health care and treatment ....\"). The Competency Order scheme presumes that inmates with serious mental health conditions are\n   <em>\n    more likely\n   </em>\n   to have their competency restored if they receive treatment at a state mental health hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 19.2-169.2. But that does not mean that inmates with such conditions who remain in Virginia's prison system are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   subject to an \"excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/\">\n    511 U.S. at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We are not blind to the fact that many prison systems offer inadequate mental\n   health care. But we are unaware of any clearly established law (or indeed, any law at all) holding that prisons are, as a general rule, unfit to house mentally ill inmates. Instead, inmates regularly challenge, and judges regularly address, the provision of prison mental health services on a system-by-system, facility-by-facility, and prisoner-by-prisoner basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Of course, in this case, the complaint alleges that prison officials affirmatively denied Mitchell his constitutional right to personal health and safety. It maintains that prison guards denied Mitchell food, turned off the water to his cell, and allowed him to live in a less-than-human state. Prison medical staff assertedly provided Mitchell little-to-no medication or treatment for severe mental and physical ailments. The complaint further alleges that guards forced Mitchell \"to the ground, dragged, sprayed with mace, stood upon, punched and kicked\" him, and that after he died, \"a correctional officer employee ... attempted to clean Mitchell's cell\" to hide the evidence of this systemic mistreatment. Adams has brought suit against some forty-nine other defendants in an effort to hold them liable for this conduct. But these are not the claims alleged against Ferguson. In assessing whether she is entitled to qualified immunity, we must differentiate the claims made against other defendants from those asserted against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Tenth Circuit recently undertook a similar analysis in\n   <em>\n    Blackmon v. Sutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n    734 F.3d 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2013), which concerned the treatment of a juvenile in a detention facility. The court, in an opinion by then-Judge Gorsuch, denied qualified immunity for defendants who allegedly \"shackled\" the plaintiff to a restraining chair and allowed \"a fully grown man ... to sit on the [plaintiff's] chest\" \"simply ... to punish him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n    at 1242-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also denied qualified immunity for prison officials who \"were well aware of\" the plaintiff's \"grave mental health problems\" but \"delayed or denied\" the plaintiff's access to necessary medical care.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n    at 1244-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the\n   <em>\n    Blackmon\n   </em>\n   court rejected the claim that the director of the facility violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights by \"failing to transfer him to\" a less restrictive facility pending trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n    at 1246-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that the plaintiff had not shown \"that his placement in the juvenile detention facility\n   <em>\n    automatically and alone\n   </em>\n   amounted to an 'objectively excessive risk' to his health and safety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n    at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Said differently, it was not clear that, absent the use of excessive force or denial of access to medical care, placing the plaintiff in the detention center and denying him a transfer\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violated the Constitution. The court therefore granted the director qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The same is true here. Adams has alleged conduct by many other defendants that, if true, clearly violates the Constitution. But her claim against Ferguson turns on \"five words: 'waiting lists and empty beds.' \" Appellee Br. at 2. Our qualified immunity analysis must therefore focus on this conduct, and this claim, alone: that-in her own words-it is clearly established\n   that \"plausible allegations of 'waiting lists and empty beds' state claims for relief\" under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719193\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We cannot hold that they do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Time and again, the Supreme Court has reiterated that for a right to be clearly established, \"existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question\n   <em>\n    beyond debate\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2044 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pauly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12608520\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/548/#p551\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[i]n the last five years,\" the Supreme Court had \"issued a number of opinions reversing\" denials of qualified immunity (citing\n   <em>\n    Sheehan\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 1774 n.3, which collected cases doing so) ).
