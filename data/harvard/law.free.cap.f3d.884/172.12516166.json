E.W. sat in an aisle seat on one side of the bus while another student, A.W., sat diagonally across from her in an aisle seat one row behind E.W. on the opposite side of the bus. The two schoolgirls both had their feet in the aisle: E.W. was facing sideways with her feet in the aisle, and A.W. was facing forward with her left leg in the aisle, extended in the direction of E.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Video footage from the school bus's surveillance camera shows A.W. swaying her left knee from side to side in the aisle. ECF No. 18 (DVD filed with Joint Appendix, hereinafter \"Video\"), at 0:10. Several seconds later A.W. raised her left leg in the air and made a sudden, stomping motion in the direction of E.W.'s leg. Video 0:24. E.W. later reported that A.W. had stomped on her shoe. In response to the stomp, E.W. immediately stood up and faced A.W., who was slouched in her seat. Video 0:26. The bus driver then asked E.W. what she was doing. E.W. sat down, took off her backpack, and removed what appeared to be two lanyards from around her neck. Video 0:26-38. A few seconds later, E.W. stood up again and raised her leg towards A.W. Video 0:40. As E.W. raised her leg, A.W., still sitting, also raised hers. Video 0:40. Because A.W. was slouched in her seat, she was able to extend her leg further than she would have sitting fully upright. The two girls appear to trade kicks before E.W. put her leg down and A.W. slid lower into her seat. Video 0:41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   E.W. then stood over A.W. and began hitting her, swinging her arms downward because of their height difference. Video 0:41-45. Although the seat in front of A.W. obscured the camera's view of the scuffle, the way A.W. was sitting suggests that E.W.'s swings likely landed on A.W.'s left arm, shoulder, and possibly her head. Video 0:46-48. After four seconds, E.W. returned to her seat. Video 0:46-48. Shortly thereafter, E.W. looked at A.W., stood up, and again moved in A.W.'s direction. Video 0:54-55. A.W. raised her leg in the air, and E.W. kicked at A.W.'s shoe several times while A.W. kicked back. Video 0:56-59. During the exchange of kicks, A.W. appeared\n   to laugh and say something to E.W. Video 0:56-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This exchange drew the attention of the bus driver, who called both E.W. and A.W. to the front of the bus and eventually suspended both girls from the bus for three days. Video 1:00-2:15; J.A. 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On Friday, January 9, 2015, the school contacted Appellee Rosemary Dolgos, a deputy sheriff and school resource officer (\"SRO\") in Wicomico County, about the scuffle. When she arrived at the school, Dolgos watched the surveillance video described above. Dolgos spoke to A.W. first, asking her if she was injured. A.W. pulled up her left pant leg, and Dolgos observed \"two small, bluish bruise[s]\" above the left knee and one on the side of A.W.'s leg. J.A. 23. Notably, no other injuries, including upper body injuries, were reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   E.W. was then removed from class and placed in a closed office with Dolgos and two school administrators. Dolgos told E.W. that she was there to discuss what took place on the bus. But, in Dolgos's estimation, \"E.W. [did not] seem to care.\" J.A. 23. E.W. explained, \"A.W. stepped on my shoe so I kicked her and started to hit her.\" J.A. 23. Dolgos attempted to emphasize to E.W. the seriousness of the situation and the possible repercussions, telling her that adults could be jailed for such behavior. Still, in Dolgos's opinion, \"E.W. continued to act as if the situation simply was not a 'big deal.' \" J.A. 23. Dolgos then decided to take E.W. into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dolgos placed E.W. in handcuffs from behind and reseated her. Dolgos inserted two fingers between the handcuffs and E.W.'s wrists to ensure that they were not too tight. In her affidavit, Dolgos stated that she was concerned about the physical safety of herself and the school administrators because of both the incident she observed in the surveillance video and E.W.'s apathy. Dolgos expressed concern in the affidavit that E.W. might act violently against her or someone else if she attempted to walk E.W. from the school to her patrol car. Dolgos also admitted, however, that she had no idea whether E.W. had \"any past or current behavioral issues or past involvements with law enforcement.\" J.A. 24. According to Dolgos, E.W. stood 4'4\" and weighed about 95 pounds, while Dolgos stands 5'4\" and weighs 155 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Immediately after being handcuffed, E.W. began to cry. She explained that she did not want to go to jail and that she would not hit A.W. again. Dolgos kept her handcuffed for about two minutes as she cried and apologized. Dolgos averred that E.W. never complained that the handcuffs were too tight or displayed bruises to her. Rather, \"[i]n response\" to E.W.'s show of remorse, Dolgos decided not to arrest E.W. and removed the handcuffs. J.A. 24-25. \"Based on [E.W.'s] remorse,\" Dolgos further decided to release E.W. to her parents. J.A. 25. The school contacted E.W.'s mother, T.W., and Dolgos informed T.W. that she would refer the matter to the Wicomico County Department of Juvenile Services. T.W. responded by asking, \"[f]or a kid fight?\" and \"[s]o you're going to put my 10 year old daughter in the system when she's 10?\" J.A. 25. Frustrated and upset by the treatment of her daughter, T.W. retrieved E.W. from the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 29, 2015, E.W., by and through T.W., filed this suit against Dolgos,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging (1) a violation of the Fourth Amendment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for unreasonable seizure and excessive force; (2) a violation of Article 26 of the Maryland\n   Declaration of Rights; (3) battery; and (4) assault. Dolgos filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, which the district court construed as one for summary judgment and then granted. In a short paragraph, without citing any case law, the district court concluded that Dolgos's actions did not amount to excessive force because E.W. was handcuffed for only two minutes and then released to her mother. The court further concluded that Dolgos was \"at least\" entitled to qualified immunity as to the \u00a7 1983 claim. J.A. 71. And as to the state law claims, the court found that E.W. failed to prove that Dolgos acted with malice or gross negligence. E.W. timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   E.W. first maintains that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to Dolgos for her \u00a7 1983 claim.

In fact, Dolgos recognized that E.W. appeared calm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 23-24.

Not to mention, E.W. was in a closed office and surrounded by two school administrators and a deputy sheriff. Given these facts, E.W. posed little threat even if she were to become aggressive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The significant time that had elapsed-without incident-since the fight on the bus further negates any notion that E.W. posed an immediate threat. While the scuffle took place on Tuesday, January 6, East Salisbury Elementary School waited three days to even contact Dolgos. In the interim, E.W. was allowed to and did in fact attend school without incident, indicating that she did not pose a risk to the children around her, much less to the adults.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Ohio 2014) (finding reduced need to use force because student was no longer disruptive when officer arrived). When Dolgos interacted with E.W. on Friday, January 9, E.W. was not hostile or even disobedient. Rather, E.W. remained seated and submissive during the entire interview, even as Dolgos placed the handcuffs on her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, Dolgos had no reason to think that the scuffle between E.W. and A.W. was anything but an isolated incident. E.W. had no prior behavioral issues or involvement with law enforcement, nor did Dolgos have any indication that she did. The use of force is an intrusion on Fourth Amendment rights, and an officer must have a reason for using or escalating force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (intrusions on Fourth Amendment rights must be reasonably necessary given countervailing governmental interests). Even as to the altercation on the school bus, E.W., while unjustified in retaliating, did not become violent without physical provocation by A.W.

Furthermore, as with age, the school context presents unique considerations not present when officers patrol the streets.

Dolgos observed a ten-year-old girl sit calmly and compliantly in a closed office surrounded by three adults and answer questions about an incident with another little girl that had occurred several days prior. Although Dolgos stated she \"believed there was a possibility that [E.W.] could physically act out against me or anyone else nearby as we left the school to go to my patrol car,\" J.A. 24, and although E.W. argues that Dolgos handcuffed her at the outset merely because E.W. \"didn't seem to care\" about the incident with A.W., J.A. 23, Dolgos's subjective motives are not relevant to our reasonableness inquiry.

A reasonable officer, in addition to discerning E.W.'s small stature and calm and compliant disposition, would know that the bus driver who observed the incident between E.W. and A.W. found them mutually culpable, as he suspended both girls from the bus for three days. Further, the officer would know that E.W. attended school and sat in class among\n   other children without incident from Tuesday, January 6, 2015 to Friday, January 9, 2015. No reasonable officer confronted with this information would have determined that handcuffing E.W. for any amount of time was justified under the circumstances.

This is evident from Dolgos's own affidavit. J.A. 24-25. As Dolgos spoke to E.W. about the incident, she observed that E.W. did not seem to care. Displaying the maturity of a ten-year-old child, E.W. believed that the incident was not a big deal because A.W. should not have stepped on her shoe. Due to E.W.'s attitude, Dolgos handcuffed her. And, again much like a ten-year-old child, E.W. began crying profusely and apologizing because she was afraid of going to jail. Dolgos stated that she then removed the handcuffs about two minutes later \"[b]ased on E.W.'s remorse\" and \"[i]n response\" to her crying. J.A. 24-25.

We must be mindful of the long-lasting impact such actions have on these children and their ability to flourish and lead prosperous lives-an impact that should be a matter of grave concern for us all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   SHEDD, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment only:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The majority appears to agree that Deputy Dolgos had probable cause to arrest E.W. for her violent assault on another\n   student and authority to take E.W. into custody for transport to juvenile authorities. Moreover, the majority does not contend that the deputy\n   <em>\n    decided to arrest and take E.W. into custody\n   </em>\n   for an improper reason. For our purposes, therefore, the custodial arrest itself is lawful. Because there is no evidence that Deputy Dolgos used additional force or that E.W. was injured during the arrest, E.W.'s excessive force, assault, and battery claims hinge solely on the deputy's use of handcuffs. Ultimately, the majority affirms summary judgment on immunity grounds, and that holding (with which I agree) suffices to end this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    A.M. v. Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925709\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1123/#p1152\">\n    830 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1152 (10th Cir. 2016) (holding that an officer who lawfully arrested and handcuffed a thirteen-year-old student for disrupting a class by repeatedly burping was entitled to qualified immunity on the student's excessive force claim \"because there was no clearly established law indicating that [the student's] minor status could negate [the officer's] customary right to place an arrestee in handcuffs during the arrest\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Unfortunately, the majority is not content to speak with one voice and resolve this case on the noncontroversial immunity grounds. Instead, the majority reaches out unnecessarily to hold that E.W. has presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on her claims that Deputy Dolgos used excessive force and committed assault and battery by handcuffing her during the custodial arrest. In doing so, the majority disregards the undisputed objective fact that Deputy Dolgos handcuffed E.W. in preparation for transporting her from school to juvenile authorities, thereby erroneously judging the deputy's actions without considering the totality of the circumstances. Compounding this factual error, the majority significantly extends our precedent in a novel and uncertain manner that subjects law enforcement officers to potential liability for simply handcuffing a lawful custodial arrestee. The majority's holding runs counter to the prevailing federal rule and provides little, if any, guidance for law enforcement officers going forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I concur only in the result reached by the majority-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the affirmance of summary judgment in Deputy Dolgos' favor. I write separately to explain my disagreement with the majority's holding regarding the merits of E.W.'s federal and state claims. Simply put, on this record, the deputy's conduct is lawful under federal and state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The following material facts are not disputed. On January 9, 2015, Deputy Dolgos\n   had been a law enforcement officer for more than 15 years, and a school resource officer for over 10 years. That day, she reported to East Salisbury Elementary School, where school officials briefed her about an incident that occurred between E.W. and another female student on a moving school bus three days earlier. The school vice-principal told Deputy Dolgos that the incident was recorded on video and depicted \"an attack by one student on another, and not a fight between students.\" J.A. 22. Deputy Dolgos viewed the video, which shows E.W. standing over and repeatedly hitting and kicking the other student, who was seated on the bus and essentially defenseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Deputy Dolgos interviewed both students individually in a school office and in the presence of one or more school officials. While speaking with the victim, Deputy Dolgos confirmed that she suffered several injuries during the attack. During her interview with E.W., Deputy Dolgos explained why she was there, but E.W. seemed unconcerned about the seriousness of what had happened. E.W. admitted that she kicked the victim at least five times and hit her three times, and she attempted to justify her behavior by claiming that the victim had stepped on her shoe. The victim had denied that assertion in her interview, and Deputy Dolgos did not see the victim do anything in the video to prompt the attack.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deputy Dolgos told E.W. that adults could be jailed for such behavior, but E.W. \"continued to act as if the situation simply was not a 'big deal.' \" J.A. 23. At the conclusion of her interview with E.W., Deputy Dolgos determined that she had probable cause to take E.W. into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Departmental policy specified that juveniles taken into custody for criminal-type offenses were subject to the same security requirements as adults and could \"be handcuffed or otherwise restrained as necessary during transport and processing.\" J.A. 44. This policy instructed officers that in deciding whether to handcuff an arrested juvenile, \"primary importance is the physical safety of all persons present,\" and it specified that officers should consider the number of deputies present and the juvenile's physique, reputation for violence, conduct at the time of arrest, known arrest record, and community standing. J.A. 47-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Deputy Dolgos was the only law enforcement officer on the scene, and other than what she had observed, she \"knew nothing of any past or current behavioral issues or past involvements with law enforcement involving [E.W.]\" J.A. 24. Consistent with departmental policy, she explained her rationale for handcuffing E.W.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   My primary concern was the physical safety of all persons present. I had observed [E.W.] physically attack another student on a moving school bus, and she seemed unconcerned by the seriousness of what had and what might occur.\n   <em>\n    I believed that there was a possibility that [E.W.] could physically act out against me or anyone else nearby as we left the school to go to my patrol car\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   J.A. 24 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Deputy Dolgos handcuffed E.W. in a manner to ensure that the handcuffs were not too tight, she did not use any additional\n   force to secure E.W., and E.W. was not injured during the handcuffing. Shortly after E.W. was handcuffed, she \"began crying, saying that she didn't want to go to jail, and that she wouldn't do it again.\" J.A. 24. In response, Deputy Dolgos consulted with the vice-principal and exercised her discretion to release E.W. from custody and allow her to leave school with a parent. Deputy Dolgos then removed the handcuffs, which had been on E.W. for approximately two minutes. Eventually, E.W.'s mother picked her up from school. Despite releasing E.W. into her mother's custody, Deputy Dolgos was required to inform juvenile authorities about the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The foregoing undisputed evidence establishes that Deputy Dolgos handcuffed E.W. during the course of a lawful custodial arrest\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   in preparation for transporting her from school to juvenile authorities. Critically, however, the majority disregards the undisputed fact that Deputy Dolgos was preparing to transport E.W. from school when she handcuffed her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, calling her \"callous,\"\n   <em>\n    Majority Op.\n   </em>\n   at 188, the majority treats Deputy Dolgos' action as being tantamount to sending E.W. to \"timeout\" for instructive and/or punitive reasons.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Majority Op.\n   </em>\n   , at 181 (stating that \"E.W. was in a closed office and surrounded by two school administrators and a deputy sheriff\" when she was handcuffed); at 188 (\"[Deputy Dolgos] was bothered by E.W.'s lack of remorse or concern for hitting [the victim]. This is evident from [the deputy's] affidavit.\"); at 188 (\"[A] reasonable jury could infer that [Deputy Dolgos'] actions were motivated by a desire to dissuade E.W.'s apathy and induce remorse.\"). Further denigrating Deputy Dolgos' conduct, the majority states that she \"kept [E.W.] handcuffed for about two minutes as she cried and apologized,\"\n   <em>\n    Majority Op.\n   </em>\n   , at 177, clearly implying that the deputy deliberately delayed removing the handcuffs until she was satisfied with E.W.'s remorse. That implication, however, does not accurately reflect what transpired:\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after E.W. started crying, Deputy Dolgos consulted with the vice-principal before deciding to release E.W. into her mother's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects persons from unreasonable seizures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although \"an arrested person is not invariably taken to a police station or confined,\"\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

In\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   , officers responded to an apartment tenant's complaint about children throwing acorns against the side of the apartment building. After observing nine-year-old Latrice Branch throw an object against a window, the officers detained her for destruction of property. The officers mistakenly believed that they were required to transport Branch to the police station for fingerprinting, and standard operating procedure dictated that anytime an officer transported an arrestee (adult or juvenile) to the police station in a police car, the arrestee was to be handcuffed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Initially, the officers intended to handcuff Branch once she was placed in the police car, but a crowd began protesting the arrest, and the officers decided to handcuff Branch immediately. The officers made Branch kneel down while they handcuffed her behind her back, and they placed her in the police car, where she remained for approximately 25 minutes. During that time, Branch was crying, but the officers refused to permit her to speak with her mother. Eventually, the officers issued a juvenile citation and released Branch to her mother's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Branch sued the officers for a variety of federal and state-law claims, including excessive force, assault, and battery. The officers moved for summary judgment, asserting (among other things) that the handcuffing was reasonable and lawful. Analyzing these claims, the court acknowledged that Branch did not try to flee or otherwise resist the arrest and that \"the officers were not in fear\" of her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 641. Even so, the court concluded that summary judgment in the officers' favor was proper. Looking at the constitutional reasonableness of the handcuffing for the federal and state excessive force claims, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   The facts remain that the officers had probable cause to arrest and that [Branch] was not physically injured in any way. Handcuffing [Branch] was entirely reasonable under the circumstances, given that she was already under arrest,\n   <em>\n    she would soon be handcuffed for transport anyway\n   </em>\n   , and the officers feared for her safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 641-42 (emphasis added).

Instead, the undisputed facts establish that: Deputy Dolgos had probable cause to arrest and take E.W. into custody; before she changed her mind, she was preparing E.W. for transport from school to juvenile authorities; and she handcuffed E.W. in preparation for transport. Viewing the totality of circumstances, as we are required to do, and mindful of the universal acceptance of handcuffing custodial arrestees, the inherent danger presented in every custodial arrest, and the natural unpredictability of juveniles, it is clear as a matter of law that the deputy's use of handcuffs in this instance was objectively reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Admittedly, the crime for which E.W. was arrested, although violent, is relatively minor; Deputy Dolgos was larger than E.W.; she applied the handcuffs in the presence of at least one other adult; and E.W. appeared compliant at that moment. However, these facts do not portray the\n   <em>\n    totality\n   </em>\n   of the circumstances. Instead, it is important to recognize that this was a fluid situation, and Deputy Dolgos knew that E.W. had violently attacked a fellow student on a moving school bus a few days earlier. Deputy Dolgos also knew that E.W. seemed unconcerned about the seriousness of her criminal behavior. Moreover, Deputy Dolgos did not know whether E.W. had a history of similar misbehavior, and she certainly could not predict with any sense of assurance how E.W. would react when she began escorting her from the school office to her vehicle for transport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Perhaps E.W. would have gone quietly, but she might also have fled or otherwise resisted. Because Deputy Dolgos decided to release E.W. into her mother's custody, we cannot know how this would have ultimately turned out, but we do know that once E.W. realized she was under arrest, she \"display[ed] the maturity of a ten-year-old child, [and] began crying profusely and apologizing because she was afraid of going to jail.\"\n   <em>\n    Majority Op.\n   </em>\n   , at 188. It is not at all farfetched to envision E.W.'s completely understandable emotional reaction to being arrested escalating beyond mere tears during the custodial transport, and one can easily imagine the outcry if, instead of handcuffing E.W., Deputy Dolgos had chosen, or been forced, to control E.W. using a more physical \"hands on\" approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In short, under the totality of the objective circumstances present in this case, which the majority fails to consider, and in light of the overwhelming acceptance of handcuffing as a lawful incident of a custodial arrest, Deputy Dolgos' use of handcuffs as a relatively minor safety precaution was objectively reasonable. I would\n   hold as a matter of law that Deputy Dolgos did not use excessive force or commit assault or battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As I have explained, the majority's contrary decision is premised on its failure to view Deputy Dolgos' conduct in light of the totality of the objective circumstances. Given our agreement on the immunity issues and the ultimate affirmance of summary judgment in Deputy Dolgos' favor, my disagreement with the majority over the manner in which it has factually analyzed this case ultimately may have little affect beyond this case. However, I believe that the legal underpinnings of the majority's decision portend difficulties for law enforcement officers going forward. Although the majority purports to simply apply the well-established\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors for determining whether Deputy Dolgos used excessive force, it ominously warns that its \"excessive force holding is clearly established for any future qualified immunity cases involving similar circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Majority Op.\n   </em>\n   , at 187. Despite this warning, however, the majority does not clearly define the parameters of its holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   If the excessive force holding is limited to the majority's view of the facts of this case (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Deputy Dolgos handcuffed E.W. for disciplinary reasons with no intention of transporting her), then it seems to be relatively narrow: law enforcement officers may not handcuff an arrested juvenile at school simply to punish or teach him a lesson. Interpreted in this manner, the majority's holding would be rather obvious and unexceptional.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gray v. Bostic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386660\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/1295/#p1300\">\n    458 F.3d 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1307 (11th Cir. 2006) (\"We conclude that Deputy Bostic's conduct in handcuffing Gray, a compliant, nine-year-old girl for the sole purpose of punishing her was an obvious violation of Gray's Fourth Amendment rights.... Every reasonable officer would have known that handcuffing a compliant nine-year-old child for purely punitive purposes is unreasonable.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   I suspect, however, that the majority intends its excessive force holding to be broader. It is certainly not unreasonable to read the majority opinion as opening the door to permit all custodial arrestees to pursue (but not necessarily win) excessive force claims based on the mere fact that they were handcuffed. It may, perhaps, be slightly more reasonable to read the majority opinion as being limited to cases involving the handcuffing of certain juveniles who are arrested at school. Of course, either reading extends well beyond our precedent, runs counter to the prevailing federal rule, and will hinder law enforcement officers in safely and efficiently performing their duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Instead of being able to handcuff arrestees for custodial transport as a matter of course for obvious and practical safety reasons, which is the standard procedure in virtually all custodial arrests, officers subject to the majority decision will now have\n   to make on-the-spot predictions about whether every arrestee will peacefully submit to the arrest and transport. Their\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   predictions will potentially be subjected to judicial second-guessing based on a variety of factors (both known and unknown to the officers) that should be irrelevant to the handcuffing determination. Included among these factors are the relative age or size disparity between the officer and arrestee, the arrestee's gender or background, the potential emotional consequences that an arrestee may one day suffer as a result of the arrest and handcuffing, and anything else a reviewing court may deem to be pertinent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As one example of the difficulties created by the majority's decision, I note that the majority emphasizes that this case does not involve the arrest of an adult \"or even a teenager.\"\n   <em>\n    Majority Op\n   </em>\n   ., at 180. I am skeptical that the majority would find the handcuffing reasonable in this case if E.W. had been a teenager at the time of the arrest, but the arbitrary age distinction implied by the majority illustrates the dilemma that officers face under the majority's analysis. Moreover, age is certainly not the only potential variable in play. Although I am again skeptical whether the majority would find the handcuffing reasonable in this case if E.W. had been taller or heavier, or male, the majority's analysis certainly leaves open that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Unfortunately, law enforcement officers cannot know how courts will view those or any other factors in litigation, and the majority provides no real guidance to assist them. Thus, despite the Supreme Court's unequivocal recognition of the inherent dangers associated with\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   custodial arrests, the majority's decision will inevitably lead officers who are subject to the decision to avoid using handcuffs during some custodial arrests. This restriction is not compelled by the Fourth Amendment or Maryland law, and it will further hinder officers' ability to perform their duties in a safe and effective manner for themselves, the arrestees, and the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   It is apparent that the majority's fundamental complaint is not Deputy Dolgos' use of the handcuffs\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the majority is troubled by the deputy's decision to arrest E.W., which led to the handcuffing and is, itself, the real source of any embarrassment that E.W. may have suffered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2177 ;\n   <em>\n    Atwater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301256\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/318/#p354\">\n    532 U.S. at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301256\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/318/#p354\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite its apparent displeasure about the wisdom of the arrest, which is not a matter within our purview, the majority does not question its legality or the deputy's right to take E.W. into custody for transport. Based on the totality of the objective circumstances, the Fourth Amendment and Maryland law clearly permitted Deputy Dolgos to handcuff E.W. for transport away from school. Unfortunately, the majority has needlessly ruled otherwise. In doing so, it has both besmirched the deputy's professional standing and put many, if not all, law enforcement officers (and perhaps other citizens) in this circuit in a potentially dangerous situation going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Based on the foregoing, I disagree with the majority's determination that Deputy Dolgos is not entitled to summary judgment on the merits of the excessive force, assault, and battery claims. However, I concur in the judgment to the extent that it affirms summary judgment in Deputy Dolgos' favor on immunity grounds.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    E.W. also sued the Wicomico County Sheriff's Department but voluntarily dismissed those claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    We note that E.W. contests the district court's use of the summary judgment standard, but does not appear to challenge the court's conversion of the motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    We generally review a district court's conversion of a motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion for abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Laughlin v.

Certainly, the majority does not disagree that law enforcement officers may lawfully restrain juveniles when they have a legitimate basis for doing so or that juveniles do, in fact, present special security considerations. The majority may disagree that a lawful custodial arrest of a juvenile is a legitimate basis for handcuffing, but there is no doubt that the authorities I have cited support the view that handcuffing an arrested juvenile for custody purposes is generally considered to be entirely lawful.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    <em>\n     Gray\n    </em>\n    is one of several cases cited by the majority that are noteworthy for their inapplicability to this case.
