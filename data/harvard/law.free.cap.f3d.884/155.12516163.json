On March 1, 2016, the Immigration Judge found that Mondragon-Gonzalez's conviction fell within\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E)(i), one of the three statutory\n   grounds for removal advanced by DHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), in pertinent part, provides that \"[a]ny alien who at any time after admission is convicted of ... a crime of child abuse ... is deportable.\" The Immigration Judge concluded that Mondragon-Gonzalez's conviction constituted a \"crime of child abuse\" as that phrase has been interpreted by the BIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Agreeing with the Immigration Judge, the BIA dismissed Mondragon-Gonzalez's appeal.

The Board found that the Immigration Judge was correct in sustaining the grounds for removal under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) because Mondragon-Gonzalez's conviction satisfied the elements of the crime of child abuse as established in the BIA's precedential decisions. Mondragon-Gonzalez timely petitioned for review by our Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mondragon-Gonzalez challenges the BIA decision on two grounds. First, he argues that the Board's definition of what constitutes a crime of child abuse is unreasonable and should not be afforded\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. Second, he insists that the Pennsylvania law of which he stands convicted is not a categorical match of the BIA's interpretation of what constitutes a \"crime of child abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We accord\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review to questions of law, including the BIA's interpretation of the INA, subject to the deference dictated by\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , we take a two-step approach, first deciding whether the statutory provision interpreted by the BIA is ambiguous and then, if it is, giving deference to the BIA's reasonable interpretation of the INA.\n   <em>\n    De Leon-Ochoa v. Att'y Gen. of U.S.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787926\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/341/#p348\">\n    622 F.3d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (3d Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The crime of child abuse is not defined in the INA. Moreover, the meaning of the phrase, \"crime of child abuse,\" as used in \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) is not plain and unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florez v.

We therefore must view the term as ambiguous,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , requiring interpretation, and proceed to the second step of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   inquiry: \"whether the BIA's interpretation 'is based on a permissible construction of the statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011760\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/207/#p211\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Velazquez-Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    24 I. &amp; N.

The Board arrived at the following working definition, interpreting the term broadly to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [A]ny offense involving an intentional, knowing, reckless, or criminally negligent act or omission that constitutes maltreatment of a child or that impairs a\n   child's physical or mental well-being, including sexual abuse or exploitation. At a minimum, this definition encompasses convictions for offenses involving the infliction on a child of physical harm, even if slight; mental or emotional harm, including acts injurious to morals; sexual abuse, including direct acts of sexual contact, but also including acts that induce (or omissions that permit) a child to engage in ... sexually explicit conduct....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Building on this broad definition, the BIA held in a subsequent precedential opinion that the crime of child abuse is not limited to crime that require actual proof of injury to a minor-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , evidence of a physical act.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Soram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n    25 I. &amp; N.

As the BIA explained in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Velazquez-Herrera\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i)\"was enacted ... as part of an aggressive legislative movement to expand the criminal grounds of deportability in general and to create a 'comprehensive statutory scheme to cover crimes against children' in particular.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    24 I. &amp; N.

The BIA correctly determined that the Pennsylvania statute at issue satisfies the necessary intent to be considered child abuse under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n   <em>\n    Velasquez-Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    24 I. &amp;.

Dec. at 704-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mondragon-Gonzalez argues that the Pennsylvania statute does not involve a sufficiently high risk of harm to a child because the statute only criminalizes communication with a child. Mondragon-Gonzalez, however, ignores the fact that a conviction under the Pennsylvania statute requires that the perpetrator \"contacts or communicates with the minor\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of\n   </em>\n   engaging in the prohibited activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Com. v.

Thus, a conviction would not occur under the statute unless it had already\n   been proven that the communication was intended for an illicit sexual purpose, and this is sufficient to create a high risk of harm to a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his Reply Brief, Mondragon-Gonzalez seizes upon the recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Quintana v.

Because Pennsylvania defines \"minor\" for purposes of the crime of unlawful contact with a minor as a person \"under 18 years of age,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%206318\">\n    18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 6318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), Mondragon-Gonzalez contends that the BIA erred in\n   <em>\n    Velazquez-Herrera\n   </em>\n   in holding that Congress intended that the crime of child abuse cover individuals under the age of 18. He argues that the Pennsylvania crime of unlawful contact with a minor is broader than the INA \"crime of child abuse,\" and thus his conviction cannot serve as predicate for his deportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mondragon-Gonzalez's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Quintana\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. The Court there was confronted with the question of \"whether a conviction under a state statute criminalizing consensual sexual intercourse between a 21-year-old and a 17-year-old qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA.\"\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Quintana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604345\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1562/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting that the \"age of consent\" is the determinative factor in the generic offense of statutory rape, and the consensus view is that the age of consent is 16, the Court concluded that the state statute at issue did not categorically fall within the generic offense of statutory rape.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604345\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1562/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604345\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1562/\">\n    at 1568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the state conviction in that case could not serve as the predicate for removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Significantly, the Court did not decide that the generic crime of \"sexual abuse of a minor\" could never occur when the victim was at least 16 years old. On the contrary, the Court indicated that consensual sex that occurred as a result of the perpetrator abusing a position of trust could qualify as \"sexual abuse of a minor\" even if the victim is 17 years-old.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604345\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1562/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604345\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1562/\">\n    at 1572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Quintana\n   </em>\n   does not support Mondragon-Gonzalez's claim that the \"crime of child abuse\" is limited to children under the age of 16.
