(BAE), and the Republic of Korea and its Defense Acquisition Program Administration (collectively Korea). BAE sought a declaratory judgment that it had not breached any contractual obligation to Korea and a permanent injunction barring Korea from prosecuting its suit against BAE in Korean courts. The district court granted BAE the requested declaration but refused to issue a permanent anti-suit injunction. Korea appeals, and BAE cross-appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Arms Export Control Act (AECA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202751\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , authorizes the Executive Branch to engage in Foreign Military Sales (FMS) transactions when selling certain U.S. military goods or services to a foreign government.

The U.S. government then contracts with a U.S. contractor for the goods or services that the U.S. government will eventually resell to the foreign sovereign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202762\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the FMS structure, the U.S. contractor is \"directly obligated\" to the U.S. government and \"has no direct contractual relationship\" with the foreign government. Def. Inst. of Sec.

May 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For that reason, this dual-contract structure precludes the foreign sovereign from directly suing the U.S. contractor for its performance on an FMS contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sec'y of State for Defence v. Trimble Nav.

Once the two sovereigns agree on the terms of sale, the foreign sovereign must \"trust[ ]\" the U.S. government \"to negotiate a contract [with a U.S. contractor] that will meet [the foreign government's] needs.\"\n   <em>\n    Green Book\n   </em>\n   at 15-8. The U.S. government \"determines the contract type, selects the contract source, and negotiates prices and contract terms with individual contractors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732593\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/700/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly here, in an FMS transaction, the\n   U.S. government retains control over price. Although the sovereign-to-sovereign agreement contains an initial price estimate, the foreign government must pay whatever the U.S. government contends the transaction costs-even if that amount exceeds the previous estimate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Sec. Cooperation Agency, U.S. Dep't of Def.,\n   <em>\n    Security Assistance Management Manual\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    SAMM\n   </em>\n   ), Fig. C5.F4 \u00a7 4.4.1, http://www.samm.dsca.mil (last visited February 9, 2018). In sum, the FMS structure provides advantages and disadvantages for a foreign purchaser. One potential advantage is that, in an FMS transaction, the foreign purchaser benefits from the U.S. government's procurement expertise.\n   <em>\n    See Green Book\n   </em>\n   at 15-7, 15-8. One disadvantage, however, is the loss of control over several aspects of the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In most instances, a foreign sovereign may choose whether to procure goods and services through the FMS structure or whether to purchase them directly from the U.S. contractor through a Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) transaction. For military sales it deems particularly sensitive, however, the U.S. government requires the use of the FMS structure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trimble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732593\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/700/#p707\">\n    484 F.3d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the President has discretion to designate which military items must be sold exclusively through FMS channels);\n   <em>\n    SAMM\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 C4.3.5 (\"The AECA gives the President discretion to designate which military end-items must be sold exclusively through FMS channels. This discretion is delegated under statutory authority to the Secretary of State. Generally, as a matter of policy, this discretion is exercised upon the recommendation of DoD.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although in an FMS transaction the foreign government and U.S. contractor do not contract directly, the foreign sovereign and U.S. contractor may coordinate in advance of the government-to-government talks in an attempt to pre-determine the contents of the eventual government-to-government agreement. Before submitting its FMS purchase request to the U.S. government, for instance, a foreign sovereign may negotiate proposed pricing and technical specifications with a favored U.S. contractor and then urge the U.S. government to provide a sole source award to that contractor under the pre-negotiated terms. But the U.S. government need not agree to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The dual-contract structure of an FMS transaction has important implications for resolving legal disputes. The foreign sovereign cannot directly sue the U.S. contractor for its performance on an FMS contract. Nor can the two sovereigns sue each other for failure to perform on the government-to-government contract: their only recourse is to hold bilateral consultations.\n   <em>\n    SAMM\n   </em>\n   at Fig. C5.F4 \u00a7 7.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, Korea announced its intention to upgrade its fighter planes. Because this upgrade program required Korea to obtain sensitive military technology, the U.S. government barred Korea from purchasing directly from U.S. contractors through a direct purchase DCS transaction and instead required Korea to procure the desired goods and services through an FMS transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In preparation for this FMS transaction, Korea solicited bids from U.S. defense contractors, including BAE, as to the cost of providing the desired upgrades. BAE responded\n   and issued successive Letters of Guarantee to Korea. In those letters, BAE agreed to pay Korea $43.25 million if BAE failed to \"respond timely to the evaluation formalities of the bidder's qualification,\" assuming BAE was \"designated as an eligible bidder,\"\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   if BAE failed to execute a contract with Korea after Korea awarded its bid to BAE. BAE issued the first Letter of Guarantee in late 2011; soon thereafter, Korea selected BAE as its favored contractor for the upgrade program. In the ensuing years, BAE renewed its Letter of Guarantee several times, including in 2013 and 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Given the dual-contract structure in an FMS transaction, Korea and BAE attempted to pre-negotiate key aspects of the inter-governmental talks. They agreed on what Korea would request from the U.S. government and at what price. BAE promised to \"put forth its best effort\" to convince the U.S. government to agree to those terms. In exchange, Korea promised to recommend BAE as its favored contractor to supply the requested goods and services to the U.S. government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 1, 2012, BAE and Korea memorialized their understandings in a Memorandum of Agreement. That BAE-Korea agreement authorized Korea to demand payment of the $43.25 million promised in the Letters of Guarantee if (1) BAE failed to use its \"best effort\" to secure the terms specified in the BAE-Korea agreement in the separate agreement between the U.S. and Korean governments, and (2) BAE's failure to use its \"best effort\" delayed conclusion of the government-to-government negotiations. The BAE-Korea agreement also contains a forum selection clause, which provides that any dispute between BAE and Korea \"shall be resolved through a litigation and the Seoul Central Court shall hold jurisdiction.\" Finally, the BAE-Korea agreement provides that it \"automatically terminate[s]\" upon execution of an FMS agreement between the U.S. and Korean governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Korea then sent its formal purchase request to the U.S. government, initiating the FMS government-to-government negotiations. In December 2013, the two sovereigns signed an initial FMS agreement that covered preliminary issues and anticipated a \"follow-on amendment\" to execute the core of the FMS transaction. With respect to the anticipated follow-on amendment, the U.S. government initially signaled it could meet Korea's budget but later informed Korea that the price tag of the FMS transaction would greatly exceed initial estimates. BAE, as the contractor chosen to provide the requested goods and services, had participated in inter-governmental discussions related to price. After the U.S. government raised its overall price estimate, Korea charged that BAE had breached the BAE-Korea agreement by failing to use its best efforts to ensure the U.S. government agreed to the price that Korea and BAE had worked out in advance. BAE steadfastly denied this, explaining that the U.S. government increased its price for reasons having nothing to do with BAE and despite its best efforts. Nonetheless, Korea demanded that BAE pay $43.25 million pursuant to the BAE-Korea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   BAE then filed this action in federal court, seeking a declaration that it had not breached any obligations to Korea. After the court denied Korea's motion to dismiss, Korea answered the complaint and asserted a number of cross-claims against BAE. Korea also initiated a suit in a Korean court to litigate essentially the same issues. The district court issued the requested declaratory judgment to BAE but refused to enjoin the litigation in Korea. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Korea initially grounds its appeal in the forum selection clause contained in the BAE-Korea agreement. That forum selection clause provides that any dispute arising from or relating to the BAE-Korea agreement \"shall be resolved through a litigation and the Seoul Central District Court shall hold jurisdiction.\" Korea claims this is a mandatory forum selection clause, requiring all litigation to occur in Korea, and thus requires dismissal of BAE's suit. BAE maintains that it is permissive, providing that Seoul, Korea is an appropriate forum for litigation, but not barring litigation elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the parties agree that we consider this question\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , and we traditionally have done so, the more deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of review may be appropriate in light of\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v.

On February 18, 2016, after the district court denied Korea's motion to dismiss, Korea filed an answer to BAE's complaint and several counter-claims against BAE. This was Korea's first responsive pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

In this initial pleading, Korea failed to assert sovereign immunity but instead asserted counter-claims against BAE for breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. In sum, by February 18, 2016, this litigation had been ongoing for over a year, Korea had not asserted a sovereign immunity defense, and Korea had filed a responsive pleading in the form of an answer and counter-claims. It thus appears that Korea impliedly waived its sovereign immunity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Resisting this conclusion, Korea notes that it filed an amended answer and counter-claims on March 10, 2016, in which it did refer to FSIA. Korea added the following sentence in its amended answer and counter-claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, Defendants deny that the act upon which BAE TSS bases its claim-Defendants' demand for payment of the amount of the bid bond required by Korean law-falls within the commercial activities exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although it referred to the FSIA in this amended answer and counter-claims, even then Korea did not raise the FSIA as an affirmative defense. Rather, Korea simply denied engaging in commercial activity under the FSIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even assuming this statement in the amended answer sufficed to invoke FSIA protections, Korea cannot defeat a holding of implied waiver unless its amended answer and counter-claims rendered its initial answer and counter-claims irrelevant. Korea contends that this is the case, because an amended pleading generally supersedes the original, rendering the original of no legal effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants/Cross-Appellees Response/Reply Br. at 32-33 (citing\n   <em>\n    Young v.

When Korea sought to upgrade the avionics systems of its fleet of fighter planes, the United States insisted that this upgrade could only occur through an FMS transaction, in which the U.S. government retained control over price. Perhaps in recognition of the U.S. government's complete control over the FMS contract, Korea attempted to pre-determine its costs. To that end, Korea entered into an agreement with BAE in which, in exchange for being named as Korea's preferred contractor, BAE agreed to put forth its \"best effort\" to ensure the pricing to which BAE and Korea had agreed was accepted by the United States and included in the agreement between the two governments. Although the United States and Korea entered into a preliminary FMS contract, negotiations between them ultimately collapsed due to price differences. Korea claims that BAE did not use its best efforts to ensure the U.S. government agreed to the price that BAE and Korea had worked out in advance. BAE maintains that the U.S. government increased its cost estimate based on \"historical experience\" with \"previous F-16 upgrade programs\" and that \"no part of this cost increase was the result of [BAE's] actions.\" Appellee/Cross-Appellant's Response/Opening Br. at 15. The principal issue for declaratory judgment purposes, however, is not whether BAE failed to use its best efforts to advocate for a certain price, but rather whether Korea can enforce its agreement with BAE (including this \"best effort\" obligation) in light of U.S. national security interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We agree with the parties that this question turns on the relationship between the BAE-Korea agreement and the FMS transaction and whether enforcement of the BAE-Korea agreement would impact U.S. national security interests. Korea claims that the BAE-Korea agreement relates to, but is entirely distinct from, the FMS transaction. According to Korea, its agreement with BAE imposes obligations on BAE and Korea that have \"no impact on the U.S. government or its national security.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 49. BAE maintains that because the BAE-Korea agreement is intimately linked to the government-to-government transaction and purports to influence its outcome, it impacts U.S. national security and so is unenforceable.

We reasoned that a foreign state will not be permitted \"to gain an advantage of\n   the DCS program in a situation where United States policy (and the statutory scheme chosen to effectuate that policy) explicitly precludes a DCS arrangement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732593\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/700/#p707\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We thus concluded that a foreign state participating in an FMS transaction cannot sue the U.S. contractor under the theory that the foreign state is a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the U.S. government and the U.S. contractor. Recognizing such a cause of action \"would allow the foreign purchaser to hold the contractor directly liable for the purchased goods, a level of accountability that may be achieved [only] through a DCS sale.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732593\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/700/#p707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Trimble\n   </em>\n   teaches that a foreign state cannot sue a U.S. contractor if doing so would undermine the FMS structure and afford the foreign state advantages only available in a direct purchase DCS transaction between a foreign state and a U.S. contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The district court concluded that Korea's lawsuit would do just that. The court reasoned that the BAE-Korea agreement is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the FMS transaction. In reaching this conclusion, it relied on the fact that the explicit purpose of the BAE-Korea agreement was to establish the technical specifications and prices that BAE would then support for inclusion in Korea's eventual FMS agreement with the U.S. government. If BAE failed to adequately advocate for inclusion of those terms in an inter-governmental deal, and that failure delayed conclusion of such a deal, the BAE-Korea agreement subjected BAE to \"punishment\" in the form of a $43.25 million payment. And, as the district court noted, the BAE-Korea agreement \"automatically terminate[d]\" once the two governments reached an FMS agreement. Given these facts, we agree that the BAE-Korea agreement is intimately linked to the FMS transaction: in essence, it subjects BAE to potential liability if Korea is dissatisfied with developments in the government-to-government FMS negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   If enforced as Korea seeks, the BAE-Korea agreement would undermine the FMS structure in two critical ways. First, it would undermine the FMS dispute settlement provisions. The FMS structure strictly circumscribes the availability of litigation. A foreign state cannot sue the United States for failure to perform pursuant to the sovereign-to-sovereign agreement, including with respect to price. The foreign state's only recourse is to consult with the U.S. government.\n   <em>\n    See SAMM\n   </em>\n   Fig. C5.F4 \u00a7 7.2. Nor can a foreign state sue the U.S. contractor retained by the U.S. government to fulfill an FMS contract, because the foreign state does not contract directly with that contractor for the goods and services the contractor ultimately supplies (via the U.S. government) to the foreign state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trimble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732593\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/700/#p707\">\n    484 F.3d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FMS structure thus shields a U.S. contractor, such as BAE, from liability. Pursuant to the separate BAE-Korea agreement, Korea nonetheless seeks to impose liability on BAE for allegedly failing to use best efforts to prevent a price increase by the U.S. government in FMS government-to-government negotiations.

It would provide a foreign state with a cause of action against a U.S. contractor if the price of the FMS transaction exceeded initial expectations, because the foreign state could always claim the U.S. contractor did not use its best efforts to keep prices down. Thus, although enforcement of the BAE-Korea agreement as Korea seeks would not \"control\" the FMS transaction price in a strict sense (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it would not dictate what the U.S. government ultimately charges Korea, nor would it dictate what BAE charges the U.S. government), it would nevertheless allow a foreign state to recover from a U.S. contractor if the cost of the FMS transaction exceeded initial estimates. Accordingly, it would import a benefit available only in a direct purchase, DCS transaction, into an FMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   transaction. In a DCS transaction, the foreign state may negotiate a fixed price with the U.S. contractor, such that it knows how much money it will owe.

Under\n   <em>\n    Trimble\n   </em>\n   , we focus on whether enforcement of the BAE-Korea agreement would undermine the FMS structure established by Congress. The Government's brief does not meaningfully engage with this issue: it fails to even mention the statute authorizing FMS transactions (AECA), the regulations governing such transactions (DFARS), the key manual with which FMS transactions must comply (SAMM), or the standard terms used in FMS agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Government also suggests that enforcement would not undermine the FMS structure, because Korea seeks compensation \"only for BAE's own alleged failure to use best efforts,\" and \"is not here reneging on a commitment to settle disputes with the United States using government-to-government negotiation.\" Amicus Br. at 6. Functionally, however, Korea does precisely this-it seeks to hold BAE liable for higher prices demanded by the United States in the government-to-government negotiation. The record makes this connection plain: one day after the U.S. government announced a price increase, Korea demanded payment from BAE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, although we take seriously the Government's views, we note that the Government in its brief only concludes national security interests do not prohibit enforcement of the \"best effort\" provision in the particular agreement and circumstances presented here. The same might not be true, the Government suggests, the next time around.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amicus Br. at 1-2, 5 n.2. This provides no guidance to industry actors and suggests that courts must consider the distinct national security implications of each and every contract that, like the BAE-Korea agreement here, relates to\n   (but is technically separate from) an FMS transaction.

After the district court granted summary judgment in favor of BAE, it lifted a preliminary injunction it had previously imposed. The court concluded that if South Korea \"proceed[ed] with its claims against BAE in its own courts, BAE may defend against the claims by asserting any claim or issue preclusion that this judgment may afford it under Korean law.\" We review denial of the permanent anti-suit injunction for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v.

Our sister circuits have outlined at least two approaches for determining if a foreign anti-suit injunction is warranted: the \"liberal\" test and the \"conservative\" test. Both weigh factors favoring an injunction against the effect of an injunction on international comity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The principal difference is that the liberal approach accords less weight to international comity concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allendale Mut.

But international comity remains a significant consideration, even in courts endorsing the liberal approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery v.

BAE's contention to the contrary rests on two rationales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, BAE claims the Korean litigation threatens the district court's jurisdiction, because \"the U.S. court system is the proper venue for the dispute,\" and, absent an injunction, BAE \"face[s] the possibility of an inconsistent judgment\" in Korea, which \"could be enforced in [Korea] or potentially third countries.\" Appellee/Cross-Appellant's Response/Opening Br. at 40. We agree that a district court may, in certain circumstances, impose an anti-suit injunction to protect its own jurisdiction, even where (as here) it has already rendered its judgment. In that context, the\n   injunction serves to protect the integrity of the district court order in case the foreign forum fails to give\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect to the district court judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paramedics Electromedicina Comercial, Ltda v.

Cir. 1984) (\"[A] showing of harassment, bad faith, or other strong equitable circumstances should ordinarily be required\" for a district court to impose an anti-suit injunction in order to protect an existing judgment). Otherwise, such injunctions would be commonplace rather than extraordinary. Here, the Korean litigation is not particularly vexatious or oppressive; indeed, the forum selection clause in the BAE-Korea agreement contemplates (but does not require) litigation in Korea. In sum, we conclude that jurisdictional grounds provide an unconvincing justification for an anti-suit injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   BAE also claims an injunction is necessary in order to protect U.S. national security interests. Here, BAE has more solid footing. We have concluded that enforcement of the BAE-Korea agreement runs counter to U.S. national security concerns, and we agree that enforcement by a Korean court may threaten those same concerns. But BAE goes even further, suggesting it would be inconsistent to allow the enforceability of the BAE-Korea agreement to be litigated in Korea after holding, as we do here, that enforcement runs counter to national security interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee/Cross-Appellant's Response/Opening Br. at 32-33. That line of reasoning is too simplistic, because it ignores international comity concerns that must always be considered in determining whether to issue an anti-suit injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   International comity counsels us to give effect, if possible, to the judgments of foreign courts in order to strengthen international cooperation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hilton v.

Here, these comity concerns are near their peak.

In an FMS transaction, the foreign state and U.S. contractor may negotiate offsets, which are \"the entire range of industrial and commercial benefits provided [by contractors] to foreign governments as an inducement or condition to purchase military supplies or services.\" DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information 225.7303-2 (May 2015), https://www.acq.osd.mil/DPAP/dars/dfarspgi/current/index.html (last visited March 5, 2018). Korea claims that offsets are enforceable and that the BAE-Korea agreement is \"\n    <em>\n     similar\n    </em>\n    to an offset agreement\" in that it is \"an ancillary contract between the foreign purchaser and the contractor related to an FMS transaction.\" Appellant's Opening Br. 52 n.10. Even if offsets are enforceable, we view them as distinct. Offsets, unlike the BAE-Korea agreement, do not undermine the FMS structure. Instead, offsets are mere inducements offered by U.S. contractors to the foreign state to convince the foreign state to purchase military goods and services in the first place.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The United States did not participate in this case in the district court or in the oral argument or original briefing in this court. However, after oral argument, we invited the Government to provide a brief setting forth its views on two questions. First, we asked the Government to address an issue in Korea's appeal (Fourth Circuit No. 17-1041): whether, in the Government's view, permitting Korea to enforce its agreement with BAE would \"run counter to United States national security interests.\" Second, we solicited the Government's view on the issue pursued by BAE in its cross-appeal (Fourth Circuit No. 17-1070): whether a permanent anti-suit injunction \"is warranted in light of any United States national security interests.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Instead, the Government's effort to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Trimble\n    </em>\n    rests entirely on factual differences between\n    <em>\n     Trimble\n    </em>\n    and the case at hand.

But even more important and more relevant here are concerns at the center of the\n    <em>\n     Trimble\n    </em>\n    holding that the foreign government's lawsuit runs counter to the statutory and regulatory structure underpinning FMS transactions-something the Government largely fails to address.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Moreover, the harm the Government suggests might arise from holding unenforceable \"best efforts\" clauses like the one at issue here-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \"influencing allied countries to look elsewhere for some military purchases,\" Amicus Br. at 3-is one Korea never raised in this lengthy litigation involving numerous briefs and oral arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Under both approaches, the court also examines, as a threshold inquiry, whether the parties and issues in the two disputes are the same.
