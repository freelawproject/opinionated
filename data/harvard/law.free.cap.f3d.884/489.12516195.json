Accordingly, the injury alleged by the property owner's subcontractor-in this case, Slay's Restoration, LLC-was not proximately caused by conduct of the insurance company, and Slay's Restoration therefore failed to state a plausible claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") against the insurance company and its consultants upon which relief could be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 1964(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When an apartment complex owned by City Line Associates, LP, was damaged by flooding, City Line hired First Atlantic Restoration, Inc., to make repairs. First Atlantic, in turn, hired the plaintiff, Slay's Restoration, as a subcontractor to perform some of the work. Using documentation provided by Slay's Restoration describing the work it did, City Line submitted several insurance claims for payment of its costs of repair to its insurance company, Wright National Flood Insurance Company. To adjust the claim, Wright Insurance hired Colonial Claims Corporation, and Colonial Claims, in turn, hired two consulting firms to provide professional assessments of the repair work done. Based on the consulting firms' assessments, Wright Insurance offered to pay its insured, City Line, less than one-half of the amount City Line requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Slay's Restoration commenced this action against Wright Insurance and its consultants contending that they fraudulently conspired to reduce City Line's claim, in violation of RICO, thereby injuring City Line's ability to pay Slay's Restoration fully for its work. On the defendants' motions, the district court dismissed Slay's Restoration's complaint, concluding (1) that Slay's Restoration did not plausibly allege that its injury was\n   <em>\n    proximately caused\n   </em>\n   by the defendants' alleged violation of RICO, as required by the statute, and, alternatively, (2) that Slay's Restoration's claim was precluded by restrictions contained in City Line's insurance policy issued under the National Flood Insurance Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Concluding that Slay's Restoration has not and cannot, in the circumstances of this case, adequately allege proximate causation as required for a civil RICO claim, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result of heavy rainfall in Newport News, Virginia, in September 2014, a 200-unit apartment complex owned by City Line was damaged by flooding. City Line hired First Atlantic to effect repairs, and First Atlantic hired Slay's Restoration to perform \"drying services.\" Upon completion of the work, Slay's Restoration submitted documentation of its work to First Atlantic and City Line for use by City Line in its presentation of claims to Wright Insurance, its insurance company. Wright Insurance provided flood insurance to City Line under the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\"). Under that program, Wright Insurance is responsible for adjusting claims made under the policy, but FEMA ultimately pays the loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodson v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276884\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/628/#p631\">\n    855 F.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (4th Cir. 2017). City Line submitted 18 claims to Wright Insurance for over $1.2 million in the aggregate to reimburse it for the costs of repairs to 18 apartment buildings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To adjust the claims, Wright Insurance hired Colonial Claims, a claims-adjusting firm, and Colonial Claims hired two consulting firms to evaluate the work done in\n   repairing the flood damage, including that done by Slay's Restoration. These firms submitted reports concluding that First Atlantic and Slay's Restoration had not adhered to applicable industry standards in repairing the apartments. After receiving these reports, Wright Insurance offered to pay City Line a total amount of roughly $530,000 in satisfaction of its 18 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Slay's Restoration commenced this action, alleging in some detail that the reduction of City Line's claims resulted from the two consulting firms' wrongful assessment of its work and their fraudulent representations that the work was not performed in accordance with applicable standards. Contending that the conduct amounted to violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1343, which prohibit the use of the mails or wire to obtain money by fraud or false pretenses, Slay's Restoration alleged that Wright Insurance, Colonial Claims, and the two consulting firms participated in a \"fraudulent scheme\" to create \"false reports [about the repair work done] to deny policy benefits to insureds and payments to contractors,\" in violation of RICO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). According to Slay's Restoration, the substantial reduction of City Line's claims as a result of this scheme prevented First Atlantic and ultimately Slay's Restoration from receiving full payment for their work. It claimed that it suffered a loss exceeding $900,000 and sought treble damages, as provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants filed motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), contending, among other things, (1) that Slay's Restoration lacked \"standing\" to bring its civil RICO claim because Slay's Restoration could not show that the defendants were the proximate cause of its injury, given that the parties had no contractual relationship with each other that would require the defendants to disburse FEMA funds directly to Slay's Restoration; and (2) that Slay's Restoration was, in any event, foreclosed from pursuing its claim because City Line's standard form insurance policy, as fixed by FEMA, required that any dispute from the handling of a claim be governed exclusively by FEMA regulations, the National Flood Insurance Act, and federal common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Agreeing with both arguments, the district court granted the defendants' motions and dismissed Slay's Restoration's complaint. On the issue of causation, the court noted that Slay's Restoration was \"a subcontractor of First Atlantic, who [was] a contractor of City Line, who ha[d] an insurance policy with Wright [Insurance], who employed the [defendants],\" concluding that, \"on these facts, any financial injury [that Slay's Restoration] ha[d] endured was\n   <em>\n    proximately\n   </em>\n   caused by First Atlantic,\" not by any of the defendants' actions. In addition, the district court determined that Slay's Restoration's claim was precluded by the provisions regulating the National Flood Insurance Program and the terms of the standard form insurance policy issued by Wright Insurance as required under that program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   From the district court's judgment dated January 3, 2017, Slay's Restoration filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The question presented is whether Slay's Restoration sufficiently alleged that its injury was proximately caused by the alleged racketeering-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it was \"injured in [its] business or property by reason of a violation of [RICO].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

While the Court recognized that foreseeability is an established tenet of proximate causation at common law, the Court stated that it is not a tenet that applies in the RICO context.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, it alleged that two consulting firms hired by Colonial Claims, who in turn was hired by Wright Insurance, colluded to defame Slay's Restoration's work with false and fraudulent reports, resulting in Wright Insurance's reduction of the amount it was willing\n   <em>\n    to pay City Line\n   </em>\n   on its claims of $1.2 million. To be sure, Slay's Restoration did contend that this reduction prevented City Line from fully compensating First Atlantic for the work it performed, which in turn prevented First Atlantic from fully compensating Slay's Restoration. But even though Slay's Restoration alleged that the defendants' fraudulent conduct was the\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   of its injury, it did so by describing a chain of causation that extends significantly beyond \"the first step,\" proceeding from the consulting firms' fraudulent conduct, through Colonial Claims and Wright Insurance to City Line, then to First Atlantic, and ultimately to Slay's Restoration. Because Slay's Restoration's claimed injury was not the\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   result of the defendant's fraudulent conduct, it was not\n   <em>\n    proximately\n   </em>\n   caused by that conduct, as required by \u00a7 1964(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Slay's Restoration insists that this focus on the chain of causation is inapt given the circumstances here because it was the\n   <em>\n    expected\n   </em>\n   recipient of insurance funds disbursed by Wright Insurance under the policy, and therefore it had been injured\n   <em>\n    by the defendants\n   </em>\n   . But this argument is nothing more than a claim that Slay's Restoration's injury\n   <em>\n    foreseeably\n   </em>\n   resulted from the defendants' conduct, not that it\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   resulted from that conduct.

Indeed, as\n   <em>\n    Hemi Group\n   </em>\n   explained, even if Slay's Restoration could demonstrate that its injury was one of the \"\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   consequences of the defendant[s'] unlawful behavior,\" it would still have to demonstrate that the\n   injury was also the\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   consequence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

It asserts that the district court in this case would face no difficulty in ascertaining the amount of damages owed to Slay's Restoration due to Wright Insurance's adjustment of City Line's claims because those claims were based entirely on invoices provided by Slay's Restoration and First Atlantic. This argument, however, grossly oversimplifies the process by which Slay's Restoration could receive any part of the insurance proceeds. In the circumstances of this case, both FEMA and Wright Insurance might have reasons for reducing the claims independent of the consulting firms' assessments, including complex regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program. The funds would then pass through City Line to First Atlantic, both of whom might also have independent defenses to raise against a party seeking payment. In light of these potential intervening causes, we cannot assume that if Wright Insurance improperly or fraudulently evaluated the work that Slay's Restoration performed, Slay's Restoration would therefore ultimately be entitled to the full amount of its claim against First Atlantic for that work. Nor can we even assume that any failure by First Atlantic to fully compensate Slay's Restoration for its work would be entirely attributable to Wright Insurance's underpayment on City Line's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dangers of these assumptions are precisely what prompted the Supreme Court to adopt the proximate cause requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Slay's Restoration urges that we nonetheless recognize a special exception for the circumstances in this case. But that would require us to find some non-arbitrary point at which to draw a line in the chain of causation. In creating such an exception, we would, for example, have to determine conceptually whether a third or fourth level subcontractor of an insured could bring a RICO claim against the insurance company or, indeed, whether a supplier to one of those subcontractors could. Making exceptions to the proximate cause requirement on a case-by-case basis, as Slay's Restoration would have us do, would force courts to contend with the very issues of causation and apportionment that prompted the Supreme Court to adopt the direct-relationship requirement in the first place.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kansas v.
