The district court answered in the affirmative. In doing so, it awarded Plaintiff PSM Holding Corp. more than $1.1 million in restitution. Defendants now challenge this award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   All told, the parties have filed five appeals and cross-appeals, which were consolidated for oral argument and decision. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we affirm in part, reverse in part, and dismiss in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Lawsuit and Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to the instant lawsuit, Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant National Farm Financial Corporation (\"National Farm\") owned Business Alliance Insurance Company (\"BAIC\"). Larry Chao, the president of National Farm, co-founded BAIC in the 1990s with his wife, Julie Chao. BAIC provided insurance to small businesses. BAIC had $14.2 million in net written premiums and $2.8 million in net income by 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early 2005, National Farm entered into negotiations to sell BAIC to Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee PSM Holding Corporation (\"PSM\"). Ultimately, however, National Farm walked away from the deal. Thereafter, PSM sued National Farm, Larry Chao, and BAIC (collectively, \"Defendants\") alleging claims for breach of contract and fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following a trial, a jury found in favor of PSM and awarded it $40 million on its breach of contract claim and $3 million on its fraud claim. In post-trial proceedings, Judge Fairbank granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law (\"JMOL\"). The motion was denied, with the exception that judgment was entered in favor of Defendants on the fraud claim, thereby reducing PSM's damages award to $40 million. Judge Fairbank also granted Defendants' motion to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal, conditioned on Defendants posting a $40 million bond. However, after Defendants failed to post the required bond and National Farm entered bankruptcy, PSM executed on the judgment. In\n   October 2008, BAIC was transferred to PSM. At the time of transfer, BAIC had more than $30 million in assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After taking possession of BAIC, PSM took various steps to integrate BAIC into its existing business. For example, PSM and BAIC entered into an intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement (the \"QSA\"). The QSA provided that, for every insurance policy BAIC issued, PSM would receive 90 percent of the policy's insurance premiums in exchange for assuming 90 percent of the policy's risk of loss. BAIC would retain the remaining ten percent of the premiums and would continue to be responsible for ten percent of the policies' risk of loss. PSM also assumed control of 90 percent of BAIC's loss and loss expenses reserves, thereby rendering it responsible for 90 percent of BAIC's losses on policies written prior to October 21, 2008, as well as on future policies. Additionally, PSM and BAIC entered into an Intercompany Service Agreement (\"ISA\"), under which PSM would provide to BAIC certain executive, administrative, and other services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Judgment is Reversed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 18, 2009, the Ninth Circuit reversed Judge Fairbank's partial denial of Defendants' JMOL motion. The Ninth Circuit held that \"[t]he plain terms of the agreement dictate that no contract was formed because the signature lines for National Farm; Larry Chao, as an individual; and Julie Chao, as an individual, were left blank. As a result, none of the parties could be liable under its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    PSM Holding Corp. v. Nat'l Farm Fin.

The case was remanded to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Post-Remand Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. July 26, 2010, Order on Restitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On remand from the Ninth Circuit, it was undisputed that PSM should pay restitution to Defendants. At issue, however, was the appropriate amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 26, 2010, the district court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion for restitution and attorney's fees. Although Defendants' motion opposed a return of BAIC to National Farm and, instead, sought a restitution award in the amount of $59.6 million, the district court ordered \"[r]estitution in the form of the return of BAIC's shares to [D]efendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court's decision relied heavily on Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 74, which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A person who has conferred a benefit upon another in compliance with a judgment, or whose property has been taken thereunder, is entitled to restitution if the judgment is reversed or set aside, unless restitution would be inequitable or the parties contract that payment is to be final; if the judgment is modified, there is a right to restitution of the excess.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 74 (Am. Law Inst. 1937). In such situations, comment e to \u00a7 74 provides, \"the judgment debtor is entitled to specific restitution, together with the value of [the property's] use in the meantime, diminished by expenses necessarily incurred in the protection of the property and the payment of taxes and liens, but not including the expense of improvements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=339%20Fed.%20Appx.%20693\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 74, cmt. e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to the district court, this rule is consistent with a similar principle set forth in Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 18 (Am. Law. Inst. 2011) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A transfer or taking of property, in compliance with or otherwise in consequence of a judgment that is subsequently reversed\n   or avoided, gives the disadvantaged party a claim in restitution as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the court supported its decision by relying on several state court decisions-from California and elsewhere-that confronted similar issues, including\n   <em>\n    Stockton Theatres, Inc. v. Palermo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210232\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/121/616/\">\n    121 Cal.App.2d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=264%20P.2d%2074\">\n    264 P.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1953),\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

Law Inst. 1937).) Accordingly, the district court ordered \"an accounting of the profits PSM generated through its ownership of [the BAIC] shares.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. October 8, 2013, Order on Accounting and Rescission of QSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Post remand, Defendants filed a motion for an award of PSM's profits. Defendants sought $14 million in profits. PSM opposed the motion, arguing that it actually suffered a $1.5 million loss as a result of its temporary possession and control of BAIC. Additionally, PSM sought to rescind the QSA. The district court determined that expert testimony was required in order to resolve Defendants' motion for profits and PSM's request for rescission. Accordingly, it appointed two experts: (1) Debra J. Roberts, who would consider the QSA issue; and (2) Timothy H. Hart, a forensic accountant, who would consider the question of profits. After each expert filed her/his report, the district court ruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the question of rescission, the district court denied PSM's request, relying on the following illustration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A obtains judgment in ejectment against B and is put in possession of Blackacre. After knowledge that an appeal has been taken, A makes improvements thereon to the amount of $1000, at an expense of $100 repairs a roof which otherwise would have leaked, and pays taxes thereon to the amount of $300. He remains on the land for two years, at the end of which time the judgment is reversed. B is entitled to restitution of the land and to the reasonable rental value of the land during the two years, less the amount expended by A for the necessary repairs and for the payment of taxes; ordinarily [diminishment in] restitution for the value of the improvements would not be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 74 cmt. f, illust. 14 (Am. Law Inst. 1937). This rule, the district court reasoned, is consistent with the well-established proposition that \"the distinction between 'repairs and maintenance' and 'improvements' can be characterized as the difference between 'keeping' and 'putting' [an] ... asset in good condition.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Moss v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768111\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/833/#p835\">\n    831 F.2d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 835 (9th Cir. 1987).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under this legal framework, the district court concluded that \"[t]he factual record supports the conclusion that the reinsurance agreement was an improvement rather than a necessary cost of protecting BAIC.\" It reasoned that \"[t]he reinsurance agreement increased the amount of reinsurance BAIC had prior to the time PSM acquired it\" and, consequently, \"the agreement added to BAIC's value by reducing the amount of risk it faced.\" And, there is nothing in the record to suggest that \"absent replacement of the existing excess of loss and catastrophe insurance with the [QSA], BAIC would have been unable to function as an insurance company.\" Similarly, the district court found no evidence suggesting that \"there was an imminent danger that the California Department of Insurance would take regulatory action against BAIC that would have precluded it from writing insurance business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because, according to the district court, the QSA was \"better characterized as an 'improvement' [rather] than an expense necessary to protect BAIC,\" the district court concluded that \"rescission of the agreement [was] not warranted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to profits, the district court made the following findings: (1) Defendants were entitled to recover $203,532 in \"synergy profits\" from PSM; (2) there was no evidence to support Defendants recovery of \"future profits\"; (3) Defendants were entitled to recover a $30,973 tax benefit previously received by PSM due to its ownership of BAIC; (4) Defendants were not entitled to any recovery as a result of PSM's liquidation of PSM's stock portfolio; (5) PSM was not entitled to an additional management fee beyond what had already been paid directly by BAIC; (6) Defendants were entitled to recover $254,524 in improperly charged transition costs; (7) PSM was entitled to \"an adjustment of the restitution award\" of $332,190 to cover \"operating expenses associated with BAIC while it ran the company\"; (8) PSM was entitled to a credit of $557,402 in \"ceded premiums,\" i.e., premiums paid on reinsurance contracts that BAIC entered into prior to PSM's ownership; and (9) PSM could \"offset\" any restitution payment to Defendants by $700,000 to account for PSM's assumption of a loan made by BAIC to National Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court then ordered the parties to jointly \"prepare an accounting of the amounts owed [Defendants] and the amounts PSM [was] entitled to deduct.\" The court added that it would \"enter judgment in favor of whichever party is owed money pursuant to the accounting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3. December 17, 2014, Order on Restitution of Profits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The parties-unable to reach agreement on the amounts owed-each filed a proposed judgment. The parties agreed that, based on the district court's prior October 8, 2013, order, PSM was to be allotted $1,100,563 in net principal. That is, per the October 8 order, PSM's offsets and credits exceeded the Defendants' recovery of profits and benefits by just over $1.1 million. Nonetheless, the parties disputed what should happen next. For its part, PSM sought to recover $1,100,563 in net principal, net prejudgment interest at a rate of $211 per day until the entry of judgment, and undetermined costs and attorneys' fees. In contrast, Defendants requested that the district court award nothing to PSM and award unstated costs to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The crux of Defendants' position was that the district court should award nothing to PSM because \"[b]ased upon the rules of restitution, which are grounded on the principles of equity, it would be inequitable to award PSM monies, especially\n   since it operated BAIC at a loss during its operations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In its December 17, 2014, order, the district court rejected Defendants' arguments and awarded $1,100,563 to PSM. In support of its decision, the court articulated the following \"fundamental rule\" of restitution: \"the goal of restitution is 'to place the parties in as favorable a position as they could have been in had the judgments not be enforced pending appeal.' \" (Citing\n   <em>\n    Gunderson v. Wall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235387\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/196/1060/\">\n    196 Cal.App.4th 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20880\">\n    126 Cal.Rptr.3d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (2011).) Moreover, the district court continued, \"[a]bsent evidence of bad faith, even assuming PSM operated BAIC at a loss, equity does not require that PSM be held responsible for the loss.\" (Citing Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 74, cmt. f. (Am. Law Inst. 1937).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the same order, the district court considered PSM's request for prejudgment interest, pursuant to California Civil Code \u00a7 3287(a). As a preliminary matter, the district court emphasized that, under \u00a7 3287(a), \"[e]very person who is entitled to recover damages\n   <em>\n    certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation\n   </em>\n   ... is entitled also to recover interest thereon....\" (Quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203287\">\n    Cal. Civil Code \u00a7 3287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis and alterations in original).) Moreover, the district court added, \"an accounting action is prima facie evidence [that] a claim is uncertain.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Indus., Inc. v. Togova Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2142631\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/149/901/\">\n    149 Cal.App.3d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20348\">\n    197 Cal.Rptr. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (1983).) Then, after surveying several California appellate court decisions which stand for the same proposition, the district court reasoned that \"[h]ere, the issue of restitution was complex, and necessitated that the court appoint business valuation and reinsurance experts,\" and that \"[t]here were numerous discrete questions that the court had to resolve in order to determine the amount of restitution.\" Based on these findings, the district court declined to award prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Concurrently with its December 17 order, the district court entered a final judgment, in which it ordered that: (1) based on the Ninth Circuit's reversal, PSM would \"take nothing by way of its complaint\"; (2) Defendants would recover $2,224,220.76 in attorneys' fees and $53,984.99 in costs stemming from pre-reversal proceedings; (3) PSM would recover $1,100,563 from Defendants as restitution; and (4) the action would be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The parties cross-appealed from the December 17 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    4. May 19, 2015, Order on Post-Reversal Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On December 31, 2014, Defendants moved for post-reversal attorneys' fees. Defendants sought fees under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 685.040 or, alternatively, under California Civil Code \u00a7 1717. PSM opposed the motion. The district court first considered whether Defendants could recover fees under \u00a7 685.040, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment. Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney's fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In turn, California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1033.5(a)(10)(A) provides that collectible costs include \"attorneys' fees[ ] when authorized by ... [c]ontract.\" The district court further noted that \"[a] motion for post-judgment costs, including attorneys' fees, under \u00a7 685.040 must 'be made before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred.' \" (Quoting Cal. Code. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 685.080(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The district court interpreted Defendants' position to be that the \"judgment\" at issue was either (1) the Ninth Circuit's mandate reversing Judge Fairbank's judgment in favor of PSM on the breach of contract claim, or (2) the district court's December 17, 2014, judgment. Under either interpretation, the district court found, Defendants cannot prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to the district court, the Ninth Circuit's mandate could not serve as the operative judgment because it did not itself include an award of attorneys' fees, and, as a result, \u00a7 685.040 has no applicability. Similarly, the district court reasoned, the December 17, 2014, judgment likewise fails to provide a basis for recovery of post-reversal fees because the fees requested by Defendants were incurred\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   entry of that judgment. Thus, \"it is unclear how defendants could have incurred fees 'enforcing' that judgment.\" Additionally, the district court added that PSM satisfied each of these judgments prior to the filing of Defendants' motion, a fact that independently precluded recovery under \u00a7 685.040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, the district court considered Defendants' alternative motion for fees pursuant to \u00a7 1717, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201717\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The district court began its analysis by observing that PSM's breach of contract claim was \"indisputably\" an action \"on the contract,\" as required by \u00a7 1717. Moreover, the district court reasoned, \"the restitution motions ... are 'part of [the] defense' of the contractual claim.\" (Alterations in original.) (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Anchor Pacifica Mgmt. Co. v. Green\n   </em>\n   , No. B253529,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203841227\">\n    2014 WL 3841227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2014) (unpublished).) That is, according to the district court, \"Defendants here lost BAIC after Judge Fairbank entered judgment and PSM executed on the judgment; their post-appeal restitution motions sought to recover the company and profits/benefits they were denied as a result of the erroneous judgment.\" Because the restitution motions were not distinct or separate from the underlying breach of contract action, the motions were, the district court concluded, \"on the contract\" for purposes of \u00a7 1717.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Having determined Defendants' post-reversal motions were \"on the contract,\" the district court considered whether Defendants were the prevailing party, as required for recovery under \u00a7 1717. Rejecting PSM's arguments to the contrary, the district court emphasized that Defendants \"achieved total victory on the claims it asserted in its complaint and their counterclaims when the Ninth Circuit reversed the $40 million judgment entered in favor of PSM and held that PSM had no binding purchase agreement with defendants.\" In light of this \"total victory,\" the district court concluded that \"Defendants' relative\n   success in the post-appeal restitution proceedings for which they now seek fees is more properly considered in determining a reasonable lodestar amount.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The district court next calculated the lodestar fee of $438,175. It reduced this amount by 30 percent \"to reflect the defendants' limited success on the post-appeal restitution motions.\" That is, while Defendants succeeded in securing the return of BAIC from PSM, \"the court declined to award $59.6 million in restitution and denied their request for profits in its entirety.\" Accordingly, the district court awarded Defendants post-reversal attorneys' fees in the amount of $306,722.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The parties filed cross-appeals from the May 19, 2015, order on attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Law Inst. 1937) (internal quotation marks omitted) ) ). It is the district court's subsequent order of December 17, 2014, that broke new ground. There, the district court awarded PSM,\n   <em>\n    the judgment creditor\n   </em>\n   , restitution. This presents a question of first impression: can a judgment creditor-who seizes a judgment debtor's company pursuant to a judgment that is then reversed-recover in restitution for losses suffered while it possessed the seized company? The district court answered this question in the affirmative, thereby awarding PSM more than $1.1 million in restitution. Perhaps because of its doctrinal novelty, neither the parties' briefing on appeal nor the district court's order cites controlling authority to support this award. Instead, the parties rely on two provisions in the Restatements of Restitution, \u00a7 908 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and several California state court decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Restatements of Restitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Restatement (First) of Restitution was formally adopted in 1936. Section 74 thereof provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A person who has conferred a benefit upon another in compliance with a judgment, or whose property has been taken thereunder, is entitled to restitution if the judgment is reversed or set aside, unless restitution would be inequitable or the parties contract that payment is to be final.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Two comments to \u00a7 74 warrant mention. Comment e states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   If the property of the judgment debtor was awarded to the judgment creditor ... [then] the judgment debtor is entitled to specific restitution, together with the value of its use in the meantime, diminished by expenses necessarily incurred in the protection of the property and the payment of taxes and liens, but not including the expense of improvements....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Separately, Comment f provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The judgment creditor is not liable for losses not caused by his mismanagement of the property ... except where the action was brought in bad faith or where there was a sale on execution and the sale was improperly conducted....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, Illustration 15 to Comment f describes a situation where, after a judgment creditor takes possession of certain real property, a fire destroys valuable timber located thereupon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 74 cmt. f illus. 15 (Am. Law Inst. 1937). The Illustration makes clear that while the judgment debtor is entitled to restitution of the real property, he is not entitled to compensation for the timber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A plain reading of \u00a7 74 and the comments thereto undermines the award of restitution to PSM. Section 74 provides a right of restitution to a particularly described party: namely, the \"person who has conferred a benefit upon another in compliance with a judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20P.2d%20793\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 74. In this case, that refers to the Defendants, not to PSM. The comments to \u00a7 74 affirm this same principle. Comment e expressly states that \"the\n   <em>\n    judgment debtor\n   </em>\n   is entitled to specific restitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20P.2d%20793\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 74 cmt. e (emphasis added). Likewise, Comment f-in limiting what can be recovered in restitution-speaks\n   in terms of the\n   <em>\n    judgment creditor's\n   </em>\n   liability or lack of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The California Supreme Court has not spoken directly to the question presented in this appeal. On two occasions, however, it cited \u00a7 74 approvingly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Wellborn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4393573\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/32/214/\">\n    32 Cal.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=195%20P.2d%20787\">\n    195 P.2d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789-91 (1948) (comparing defendant to a judgment creditor and denying his request to reduce money owed to plaintiff because the costs incurred by defendant were not necessary to preserve wrongfully possessed property);\n   <em>\n    Schubert v.

These cases suggest that the California Supreme Court would likely look to \u00a7 74 to resolve the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A similar provision is included in Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, formally adopted in 2011. Section 18 thereof provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A transfer or taking of property, in compliance with or otherwise in consequence of a judgment that is subsequently reversed or avoided, gives the disadvantaged party a claim in restitution as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Comment e to \u00a7 18 confirms that \"[t]he rule of this section recognizes a judgment debtor's entitlement to restitution only 'as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment.' \" Restatement (Third) of Restitution \u00a7 18 cmt. e (Am. Law Inst. 2011). Both this rule and the comment accord with the plain reading of \u00a7 74. Specifically, \u00a7 18 's use of the phrase \"disadvantaged party,\" when read in context, can be interpreted only as a reference to the party who is deprived of property by court order-in other words, the judgment debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20P.2d%20793\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 18. PSM's argument to the contrary, that the phrase \"disadvantaged party\" should be read to invoke either the judgment creditor or the judgment debtor, is unpersuasive. But, even if we accept PSM's position and assume, without deciding, that \u00a7 18 is ambiguous, Comment e clarifies and confirms that \u00a7 18\"recognizes a\n   <em>\n    judgment debtor's\n   </em>\n   entitlement to restitution,\" at least to the extent such restitution is required to avoid unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20P.2d%20793\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 18 cmt. e (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, a plain reading of \u00a7 74 of the Restatement (First) of Restitution and \u00a7 18 of the Restatement (Third) of Restitution stands at odds with the district court's December 17 order. However, because these authorities are, at most, merely persuasive, our analysis must also take into account other potential sources of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    b. California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 908\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 908 provides, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   When the judgment or order is reversed or modified, the reviewing court may direct that the parties be returned so far as possible to the positions they occupied before the enforcement of or execution on the judgment or order. In doing so, the reviewing court may order restitution on reasonable terms and conditions of all property and rights lost by the erroneous judgment....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Section 908 thus identifies the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of awarding restitution in cases like the one at hand: to restore, in so far as is possible, the parties involved to the positions they occupied prior to enforcement of the judgment. Here, then, \u00a7 908 instructs that the purpose of restitution should be to return PSM and Defendants to their respective positions\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   PSM's execution of the judgment and its taking possession of BAIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The district court's December 17 order describes the \"fundamental rule\" of restitution as \"plac[ing] the parties in as favorable a position as they could have been in had the judgments not been enforced pending appeal.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    Gunderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20880\">\n    126 Cal.Rptr.3d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) And, applying this rule, the district court concluded that if PSM was not permitted to recoup the expenses it incurred while it operated BAIC, then Defendants would be placed in a position more favorable than the one they would have occupied had PSM never executed on the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   At first glance, the district court's application of the rule embodied in \u00a7 908 may appear sound. But on careful reflection, it is not. To begin with, the district court's approach is arguably inconsistent with \u00a7 908 's plain language, which provides that a restitution award should include \"all property and rights\n   <em>\n    lost by the erroneous judgment\n   </em>\n   .\" Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 908 (emphasis added). Here, it is incorrect to say that PSM suffered losses as a direct consequence of the erroneous judgment. Rather, these losses resulted from PSM's own, affirmative decision to execute on the judgment while Defendants' appeal remained pending. Relatedly, the district court's order ignores that PSM assumed some amount of risk when it opted to execute on the judgment while an appeal was pending.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Strong v. Laubach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045664\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/1297/#p1300\">\n    443 F.3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1300 (10th Cir. 2006) (\"By executing on their judgment and receiving the garnished funds during the pendency of the appeal, the Strongs assumed the risk that they might have to repay the money if Laubach prevailed on appeal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

First,\n   <em>\n    Gunderson\n   </em>\n   does not go as far as the district court's order: that is, the\n   <em>\n    Gunderson\n   </em>\n   court did not require Wall (the judgment debtor) to affirmatively make a payment in restitution to Gunderson (the judgment creditor).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet this is precisely the legally dubious step at issue on this appeal. Second,\n   <em>\n    Gunderson\n   </em>\n   involved a situation wherein the judgment debtor's recovery was limited because of the debtor's own misconduct. No such misconduct has been ascribed to Defendants here. Finally, even if the district court relied on\n   <em>\n    Gunderson\n   </em>\n   only for the general proposition that restitution in this type of case aims to \"return[ ] the parties to their original positions,\" it fails to persuade. This is because, on the record here, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Defendants would have incurred the same losses had their possession of BAIC not been interrupted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The district court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Stockton Theatres\n   </em>\n   is unconvincing for the same reasons. There, Emil Palermo, the owner and lessor of a theater, sought a declaratory judgment against Stockton Theatres Inc., the lessee of the theater, to void the lease\n   between them.\n   <em>\n    Stockton Theatres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=264%20P.2d%2074\">\n    264 P.2d at 76-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike the district court's December 17 order, the court in\n   <em>\n    Stockton Theatres\n   </em>\n   did not require Stockton Theatres, the judgment debtor in that case, to make an affirmatively payment in restitution to Palermo, the judgment creditor. In fact, imagining such a result confirms the district court's error in our case: if Palermo had operated the theater at a significant loss, no one would expect Stockton Theatres to make him whole under a theory of restitution-doing so would be self-evidently unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Reviewing the December 17 order de novo, as we must here do, we conclude that the district court erred in allowing PSM-the judgment creditor-to recover in restitution. Our conclusion rests on the California Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , wherein the court, confronted with an analogous circumstance, declined to award the judgment creditor an affirmative recovery to offset its losses. Our holding is bolstered by the plain reading of Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 74 and Restatement (Third) of Restitution \u00a7 18, both of which suggest that, in cases such as the one before us, the right of restitution runs only to the judgment debtor. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth, we reverse the district court's award of restitution to PSM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The applicable standard of review for this part is the standard set forth in Part II.A.1,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The district court's October 8, 2013, order denied PSM's request to rescind its QSA with BAIC. That decision relied heavily on Comment e to \u00a7 74 of the Restatement (First) of Restitution, which provides, in relevant part, that a judgment creditor may \"diminish[ ]\" a judgment debtor's recovery by \"expenses necessarily incurred\" but not by \"the expenses of improvements.\" The district court found that \"[t]he factual record supports the conclusion that the reinsurance agreement was an improvement rather than a necessary cost of protecting BAIC,\" and, as a result, that rescission thereof would be improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   PSM raises three arguments on appeal. First, PSM contends that the district court erred by not applying, or at least considering, California Civil Code \u00a7 1019, which concerns the removal of fixtures from leaseholds. Second, PSM argues that the district court compounded this error by misapplying \u00a7 908, which compels a court to return the parties to the positions they occupied prior to enforcement of the erroneous judgment. Finally, PSM argues that policy considerations favor its position, particularly because, absent reversal, \"judgment creditors would face an insurmountable dilemma.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   PSM's arguments are unpersuasive. First, \u00a7 1019 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   A tenant may remove from the demised premises, any time during the continuance of his term, anything affixed thereto for purposes of trade, manufacture, ornament, or domestic use, if the removal can be effected without injury to the premises, unless the thing has, by the manner in which it is affixed, become an integral part of the premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201019\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The language of \u00a7 1019 -in particular, its reference to \"tenants\" and \"premises\"-has little relevance to the instant case. PSM was never a \"tenant\" and never possessed a \"premises\" on which anything could be \"affixed.\" Therefore, PSM's argument that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider \u00a7 1019 is without merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Second, PSM's argument that the district court erred in its application of California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 908 is similarly unconvincing. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Stockton Theatres\n   </em>\n   , PSM argues that it should not be held liable for expenses that were necessarily incurred to preserve BAIC's value, and that the district court's \"mechanical removal\" of these costs was error. Contrary to PSM's argument, however, the district court thoroughly analyzed whether the QSA amounted to a necessary expense or, instead, an improvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The district court reasoned that the applicable test for distinguishing between \"repairs and maintenance\" and \"improvements\" is whether \"the improvements were made to 'put' the particular capital asset in efficient operating condition ... [or] if ... they were made merely to 'keep' the asset in efficient operating condition[.]\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768111\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/833/#p835\">\n    831 F.2d at 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Applying this standard, the district court concluded from the record evidence that PSM's decision to enter into the QSA \"\n   <em>\n    added\n   </em>\n   to BAIC's value by reducing the amount of\n   risk it faced.\" (Emphasis added.) Because the QSA \"put\" BAIC into a better position than it had been at the time PSM took possession of it, the district court concluded that \"the reinsurance agreement is better characterized as an 'improvement' than an expense necessary to protect BAIC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Finally, PSM's policy argument also fails. The crux of PSM's argument is that, absent reversal, judgment creditors who execute on a judgment and take possession of property will face an \"insurmountable dilemma,\" wherein they must carefully deduce which projects are \"repairs and maintenance\" on the property and which are \"improvements.\" But this argument is based on a false premise that it was Defendants or the district court, not PSM, that opted to execute on the judgment while an appeal remained pending. It was this affirmative choice that put PSM in the position that it has now, with hindsight, discovered to be unenviable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Following the district court's entry of judgment on December 17, 2014, Defendants filed an application with the Clerk to tax costs. After a hearing, the Clerk taxed deposition costs in the amount of $3,622.22 against PSM, but denied Defendants' remaining requests to tax a $455 filing fee and $150,967.91 in costs attributable to the court-appointed experts. Defendants then filed a motion to retax costs. On July 14, 2015, the district court denied the motion. The district court's decision rested on Defendants' \"limited success and partial recovery, the benefit to both parties of the court-appointed experts' reports, and the necessity of retaining such experts to assist in analyzing the complex issued raised\n   by the post-appeal restitution proceedings.\" Because we reverse the district court's restitution award to PSM, the district court's rationale for denying Defendants' motion to retax is undermined, at least in part. Accordingly, we vacate the district court's denial and remand for further consideration in light of today's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   For the reasons set forth above:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   1. In No. 15-55026 &amp; 15-55087, we reverse the district court's December 17, 2014, order with respect to the order's award of $1.1 million in restitution to PSM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We dismiss as moot PSM's appeal of the district court's denial of prejudgment interest. We affirm the December 17 order in all other respects, including as to the issue of QSA rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   2. In No. 15-55941, we reverse the district court's May 19, 2015, order awarding attorneys' fees to Defendants. In No. 15-55943, Defendants' appeal of the district court's reduction of the lodestar fee amount is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   3. In No. 15-56184, because we reverse PSM's restitution award, we vacate the district court's July 14, 2015, order denying Defendants' motion to retax costs and remand for reconsideration in light of the changed circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   4. In each of these five appeals, each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part, and DISMISSED in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    PSM returned the BAIC shares to Defendants in early 2011.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    In addition to ordering a return of the BAIC shares and an accounting of profits, the district court awarded Defendants $2,224,220.76 in attorneys' fees and $53,984.99 in costs. These awards of fees and costs are\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    at issue on this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The district court also stated that Defendants may file subsequent or additional attorneys' fees motions, in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Thus, unlike in the usual case, the plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Ward\n    </em>\n    was the judgment debtor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    If it had, then the court would have needed to calculate the difference between the interest received by Gunderson while he possessed the $800,000 pending appeal, and the additional costs incurred by him as a result of Wall's misconduct. The court did not do so, opting instead simply to do rough justice by zeroing out Wall's restitution award. To be analogous to the instant case, the court would have had to order Wall (the judgment debtor) to affirmatively pay Gunderson (the judgment creditor).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Our conclusion with respect to restitution also renders moot PSM's appeal of the district court's order denying PSM prejudgment interest. No. 15-55026. Because there is no award, the question of whether PSM was entitled to receive prejudgment interest on that award is moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Moreover, PSM's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Central Pacific Supply Corp. v.
