The aggravated felony on which the Government relied was Verduzco's prior conviction of felony possession for sale of methamphetamine in violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code section 11378. Verduzco now argues that this conviction was not in fact an aggravated felony, rendering his removal invalid and requiring reversal of his recent conviction. For the reasons that follow, we disagree, reaffirm that a conviction under section 11378 is an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) where, as here, the record of conviction establishes that the substance involved was federally controlled, and affirm Verduzco's conviction.</p><p id=\"p-10\">We review <em>de novo</em> Verduzco's collateral attack on his 2004 removal. <em>United States v.

To prevail on this collateral attack, Verduzco must demonstrate that (1) he exhausted all available administrative remedies, (2) his removal proceeding deprived him of an opportunity for judicial review, and (3) the entry of his removal order was \"fundamentally unfair.\" <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326</extracted-citation>(d). For purposes of this appeal, the Government concedes the first two prongs, so the only question is whether the removal was fundamentally unfair. A removal order is fundamentally unfair if the relevant immigration laws did not in fact authorize deportation. <em>See</em> <em>Aguilera-Rios</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265185\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/626/#p629\">769 F.3d at 630</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-11\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"921\" href=\"#p921\" id=\"p921\">*921</a>The Supreme Court has decreed that courts should initially employ a \"categorical approach\" to determine whether a state offense is an aggravated felony under the INA. <em>See</em> <em>Mellouli v.

Holder</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156053\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/977/\">759 F.3d 977</extracted-citation>, 983 n.1 (9th Cir. 2014). However, section 11378 is divisible as to which substance the defendant was convicted of actually trafficking, <em>see, e.g.</em> , <em>United States v. Vega-Ortiz</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054995\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1031/#p1035\">822 F.3d 1031</extracted-citation>, 1035 (9th Cir. 2016), so courts can look to underlying <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"922\" href=\"#p922\" id=\"p922\">*922</a>records to determine whether a conviction was for a federally banned substance and thus qualifies as an aggravated felony for purposes of federal law. Verduzco's 2004 indictment and plea agreement establish that he was convicted of trafficking methamphetamine, which is a controlled substance under both California and federal law.</p><p id=\"p-16\">Verduzco nonetheless argues that his California conviction is not categorically an aggravated felony because section 11378 remains broader than federal law as to defendants' beliefs about the kind of substance in which they were trafficking. Under federal law, a person actually selling cocaine who thought he was selling baking soda does not possess the required mens rea to be guilty of drug trafficking. <em>See</em> <em>McFadden v. United States</em> , --- U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590298\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2298/#p2304\">135 S.Ct. 2298</extracted-citation>, 2304, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590298\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2298/#p2304\">192 L.Ed.2d 260</extracted-citation> (2015). Under section 11378, defendants can be found guilty even if they were mistaken about what specific substance was being trafficked, as long as the substance in which they intended to traffic is in fact controlled under California law. <em>See</em> <em>People v. Romero</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Cal.%20App.%204th%20147\">55 Cal.App.4th 147</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2016\">64 Cal.Rptr.2d 16</extracted-citation>, 23 (1997) (affirming conviction of defendant who sold cocaine that he thought was marijuana). This means that a person who believed she was trafficking in chorionic gonadotropin but was in fact trafficking in methamphetamine would violate California law but not federal law. Verduzco argues that section 11378 is thus not categorically a drug trafficking crime under the second route laid out in <em>Rendon</em> .</p><p id=\"p-17\">Rather than contesting this point, the Government argues that it is irrelevant because a conviction under section 11378 is an aggravated felony under the first route, at least where, as here, the defendant was trafficking a substance (methamphetamine) that is also controlled by federal law. We agree, and thus need not consider whether Verduzco's conviction would also qualify as an aggravated felony under the second route identified in <em>Rendon</em> . Indeed, <em>Rendon</em> itself held that \"possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell\" under Kansas law \"contains a trafficking element and is an aggravated felony on that basis.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701638\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/967/#p974\">520 F.3d at </extracted-citation>976 &amp; n.7.</p><p id=\"p-18\">Verduzco counters that (1) <em>Rendon</em> did not address what state of mind federal law requires a state statute to have for a conviction under that statute to be an aggravated felony under the first route,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) that the phrase \"illicit trafficking\" in \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) incorporates the federal law's scienter requirement that the substance in which the defendant intends to traffic be a substance controlled by federal law. But there is no good reason to suppose that, when Congress defined \"aggravated felony\" in the INA to include \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,\" it meant to implicitly incorporate such a requirement. Indeed, the plain meaning of the statutory language is to the contrary. If the first route were to require (1) a trafficking element, (2) the actual involvement of a drug that is banned federally, and (3) that federal law control the substance in which the defendant intended to traffic, then it would cover only drug trafficking crimes punishable as felonies under federal law-exactly what the second route already encompasses. In addition to rendering the statute redundant, Verduzco's proposed reading ignores the word \"including,\"</p><p id=\"p-20\">Under <em>Rendon</em> 's first route, we need not consider whether a state drug crime would also be punishable under federal law. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701638\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/967/#p974\">520 F.3d at 974</extracted-citation>. Rather, it is sufficient that the state statute contains an \"illicit trafficking\" element, which section 11378 clearly does. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701638\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/967/#p974\">id.</extracted-citation></em> at 976 &amp; n.7. To the extent \"illicit trafficking\" in route one incorporates a mens rea requirement, section 11378 suffices because it requires that the defendant intend to possess for sale a controlled substance and actually possess for sale a controlled substance, and that both the intended substance and the actual substance be controlled. This is, in fact, the same mens rea required under federal law. <em>See</em> <em>McFadden</em> , 135 S.Ct. at 2304. That Congress would impose consistent deportation consequences for those who engage in equally culpable activity is hardly surprising and is consistent with a generic understanding of \"drug trafficking.\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-21\">Because section 11378 has a trafficking element and requires a sufficiently culpable state of mind, section 11378 is a drug trafficking aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) where the record of conviction establishes that the substance involved is federally controlled. Thus, removal under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) based on such a conviction under section 11378 is not fundamentally unfair. Verduzco's conviction is therefore <strong>AFFIRMED</strong> .</p><p id=\"p-25\"><extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802</extracted-citation> defines \"controlled substance\" as \"a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of this subchapter.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 802(6). <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924</extracted-citation> defines a \"drug trafficking crime\" as \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq. ), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq. ), or chapter 705 of title 46.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 924(c)(2).</p><p id=\"p-26\">As a general matter, all federal criminal statutes are presumed to incorporate a requirement that the defendant act with a culpable state of mind unless the statute expressly indicates otherwise. <em>See</em> <em>Morissette v.

There, we held that Washington State's possession with intent to distribute statute was not a drug trafficking aggravated felony. The Washington statute criminalized more conduct than its federal analogs because one could be convicted under Washington law as an aider and abettor by either knowingly or intentionally assisting a principal, whereas federal law only criminalized intentionally assisting a principal. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266948\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1201/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266948\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1201/\"> at 1207-08</extracted-citation>. <em>Intentionally</em> abetting the commission of a crime involves a more culpable state of mind than <em>knowingly</em> doing so, and it is unlikely that Congress intended the generic \"drug trafficking\" listed in the INA to reach the less culpable conduct that the Washington statute criminalized. Here, by comparison, knowingly possessing for sale a substance controlled only by state law involves an equally culpable state of mind as knowingly possessing for sale a substance controlled by federal law.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
