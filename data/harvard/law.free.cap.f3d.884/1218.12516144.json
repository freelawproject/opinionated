But when required disclosures aren't made or cooperation breaks down, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 allows a party to move for an order compelling disclosures or discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   If the order is disobeyed, the court can impose contempt and other sanctions. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, which governs the issuance of subpoenas, also provides for contempt sanctions when a subpoena is disobeyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The question here is whether Rule 45 is the exclusive mechanism for compelling a nonparty to appear at a deposition and obtaining sanctions for noncompliance. We hold that under Rule 37's general discovery enforcement provisions, a court can order a party to produce its nonparty expert witness at a deposition and, if the party makes no effort to ensure that its witness attends the deposition, sanction the party's counsel when the witness fails to appear unless the failure to produce the expert \"was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C). Because the Rule 37 sanctions were reasonable in this case, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Marlyn Sali and Deborah Spriggs are registered nurses who instituted a class action against their former employer, Corona Regional Medical Center, and its corporate parent, UHS of Delaware Inc., for alleged violations of wage and hour laws. Plaintiffs moved for class certification with supporting declarations from their expert economist, Mark Falkenhagen, and expert statistician, Dr. Richard Drogin. As defendants were preparing their opposition, the parties became embroiled in a discovery dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants sought to depose Falkenhagen and Drogin in advance of the April 16, 2015 deadline for filing the opposition to class certification. After an unproductive email exchange, in which the parties' counsel dickered over fees, defendants subpoenaed Falkenhagen to be deposed on March 30, 2015. Plaintiffs interposed various objections, which defendants dismissed as \"insufficient to prevent a\n   <em>\n    subpoenaed\n   </em>\n   deposition from moving forward.\" On the scheduled day of the deposition, neither Falkenhagen nor plaintiffs' counsel showed up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next day, on April 1, defendants informed plaintiffs that they would be applying ex parte for sanctions and to compel Falkenhagen's deposition. Counsel then met and conferred regarding the expert depositions as required under the local rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.D. Cal. L.R. 37-1. Defendants agreed to pay Falkenhagen's fee prior to his deposition. They sought to depose him on April 9, but plaintiffs' counsel was taking a vacation that week and told defendants' counsel that Falkenhagen would be unavailable then. Plaintiffs offered to produce Falkenhagen for deposition on April 13,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but defendants didn't accept because they felt \"it was imperative the depositions occur prior to April 10.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants then applied ex parte to compel Falkenhagen's and Drogin's depositions on April 9 and 10, respectively. In an order dated April 7, 2015, the magistrate judge denied the request, finding that defendants were \"not without fault in creating the circumstances\" because they inexcusably waited to arrange the depositions. The magistrate judge acknowledged that plaintiffs' counsel \"exacerbated this situation by apparently failing to respond to inquiries from Defendants, having extremely\n   limited availability, and failing to seek a protective order concerning the noticed depositions.\" However, given plaintiffs' offer to make Falkenhagen available for deposition immediately after their attorney's vacation, the magistrate judge found that defendants would have sufficient time to incorporate his testimony into their opposition to class certification. The order concluded: \"Plaintiffs are, however, instructed to produce Falkenhagen for deposition on April 13.\" Defendants subpoenaed him for that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once again, Falkenhagen and plaintiffs' counsel failed to appear at the deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants moved for sanctions under Rule 37. The magistrate judge found that plaintiffs weren't substantially justified in disobeying the order to produce Falkenhagen for deposition and sanctioned counsel $15,112 for defendants' costs associated with the deposition and motion for sanctions. When counsel didn't pay, the district court entered a contempt judgment, from which plaintiffs and their counsel appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rule 37 is largely silent as to whether the court can compel a party to produce its general employees or persons over whom the party might reasonably be expected to exert influence or control. However, the rule isn't entirely silent. Rule 37(b)(2)(B) provides for sanctions \"[i]f a party fails to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring it to produce another person for [physical or mental] examination.\" Rule 35(a), in turn, authorizes the court \"to order a party to produce for examination a person who is in its custody or under its legal control.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 35(a)(1). This means, for example, that \"that a parent or guardian suing to recover for injuries to a minor may be ordered to produce the minor for examination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772831\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/617/1146/#p1158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   advisory committee's note to 1970 amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to whether courts can order parties to produce nonparties generally, our interpretation of Rule 37(a)(5) is relevant. Rule 37(a)(5) requires, upon a party's successful motion to compel discovery, that the court order \"the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant's reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney's fees.\" \"It applies,\" we have explained, \"to ... motions to compel nonparties to attend depositions.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennwalt Corp. v.

But plaintiffs misunderstand the nature of the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While an order to produce a deponent under Rule 37 and a subpoena under Rule 45 are intended to bring about the same outcome, the order's focus and the consequences of noncompliance are different. A Rule 37 order is directed at the party. It compels the party to use its best efforts to secure the nonparty's attendance at the deposition. But it doesn't demand the impossible. The party can avoid sanctions by showing that it attempted in good faith to comply with the order but was unable to produce the nonparty-regardless of whether the nonparty's absence was justified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Falstaff Brewing Corp. v.

Even if the party could have produced the nonparty but fails to do so, the party can still avoid incurring \"reasonable expenses ... caused by the failure\" if it \"was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\" Fed.

None of the other sanctions available under Rule 37 are available against the nonparty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the standard for a contempt finding differs from a Rule 37 sanction.

Still, there may be good reason to seek an order compelling the opposing party to produce\n   its witness. For example, if the party seeking the deposition suspects that the opposing party is the bottleneck-either directing or encouraging its witness not to appear-an order directed at the opposing party may be fruitful. Or the opposing party \"may have ... practical reasons for not wanting its own witness to be served with a subpoena,\" and \"service of an unnecessary subpoena ... against the wishes of [the opposing party's] counsel would [be] unseemly and inordinately bellicose.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Keystone Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502877\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/134/828/#p830\">\n    134 B.R. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (Bankr.

Counsel didn't even read the order until after the time for the deposition had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There was no justification for plaintiffs' failure to attempt to comply with the court's order. Accordingly, the court had authority under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) to \"issue further just orders\" in the nature of sanctions, including ordering the payment of expenses \"unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C). Here, the award of defendants' deposition-related costs wasn't unjust. Rather, it was the mildest of the possible Rule 37 sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the district court's contempt judgment is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    According to defendants' counsel, plaintiffs' counsel \"affirmatively stated that [he would be] available for Mr. Falkenhagen's deposition on [April 13].\" Plaintiffs' counsel asserted that he told them \"maybe, maybe\" he could produce Falkenhagen then, but he needed to know before he left on vacation in order to set it up.
