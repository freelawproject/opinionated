For plans that do not have valid delegation clauses, the Supreme Court has held that \"a denial of benefits challenged under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For a quarter century, we have interpreted that holding to apply only to a denial of benefits based on an interpretation of plan language. The result is a bifurcated standard of review for challenges in our circuit to the denial of ERISA benefits. Courts reviewing challenges to the legal interpretation of a plan do not, as\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   says, give any deference to the administrator's view of plan language. But challenges to an administrator's factual determination that a beneficiary is not eligible are reviewed under the same abuse-of-discretion standard that applies when plans have delegated discretion.\n   <em>\n    Pierre v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548033\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/1552/#p1562\">\n    932 F.2d 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1562 (5th Cir. 1991). When\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   was decided, it created a circuit split with one other court of appeals that had read\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   to set a default\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard for both legal and factual determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Reinking v. Phila. Am. Life Ins.

In the time since, seven other courts of appeals have chimed in. Every one has taken the view that the standard of review does not depend on whether the denial is deemed to be based on legal or factual grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We thus have long stood alone in limiting\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review to denials based on interpretations of plan terms. Our outlier view did not affect a great number of ERISA cases, however, because delegation clauses that remove a case from the default standard of\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   are so prevalent. But the importance of this issue may be growing. As part of a trend in a number of states,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Texas recently enacted a law banning insurers' use of delegation clauses. TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 1701.062(a). Assuming that the antidelegation statute is not preempted by federal law-something we do not decide today as that defense has not been asserted-a lot more ERISA cases will be subject to\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   's default standard of review. So we granted\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review of this case to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   and determine the default standard of review that applies when a beneficiary challenges a plan denial based on a factual determination of ineligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ariana M. is a dependent covered by an Eyesys Vision Inc. group health plan. Humana Health Plan of Texas, Inc. insures and makes benefits determinations for that plan. So when Ariana was admitted to Avalon Hills, a facility that treats eating disorders, Humana determined whether and for how long to cover her partial hospitalization. According to the plan's terms, partial hospitalization includes comprehensive treatment for a minimum of five hours per day, five days a week. This treatment is more intensive than any form of outpatient care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When she was admitted, Ariana had over 100 self-inflicted cuts on her body, while her escalating eating disorder interfered with her ability to lead a normal life. This was no isolated occurrence. By that time, Ariana had a six-year history of eating disorders, though she claimed that her body-image dissatisfaction dated back to early childhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A beneficiary is only eligible for partial hospitalization for mental health services if the treatment is \"medically necessary.\" Medically necessary services are those \"that a\n   <em>\n    health care practitioner\n   </em>\n   exercising prudent clinical judgment would provide to his or her patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an\n   <em>\n    illness or bodily injury\n   </em>\n   , or its symptoms.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ariana's treatment lasted from April to September 2013. Though Humana, at various points, denied certification for continued treatment-reversing course only on appeal by Avalon Hills-it did eventually authorize forty-nine days of partial hospitalization. But Humana declined to allow partial hospitalization beyond June 5th, claiming it was no longer medically necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, Humana had two doctors evaluate Ariana's records. Dr. Manjeshwar Prabhu-a contract physician with Humana's behavioral-health vendor-conducted the initial review, finding that Ariana no longer qualified for treatment\n   under the Mihalik criteria. Mihalik provides a set of privately licensed guidelines used to evaluate the need for certain medical services. In Prabhu's view, Ariana posed no imminent danger to herself or others and showed no medical instability or functional impairments, so a lower level of care, such as an intensive outpatient treatment, was appropriate. Though Avalon Hills-whose physicians participated in a peer-to-peer review of Ariana's case with Prabhu-acknowledged she was neither suicidal nor psychotic, it informed Prabhu that Ariana was not progressing in her treatment. In the view of a therapist at the facility, Ariana appeared to be at her \"baseline behaviors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Avalon Hills appealed the denial. That prompted Humana to seek an additional review from Dr. Neil Hartman, a psychiatrist with Advanced Medical Reviews. He evaluated Ariana's medical records-including Prabhu's determination-and consulted her treating physicians. Hartman concluded that Ariana's partial hospitalization was no longer necessary because she was \"medically stable,\" \"not aggressive,\" and \"not a danger to [herself or others].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ariana then filed this lawsuit. The plan has a clause granting to Humana \"full and exclusive discretionary authority to: [i]nterpret plan provisions; [m]ake decisions regarding eligibility for coverage and benefits; and [r]esolve factual questions relating to coverage and benefits.\" Early in the lawsuit, Ariana argued that the clause was unenforceable because Texas prohibits discretionary clauses. TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 1701.062(a). In response, Humana agreed to not rely on the delegation clause (and thus did not raise a preemption defense to the Texas statute) and said it would defend its denial under the default \"\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   \" standard. Despite using the \"\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   \" label, Humana made clear that it was invoking the \"abuse of discretion\" standard\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   applies to factual determinations even when a plan does not grant the administrator discretion. Ariana argued that the Texas law did not just invalidate delegation clauses but also overrode\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   's deferential standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court disagreed that Texas law could dictate the ERISA standard of review. The court thus applied\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   and assessed whether Humana's decision fell \"somewhere on a continuum of reasonableness-even if on the low end.\"\n   <em>\n    Ariana M. v. Humana Health Plan of Tex., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338387\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/163/432/#p439\">\n    163 F.Supp.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439 (S.D. Tex. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Holland v. Int'l Paper Co. Ret.

It held that Humana did not abuse its discretion in finding Ariana's continued partial hospitalization medically unnecessary-Prabhu and Hartman both conducted peer-to-peer reviews with her treating physicians, reviewed her medical files, provided reports citing the Mihalik criteria, and explained why she did not qualify for continued partial hospitalization under the plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 442. As a result, the district court granted Humana's motion for summary judgment and denied Ariana's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 443.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A panel of this court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Ariana M. v.

The panel rejected Ariana's contention that the Texas statute mandated a specific standard of review, finding instead that the \"plain text of the statute provides only that a discretionary clause cannot be written into an insurance policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277094\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/753/#p762\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277094\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/753/#p762\">\n    at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A number of amici, including the Department of Labor and the Texas Department of Insurance, supported Ariana's request for full court reconsideration of\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   . We granted the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We first consider Ariana's argument that the Texas statute dictates the standard of review for ERISA cases. That is not our reading of the antidelegation law. It provides that an \"insurer may not use a document described by Section 1701.002\"-which includes health insurance policies-\"in this state if the document contains a discretionary clause.\" TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 1701.062(a). In turn, the law defines discretionary clauses to encompass any provision that \"purports or acts to bind the claimant to, or grant deference in subsequent proceedings to, adverse eligibility or claim decisions or policy interpretations by the insurer\" or \"specifies ... a standard of review in any appeal process that gives deference to the original claim decision or provides standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the laws of this state, including the common law.\" TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 1701.062(b)(1), (2)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Texas insurance code provision thus only renders discretionary clauses unenforceable; it does not attempt to prescribe the standard of review for federal courts deciding ERISA cases. As to whether federal law preempts this state action making discretionary clauses unenforceable, we do not consider that defense because Humana did not assert it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With the delegation clause out of the picture and federal ERISA law providing the standard of review, this case presents us with an opportunity to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   . It held that \"for factual determinations under ERISA plans, the abuse of discretion standard of review is the appropriate standard; that is, federal courts owe due deference to an administrator's factual conclusions that reflect a reasonable and impartial judgment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548033\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/1552/#p1562\">\n    932 F.2d at 1562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They cited a number of reasons for not following our view. At the most basic level, they disagreed with\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   's reading of\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   . That Supreme Court decision addressed a dispute about plan interpretation rather than one involving a factual determination that a beneficiary was not entitled to benefits. But every other circuit has read its holding as applying to both situations. That is because\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   holds that \"a denial of benefits challenged under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n    489 U.S. at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n    109 S.Ct. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first part of this pronouncement-\"a denial of benefits\"-does not distinguish denials that rest on contractual interpretation from those based on a factual assessment of eligibility; any denial is \"to be reviewed under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

For starters, this ignores that\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    says \"a denial of benefits,\" without qualification, is reviewed\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    , and that the \"eligibility for benefits\" language appears in the clause saying a grant of discretionary authority can change that standard.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     489 U.S. at 115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     109 S.Ct. 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

What the dissent describes as the initial coverage determination is a question of whether a claimant is a \"participant\" or \"beneficiary\" (Ariana is the latter as a dependent of a participant). The statute defines a \"participant\" as \"any employee or former employee of an employer ... who is or\n    <em>\n     may become eligible\n    </em>\n    to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (7) (emphasis added). So someone is covered under the plan even if they are not yet eligible to receive a benefit, such as someone still working who does not yet receive pension payments or someone covered under a medical policy who has not yet been to a doctor. That someone can be covered under the policy who is not yet \"eligible\" to receive benefits shows that an \"eligibility determination\" is not the same question as whether the person is covered. Our cases have long reflected this understanding in using \"eligibility determination\" to describe claims like this one that turn on factual entitlement to benefits.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Atkins v.

The court of appeals reversed on grounds that Firestone, as administrator of the plan, had a conflict of interest; as such, de novo-not \"arbitrary and capricious\"-was the proper standard of review for Firestone's interpretation of the plan.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     at 107\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     109 S.Ct. 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, when the case reached the Supreme Court, the appeal was twofold: First, whether Firestone's interpretation of the plan was subject to an arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review or to a de novo review and, second, whether a proper interpretation of the plan's terms covered these \"former employees.\" The Supreme Court did not address whether the courts should defer to administrators' factual decisions because the court of appeals had reserved comment on that question.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bruch v.

The Supreme Court sets the tone of its analysis when it limits its holding to disputes based on interpretation of the plan; indeed, as noted above, these legal questions were the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    issues before the Court. The\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    Court said, \"The discussion which follows is\n    <em>\n     limited to\n    </em>\n    the appropriate standard of review in \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) actions challenging denials of benefits based on\n    <em>\n     plan interpretations\n    </em>\n    .

The Court then said, \"ERISA does not set out the appropriate standard of review for actions under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) challenging benefit\n    <em>\n     eligibility determinations\n    </em>\n    ,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     at 109\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     109 S.Ct. 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added), signaling again that it was addressing an inherently legal question. The Court then rejected the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review (applied by the district court), saying \"the\n    <em>\n     wholesale\n    </em>\n    importation of the arbitrary and capricious standard into ERISA [was] unwarranted.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In doing so, the Court plainly did not suggest that a uniform standard of review applied to all decisions of the administrator.

The oral argument confirms that the subject before the Court was plan interpretation. There, several Justices stated the issue in terms of whether the Court must give deference to ERISA plan administrators for their construction of plan terms.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Oral Argument at 3:05, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Further, a Justice expressed that the case might be different if resolving a question involving a factual judgment, by saying:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    My, my recollection of trust law ... and it obviously isn't, isn't a terribly recent one ... is that if you're talking about the ... the many things that the trustee\n    is given discretion to do in a trust instrument, decide on the medical needs or educational needs of various beneficiaries and allocate discretionary funds among them, the courts give great deference to a trustee.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    But is ... in deciding who is a beneficiary, I, I was not aware that trust law says the trustee has great discretion there.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5:23. And the plaintiffs' lawyer emphasized that this case involved only \"a pure question of plan interpretation\" and involved a different \"category of question\" from a fact question.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 32:49, 36:33.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nothing in the argument signals that the Court considered that its ruling, i.e., applying de novo review to who is a beneficiary under the plan, would also apply to fact questions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Therefore, based on the procedural history, the proper context, the oral argument, and the specific language of the opinion, it should be clear to all but the obstinate that the\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    Court did not intend that de novo review would apply to factual questions that went before plan administrators.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The majority's argument that\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    mandates de novo review for factual issues is further undermined by\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    's clarity that principles of trust law apply to administrator actions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     489 U.S. at 111\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n     109 S.Ct. 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"In determining the appropriate standard of review for actions under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), we are guided by principles of trust law.\"). The majority seems to disregard this directive. But, inasmuch as\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    clearly does not mandate a de novo standard of review for factual disputes, trust law controls, as instructed by\n    <em>\n     Firestone\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Under trust law, trustees have measured discretion in determinations that fulfill the underlying purposes of the trust; yet, the majority, with its de novo review, grants trustees no deference in administering the quotidian claims arising under the trust document. The Second Restatement provides that trust administrators have two types of powers: (1) those conferred upon the administrator \"in specific words by the terms of the trust\" and (2) those \"necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the trust and are not forbidden by the terms of the trust.\" Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 186 (Am. Law Inst. 1959). The Third Restatement explains further, \"When a trustee has discretion with respect to the exercise of a power, its exercise is subject to supervision by a court only to prevent abuse of discretion.\" Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 87 (Am. Law Inst. 2007). The general rule is that trustees have discretion with respect to the exercise of trusteeship powers, except when directed differently by the terms of the trust or when compelled by the trustee's fiduciary duties.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    cmt. a.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    And turning to\n    <em>\n     Scott and Ascher on Trusts\n    </em>\n    , we find, \"A trustee's powers ordinarily are discretionary, unless the terms of the trust or applicable law makes them mandatory.\" 3 A.

If the administrator argued otherwise, de novo review would be used, like in any other contract dispute, to determine whether Ariana's claim is contractually barred. But that is not the appeal here.

The relevant question, however, is not the confused use of \"eligibility,\" but instead what the\n     <em>\n      Firestone\n     </em>\n     Court meant by eligibility determinations. Given the context in which the case was decided and the language of the opinion, eligibility means qualification to claim entitlement to benefits under the plan.

Second,\n     <em>\n      Rush Prudential\n     </em>\n     is a preemption case that decided whether a state can \"prohibit[ ] designing an insurance contract so as to accord unfettered discretion to the insurer to\n     <em>\n      interpret the contract's terms\n     </em>\n     .\"\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255019\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/355/#p386\">\n      536 U.S. at 386\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255019\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/355/#p386\">\n      122 S.Ct. 2151\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . It held that this type of statute was allowed because, like an insurance contract, the focus was on a legal question-whether a state statute could modify a plan's form of legal analysis and not whether the specific person was entitled to money for medical treatment.

Mistake of law as to existence of duties and powers. A trustee commits a breach of trust not only where he violates a duty in bad faith, or intentionally although in good faith, or negligently, but also where he violates a duty because of a mistake as to the extent of his duties and powers. This is true not only where his mistake is in regard to a rule of law, whether a statutory or common-law rule, but also where he interprets the trust instrument as authorizing him to do acts which the court determines he is not authorized by the instrument to do. In such a case, he is not protected from liability merely because he acts in good faith, nor is he protected merely because he relies upon the advice of counsel. Compare \u00a7 297, Comment j. If he is in doubt as to the interpretation of the instrument, he can protect himself by obtaining instructions from the court. The extent of his duties and powers is determined by the trust instrument and the rules of law which are applicable, and not by his own interpretation of the instrument or his own belief as to the rules of law.\n    </blockquote>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-142\">\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Metro.

Kinds of discretionary powers. The rule stated in this Section is applicable both to the powers of managing the trust estate conferred upon the trustee either in specific words or otherwise, and also to such powers as may be conferred upon him to determine the disposition of the beneficial interest. Thus, it is applicable not only to powers to lease, sell or mortgage the trust property or to invest trust funds, but also to powers to allocate the beneficial interest among various beneficiaries, to determine the amount necessary for a beneficiary's support, or to terminate the trust.\n    </blockquote>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"12\">\n    <p id=\"p-146\">\n     <em>\n      Id\n     </em>\n     . at cmt. d:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n     d. Factors in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion. In determining the question whether the trustee is guilty of an abuse of discretion in exercising or failing to exercise a power, the following circumstances may be relevant: (1) the extent of the discretion conferred upon the trustee by the terms of the trust; (2) the purposes of the trust; (3) the nature of the power; (4) the existence or non-existence, the definiteness or indefiniteness, of an external standard by which the reasonableness of the trustee's conduct can be judged; (5) the motives of the trustee in exercising or refraining from exercising the power; (6) the existence or nonexistence of an interest in the trustee conflicting with that of the beneficiaries.\n    </blockquote>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"13\">\n    <p id=\"p-148\">\n     <em>\n      Id\n     </em>\n     . at cmt. e:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n     e. No abuse of discretion. If discretion is conferred upon the trustee in the exercise of a power, the court will not interfere unless the trustee in exercising or failing to exercise the power acts dishonestly, or with an improper even though not a dishonest motive, or fails to use his judgment, or acts beyond the bounds of a reasonable judgment. The mere fact that if the discretion had been conferred upon the court, the court would have exercised the power differently, is not a sufficient reason for interfering with the exercise of the power by the trustee. Thus, if the trustee is empowered to apply so much of the trust property as he may deem necessary for the support of the beneficiary, the court will not interfere with the discretion of the trustee on the ground that he has applied too small an amount, if in the exercise of his judgment honestly and with proper motives he applies at least the minimum amount which could reasonably be considered necessary, even though if the matter were left to the court determine in its discretion it might have applied a larger amount. So also, the court will not interfere on the ground that the trustee has applied too large an amount, if in the exercise of his judgment honestly and with proper motives he applies an amount not greater than a reasonable person might deem necessary for the beneficiary's support, although the amount is greater than the court would itself have awarded.\n    </blockquote>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"14\">\n    <p id=\"p-150\">\n     <em>\n      Metro.
