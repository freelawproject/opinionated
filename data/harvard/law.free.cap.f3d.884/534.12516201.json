SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Gino Carlucci filed several claims against officials and medical personnel at a federal correctional institution located in Texas. He alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause. The district court dismissed Carlucci's complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a plausible claim upon which relief could be granted. We AFFIRM in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gino Carlucci was incarcerated at Federal Correctional Institution La Tuna (\"FCI La Tuna\") located in Anthony, Texas. Carlucci suffers from temporomandibular joint disorder (\"TMJD\"), which causes pain and dysfunction of the jaw. He alleges that because of his TMJD he \"experience[d] very violent jaw popping and the right side of [his] teeth were hitting really bad.\" In February 2013, one of Carlucci's front teeth cracked and broke off. He was sent directly to the dental clinic, where Dr. Springer concluded that nothing could be done and recommended pulling the tooth. Carlucci disagreed. Instead, Carlucci glued the broken tooth back in place. This self-remedy made Carlucci's bite \"extremely uneven,\" and several of his front upper teeth began to crack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Carlucci notified Associate Warden Niles and Human Resources Coordinator Dunnigan of his dental problems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They assured Carlucci he would receive care and scheduled an appointment with Dr. Thomas. The appointment was on November 27,\n   2013. After examining Carlucci's teeth, Dr. Thomas concluded that the only effective treatment to prevent Carlucci's teeth from breaking or cracking was \"to restore the missing bridge and repair the fractured teeth.\" Dr. Thomas further told Carlucci, however, that the Bureau of Prisons \"would never authorize\" the treatment. In December 2013, Carlucci reported the results of his dental exam to Associate Warden Niles, who told Carlucci he was working to resolve this problem. Carlucci also filed a claim for an administrative remedy but allegedly received no response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2014, Carlucci met again with Niles and Dunnigan, who again told Carlucci that they were trying to have his dental problems addressed. In February 2014, Carlucci received a bite-guard from Dr. Thomas. While he was waiting for a response to his administrative remedy claim, Carlucci learned that Niles and Dunnigan had both retired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2014, Carlucci met with the new Human Resources Coordinator, Acosta. The next day, Acosta advised Carlucci to start the administrative remedy process. Carlucci said \"he had already completed the administrative remedy process and the next step was to file an action in court to seek a remedy.\" This angered Acosta, who responded, \"If you file a lawsuit I am just going to say that you never went to your dentist appointments and it[']s your fault that you[']r[e] not receiving dental care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 4, 2015, Carlucci sued Warden Rachel Chapa, Former Associate Warden Niles, Former Human Resources Coordinator Dunnigan, Human Resources Coordinator Acosta, Dr. Springer, and Dr. Thomas under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). In his complaint, Carlucci asserted three grounds for relief: (1) the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment; (2) the defendants intentionally caused him wanton pain and suffering by failing to treat his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment; and (3) the defendants failed to provide him necessary medical treatment in violation of his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. In a report and recommendation, the magistrate judge assigned to the case recommended a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissal of Carlucci's complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. The district court overruled Carlucci's objections, adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation, dismissed the complaint, and awarded Carlucci a strike under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

The magistrate judge found that Carlucci showed a substantial risk of serious harm,\n   and the district court adopted this finding. Carlucci argues that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference because they knew of his serious medical need yet failed to provide adequate care. The magistrate judge and district court concluded otherwise, holding that Carlucci had not pled \"deliberate indifference because his claims amount to nothing more than a disagreement with the type of dental treatment\" that the defendants offered to provide. The magistrate judge wrote that \"Carlucci declined to have any of [ ]his teeth removed, even though it would resolve[ ] the issue of his injured front teeth, because he preferred the restoration of his missing bridge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This reading of Carlucci's complaint does not construe the facts in the light most favorable to Carlucci, which is the standard that must be applied to his complaint. In his complaint, Carlucci alleged that Dr. \"Thomas performed a radiograph of Plaintiff[']s teeth that revealed several fractures, he explained that ... all of the teeth that are hitting will eventually break or crack and the only way to stop this ... is to restore the missing bridge and repair the fractured teeth.\" Carlucci's allegation is that the dentist recommended restoring his bridge and repairing the fractured teeth. He did not claim that the dentist recommended pulling the teeth and Carlucci disagreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The nature of Carlucci's claims are similar to some we have previously considered and deemed sufficient. In one case, a dentist recommended pulling a prisoner's teeth but informed the prisoner that the operation could not be done because it was not authorized.\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Carlucci said he suffered \"extreme pain,\" that \"four to five front upper teeth were begin[n]ing to crack,\" and that he suffered permanent physical injury.

In\n   <em>\n    McQueen\n   </em>\n   , though, the plaintiff preferred an alternative to the recommended treatment.
