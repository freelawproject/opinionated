(\"Zappos\") and allegedly stole the names, account numbers, passwords, email addresses, billing and shipping addresses, telephone numbers, and credit and debit card information of more than 24 million Zappos customers. Several of those customers filed putative class actions in federal courts across the country, asserting that Zappos had not adequately protected their personal information.

Sometime before January 16, 2012, hackers targeted Zappos's servers, stealing the PII of more than 24 million of its customers, including their full credit card numbers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 16, Zappos sent an email to its customers, notifying them of the theft of their PII. The company recommended \"that they reset their Zappos.com account passwords and change the passwords `on any other web site where [they] use the same or a similar password.'\" Some customers responded almost immediately by filing putative class actions in federal district courts across the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In these suits, Plaintiffs alleged an \"imminent\" risk of identity theft or fraud from the Zappos breach. Relying on definitions from the United States Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\"), they characterized \"identity theft\" and \"identity fraud\" as \"encompassing various types of criminal activities, such as when PII is used to commit fraud or other crimes,\" including \"credit card fraud, phone or utilities fraud, bank fraud and government fraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred several putative class action lawsuits alleging harms from the Zappos data breach to the District of Nevada for pretrial proceedings. After several years of pleadings-stage litigation, including a hiatus for mediation, the district court granted in part and denied in part Zappos's motion to dismiss the Third Amended Consolidated Complaint (\"Complaint\") and granted Zappos's motion to strike the Complaint's class allegations. The court distinguished between two groups of plaintiffs: (1) plaintiffs named only in the Third Amended Complaint who alleged that they had already suffered financial losses from identity theft caused by Zappos's breach, and (2) plaintiffs named in earlier complaints who did not allege having already suffered financial losses from identity theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court ruled that the first group of plaintiffs had Article III standing because they alleged \"that actual fraud occurred as a direct result of the breach.\" But the court ruled that the second group of plaintiffs (again, here referred to as \"Plaintiffs\") lacked Article III standing and dismissed their claims without leave to amend because Plaintiffs had \"failed to allege instances of actual identity theft or fraud.\" The parties then agreed to dismiss all remaining claims with prejudice, and Plaintiffs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review the district court's standing determination de novo.\n   <em>\n    See Maya v.

Plaintiffs also allege that their credit card numbers were within the information taken in the breach - which was not true in\n   <em>\n    Krottner.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Congress has treated credit card numbers as sufficiently sensitive to warrant legislation prohibiting merchants from printing such numbers on receipts - specifically to reduce the risk of identity theft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g) (2012).

Although those plaintiffs' claims are not at issue in this appeal, their alleged harm undermines Zappos's assertion that the data stolen in the breach cannot be used for fraud or identity theft. In addition, two plaintiffs whose claims are at issue in this appeal say that the hackers took over their AOL accounts and sent advertisements to people in their address books.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though not a financial harm, these alleged attacks further support Plaintiffs' contention that the hackers accessed information that could be used to help commit identity fraud or identity theft.

The plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Beck,\n    </em>\n    patients with personal data on a laptop stolen from a hospital, did not allege that the \"thief intentionally targeted the personal information compromised in the data breaches.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 274.

It is true that in\n    <em>\n     Beck\n    </em>\n    the Fourth Circuit opined that \"`as the breaches fade further into the past,' the Plaintiffs' threatened injuries become more and more speculative.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 275 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Chambliss v.

But the time since the data breach appears to have mattered in\n    <em>\n     Beck\n    </em>\n    because the court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing after the breach in the first place, so it made sense to consider whether any subsequent events suggested a greater injury than was initially apparent.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 274.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13.\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <em>\n     Clapper\n    </em>\n    is not to the contrary. In\n    <em>\n     Clapper,\n    </em>\n    the Supreme Court held that, even assuming the plaintiffs were going to be surveilled, any future surveillance could not be traced to the challenged statute because the risk of being surveilled did not increase with the addition of the new statutory tool.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n     568 U.S. at 413\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , (\"[B]ecause respondents can only speculate as to whether any (asserted) interception would be under \u00a7 1881a or some other authority, they cannot satisfy the `fairly traceable' requirement.\"). There were many surveillance options, all of which were in the hands of one actor: the government. Thus, a plaintiff's risk of surveillance hinged on whether the government chose to surveil him in the first place. In contrast, with each new hack comes a new hacker, each of whom independently could choose to use the data to commit identity theft. This means that each hacking incident adds to the overall risk of identity theft. And again, as explained above, the key injury recognized in\n    <em>\n     Krottner\n    </em>\n    is the risk of being subject to identity theft, not actual identity theft.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14.\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Plaintiffs need only one viable basis for standing.\n    <em>\n     See Douglas Cty. v.

Because Plaintiffs sufficiently allege standing from the risk of future identity theft, we do not reach their other asserted bases for standing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
