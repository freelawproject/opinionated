In August 2011, the Court certified the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class (\u201cIPC\u201d) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). <em>See In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., </em>282 F.R.D. 126 (E.D.Pa. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">GSK now moves to decertify the IPC based on a quartet of Third Circuit cases dealing with the requirement that Rule 23(b)(3) classes be ascertainable. <em>See generally Byrd v. Aaron\u2019s Inc., </em>784 F.3d 154 (3d Cir.2015); <em>Carrera v. Bayer Corp., </em>727 F.3d 300 (3d Cir.2013); <em>Hayes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>725 F.3d 349 (3d Cir.2013); <em>Marcus v. BMW of North America, LLC, </em>687 F.3d 583 (3d Cir.2012). GSK argues that the IPC cannot satisfy this requirement, and that the IPC should therefore be decertified. In connection with GSK\u2019s motion to decertify the IPC, GSK has filed a <em>Daubert </em>motion to exclude the opinions and testimony of one of the IPC\u2019s experts, Dr. Meredith Rosenthal. The IPC also filed a <em>Daubert </em>motion to exclude the opinions and testimony of GSK\u2019s expert, Dr. Bruce Strombom.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">To satisfy the aseertainability requirement, a putative class must show that there is a reliable, administratively feasible mechanism that can identify which potential class members fall within the class definition. <em>Byrd, </em>784 F.3d at 163. In this case, the IPC must show that it can identify (1) which entities paid some or all of the retail purchase price of Wellbutrin XL and later purchased its generic equivalent (\u201cgeneric XL\u201d), and (2) which individual consumers and entities paid some or all of the retail purchase price of generic XL. Individual consumers who made only flat co-payments for the generic drug are excluded from the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">There is no dispute among the parties that third party payers (\u201cTPPs\u201d), such as health insurers and health and welfare benefit plans, may have been entities that paid some or all of the retail purchase price of Wellbut-rin XL and/or generic XL. The potential class membership of pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d), on the other hand, is hotly contested. PBMs, which generally act as middlemen between TPPs and retail pharmacies, sometimes offer price discount guarantees or spread pricing arrangements on pharmaceutical drugs to their TPP customers. GSK argues that these pricing guarantees caused PBMs to pay for Wellbutrin XL or generic XL. Conversely, the IPC argues that such pricing arrangements constitute \u201coff-transaction financial flows\u201d that do not cause PBMs to pay for Wellbutrin XL or generic XL.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The IPC contends that it has a mechanism for identifying which individual consumers and PBMs (if necessary) are members of the class: utilizing pharmaceutical purchase records maintained by PBMs and retail pharmacies. The IPC must show that such records exist, can identify class members, and can be used in a reliable, administratively feasible fashion to satisfy the aseertainability inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">The Court will grant GSK\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>motion because Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s methodology is not reliable. The Court will deny the IPC\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>motion because it finds that Dr. Strombom is qualified to be an expert on this matter and that his methodology is sufficiently reliable. Finally, the Court will grant GSK\u2019s motion to decertify the IPC because the IPC has not carried its burden of showing that the class is ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">An understanding of the roles of some of the major players in the retail pharmaceuti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>cal industry is necessary to analyze some of the ascertainability issues in this case. Many individual consumers obtain prescription drugs from retail pharmacies. If they are covered by a health insurance plan, consumers may share the cost of prescription drugs with their insurer or health plan. These entities are often referred to as \u201cthird party payers\u201d (\u201cTPPs\u201d). GSK\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>Mot. Ex. A, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 24 (\u201cRosenthal Decl.\u201d); GSK\u2019s Mot. to Decertify Ex. A, \u00b6\u00b6 48-53 (\u201cStrombom Report\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">In many eases, TPPs employ a PBM as a sort of middleman between the TPP and the retail pharmacy. TPPs provide PBMs with information about individual consumers and the details of their insurance coverage. When a consumer goes to the pharmacy to obtain a prescription drug, he or she provides insurance information to the pharmacist. The pharmacy contacts the PBM with that information, and the PBM determines what price, if any, the consumer is responsible for. The PBM also often forwards the TPP\u2019s portion of the retail price of the drug to the pharmacy. This is usually accomplished via an electronic, automated system. St. Phillip Decl. Ex. 6 at 8-9, Mar. 9, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">II. <em>Relevant Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The IPC claims that that GSK (along with former codefendants Biovail Corporation, Biovail Laboratories, Inc., and Biovail Laboratories International SRL (collectively, \u201cBiovail\u201d), who have since settled) delayed the entry of generic versions of the drug Wellbutrin XL (\u201cgeneric XL\u201d) by entering into illegal agreements with generic drug companies to settle patent infringement lawsuits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In August 2011, the Court certified the IPC as a Rule 23(b)(3) class after extensive briefing and several days of hearings. <em>See Wellbutrin XL, 282 </em>F.R.D. 126. The Court defined the IPC as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">(1) All persons or entities who purchased an AB-rated generic bioequivalent of Well-butrin XL (\u201cgeneric XL\u201d) at any time during the \u201cClass Period\u201d (hereafter defined) in California, Florida, Nevada, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"as-dedup-0\">. (2) All entities that purchased 150 mg or 300 mg Wellbutrin XL before an AB-rated generic bioequivalent was available for such dosages AND purchased generic XL in the same state after generic XL became available in California, Florida, Nevada, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">For purposes of the Class definition, persons or entities purchased Wellbutrin XL or generic XL if they paid some or all of the retail purchase price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">Excluded from the Class are \u201cflat co-payers\u201d meaning natural persons whose only purchases of generic XL were made pursuant to contracts with third party payers (\u201cTPP\u201d) whereby the amount paid by the natural person for generic XL was the same regardless of the retail purchase price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">The Class Period begins November 14, 2005 and ends on April 29, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">Order, August 12, 2011 (Docket No. 354). The parties did not raise the ascertainability question in the previous certification proceedings, and the Court did not consider it when it certified the class. <em>See generally Wellbutrin XL, </em>282 F.R.D. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">On September 22, 2014, GSK filed the pending motion to decertify the IPC. The IPC filed a motion to strike GSK\u2019s motion shortly thereafter. Following a status conference in chambers with the parties\u2019 counsel, the Court denied the IPC\u2019s motion to strike. During the status conference, the IPC\u2019s counsel indicated that it needed discovery to properly respond to GSK\u2019s motion to decertify. The Court granted the IPC\u2019s request for discovery, and issued a scheduling order allowing for fact and expert discovery on the motion to decertify and setting dead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>lines for the filing of any opposition briefs, reply briefs, and related <em>Daubert </em>motions. Scheduling Order, November 19, 2014 (Docket No. 517).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">During the fact discovery period, the IPC filed a motion to compel against GSK, mostly seeking information about the TPP-PBM relationship. The Court denied this motion, as the information sought would be in the possession of PBMs and TPPs, not drug manufacturers like GSK. Order, December 10, 2014 (Docket No. 521). The Court also noted that the IPC had served subpoenas for documents and depositions to nine different PBMs regarding their purchase records for Wellbutrin XL and financial arrangements with members of the class. <em>Id. </em>Despite serving these subpoenas, the IPC did not introduce any such PBM documents or deposition testimony to the Court in support of its ascertainability arguments. Oral Ar. Tr. 57:6-60:2, May 29, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On May 29, 2015, the Court held oral argument on the pending motion to decertify and related <em>Daubert </em>motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">III. <em>The Ascertainability Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">A. <em>Expert Witnesses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Both GSK and the IPC have introduced expert witnesses to support their arguments on the ascertainability issue. GSK relies on the opinions and conclusions of Dr. Bruce A. Strombom, while the IPC relies on Dr. Meredith Rosenthal and Paul DeBree. All three experts provided reports and were deposed. A summary of the expert reports follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">1. <em>Dr. Bruce A. Strombom</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Dr. Strombom generally opines that the IPC is not ascertainable because identifying class members would require extensive individualized analysis, and identifies three main theories as to why this is the ease. First, Dr. Strombom claims that PBMs, depending on their contracts with TPPs, may have borne financial risk for the purchase of Well-butrin XL or generic XL due to rebate and price guarantees. He states that determining when and whether a PBM bore financial risk stemming from these types of guarantees would depend on individual contracts with TPPs and would therefore require individualized inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">Second, Dr. Strombom opines that TPPs may have passed on their portion of the increased price of Wellbutrin XL and/or generic XL by, for example, charging higher premiums the following year to consumers of health insurance. Third, Dr. Strombom states that in some cases, available records do not allow individual consumer class members to be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">a. <em>The PBM Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Dr. Strombom highlights the presence of both rebate guarantee provisions and price discount guarantee provisions in PBM-TPP contracts. PBMs may negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain rebates that can be used to lower the price paid for prescription drugs. Similarly, PBMs may negotiate with retail pharmacies to obtain price discounts on purchases made by TPP plan members. Some PBM-TPP contracts include provisions in which the PBM guarantees minimum rebate amounts or minimum price discounts. Dr. Strombom opines that if a PBM is unable to obtain rebates or discounts at the levels guaranteed, the PBM would be responsible to make up the difference. This would cause a PBM to bear financial risk for the retail purchase price of Wellbutrin XL and/or generic XL, making it a member of the class. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 16-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Dr. Strombom states that these arrangements present an ascertainability problem because they differ from PBM contract to PBM contract and would thus necessitate an individualized inquiry. Additionally, rebate payments from PBMs to TPPs are usually paid in a lump sum incorporating rebates for many different drugs. Determining which PBMs bore financial risk due to rebate payments and discount guarantees for Wellbut-rin XL would therefore require individualized inquiries. Strombom Report \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">b. <em>The Premium Pass-On Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">Dr. Strombom also opines that TPPs likely would not be harmed by any overcharge on the price of Wellbutrin XL or generic XL because they would pass on the increased price of the drug to their consumers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>form of higher premiums for the next year\u2019s coverage. Dr. Strombom states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4d\">[a]s health care costs increase for these plans and insurers, they must increase the amount of funds allocated to pay claims. This increase in funds is achieved through various types of adjustments, with the exact adjustments for any given TPP being highly individualized. The specific adjustments that are made, however, determine which parties bear the burden of the alleged overcharge. Thus, class membership is only ascertainable through analysis of these individualized adjustments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWo\">Strombom Report \u00b628. Dr. Strombom describes the various adjustments that insurance companies can make in order to pass on the cost of increased health care to consumers. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Dr. Strombom claims that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj7\">there are no records readily identifying the class members who bore the alleged overcharges after pass-on is taken into account. Accordingly, class members can only be ascertained through extensive individualized inquiry into the specific adjustments made by TPPs to their healthcare coverage and premiums, as well as the specific parties (employers versus members) who are ultimately responsible for paying the health insurance premiums.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Strombom Report \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">To support this theory, Dr. Strombom cites the fact that insurance companies generally increase insurance premiums to reflect the rising costs of health care, and observes that there is a positive correlation between the cost of health care and the cost of health insurance. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 30-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Dr. Strombom also supports this theory with the fact that insurance companies use processes such as \u201cexperience rating\u201d and \u201cretrospective experience rating\u201d \u2014 in which the insurance provider looks back at the costs of particular insured customers \u2014 in order to take costs into account in setting future premiums. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 34-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Finally, Dr. Strombom discusses the Medical Loss Ratio (\u201cMLR\u201d) rule that was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d). This rule requires that health care spending by insurers be within a certain ratio relative to health care premiums. If the ratio falls below a certain level, insurers are required to rebate to policyholders the amount of the premium sufficient to raise the MLR to the minimum level. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Dr. Strombom argues that insurers potentially passed on the cost of Wellbutrin XL or generic XL overcharges because the overcharges could have raised the insurers\u2019 MLR above the minimum level, and thus precluded the issuance of a rebate to the insurance customers. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 41-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">c. <em>Ascertainability of Individual Consumers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Dr. Strombom provides three main reasons why individual consumers of generic XL cannot be ascertained without individual inquiry. All three relate to the fact that the class definition excludes individuals who paid only flat co-payments when they purchased generic XL.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">First, Dr. Strombom points out that under their health insurance plans, what many consumers paid for generic XL depended on what pharmacy they obtained the drug from. At certain pharmacies, consumers had to pay only a flat co-payment, while at other pharmacies they may have had to pay a percentage of the retail cost of the drug. Without individualized inquiries of where these consumers purchased generic XL, Dr. Strom-bom opines, the class could not be ascertained. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 48-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">Second, Dr. Strombom cites consumer surveys that indicate that a majority of respondents could not correctly identify whether they paid flat co-payments or not. Dr. Strombom states that these surveys show that ascertaining the class by affidavit would not be a realistic way of identifying class members. Strombom Report \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">Finally, Dr. Strombom analyzed data produced by one of the class representatives, Aetna Health of California, and concluded that the individual consumers could not be ascertained using this data. Although the Aetna data show which Aetna clients pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>chased generic XL during the class period and the price they paid for the drug, the data do not explicitly state whether those consumers paid a flat co-payment. Strombom Report \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Dr. Strombom made inferences from the data in an attempt to determine whether Aetna clients paid a flat co-payment and were thus excluded from the class. If the amount paid by the consumer matched the retail cost of the drug, Dr. Strombom characterized the payment as \u201cfully out-of-pocket.\u201d If the consumer paid nothing, Dr. Strombom categorized the purchase \u201cfully covered.\u201d If the consumer paid an integer dollar amount, like $10, Dr. Strombom categorized the payment as \u201cfixed-dollar copay,\u201d provided that the payment did not also equal a fixed percentage evenly divisible by 5% of the total drug cost (e.g., 20% of the retail price). If the consumer paid a dollar amount equal to a fixed percentage of the total drug cost (e.g., 20%), Dr. Strombom characterized the payment as \u201ccoinsurance.\u201d If a payment was consistent with either \u201cfixed-dollar copay\u201d or \u201ccoinsurance,\u201d Dr. Strombom categorized it as \u201ccopay or coinsurance.\u201d If the payment fit none of these categories, Dr. Strombom categorized it as \u201cambiguous.\u201d Strombom Report \u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Dr. Strombom used these categories to determine whether a payment qualified a consumer for class membership. Payments in the \u201cfixed-dollar copay\u201d and \u201cfully covered\u201d categories did not qualify consumers to be in the class. Payments classified as \u201cfully out-of-pocket\u201d and \u201ccoinsurance\u201d qualified consumers to be in the class. Dr. Strombom opined that payments classified as \u201ccopay or coinsurance\u201d and \u201cambiguous\u201d did not have clear implications for class membership, and listed them as \u201cuncertain.\u201d Strombom Report \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Dr. Strombom then analyzed the Aetna data, and grouped the 15,167 Aetna clients who made at least one purchase of generic XL based on the types of payments they made. He found that 13,417 consumers made only non-qualifying payments and should be excluded from the class (\u201cCategory A,\u201d 88.5%); 1,075 consumers made qualifying payments and should be included in the class (\u201cCategory B,\u201d 7.1%); 336 consumers made only one qualifying payment and also made at least one non-qualifying or uncertain payment which made their status uncertain (\u201cCategory C,\u201d 2.2%); and 339 consumers made no qualifying payments and had at least one uncertain payment (\u201cCategory D,\u201d 2.2%). Strombom Report \u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Dr. Strombom conducted a similar analysis of data from OptumHealth, which is publicly available. Of the 23,463 consumers who made at least one generic purchase, 14,626 (62.3%) belonged in Category A; 6,356 (27.1%) belonged in Category B; 993 (4.2%) belonged in Category C; and 1,488 (6.3%) belonged in Category D. Strombom Report \u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">2. <em>Dr. Meredith Rosenthal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Dr. Rosenthal provides several opinions related to the ascertainability inquiry. First, she opines that class membership is a function of who pays for the drug at the time of the transaction. Given that, she argues, rebate and price discount guarantees do not make PBMs potential class members. Second, she opines that there are sufficient records in the pharmaceutical industry to identify class members. Dr. Rosenthal also criticizes Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis of the Aetna and OptumHealth data. Finally, she opines that consumers who could not be identified by pharmaceutical records could be identified by other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Dr. Rosenthal states that \u201cClass membership is a function of who pays for the drug at the time of the transaction,\u201d and offers three reasons for this limitation. GSK\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>Mot. Ex. A, \u00b6 4 (\u201cRosenthal Decl.\u201d). First, Dr. Rosenthal states that she was \u201cinstructed by counsel to work from the theory\u201d that class membership is limited to those who paid for the drug at the time of the transaction. Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 4. Second, Dr. Ro-senthal states that this limitation is \u201centirely consistent with the plain meaning of the word \u2018paid\u2019 and requires no new theory.\u201d Rosenthal Decl. \u00b64. Finally, Dr. Rosenthal based her limitation of class membership on the Court\u2019s choice of law analysis, which concluded that \u201cthe law of the place of purchase\u201d would govern the transactions. Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>senthal Deel. \u00b6 13-14 (citing <em>Wellbutrin XL, </em>282 F.R.D. at 136).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Dr. Rosenthal opines that rebate and price discount guarantees should not \u201cweigh into the ascertainment of Class members\u201d because they are not computed or allocated at the time of the transaction. Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 25. She argues that Dr. Strombom\u2019s consideration of rebate and price guarantees\u2014 what Dr. Rosenthal characterizes as \u201coff-transaction adjustments\u201d \u2014 challenges the plain meanings of the words \u201cpaid\u201d and \u201cpurchase\u201d in the class definition. Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 15. Dr. Rosenthal extends this criticism to Dr. Strombom\u2019s premium pass-on theory, saying it \u201cbrings in a highly speculative analysis of long-run economic incidence and incorrectly render absurd the notion of \u2018paid.\u2019 \u201d Rosenthal Deel. \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Dr. Rosenthal also criticizes Dr. Strom-bom\u2019s analysis of the Aetna and Optum-Health data. She argues that the consumers in his Category C should be included in the class without any further individualized inquiry because they made at least one qualifying purchase. She also states that consumers in Dr. Strombom\u2019s Category D should be excluded from the class without the need for individualized inquiry because no qualifying payments could be demonstrated. Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Finally, Dr. Rosenthal opines that consumers who paid cash for generic XL (that is, those without some form of health insurance) can be ascertained using pharmacy reports, receipts, and prescription bottles. Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">3. <em>Paul DeBree</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">In his declaration, Mr. DeBree offers two general opinions. First, Mr. DeBree states that those who paid for Wellbutrin XL and generic XL can be easily identified. Second, Mr. DeBree concludes that PBMs did not pay a portion of the retail purchase price of Wellbutrin XL and generic XL, and are therefore not potential members of the IPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Mr. DeBree opines that there are readily accessible records that can be used to identify every entity and consumer that paid some or all of the purchase price of Wellbutrin XL and generic XL. Mr. DeBree states that pharmacies record consumers\u2019 prescription and identifying information, and that PBMs necessarily maintain consumer identifying and insurance plan information to facilitate the claim adjudication process with pharmacies. Mr. DeBree believes that such information would be accessible and sufficient to identify all potential class members. During his deposition, however, Mr. DeBree stated that PBMs would not willingly give out whatever pharmaceutical information they maintain, undercutting the statement in his report that such information would be accessible. St. Phillip Decl. Ex. 1, \u00b6\u00b621, 24-25, Mar. 9, 2015 (\u201cDeBree Decl.\u201d); DeBree Dep. 287:24-288:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Mr. DeBree opines that PBMs do not pay a part of the retail purchase price of Wellbut-rin XL and/or generic XL because rebate and discount guarantees are calculated in the aggregate over time and concern only the business relationship between the PBM and the TPP. PBMs do not pay a portion of the retail cost of these drugs because such guarantees are directed only towards the PBM\u2019s contractual obligations to TPPs, and create no obligations to consumers to purchase drugs. During his deposition, however, Mr. DeBree conceded that PBMs may bill their TPP clients for pharmaceutical purchases at a lower rate than the rate PBMs paid to retail pharmacies for the purchase of pharmaceutical drugs. DeBree Dep. 79:15-80:6. DeBree Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Mr. DeBree argues that PBMs are not potential class members because they are not insurers with an obligation to consumers to pay pharmacies for drug purchases. According to Mr. DeBree, although PBMs do pay pharmacies directly, they only make such payments on behalf of TPPs and use only TPP funds to do so. According to Mr. De-Bree, if PBMs did pay a portion of the retail price of pharmaceuticals, they would be operating illegally as unregulated insurance companies.

To satisfy the requirements of Rule 702, a proffered expert must be qualified to express an expert opinion, the proffered expert opinion must be reliable; and the proffered expert\u2019s testimony must assist the trier of fact and \u201cfit\u201d the facts of the case. <em>In re TMI Litigation, </em>193 F.3d 613, 664-65 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">To be qualified as an expert witness, one must \u201cpossess specialized expertise.\u201d <em>Calhoun v.

Several factors guide the reliability inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">(1) whether a method consists of a testable hypothesis; (2) whether the method has been subject to peer review; (3) the known or potential rate of error; (4) the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique\u2019s operation; (5) whether the method is generally accepted; (6) the relationship of the technique to methods which have been established to be reliable; (7) the qualifications of the expert witness tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tifying based on the methodology; and (8) the non-judicial uses to which the method has been put.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>Id. </em>The proffered expert\u2019s methodology does not have to be perfect; a court should only exclude the evidence if a flaw is large enough that the expert lacks good grounds for his or her conclusions. <em>In re TMI Litig., </em>193 F.3d at 665. However, a court must examine the expert\u2019s conclusions to determine whether they \u201creliably flow from the facts known to the expert and the methodology used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665-66 (quoting <em>Heller v.

Additionally, the IPC claims that Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis of pharmaceutical purchase data is flawed. Dr. Strombom\u2019s opinions and testimony will not be excluded because he is sufficiently qualified to be an expert in this case, and his data analysis, though flawed, is reliable enough for the <em>Daubert </em>inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">1. <em>Dr. Strombom\u2019s Qualifications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Dr. Strombom has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Irvine. His graduate research focused on consumer choice in health markets, and his dissertation examined the factors that influence employees\u2019 choices of alternative health plans. GSK\u2019s Mot. to Decertify Ex. A, \u00b6 3 (\u201cStrom-bom Report\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Dr. Strombom has professional experience in the healthcare industry. He has evaluated the pricing and claims payment practices of health insurers, has reviewed the merger of hospitals, and has conducted economic analy-ses of healthcare markets. Additionally, Dr. Strombom has conducted economic analyses evaluating the appropriateness of class treatment in eases involving health insurance and pharmaceuticals. Strombom Report \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Dr. Strombom is qualified to give expert opinions because he has years of experience analyzing data in the healthcare field. His qualifications show that he knows more about the healthcare field in general, and the pharmaceutical field specifically, than the average layman.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">The IPC argues that Dr. Strombom\u2019s qualifications are not relevant to this ease, in that he has \u201cno specialized knowledge about the pharmacy benefit manager or pharmaceutical industry.\u201d IPC\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>Mot. 16. The IPC argues that Dr. Strombom has never worked or consulted for a pharmacy, a managed care company, or a PBM. Finally, the IPC claims that Dr. Strombom never analyzed, researched, or opined on pharmaceutical data or pharmaceutical platforms until this litigation. <em>See In re TMI Litig., </em>193 F.3d at 680 (excluding expert testimony because the proffered expert\u2019s only knowledge on the issue was obtained by reviewing literature in connection with his retention as an expert in the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">Despite the IPC\u2019s claims, Dr. Strombom has in fact analyzed pharmaceutical data before this litigation. In his deposition, he testified that he has used the same publicly available OptumHealth pharmaceutical data in previous assignments. Strombom Dep. 98:21-99:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">Additionally, despite the fact that he has never worked directly with a PBM, Dr. Strombom\u2019s economics education and his ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>perience in the healthcare field give him the capability to interpret PBM-TPP contracts and determine what risks, if any, are present due to any rebate or price guarantees contained therein. Dr. Strombom has much more skill than the average layperson in data analysis and much more knowledge than the average person regarding the healthcare industry. He is qualified to serve as an expert for purposes of ascertainability.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">2. <em>Dr. Strombom\u2019s Analysis of Pharmaceutical Purchase Data</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The IPC challenges Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis of Aetna and OptumHealth data and his conclusions that such data are not sufficient to identify individual consumer class members. Although flawed, Dr. Strombom\u2019s data analysis and conclusions are reliable enough that his opinions and testimony will not be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The first problem with Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis is his characterization of \u201cambiguous\u201d or \u201cuncertain\u201d payments as they relate to class membership. Dr. Strombom opined that if a payment was not consistent with a flat co-payment, a coinsurance payment, or a fully out-of-pocket payment on its face, individualized inquiries would be required to determine the type of payment and thus eligibility for the class. The type of payment, however, does not need to be determined to identify class members; the payment just must have not been a flat co-payment. As long as the consumer\u2019s payment was not a flat co-payment, the consumer would be a member of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Another flaw in Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis is that he characterizes Category C, which includes consumers who made only one qualifying payment and also made at least one non-qualifying or uncertain payment, as a category in which individualized inquiry is necessary to determine class membership. Membership in the class does not require that every payment not be a flat co-payment, however; a consumer would be a member of the class even if he or she made only one qualifying purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">These flaws in the way Dr. Strombom categorizes payments and consumers are not so serious that Dr. Strombom\u2019s opinions on the ascertainability of individual consumers should be excluded. Dr. Strombom\u2019s underlying methodology \u2014 analyzing amounts paid by consumers in an attempt to determine whether a given consumer paid only flat co-payments for generic XL \u2014 appears to the Court to be a sound way of determining the class membership of individual consumers. Any flaws in Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis affect only the number of consumers in a given category; they do not undermine Dr. Strom-bom\u2019s conclusion that there are cases where the Aetna purchase records he analyzed did not provide enough information to ascertain whether or not an individual consumer was a member of the class. His methodology is therefore reliable enough to satisfy the <em>Dau-bert </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The IPC makes several other criticisms of Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis, none persuasive. First, the IPC states that Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis of the Aetna data was flawed because he analyzed only the data that Aetna produced in this litigation without determining whether Aetna possesses additional data that could help in the ascertainability inquiry. Dr. Strombom analyzed additional data from OptumHealth, however, and came to similar conclusions. This alleged flaw is not large enough to exclude Dr. Strombom\u2019s opinion on the basis of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">The IPC also claims that Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis is unreliable because he did not rely on data standards set by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (\u201cNCPDP\u201d), a standards setting organization. The NCPDP sets pharmaceutical data standards, but does not actively collect or store any pharmaceutical data. The IPC contends that the standards set by the NCPDP include fields to record the amount a consumer pays in co-payments and coinsurance, which would therefore enable class members to be ascertained. In his rebuttal report, Dr. Strombom analyzes data from GSK\u2019s relationship with PBMs, as well as information from the NCPDP, and concludes that NCPDP standards have not been implemented uniformly across the pharmaceutical industry. Strombom Rebuttal Report \u00b6 45. The fact that the standards may include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>fields that could help the aseertainability inquiry does not mean that those fields were actually utilized in generic XL transactions. This alleged flaw in Dr. Strombom\u2019s methodology does not warrant excluding his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Dr. Strombom has the necessary qualifications to serve as an expert for purposes of the aseertainability inquiry. Although flawed, his analysis is reliable enough for him to offer his expert opinions. The IPC\u2019s <em>Dau-bert </em>motion is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">C. <em>Dr. Meredith Rosenthal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">GSK seeks to exclude Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s opinions and conclusions limiting class membership to those who paid for Wellbutrin XL or generic XL at the time of the transaction. These opinions and conclusions will be excluded because Dr. Rosenthal did not support them with independent economic analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Dr. Rosenthal is highly qualified to give opinions on these matters. She is a Professor of Health Economics and Policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and an Academic Affiliate of Greyloek McKinnon Associates, a consulting and litigation support firm. Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 1. GSK does not dispute Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s qualifications, and the Court relied on her opinions when it originally certified the IPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In her Rebuttal Declaration, Dr. Rosenthal opines that \u201cClass membership is a function of who pays for the drug at the time of the transaction.\u201d GSK\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>Mot. Ex. A, \u00b6 4 (\u201cRosenthal Deck\u201d). Under this theory, according to Dr. Rosenthal, price discount guarantees would not cause PBMs to pay a portion of the retail purchase price, and PBMs would therefore not be class members. Rosenthal Deck \u00b6\u00b6 15, 24r-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Dr. Rosenthal cites three reasons why she limited membership of the class to those that paid at the time of the retail transaction, none of which provide adequate support for the limitation or are based on sound economic reasoning. First, Dr. Rosenthal states that she was \u201cinstructed by counsel to work from the theory that Class membership is a function of who pays for the drug at the time of the transaction.\u201d Rosenthal Deck \u00b6 4. An instruction from counsel is not a sound basis on which to draw an economic conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Second, Dr. Rosenthal states that the instruction of counsel is \u201centirely consistent with the plain meaning of the word \u2018paid\u2019 and requires no new theory.\u201d Rosenthal Deck \u00b6 4. Limiting class membership to those who paid at the time of the transaction, however, is not consistent with the plain meaning of \u201cpaid some or all of the retail purchase price,\u201d especially given the realities of the pharmaceutical industry. The class definition does not limit class membership to those who paid at the time of the transaction; it limits class membership to those who paid a portion of the retail purchase price. Indeed, in many cases, TPPs such as health insurers do not pay their portion of the retail purchase price \u201cat the time of the transaction\u201d\u2014 a PBM pays for them. Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s reading of the word paid would effectively exclude many TPPs, who the IPC claims are one of two core groups of class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Dr. Rosenthal appeared to concede as much during her deposition. She testified that in using the phrase \u201cat the time of the transaction,\u201d she did not mean literally at the time of the transaction. Rosenthal Dep. 52:15-53:19, Feb. 12, 2015 (\u201cRosenthal Ascer-tainability Dep.\u201d). She stated that \u201cif it\u2019s 24, 72 hours later that the TPP funds flow to the PBM, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m just talking about the specific transaction.\u201d Rosenthal Aseertainability Dep. 52:24-53:1. She further clarified that a payment had to be \u201crelated to the filling of that prescription\u201d for it to be a payment qualifying an entity for class membership. Rosenthal Ascertainability Dep. 53:18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s deposition testimony seems to indicate that when she used the phrase \u201cat the time of the transaction\u201d repeatedly throughout her declaration, she really meant to say \u201crelated to the transaction.\u201d Dr. Rosenthal never explains why price guarantee provisions are not \u201crelated to the transaction;\u201d she merely concludes that these are \u201coff-transaction financial flows.\u201d There is an argument that any payment from a PBM to a TPP due to a price guarantee would be \u201crelated to the transaction\u201d \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>PBM would be responsible for some of the overcharge stemming from a purchase of Wellbutrin XL.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In making this argument, Dr. Rosenthal is not undertaking an economic analysis. Rather, she is attempting to interpret the meaning of words within a class definition \u2014 a task that is the duty of the Court, not an economic expert. The plain meaning of the class definition is not a sound basis upon which Dr. Rosenthal can rely in limiting class membership to those who paid at the time of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Finally, Dr. Rosenthal based her limitation on class membership on the Court\u2019s choice of law analysis, which concluded that \u201cthe law of the place of purchase\u201d would govern the transactions. <em>Wellbutrin XL, </em>282 F.R.D. at 136. The choice of law inquiry is markedly different from the economic inquiry necessary to determine who \u201cpaid\u201d for a given drug. Any reliance by Dr. Rosenthal on the Court\u2019s choice of law analysis for this purpose is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s conclusions limiting class membership to those who \u201cpaid at the time of the transaction\u201d are excluded because her methodology is severely flawed and her conclusions inconsistent and ambiguous. Rather than base her conclusions on economic analysis, Dr. Rosenthal relies on instructions from counsel and the Court\u2019s choice of law analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">V. <em>Motion to Decertify</em></p>\n<p id=\"AE\">A. <em>Legal Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Rule 23(e)(1) requires district courts \u201cto reassess their class rulings as the case develops.\u201d <em>Barnes v.

Finally, a defendant must be able to \u201ctest the reliability of the evidence submitted to prove class membership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Ascertainability should not be conflated with other Rule 23 requirements, such as the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).

Discussion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">GSK\u2019s motion to decertify the IPC is granted because the IPC has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the class is ascertainable. Specifically, the IPC has not shown that it can ascertain which PMBs, if any, are members of the class, and which individual consumers of generic XL are members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">1. <em>The Potential Class Membership of PBMs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The IPC argues that PBMs are not potential class members, and that it therefore does not need to show that it can ascertain which PBMs are class members and which are not. PBMs are potential class members because they may have paid a portion of the retail purchase price of Wellbutrin XL or generic XL via so-called \u201cspread pricing arrangements\u201d or \u201cprice discount guarantees.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An entity is a member of the IPC if it paid some or all of the retail purchase price of generic XL during the class period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">In some contracts with TPPs, PBMs guarantee a certain price discount for prescription drug purchases. GSK\u2019s Reply in Supp. of its Mot. to Decertify Exs. A-D. For example, OptumRx, a large PBM, may make guarantees to its TPP clients that it will obtain a certain level of discounts for prescription drug purchases. GSK\u2019s Reply in Supp. of its Mot. to Decertify Ex. D. If it cannot obtain those discounts from pharmacies, OptumRx is responsible to the TPP for the difference between the guaranteed discount and the actual discount obtained. <em>Id. </em>In this event, it is possible that a PBM will not be fully reimbursed by the TPP for the prescription drug purchases of a TPP\u2019s members. The PBM would, therefore, have paid a portion of the retail purchase price of generic XL.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The IPC does not dispute that such spread pricing arrangements or price discount guarantees exist, but rather characterizes them as \u201coff-transaction financial flows\u201d that do not take place when the retail transaction occurs. In her deposition, Dr. Rosenthal acknowledged that due to price discount guarantees,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-14\">it may be possible that with some contract I\u2019m out of sync and I\u2019m losing money on all my prescriptions, and then that, whatever that gap is, the 1 or 2 percent gap, that\u2019s the percentage of the overcharge that the PBM is bearing in that kind of negative risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">Rosenthal Ascertainability Dep. 75:14-20. The IPC\u2019s arguments are not persuasive on this point. Neither the IPC nor Dr. Rosen-thal explain why only the parties who paid at the time of the transaction should be included in the class, and Dr. Rosenthal conceded in her deposition that such a limitation, taken literally, would prevent most TPPs from being class members. Rosenthal Ascertainability Dep. 52:15-53:19. Indeed, in many cases such a limitation would cause PBMs to be included in the class and TPPs to be excluded, as PBMs are often the entities that pay pharmacies \u201cat the time of the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">The IPC relies on <em>In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litigation, </em>297 F.R.D. 168, 179 (D.Mass.2013), <em>aff'd </em>777 F.3d 9 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Cir.2015), to support its contention that PBMs are not a part of the class. The district court in <em>Nexium, </em>however, expressly excluded PBMs from the class at the suggestion of the named plaintiff without any discussion. The First Circuit did not mention the class membership of PBMs on appeal. <em>See generally, In re Nexium Antitrust Litig., </em>777 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The IPC has also offered to include an express exclusion of PBMs in the class defi- \u2019 nition in this case.

L.Rev. 1213,1213-14 (2014) (highlighting the lack of clarity in the wake of <em>Comcast </em>with regards to the role of damages calculations in the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The <em>Comcast </em>Court held that at the class certification stage, a plaintiffs damages model must measure only damages attributable to the plaintiffs theory of liability. <em>Comcast, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1433. This case does not present what this Court refers to as a \u201cpure\u201d <em>Comcast </em>problem. The IPC\u2019s damages model measures only damages attributable to its theory of liability \u2014 that GSK sought to exclude generic XL from the market by entering into settlement agreements with generic companies in patent litigation. The <em>Comcast </em>Court\u2019s implication, however, that a putative class must show that \u201cdamages are susceptible of measurement across the entire class\u201d could cause issues for the IPC if PBMs are excluded from the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Professor Rosenthal\u2019s damages methodology measures damages in the aggregate across the entire IPC, and would include any damages suffered by PBMs as a result of spread pricing arrangements or price discount guarantees. Oral Arg. Tr. 71:10-20, April 29, 2011; Rosenthal Ascertainability Dep. 160:12-161:2. Professor Rosenthal\u2019s damages methodology does not allocate damages to individual class members, and could not be used to figure out the overcharge suffered by an individual class member. Oral Arg. Tr. 75:20-77:2, April 29, 2011. Professor Rosenthal acknowledged that her model could not currently deduct any damages suffered by PBMs from the damages calculation. Rosenthal Ascertainability Dep. 160:16-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">It is unclear whether the IPC has shown that if PBMs are excluded, \u201cdamages are susceptible to measurement across the entire class\u201d \u2014 the IPC\u2019s current damages model would potentially include damages suffered by non-class members, and may therefore overstate the amount of damages suffered by the IPC. The Court does not have enough information at this point to know whether such an overstatement would be significant or relatively minor; indeed, the Court does not know if such an overstatement even exists. <em>Cf. Comcast, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1433 (stating that at the class certification stage, damages \u201c[calculations need not be exact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The Court therefore declines to include an express exclusion of PBMs in the class definition. Such an exclusion would potentially create as many problems for the certification of the IPC as it would solve. Additionally, such an exclusion would do nothing to solve the IPC\u2019s problems in showing that individual consumers can be ascertained, which the Court will discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Price discount guarantees made by PBMs to TPPs potentially caused PBMs to pay some or all of the retail purchase price of Wellbutrin XL or generic XL. If a PBM did pay a part of the retail purchase price, it would be a member of the IPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">2. <em>Ascertainability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">The IPC has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a reliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and administratively feasible mechanism for determining which PBMs and individual consumers are members of the class. The IPC\u2019s evidence on ascertainability barely goes further than repeated assurances that showing ascertainability in pharmaceutical eases is not difficult and that there are extensive purchase records in the pharmaceutical industry that could be used to ascertain whether individual consumers and PBMs are members of the class. Oral Ar. Tr. 7:7-8:17, 9:20-10:6, May 29, 2015. The IPC has not introduced evidence showing that those assertions are correct, and the Third Circuit has warned district courts against merely relying on a party\u2019s assurance \u201cthat it intends or plans to meet the requirements of Rule 23____\u201d <em>Carrera, </em>727 F.3d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The IPC claims that a reliable, administratively feasible method exists for identifying which PBMs and consumers are in the class: utilizing purchase records. The IPC, however, has put forward scant evidence to support that claim. The IPC\u2019s ascertainability experts, Dr. Meredith Rosenthal and Paul De-Bree, both claim that there are records at the retail pharmacy and PBM level that can be used to identify class members. DeBree Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28; Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Additionally, the IPC has introduced purchase data from several health plans. Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Opp. to the IPC\u2019s Mot. for Class Certification Exs. 9 &amp; 13, Jan. 28, 2011. Neither expert, however, examined or analyzed these pharmaceutical records, or the Aetna data analyzed by Dr. Strombom, to show that they could be used to ascertain PBMs and individual consumers. The Court is not persuaded by these experts\u2019 eonclusory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Even if it were established that such records exist, the IPC has not introduced any evidence showing that such records are obtainable or can be used in an administratively feasible fashion to ascertain class members. The IPC\u2019s own expert testified that it could be difficult to obtain purchase data from PBMs. DeBree Dep. 286:22-288:16. Indeed, the IPC served subpoenas on several PBMs during the recent discovery period, but did not obtain any records from those PBMs. This heightens the Court\u2019s concern that such pharmaceutical records may not be obtainable for use in the ascertainability inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Nor has the IPC provided any evidence that if it did obtain PBM and retail pharmacy records, it could utilize those records to ascertain the class in an administratively feasible manner. There are thousands of PBMs and retail pharmacies; the IPC has not produced any evidence showing that it could synthesize records from these disparate entities and use them to ascertain PBMs and individual consumers in a reliable and administratively feasible manner. Additionally, the IPC has not shown that such records could identify which consumers paid flat co-payments and which did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The IPC also points to the existence of data standards set by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (\u201cNCPDP\u201d) as evidence that pharmaceutical records exist that could be used to ascertain consumer class members. The NCPDP sets pharmaceutical data standards, but does not actively collect or store any pharmaceutical data. The IPC contends that the standards set by the NCPDP include data fields for both co-payments and coinsurance, which would enable the IPC to determine which consumers paid flat co-payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">It is not clear, however, that the players in the pharmaceutical industry utilize all of the fields set out in NCPDP standards. Various surveys conducted by the NCPDP indicate that a substantial portion of the industry is not fully compliant with NCPDP standards. Strombom Rebuttal Report \u00b645. The fact that NCPDP standards include data fields that could be used to ascertain individual class members does not automatically lead to the conclusion that such fields were utilized by members of the pharmaceutical industry, or that such records would be available to aid in the ascertainability inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Finally, the IPC argues that Dr. Strom-bom\u2019s analysis of the Aetna data shows that such data could be used to ascertain whether almost 98% of Aetna customers are in the class or not. Given the flaws in Dr. Strom-bom\u2019s analysis identified by the Court, however, the Court is unsure what percentage of Aetna customers Dr. Strombom\u2019s analysis could successfully ascertain. This evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>falls short of convincing the Court that such data could be used to ascertain individual class members.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The Court emphasizes that its decision on the aseertainability of the IPC is made on the record before it. The Court does not hold a view regarding whether indirect purchaser classes in other eases involving pharmaceutical purchases are ascertainable or not. The Court\u2019s holding is limited to the record before it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The IPC has not carried its burden of \u201caffirmatively demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that there is a reliable, administratively feasible method of ascertaining the class. <em>Byrd, </em>784 F.3d at 163; <em>see also Carrera, </em>727 F.3d at 306 (\u201cA plaintiff may not merely propose a method of ascertaining a class without any evidentiary support that the method will be successful.\u201d). The IPC\u2019s evidence in support of aseertainability consists mainly of conelusory statements by its experts that records exist that could be used to ascertain the class and the existence of NCPDP standards. This evidence is not enough to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the class is ascertainable. GSK\u2019s motion to decertify the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class is therefore granted. See Vista <em>Healthplan, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., </em>2015 WL 3623005, at *5-*13 (E.D.Pa. June 10, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">An appropriate order shall issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">AND NOW, this 30th day of June, 2015, upon consideration of defendants SmithKline Beecham Corporation d/b/a GlaxoSmithKline and GlaxoSmithKline pic\u2019s (collectively, \u201cGSK\u201d) Motion to Decertify the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class (\u201cIPC\u201d) (Docket No. 507), GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude the Expert Opinions and Testimony of Meredith Rosen-thal Regarding Aseertainability (Docket No. 532), the IPC\u2019s Motion Under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Bruce A. Strombom (Docket No. 528), all oppositions and replies thereto, and after hearing oral argument on these motions on May 29, 2015, for the reasons stated in a memorandum of law bearing today\u2019s date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">1. GSK\u2019s Motion to Decertify the IPC is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">2. GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude the Expert Opinions and Testimony of Meredith Rosen-thal Regarding Aseertainability is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">3. The IPC\u2019s Motion Under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Bruce A. Strom-bom is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">4. The indirect purchaser litigation class certified by the Court\u2019s orders of August 12, 2011 (Docket No. 354) and August 30, 2011 (Docket No. 357) is DECERTIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\">. The IPC initially alleged that GSK and Biovail delayed the entry of generic XL by filing sham patent litigation against generic companies and a sham citizen petition with the FDA. The Court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the sham patent litigation and sham citizen petition claims, and reserved judgment on the settlement agreement claims as briefing was still ongoing. <em>See In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litigation, </em>2012 WL 1657734, at *6 (E.D.Pa. May 11, 2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\">. Rule 702 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testily in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-17\">(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-18\">(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-19\">(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\">. The IPC does not challenge Dr. Strombom\u2019s premium pass-on theory in the IPC\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>motion; rather, the IPC argues that the theory is legally irrelevant. Because the Court grants GSK\u2019s motion to decertify on other grounds, it will not pass judgment on the validity of Dr. Strombom\u2019s premium pass-on theory or its legal relevance. The Court notes its skepticism, however, that a TPP would not have paid the purchase price of a prescription drug simply because it increased premiums to consumers the following year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\">. Rule 23 was amended in 2003, after <em>Barnes </em>was decided. The relevant language of Rule 23(c)(1) in place when <em>Barnes </em>was decided read that an order to certify a class \u201cmay be conditional and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.\" <em>Barnes, </em>161 F.3d at 134 n. 4 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1) (amended 2003)). Rule 23(c)(1)(C) now reads: \"An order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.\" The amended language does not affect the duty of district courts pronounced by the Third Circuit to continually reassess their class rulings as the case develops.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">. The parties do not dispute that the class is defined with reference to objective criteria. Rather, the parties focus their arguments on the second prong of the ascertainability inquiry: whether there is a reliable, administratively feasible method of identifying class members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\">. The parties agree that a PBM would be a member of the IPC if it operated pursuant to a capitation contract. Capitation contracts are exceedingly rare, to the point that they are almost nonexistent at this point. GSK states that it does not base its motion on capitation contracts, but rather on rebate and price discount guarantees. GSK's Reply in Supp. of its Mot. to Decertify 3 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-18\">. A more comprehensive class definition is located <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\">. The IPC also argues that the successful administration of the Biovail settlement in this case shows that there are sufficient records to ascertain the class. The successful administration of a settlement does not necessarily mean that a litigation class could be ascertained. In certifying a litigation class, the Court must be mindful of a defendant's due process rights. Such a concern is not present when administering a settlement class.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Similarly, the IPC argues that a model trial plan has already been proposed which sets out a methodology for ascertaining class members. <em>See </em>St. Phillip Decl. Ex. 10 at 79, Mar. 9, 2015. These related arguments are not persuasive because both the Biovail settlement and the model trial plan rely on representations from potential class members to ascertain whether they are members of the class. In <em>Carrera, </em>the Third Circuit held that relying on affidavits of potential class members to ascertain the class did not satisfy the aseertainability requirement. <em>Carrera, </em>727 F.3d at 309-312. The <em>Carrera </em>court was concerned both that relying on affidavits would not allow a defendant to challenge class membership, as well as the fairness to absent class members that their recovery might be diluted by fraudulent or inaccurate claims. <em>Id. </em>These concerns are present in this case as well; the Biovail settlement and the IPC\u2019s model trial plan do not persuade the Court that the class is ascertainable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
