Norega, his son (also a citizen and resident of the Philippines), rendered on behalf of the United States Army from November 8,1944, to April 4,1946, and on behalf of the War Shipping Administration from April 5, 1946, to May 7, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">The petition herein was filed in this court on March 13, 1953. Defendant has filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that the claim urged therein is barred by the statute of limitations applicable to claims coming within the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims (62 Stat. 976, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>28 U. S. C. (Supp. IV) \u00a7 2501) because it was not filed within six years of the date of the last alleged service, i. e. May 7, 1946. Defendant also points out that the petition filed by plaintiff under a power of attorney-in-fact from his son, not an infant or incompetent, does not meet the requirements of Court'of Claims Rule 20 (a); that plaintiff is not the real party in interest and therefore lacks capacity to prosecute this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We believe that both of defendant\u2019s positions are sound and accordingly plaintiff\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-7\">Madden, <em>Judge; </em>Whitaker, <em>Judge; </em>Littleton, <em>Judge; </em>and Jones, <em>Chief </em>Judge, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
