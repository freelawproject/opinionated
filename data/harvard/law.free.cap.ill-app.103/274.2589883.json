Notary Public.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b311-15\" pgmap=\"311\">The claim was objected to by the executor, and after being heard in the County Court, was there disallowed. It was then taken to the Circuit Court where it was tried by jury and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the estate.</p> <p id=\"Ali\" pgmap=\"311(95) 312(17)\">Before it was tried in the Circuit Court, Julius Bothschild died and the claim was thereafter prosecuted in the name of Albert Bothschild, the surviving partner, who, after the verdict had been returned against him, moved for a new trial, which was overruled and a judgment rendered disallowing the claim, to which the claimant excepted; and he has brought the case to this court by appeal, and to reverse the judgment, insists that the court improperly ruled on the evidence and instructions; that counsel for the estate made improper remarks when stating and arguing the case to the jury, and that the verdict and judgment are against the law and evidence.</p> <p id=\"b312-4\" pgmap=\"312\">The bill of exceptions shows that before the trial, claimant abandoned all claim upon the note upon which the claim was first founded, and relied only upon the account stated in the claim as amended.</p> <p id=\"AVz\" pgmap=\"312\">In support of the claim, the account books of Bothschild Bros, were received in evidence, and they showed on the dates mentioned in the amended claim, the items there charged were entered on the books as charges to P. J, Hendgen, substantially as specified in the claim as amended, except that in some instances the item on the books showed tl cash,\u201d and in others \u201c ch.,\u201d but most of them only the date, followed by the name P. J. Hendgen, and in the dollars and cents columns the figures in amounts as shown by the amended claim.</p> <p id=\"b312-9\" pgmap=\"312\">The' account books were shown to be those of Bothschild Bros., kept in the course of their business selling hats in the city of St. Louis, and the bookkeeper who kept their books from 1884 to the time Hendgen died and afterward, testified that the entries made in the books as charges against Hendgen prior to 1884 were in the handwriting of the bookkeeper who preceded him; that he was dead before the trial, and that often when P. J. Hendgen paid the items with which he is credited on the books after 1884, he would say that credit be given him on the \u201c old matter;\u201d on the \u201c old account.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b312-10\" pgmap=\"312\">It was also shown that the items credited from 1885 forward, were for commissions due Hengden as insurance broker on premiums for insurance which Avere given him by or through Bothschild Bros., and that Hendgen had often said that if they would give him more insurance, he could and would pay them more on the \u201c old account.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b312-11\" pgmap=\"312\">The executor showed that after the claim had been filed and before it was amended, Julius Bothschild told him that the estate only owed Bothschild Bros, the balance of the note upon which the claim was based.</p> <p id=\"b312-12\" pgmap=\"312\">There were no checks or notes put in evidence to explain or add to the showing made by the books.</p> <p id=\"b313-3\" pgmap=\"313\">The executor invoked the statute of limitations against the claim. At the request of the executor, the court instructed the jury to the effect that if they believed from the evidence that the several items of indebtedness claimed by the claimant were all more than five years past due when the claim therefor was filed in the County Court, then they should find for the estate unless they further believed from the evidence that Hendgen, within five years prior to the filing of the claim in the County Court, promised to pay the same or made partial payments thereon, with the intention or purpose of acknowledging the entire account; and at the instance of the claimant, refused to instruct the jury that a part payment on the account in question by Hendgen within five years before the claim was filed would alone be sufficient to hold the statute of limitations.</p> <p id=\"b313-4\" pgmap=\"313\">The account books of the firm alone were not sufficient to prove that the entries therein of cash or check charged to the decedent by the firm, were that much money loaned to him by them, for the reason that the usual probative force of accounts kept in books in the usual course of dealing between parties as regards transactions of merchandise and the like \u201c do not apply to an account for money lent, as that is not usually the subject-matter of an account, notes being generally taken.\u201d Boyer v. Sweet, 3 Scam. 120; Ruggles v. Gatton, 50 Ill. 412; Kibbe v. Bancroft, 77 Ill. 18; House v. Beak, 141 Ill. 290; Schwarze v. Roessler, 40 Ill. App. 474; and Smith v. Rentz, 15 L. R. A. 138.</p> <p id=\"b313-5\" pgmap=\"313\">And under all the evidence, it seems to us the jury were warranted in concluding that the claim had not been satisfactorily established.</p> <p id=\"b313-6\" pgmap=\"313\">The rulings of the court on the instructions were proper; for in order to remove the bar of the statute, it was necessary for the jury to find from the evidence that not only had the decedent made payments to the firm as claimed by them, but also that he had made them upon the identical account sued upon, with the intention thereby of recognizing the entire account. Miller v. Cinnamon, 168 Ill. 447.</p> <p id=\"b313-7\" pgmap=\"313(22) 314(38)\">Some of the remarks of counsel for the estate should not have been made to the jury, and upon objection being made thereto by counsel for the claimant, the trial court so ruled, and gave the jury to understand that they were not to be considered, and the claimant\u2019s case was not, in our opinion, prejudiced on that account.</p> <p id=\"b314-5\" pgmap=\"314\">The rulings of the court on the evidence were not, in our opinion, prejudicial to the claimant in the respects claimed by his counsel; and it seems to us that, the result reached by the trial court being proper, when all the evidence is fairly considered, the judgment should and will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
