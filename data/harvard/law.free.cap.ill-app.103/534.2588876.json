Isaac Cannon, Adm\u2019r.</parties><headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-8\" pgmap=\"564(83) 565(33)\">1. Practice\u2014Breach of Warranties or Representations Must Be Pleaded in Defense.\u2014In a suit on a life insurance policy, where the plaintiff produces the policy, the identity of which is admitted, and proofs of death duly executed, and a letter from the company acknowledging receipt of proofs of death in due time, all of which are offered and admitted in evidence without objection, s, prima facie case is made out in his favor. To avail himself of such matters as appear in the application without regal\u2019d to whether they are warranties, or representations merely, their falsity or a breach by the assured must be set up and proved by the defendant as matter of defense.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-4\" pgmap=\"565\">2. Same\u2014Commission to Take Depositions Must Be Followed.\u2014A commission to take depositions may specifically name any competent, disinterested person, or it may designate generally any judge, any master in chancery, justice of the peace, notary public, or it may designate any judge, master in chancery, justice of the peace or notary public; or it may designate a particular person; as A B; or any judge, master in chancery, notary public or justice of the peace, etc. In whatever form the commission runs, it can only be executed by the commissioner named in the. commission or designated therein. He must be a person expressly named in the commission, or he must be a person of a class expressly designated in the commission. He gets his power to act from the commission and must be embraced within its language.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-5\" pgmap=\"565\">8. Construction of Contracts\u2014Is for the Court.\u2014The construction of a contract for insurance as well as of other contracts is for the court. In the interpretation of a contract the purpose of the transaction between the parties must be rightly apprehended, and the contract be so construed as to effect that purpose, if it be possible so to do, by giving to the language of the contract, as a whole, any reasonable meaning.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-6\" pgmap=\"565\">4. Same\u2014Insurance Contract is One of Indemnity.\u2014The predominant intention of the parties in a contract of insurance is indemnity, and this intention is to be kept in view and favored in putting a construction upon the policy. Having indemnity for its object, the contract is to be construed liberally to that end. and it is presumably the intention of the insurer that the insured shall understand that in case of loss he is to be protected to the full extent which any fair interpretation will give. Conditions and provisos will be strictly construed against the insurers, because they have for their object to limit the scope and defeat the purpose of the principal contract.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-7\" pgmap=\"565\">5. Same\u2014Insurance Contract To Be Construed Liberally in Favor of Promisee.\u2014If there is any doubt, in view of the general tenor of the instrument of writing, whether the words used therein are to be taken in an enlarged or restricted sense, all things being equal, that construction should be taken which is most beneficial to the promisee. This rule of construction is especially applicable to the construction of policies of insurance.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-8\" pgmap=\"565(89) 566(84)\">6. Warranties\u2014Construction of.\u2014The rule that a warranty, if affirmative, must be strictly and exactly true, and if promissory, must be literally fulfilled, and that it binds the assured as made, no matter whether the breach proceeds from fraud, negligence, misinformation, or to what cause non-compliance is attributed, is an exceedingly harsh rule, and courts universally hesitate to apply it, except where, after considering all the language pertaining to the contract together, it is apparent that both parties so understood and intended it. If it be at all doubtful in meaning or contains contradictory provisions, or any statement from, which the assured might have been led to believe that his policy would not be rendered void by reason of the fact that after his death it might be found that some of his statements, though honestly made, \u201c were untrue in the slightest particular,\u201d then the courts will not hold that the statements are strict affirmative warranties, though it may be so stated in some part or parts of the contract.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b566-5\" pgmap=\"566\">7.

Insurance\u2014Materiality of Faets Concealed in Application-Question of Fact.\u2014To be of avail as a defense, defendant must prove that such answers and statements, or one of them, are fraudulent or untrue; that applicant knew that they were false at the time they were made; and that the fact concealed or the falsehood expressed was material to the risk; and these questions are all questions of fact for the jury to determine.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-7\" pgmap=\"566\">Assumpsit, on a life insurance policy.

To the declaration appellant pleaded the general issue, and the parties entered into a stipulation to the effect that either party might offer any proofs which would be competent under any special plea, and any proper replication thereto, in the same manner as if such special pleas and replications had been filed. The defense relied on by appellant, as stated by its counsel, was, \u201c that the application was in express terms made a part of the contract of insurance, and the answer of the applicant to questions asked in the application were warranted to be true, but that some of the applicant\u2019s answers to the questions asked in the application were in fact fraudulent or untrue.\u201d Among the questions and answers contained in the application are the following :</p> <blockquote id=\"b569-6\" pgmap=\"569\">\u201c Have you now or have you ever had apoplexy ?

This, under the issues as raised in the pleadings, made a prima facie case in favor of appellee. In such case it is not necessary for the plaintiff to either allege or prove such matters as appear in the application, only. To be availed of, without regard to whether they are warranties, or representations merely, their falsity or a breach by the assured must be set up and proved by the defendant as matter of defense.

In the interpretation of a contract, the purpose of the transaction between the parties must be rightly apprehended and the contract be so construed as to effect that purpose, if it be possible so to do, by giving to the language of the contract, as a whole, any reasonable meaning. In Phillips on Insurance at Sec. 124, it is said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b574-4\" pgmap=\"574\">\u201c The predominant intention of the parties in a contract of insurance is indemnity, and this intention is to be kept in view and favored in putting a construction upon the policy.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b574-5\" pgmap=\"574\">In May on Insurance, Vol. 1, 3d Ed., at Sec. 174, it is said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b574-6\" pgmap=\"574\">\u201c Having indemnity for its object, the contract is to be construed liberally to that end, and it is presumably the intention of the insurer that the insured shall understand that in case of loss he is to be protected to the full exten t which any fair interpretation will give. * * * Conditions and provisos will be strictly construed against the insurers because they have for their object to limit the scope and defeat the purpose of the principal contract.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b574-7\" pgmap=\"574\">In Wood on Fire Insurance, at Sec. 59, it is said :</p> <blockquote id=\"b574-8\" pgmap=\"574\">\u201c It is the duty of the insurer to clothe the contract in language so plain and clear that the insured can not be mistaken or misled. * * * Having the power to impose conditions and being the party who draws the contract, be must see to it that all conditions are plain, easily understood, and free from ambiguity. * * * Failing to employ a clear and definite form of expression, the benefit of all doubts will be resolved in favor of the assured. The courts will not permit the assured to be misled or cheated where there is any sort of justification, from the language used, for the interpretation placed by him upon the instrument. A contract drawn by one party, who makes his own terms and imposes his own conditions, will not be tolerated as a snare to the unwary, and if the words employed, of themselves, or in connection with other language used in the instrument, or in reference to the subject-matter to, which they relate, are susceptible of the interpretation given them by the assured, although in fact intended otherwise by the insurer, the policy will be construed to favor the assured.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b574-9\" pgmap=\"574\">In Yol. 1, 2d Ed., Wood, page 145 :</p> <blockquote id=\"b574-10\" pgmap=\"574(34) 575(28)\">\u201c If there is any doubt, in view of the general tenor of the instrument of writing, whether the words used therein are to be taken in an enlarged or restricted sense, all things being equal, that construction should .be taken which is most beneficial to the promisee. This rule of construction is especially applicable to the construction of policies of insurance.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b575-4\" pgmap=\"575\">The courts of this state have adopted and emphasized the above quoted principles and rules for the interpretation and construction of insurance contracts.

Wagner, 188 Ill. 133.</p> <p id=\"b575-5\" pgmap=\"575\">Appellant\u2019s counsel contend that it is the duty of the court to so construe the contract in this case as to make each and all the answers appearing in parts I and II of the application strict affirmative warranties, so as to bring the case under the rule:</p> <blockquote id=\"b575-6\" pgmap=\"575\">\u201c A warranty in a contract of insurance must, if affirmative, be strictly and exactly true, and if promissory, must be literally fulfilled; the validity of the entire contract depends thereon, otherwise it becomes void. Mo departure can be allowed in the slightest particular in any matter warranted. The very purpose and meaning of a warranty is to preclude all questions for what purpose it was made, or whether it was made for any purpose at all by the insured. Once it is inserted in the policy, or made a part thereof by proper reference, it binds the assured as made, it matters not whether the breach proceeds from fraud, negligence, misinformation, or to what cause non-compliance is attributed. If it be an affirmative warranty, and is false, there is a breach; and if it be promissory and is not strictly performed, the contract is void.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b575-7\" pgmap=\"575(34) 576(47)\">If the statements are strict affirmative warranties, they Avill be deemed and held to be material whether they are so in fact or not, and if shown to be \u201c untrue in the slightest particular \u201d there can be no recovery on the policy, without reference to whether such statements were intentionally or innocently made; for if false, they may be availed of by the insurer to render the policy void, although the insured may have believed them to be true.</p> <p id=\"b576-4\" pgmap=\"576\">Counsel for appellee contend that the court should so construe the contract as to make the answers representations in contradistinction from warranties, so as to bring the case under the more liberal rule :</p> <blockquote id=\"b576-5\" pgmap=\"576\">\u201c To avail as a defense it must be averred and proved that the statements were false, that the insured at the time of making them knew they were false, or made them so recklessly or under such circumstances as that in good conscience willful falsehood should be imputed to him, and that the fact concealed or the falsehood expressed was material to the risk.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b576-6\" pgmap=\"576(238) 577(387) 578(53)\">The rule invoked by appellant\u2019s counsel is an exceedingly harsh rule and courts universally hesitate to apply it\u2014will not apply it, except where, after considering all the language pertaining to the contract together, it is apparent that both parties so understood and intended it. If it be at all doubtful in meaning or contains contradictory provisions, or any statement from which the assured might have been led to believe that his policy would not be rendered void by reason of the fact that after his death it might be found that some of his statements, though honestly made, \u201c were untrue in the slightest particular,\u201d then the courts will not hold that the statements are strict affirmative warranties, though it may be so stated in some part or parts of the contract.

S. 335. When all the writings pertaining to the contract of insurance involved in this case are considered together in the light of the environment under which they were executed, it is a fair and just interpretation to put upon them, to hold, as we do, that the answers and statements made by the assured were not intended or understood by him to be strict affirmative warranties. The nature and purport of many of the questions were such that no man could have, of his own knowledge, absolutely correct information concerning them. He was therefore warranted in believing that he was only required to truthfully answer according to his understanding and recollection. It can not be believed by any disinterested, intelligent person, that the assured, in answering the questions, for instance, as to the ages, respectively, of his paternal grandfather, paternal grandmother, maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother, at the respective.dates of their deaths, understood and intended that if after he had paid for his insurance up to the date of his own death, and been by death deprived of the opportunity of defending his earthly estate, it should be made to appear that any one of those long buried ancestors had died at an age, one year, or one day even, younger or even older, than the age stated in his answer, that his policy should be absolutely void. The questions and answers in part III of the application clearly show that appellant did not rely and act upon the assured\u2019s answers and statements as absolutely true and free from possibility of error or mistake. They inquire of the medical examiner as to the length of time he had personally known assured, and as to his opinion of the truth of the statements, etc., and further, when appellant had received the application at its home office, duly examined and considered it, placed its own construction upon it and approved the risk, it forwarded to the assured the policy, upon the back of which as one of the conditions, being the provision, that, \u201c due proof of the age of the assured must be submitted with the proofs of death, and the amount of the assurance due under this policy at its maturity, shall in no case be more than the premium charged under this policy would have purchased at the society\u2019s rates in use at the date of issue of this policy for the assured\u2019s true age.\u201d When the policy containing this provision was tendered to the assured and the premium demanded, was he not warranted in believing that if he had made an honest mistake, through ignorance, lapse of memory or otherwise, in answering questions, this would not render his policy absolutely void, and does this not also evidence that appellant then so understood it ?</p> <p id=\"b578-5\" pgmap=\"578\">The construction we have given the contract eliminates many of the questions raised and argued, and such of them as we deem of importance and not so disposed of we will discuss, but not in the order in which they are presented by counsel.</p> <p id=\"b578-6\" pgmap=\"578(280) 579(151)\">The testimony shows that in the month of November, 1896, the assured had an attack of sickness; that on this occasion he was in a semi-conscious condition, in a stupor, and remained so for about two days, and that it was about three or four or five days before he could walk unassisted; that he was sick about eight or ten days and after that he attended to his duties on the farm as usual and looked after his business. Some of the witnesses think from his appearance that he never did fully recover from that attack,while others think he did. Appellant\u2019s medical examiner, who had been personally acquainted with him for ten years, states in his report of the examination that he was at that time in perfect health, and rated him in class \u201c A,\u201d and Dr. Ziegler, the physician who treated the assured during this attack in 1896, states that he never told assured that he had apoplexy or paralysis, that it might have been the result of some malarial trouble. He thought assured had recovered from the trouble\u2014he had recovered from the acute symptoms; that a man does not ordinarily recover in two or three or four days from a stroke of paralysis. The stupor that he found the assured in might have been occasioned by other things than apoplexy or paralysis. It might have been the result of indigestion or over-eating, or other sickness of some kind. There is testimony tending to show that after the attack of sickness in 1896, the assured, in speaking of it, stated that he had had something like apoplexy. In this connection, and also for the purpose of establishing the fact that the assured had been rejected by another insurance association, appellant introduced the depositions of the president and of the medical director of Des Moines Life Association, and duly identified and introduced an application, by the assured, for insurance in the latter named association, of date July 21, 1897. This application was rejected because of the statements in it that applicant had an attack of paralysis on the 19th day of November, 1896. In this application the assured answered that he had \u201c slight paralysis of left side November 19, 1896,\u201d and that Dr. Ziegler was his physician on that occasion. Dr. Ziegler was the examining physician who made the examination and report on the application to the Des Moines Life Association, and states that he wrote down the answers as the applicant gave them, and that the applicant signed his name to the application.</p> <p id=\"b579-4\" pgmap=\"579(219) 580(299)\">As to the making of the application to appellant society, which it is claimed by appellant contains such fraudulent and untrue answers and statements as render the policy here sued on, wholly void, John G. Buchannan, appellant\u2019s agent who solicited the insurance, took the application and delivered the policy,testifies : \u201cThis paper (indicating the application) is an application for insurance to Provident Savings Life Assurance Society of New York;\u201d that he took the application and the assured signed it; that he was then soliciting insurance for appellant, and acted in that capacity from April, 1898, to January, 1901; that his duties were to solicit applications,collect premiums and deliver the policies; that he, the agent, wrote down the answers and that the assured did not read over the application either before or after he signed it. Question No. 23 in this application says: \u201cHas application to grant or restore assurance on your life ever been made, which was not complied with in the form and amount asked for? If so, state every such case, when, and the cause or causes.\u201d Question to the witness : \u201cNow, I will ask you whether you read over to Mr. Cannon at the time this application was taken, this question No. 23? A. I don\u2019t think I did.\u201d That the assured told him either before or about that time that he had been rejected for insurance by the Des Moines Life Association; that he told assured that a rejection by the Des Moines Life Association was not a rejection, and that was why the assured answered this way; that he, the agent, knew of the rejection prior to the writing of the application; that Dr. Pinkstaff made the medical examination upon the application to appellant in the case at bar; that he and Dr. Pinkstaff drove in a buggy to assured\u2019s house; that they, the agent and medical examiner, had talked together before about Cannon\u2019s insurance, and on the way over he told Dr. Pinkstaff that Cannon, the assured, had been rejected by an assessment company and that he did not think it necessary to mention that as they, assessment companies, were not considered authority on insurance, and Dr. Pinkstaff told him he would take care of that; that he, the agent, had been informed that the assured had had a spell of sickness in 1896; that he wrote down the assured\u2019s answers correctly go far as he gave them, and that he also wrote down answers which the assured did not give; that he does not know how many answers he wrote down which the assured did not give; that he did not read over to the assured all the questions, but that he did read over to him some of them; that he does not know how many nor which ones of the questions he did not read over to the assured; can\u2019t pick out any question and say that he did or did not read that particular question to him; that it was generally known at the time the application was taken that the assured was sick in 1896.</p> <p id=\"b580-4\" pgmap=\"580(91) 581(342)\">Appellant is a corporation, and as such can act only through agents. Buchannan and Pinkstaff, who participated in the making of the application upon which the policy in this case is based, were both agents of appellant, with full power to act in the capacity in which they did act. Before the application was made they had knowledge of the facts that the applicant had been rejected by the Des Moines Life Association, and that he had an attack of sickness in 1896. Their knowledge, and especially the knowledge of Buchannan, was appellant\u2019s knowledge. When the application is filled out, with a knowledge on the part of the agent of the facts, whether such knowledge be communicated by the applicant, or the agent had become \u201c otherwise cognizant of them,\u201d though the application be signed by the applicant, still, if there be no collusion between the agent and the applicant, the application in such case is as much the act of the insurance company as of the assured, and the company will not be permitted to avail itself of a false or erroneous statement in the application concerning such facts. An insurance company can not insist upon the forfeiture of a policy for any cause within the knowledge of its agent at the time the policy was issued. Globe Mut. Life Ins. Ass\u2019n v.

And with reference to the answers and statements of the assured above discussed as well as to those concerning the assured\u2019s usual medical attendant, without reference to either the law or fact of waiver or estoppel, to avail as a defense it devolves upon appellant not only to prove that such answers and statements, or one of them, are fraudulent or untrue, that applicant knew that they were false at the time they were made, and that the fact concealed or the falsehood expressed was material to the risk; and these questions are all questions of fact for a jury to determine. \u00c6tna Life Ins.

Rogers, 119 Ill. 474.</p> <p id=\"b581-4\" pgmap=\"581(56) 582(111)\">It is insisted that the trial court committed many errors in the giving, modifying and refusing of instructions. These need not be discussed in detail. The principal questions raised as to the instructions are involved in the foregoing discussion. While the instructions are not, in all respects, technically accurate, they are in harmony with the law applicable to the controlling facts of this case, as we hold it to be, and are not inaccurate, in any respect, to a degree calculated to mislead the jury. In connection with this branch of the case, it is contended that the court erred in refusing to submit to the jury special interrogatories Eos. 3, 8, 9, 11 and 12, asked on behalf of appellant. Eos. 3, 9, 11 and 12 are fully covered by Eos. 1, 5 and 10, of those submitted at the instance of appellant, and the question involved in Eo. 8 was not so developed by the evidence as to become a controlling issue in the case.</p> <p id=\"b582-5\" pgmap=\"582\">Counsel contend that the trial court erred in suppressing two certain depositions taken and produced on behalf of appellant, and that for this error the case should be reversed. The record discloses that appellant sued out a commission to take the depositions upon oral interrogatories of two witnesses who resided at Detroit, Michigan. The notice and commission is to take the depositions of Charles E. Foote and Thomas Dillon. The commission appoints James Y. Oxtoby as commissioner, and authorizes him to take the depositions of the two witnesses named, at the office of the Michigan Mutual Life Insurance Company, in the city of Detroit, Michigan, on the 7th day of August, 1901, and from day to day until completed. The depositions produced are depositions of Charles E. Foote and George W. Sanders, and were taken by one Allister Cochrane, a notary public. These depositions were taken at the time and place required by the notice and commission, but appellee was not present, nor represented at the taking of them, nor did he, or any one for him, agree that the depositions might be taken by the notary, Cochrane. The commissioner, Oxtoby, was absent from the city at the time fixed by the commission for taking the depositions, and in the absence of appellee and his counsel appellant\u2019s counsel called in the notary public above mentioned and proceeded to take the depositions produced.</p> <p id=\"b582-6\" pgmap=\"582(27) 583(315)\">Appellant\u2019s counsel contend that in case of the absence or sickness of the coihmissioner named in the commission to take the depositions, any judge, master in chancery, notary public or justice of the peace may act. The authorities cited and relied on do not sustain this position as applicable to the facts of this case. It is true that the notice need not contain the name of any person or class of persons as commissioners, but the commission must do so. It may specifically name any competent, disinterested person, or it may designate generally any judge, any master in chancery, any notary public, any justice of the peace; or it may designate any judge, master in chancery, justice of the peace or notary public; or it may designate any particular person, as A B, or any judge, master in chancery, notary public or justice of the peace, etc. In whatever form the commission runs, it can only be executed by the commissioner named in the commission or designated therein. He must be a person expressly named in the commission, or he must be a person of a class expressly designated in the commission. He gets his power to act from the commission, and must be embraced within its language. The commission in the case at bar empowers James Y. Oxtoby alone to act, and neither mentions nor includes any other person or class of persons. The motion to suppress was made and sustained before the trial was commenced, and before the jury was called, and appellant did not ask a continuance for the purpose of retaking these depositions, neither was the action of the court in suppressing them stated in the motion or in any manner presented as a ground for new trial. It appears to us, upon the whole, that substantial justice has been done in this cause by the verdict and judgment, and that the record before us contains no such error as calls for a reversal of the case.</p> <p id=\"b583-4\" pgmap=\"583\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
