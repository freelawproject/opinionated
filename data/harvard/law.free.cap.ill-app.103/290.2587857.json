Ordinances\u2014Privileges Granted Must be Open to All upon Equal Terms. \u2014When privileges are granted by an ordinance of a city, they must be open to the enjoyment of all persons similarly situated upon equal terms and conditions, and an ordinance framed so as to grant such privileges to some and refuse them on equal terms to others, is invalid for being unreasonable, oppressive, and creating a monopoly.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b320-8\" pgmap=\"320\">2. Same\u2014Designating Cab Stands at Depots.\u2014A city ordinance contained the following : The city marshal shall designate stands for all cabs, coaches, omnibuses, or other vehicles at all railroad depots, where the same shall stand while waiting for passengers or property; and shall also designate and fix the stands at other points in the city where all drays, carts, coaches, cabs or other licensed vehicles shall stand while waiting for passengers or employment; and said city marshal shall make all necessary rules and regulations for the use and occupation of said stands by such licensed vehicles. Held, that such provision does not authorize the chief of police (formerly the city marshal) of the city to designate certain stands at a depot, which are more conveniently located for receiving and discharging persons and property, to be used exclusively by the licensed vehicles of one company, and require the licensed vehicles of other persons to occupy at that depot, other stands which are less conveniently situated for the same purpose, irrespective of whether the vehicles of the one or the other arrive first.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-3\" pgmap=\"321\">Prosecution Under City Ordinance.\u2014Appeal from the Circuit Court of Vermilion County; the Hon.

After the case was tried before the justice of the peace, it was taken to the Circuit Court by appeal, and there tried by the court without a jury on a written statement of facts by consent of parties, and resulted in a judgment in favor of the defendant. The city having excepted to the judgment, brings the case to this court by appeal and insists that the same ought to be reversed for the alleged reason that it is against the law applicable to the facts in the case;-</p> <p id=\"b322-4\" pgmap=\"322\">The statement of facts is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b322-5\" pgmap=\"322\">\u201c The plaintiff, the city of Danville, is a municipal corporation, duly incorporated and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Illinois.

Both of these licenses are of the same date and of the same terms. Thomas Moone, the defendant, was a driver in the employ of John Noone. At the depot of the \u2018 Big Four Bailroad \u2019 in the city of Danville, the principal street runs north and south, the railroad runs east and west. The depot platform is on the north side of said railroad tracks and on the west side of said street. This platform is some twenty-five or thirty feet wide, and just north of the east end thereof is a long space of public ground at which vehicles may stand while awaiting the arrival of passengers. The trains of the 1 Big Four Bailroad \u2019 stop west of said Vermilion street, and therefore passengers who alight upon the platform from incoming trains proceed along the platform in an easterly direction toward Vermilion street, that is to say, the great majority of them do. In so doing, such passengers necessarily reach the west-end of the said space devoted to\u2019buses, etc., first. Some time prior to the arrest of the defendant, the chief of police, William Wandrick, purporting to act under authority of the ordinance aforesaid, had given to the \u2019buses and cabs of Green &lt;&amp; Company, the first two western places, to be reserved for them at all trains; and to the hacks and cabs of FToone, the third space counting from the west; that is, the vehicles of Green &amp; Company were allowed to take the first two places along this platform farthest west, or what is known as the first and second places at which passengers arrive. Each of these \u2019bus line proprietors and drivers had been notified of this assignment by the chief of police. On the day in question, Thomas Noone, the defendant, driving one of the cabs of John Noone, went to the Big Four depot and found a cab of Green &amp; Company in the first or extreme western place; he then drove into the second place. The policeman on duty directed him to drive out of said place and give the same to one of Green &amp; Company\u2019s cabs which arrived later. This the defendant declined to do, and was accordingly arrested. The complaint made against him is as follows:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-5\" pgmap=\"326\">\u2018 Thomas Noone to the City op Danville, Db.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"AJR5\" pgmap=\"326\">To fifty dollars for violation of section No. 9 of chapter No. 41 of the Revised Ordinances of said city of Danville, entitled \u201c Vehicles,\u201d passed and approved on the 30th day of April, A. D. 1892,\"in this, to wit:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"A-8\" pgmap=\"326\">That the said Thomas Noone on or about the 24th day of May, A. D. 1901, before the commencement of this suit, at Danville, and within the corporate limits of the same, unlawfully did then and there cause and permit a cab, licensed under and by virtue of the ordinances of the said city of Danville, to stand and remain at the city depot of the O., O., C. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co., in said city of Danville, waiting for passengers and employment, at a place other than the one assigned for the said cab by the chief of police (formerly called city marshal) of the said city of Danville, and did then and there violate the rules of the said chief of police (formerly called city marshal) regulating the stands for such vehicles aforesaid\u201d, the said Thomas Noone being then and there the driver of the said cab, contrary to the provisions of the ordinances of the said city of Danville.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-13\" pgmap=\"326\">J. H. Lewman,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-14\" pgmap=\"326\">City Attorney.\u2019</blockquote> <p id=\"b326-15\" pgmap=\"326\">The defendant committed no other offense, except to drive into the space which the chief of police had allotted to the cabs and vehicles of said Green &amp; Company, to be reserved for the vehicles of said company at all times.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b326-16\" pgmap=\"326\">The only important question raised or discussed in this case is whether the ninth section of the ordinance should be construed as authorizing the chief of police of the city to designate certain stands at the \u201c Big Four \u201d depot in that city, which were more conveniently located for receiving and discharging persons and property there, to be used exclusively by the licensed vehicles of Green &amp; Company, and require the licensed vehicles of other persons to occupy at that depot, other stands which'were less conveniently located for the same purpose, irrespective of whether the vehicles of the one or the other arrived first.</p> <p id=\"b327-3\" pgmap=\"327\">It is conceded on both sides that the city possessed the power, under the statute, to license, tax and regulate hack-men, draymen, omnibus drivers and others pursuing like occupations, but it is argued for the city that by the terms of the ninth section of the ordinance, the chief of police properly designated which stands at the depot vehicles of Green &amp; Company could occupy, and which stands there those of John Noone could occupy, and that neither could occupy the stands designated for the vehicles of the other without incurring the penalty prescribed by the ordinance, regardless of whether the vehicles of the one or the other arrived at the depot first.</p> <p id=\"b327-4\" pgmap=\"327\">Counsel for appellee, Thomas Noone, contend that inasmuch as the stands which were designated for the exclusive use of the vehicles of Green &amp; Company were more conveniently located for receiving and discharging persons and property than those designated for John Noone, the manner of regulating the business which the city had licensed both to carry on, was unreasonable and oppressive to John Noone, as well as being calculated to create a monopoly there.of in favor of Green &amp; Company, which was not authorized by that section, and even if it was, it would be void for that reason.</p> <p id=\"b327-5\" pgmap=\"327\">We are of opinion that the position taken by counsel for appellee is the proper one; for when privileges are granted by an ordinance of a city, they must be open to the enjoyment of all persons similarly situated upon equal terms and conditions; and an ordinance framed so as to grant such privileges to some and refuse them on equal terms to others would be invalid for being unreasonable, oppressive, and creating a monopoly. City of Chicago v. Rumpff, 45 Ill. 90; Tugman v. City of Chicago, 78 Ill. 405, and City of Chicago v. Trotter, 136 Ill. 430.</p> <p id=\"b327-6\" pgmap=\"327(48) 328(11)\">To construe the ordinance so that it authorized the city marshal to designate more favorable stands for the vehicles of Green &amp; Company at the depots, than those designated for the vehicles of others, would render it invalid for providing an unreasonable and oppressive manner of exercising the power to regulate the business, and would create a monopoly.</p> <p id=\"b328-4\" pgmap=\"328\">The learned judge who tried this case in the Circuit Court therefore correctly held the ordinance did not confer such authority upon the chief of police, and the judgment wTill be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
