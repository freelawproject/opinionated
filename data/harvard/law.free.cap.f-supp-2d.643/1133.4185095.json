Flash memory is a type of electronic memory chip that has become commonplace in a variety of electronic products, such as USB drives, digital cameras, iPhones and similar products. Two separate civil Complaints are pending. The first is the Consolidated Direct Purchaser Class Action Complaint (\u201cDirect Purchaser Complaint\u201d), brought by those who purchased flash memory directly from Defendants. The second is the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\u201cIndirect Purchaser Complaint\u201d), filed by individuals and entities who purchased both stand-alone flash memory products and products that contain flash memory as a component. Both Complaints allege violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. The Indirect Purchaser Complaint also includes antitrust, consumer protection and equitable claims under the laws of various states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">The parties now are before the Court on: (1) the Motion by All Defendants to Dismiss Direct Purchasers\u2019 Sherman Act Claims (Docket 371); and (2) the Motion to Dismiss Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Class Action Complaint (Docket 374).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having read and considered the papers submitted, and being fully informed, the Court DENIES Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Direct Purchaser Complaint and GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Indirect Purchaser Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\"><em>A. </em>Overview of the Development of THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-15\">There are several types of memory used in or with electronic devices; most notably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>flash memory, dynamic random access memory (\u201cDRAM\u201d) and static random access memory (\u201cSRAM\u201d). Flash memory was initially developed in the 1980s by Defendant Toshiba. (Direct Purchaser (\u201cDP\u201d) Compl. \u00b6 40.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unlike DRAM and SRAM, flash memory is \u201cnon-volatile,\u201d meaning that no power is needed to maintain the information stored in the chip. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 39.) The first generation of flash memory was known as NOR flash memory. <em>(Id.) </em>In 1987, Toshiba developed a second type of flash memory \u2014 NAND flash memory \u2014 which provided greater functionality at a lower cost. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b641-43.) NAND flash memory is sold and marketed as a memory device, i.e., flash memory cards, USB drives, etc., and as a component part in other electronic devices, like Apple iPods or iPhones. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">According to Plaintiffs, the NAND flash memory industry exhibits a number of characteristics that have facilitated the alleged conspiracy to control pricing. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 44.) The NAND flash memory market is highly concentrated and is dominated by a \u201chandful\u201d of suppliers, i.e., Samsung, Toshiba, Renesas, Hynix and Micron. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 45.) Over 90 percent of the worldwide market for flash memory is controlled by three companies, Samsung, Toshiba and Hynix. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 46.) In addition, there are significant barriers to entry, as the cost to develop a modern NAND flash memory production facility can range from $4 to $5 billion. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 48.) The flash memory industry also is notable for its numerous cross-licensing and joint venture agreements that have spanned from the mid-1990s at least through the end of 2007. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 49.) These agreements, along with the Defendants\u2019 participation in various trade associations and meetings, ostensibly have facilitated their ability to collude and control flash memory prices. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 50-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">B. Collusion in the Market for Electronic Memory</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">Apparent price fixing in the memory market has caught the attention of the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) which has launched investigations into the DRAM and SRAM markets. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-65.) In the DRAM matter, Hynix and Samsung, who also are Defendants in this case, have pleaded guilty to price fixing, and have paid fines in the amount of $300 million and $185 million, respectively. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 60.) Defendants Hynix, Mitsubishi, Renesas, Samsung and Toshiba also are under investigation by the DOJ and/or are the subject of civil lawsuits relating to SRAM. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">Plaintiffs allege that the illegal pricing activity with respect to DRAM and SRAM is probative of and intertwined with Defendants\u2019 allegedly illegal activities in the market for NAND flash memory. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 65, 78.) Like the DRAM/SRAM schemes, the purpose and goal of the conspiracy was to (a) coordinate pricing among competitors, (b) stabilize prices to ensure that they did not fall too low, and (c) raise prices when opportunities arose. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 72-74.) In terms of its impact, the alleged conspiracy has artificially impacted prices for both NAND flash memory and products using such technology. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 75-77.) As a commodity item, NAND flash memory is \u201chighly price elastic\u201d and subject to steep price declines as technology continues to advance. <em>(Id.) </em>Despite these market forces, manufacturers have been able to maintain their margins through artificially controlling the market. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>In terms of overlap, Plaintiffs aver, <em>inter alia, </em>that the same employees of the Defendant companies (including those who pleaded guilty to criminal felonies in the DOJ\u2019s DRAM investigation) were responsible for pricing DRAM, SRAM and flash memory sold in the United States. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67-69.) These persons allegedly communicated with one another on a regular basis, which helped them to coordinate and control pricing across memory product lines. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-81.) For instance, in 2001, the price for NAND flash memory, like DRAM pricing, experienced a decline in demand. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 86.) But through their continuing communications and contacts, in the next quarter Defendants were able to increase DRAM and NAND flash memory prices. <em>(Id.) </em>These \u201cintercompetitor contacts\u201d continued during the 2002 to 2006 time period, as evidenced by a number of emails from Samsung and other Defendants suggesting ways to maintain pricing. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 89, 91-95.) Defendants allegedly continued their practice of entering into joint venture and cross-licensing agreements as yet another means to control the market. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 106-108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">In or about September 2007, the DOJ confirmed that it was investigating potential antitrust violations with respect to the NAND flash memory market. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 116.) Toshiba, Renesas and Samsung are among the entities that have received grand jury subpoenas in connection with the investigation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">C. Procedural Summary</p>\n<p id=\"Au9\">Plaintiffs are individuals and entities who purchased NAND flash memory directly or indirectly from one or more Defendants from 1999 to the present (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Defendants are alleged to have manufactured, sold, or distributed flash memory to customers throughout the United States during the Class Period. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-20.) Plaintiffs allege Defendants and unnamed \u201ccoconspirators conspired to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price of NAND flash memory sold in the United States.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 1.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">On February 7, 2008, Plaintiff Timothy Chanda filed a Consolidated Direct Purchaser Class Action Complaint (\u201cDirect Purchaser Complaint\u201d) against the following Defendants: Samsung Electronics Company Ltd.; Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.; Hitachi, Ltd.; Renensas Technology Corporation; Renesas Technology America, Inc. (formerly known as Hitachi Semiconductor (America) Inc.); Hynix Semiconductor, Inc.; Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc.; Mitsubishi Electric Corporation; Mitsubishi Electric and Electronics USA, Inc.; SanDisk Corporation; Toshiba Corporation; Toshiba America, Inc.; and Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-20.) Plaintiffs allege that they purchased NAND flash memory from one or more of the Defendants. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 2.) The Direct Purchaser Complaint alleges a single claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 130-135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">On the same date, Plaintiffs filed their Indirect Purchaser Complaint against essentially the same Defendants named in the Direct Purchaser Complaint. (Docket 310, Indirect Purchaser (\u201cIP\u201d) Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-66.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indirect Purchasers are 33 individuals and entities who claim they purchased stand-alone NAND flash memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>ry products (i.e., CompactFlash, SmartMedia, MultiMedia Card, Secure Digital Card, Memory Stick and USB flash drives) and products in which NAND flash memory is a substantial component. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The Indirect Purchaser Complaint alleges four claims for relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">(1) Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1;</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">(2) Unjust Enrichment and Disgorgement of Profits under the laws of Arizona, Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin;</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">(3) Violation of State Antitrust and Unfair Competition Laws of Alabama, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">(4) Violation of State Consumer Protection and Unfair Competition Laws of Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and West Virginia. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 176-222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">II. <em>LEGAL STANDARD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff must allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cSpecific facts are not necessary; the statement need only give the defendants] fair notice of what ... the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare System, LP, </em>534 F.3d 1116, 1122 (9th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIn general, the inquiry is limited to the allegations in the complaint, which are accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Lazy Y Ranch Ltd. v. Behrens, </em>546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">If dismissal is warranted, it is generally without prejudice, unless it is clear the complaint cannot be saved by any amendment. <em>See Sparling v. Daou, </em>411 F.3d 1006, 1013 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Gompper v. VISX, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir.2002). In resolving a motion to dismiss, a Court may take judicial notice, upon request, as provided by Federal Rule of Evidence 201, without transforming a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. <em>See MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Weisman, </em>803 F.2d 500, 503 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>III. <em>DIRECT PURCHASER COMPLAINT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\">A. Sufficiency of the Conspiracy Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">The Sherman Act, section 1, states in part that, \u201cEvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. In <em>Twombly, </em>the Supreme Court held that a section 1 claim \u201crequires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made.\u201d 550 U.S. at 556, 127 5.Ct. 1955. That is, there must be enough facts presented \u201cto raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAsking for <em>plausible grounds </em>to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement. And, of course, a well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable, and \u2018that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added, footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">Defendants assert that allegations in the Direct Purchaser Complaint are too vague and conclusory to comport with the pleading requirements of <em>Twombly. </em>As an initial matter, Defendants complain that the pleadings fail to allege the specific time, place, or person who had any meetings or communications regarding flash memory pricing or output. (Docket 371, Mot. at 11.) The Court disagrees. Among other things, the pleadings identify the companies and/or individuals who were directly involved in setting prices for NAND flash memory. <em>(E.g., </em>DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 69, 81-85, 88-93, 103, 106.) In particular, the Complaint alleges that many of the same employees in various companies (some of whom have pled guilty to price fixing in the DOJ\u2019s DRAM investigation) were responsible for setting prices for different types of memory, including DRAM/ SRAM and flash memory. <em>(See id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">In addition, the Complaint alleges the time frame of such alleged conduct, along with facts pertaining to the coordination of production as a means to control pricing. <em>(E.g, id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 86-88, 94, 96, 98, 101-105).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For example, there are allegations of specific instances where output was reduced following meetings by Defendants-that, in turn, led to \u201cimplausible\u201d price increases. <em>(Id.) </em>Similarly, the marketplace is alleged to have been conducive to coordinated pricing, as demonstrated by the existence of a concentrated market dominated by a few entities, with significant barriers to entry. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-59.) Courts addressing analogous pleadings have concluded that these types of conspiracy allegations are sufficient to meet the pleading standards of <em>Twombly. E.g., In re Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) Antitrust Litig., </em>580 F.Supp.2d 896, 901-02 (N.D.Cal.2008) (\u201cSRAM\u201d) (\u201cgeneral allegations of a conspiracy, price fixing and the susceptibility of the SRAM market to such violations\u201d sufficient under <em>Twombly </em>); <em>In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., </em>586 F.Supp.2d 1109, 1115 (N.D.Cal.2008) <em>(\u201cTFT-LCD </em>\u201d) (finding that allegations that price stability in flat panel market was inconsistent with natural market forces were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss). The Court finds that the facts alleged by Plaintiffs are sufficient to give rise to \u201ca plausible suggestion of conspiracy.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 566, 127 S.Ct. 1955.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>B. Exchange of Information between Competitors</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">The Supreme Court has recognized the danger of collusion posed by the exchange of pricing information. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., Inc. v. F.T.C., </em>440 U.S. 69, 80, 99 S.Ct. 925, 59 L.Ed.2d 158 (1979); <em>see also United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>438 U.S. 422, 457, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978) (\u201cthe most likely consequence of any such agreement to exchange price information would be the stabilization of industry prices\u201d); <em>United States v. Container Corp., </em>393 U.S. 333, 337, 89 S.Ct. 510, 21 L.Ed.2d 526 (1969) (\u201c[t]he inferences are irresistible that the exchange of price information has had an anticompetitive effect in the industry, chilling the vigor of price competition.\u201d). Nevertheless, there is nothing inherently improper with competitors communicating with one another. <em>See In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., </em>166 F.3d 112, 126 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201ccommunications between competitors do not permit an inference of an agreement to fix prices unless \u2018those communications rise to the level of an agreement, tacit or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d). \u201cAccordingly, information exchanges help to establish an antitrust violation only when either (1) the exchange indicates the existence of an express or tacit agreement to fix or stabilize prices, or (2) the exchange is made pursuant to an express or tacit agreement that is itself a violation of \u00a7 1 under a rule of reason analysis.\u201d <em>In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Litig., </em>906 F.2d 432, 447 n. 13 (9th Cir.1990) <em>(\u201cPetroleum Prods.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">Here, Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning the exchange of information are too \u201cambiguous\u201d and \u201csporadic\u201d to suggest the existence of an agreement to fix prices. They claim that the pleadings allege only \u201cthree discrete episodes over an eight-year period in which a non-defendant shared an unspecified snippet of \u2018flash\u2019 information....\u201d (Mot. at 12.) That is not accurate. The Complaint specifically alleges that Defendants routinely exchanged highly sensitive competitive information, including pricing and production data, to facilitate and monitor their price fixing conspiracy. For example, the Complaint alleges that in August 1998, Samsung advised Hynix (both of which are alleged to be key market players) \u201cthat it would be attempting to raise memory prices \u2018across the board in September.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46, 80). Samsung also \u201creportedly told Hynix that it would <em>\u2018coordinate with Japanese suppliers, asking them to raise, or at least not to lower from August prices.\u2019\u201d (Id. </em>(emphasis added).) Similarly, there are allegations that Micron and Samsung communicated with one another to discuss pricing and inventory on their respective products. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">More recent communications also support a plausible inference of an ongoing pattern <em>of </em>collusion. In late 2001, Samsung\u2019s Vice President of Marketing sent an internal email to the various heads of the company\u2019s regional memory sales groups. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 86.) The email instructed the recipients to contact their <em>competitors </em>to urge them that they <em>\u201cmust not retreat from the last quoted price. </em>\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(emphasis added).) Separately, in 2001, officials from Hynix and Samsung met in Korea to ensure that they were \u201cin the same boat with pricing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 88.) These types of contacts continued in the years that followed. For instance, in early 2007, as prices for NAND memory continued to decline, Defendants were making efforts \u201cto reduce NAND supply relative to expected demand growth.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 101.) Thus, in March 2007, Samsung announced to industry analysts that it had stabilized \u201cprice erosion\u201d as a result of \u201c[s]upply constraints due to cautious supply[.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 102.) Notably, Samsung emphasized its expectation that there would continue to be a \u201csevere shortage\u201d with inventories that, in turn, would bolster its margins. <em>(Id.) </em>In the absence of insider knowledge gleaned from communications with its competitors, Samsung allegedly \u201cwould have no way of making such a confident prediction.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Taken as a whole, these and similar allegations in the pleadings are sufficient to suggest that Defendants routinely exchanged highly sensitive competitive information, including pricing and production data, to facilitate and monitor their alleged price fixing conspiracy. <em>See SRAM, </em>580 F.Supp.2d at 902 (allegations regarding internal emails that discussed competitor\u2019s pricing were germane in terms of meeting the <em>Twombly </em>standard); <em>see also In re High Fructose Com Syrup Antitrust Litig., </em>295 F.3d 651, 662 (7th Cir.2002) <em>(\u201cHigh Fructose </em>\u201d) (documents discussing coordination of pricing with competitors probative of price fixing); <em>Flying J Inc. v. TA Operating Corp., </em>2007 WL 3254765, *1 (D.Utah 2007) (price fixing agreement could be inferred from email between competitors even if such an agreement was not discussed expressly).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">C. Market Concentration</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\"> \u201c[T]he Sherman Act reflects an important federal policy in preventing excessive concentration in relevant markets.\u201d <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>895 F.2d 195, 202 (4th Cir.1990); <em>Les Shockley Racing, Inc. v. National Hot Rod Ass\u2019n, </em>884 F.2d 504, 510 (9th Cir.1989). \u201cSignificant market concentration makes it easier for firms in the market to collude, expressly or tacitly, and thereby force price above or farther above the competitive level.\u201d <em>FTC v. H.J. Heinz Co., </em>246 F.3d 708, 724 (D.C.Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S.Ct. 2578, 125 L.Ed.2d 168 (1993) (\u201cTacit collusion ... describes the process, not in itself unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power, setting their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions.\u201d). On the other hand, market concentration and market shares are insufficient, standing alone, to establish a Sherman Act violation. <em>See In re Late Fee and Over-Limit Fee Litig., </em>528 F.Supp.2d 953, 964 (N.D.Cal.2007) <em>(\u201cLate Fee </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">Defendants argue that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 market concentration allegations demonstrate that any alleged \u2018parallel\u2019 conduct is at least as consistent with independent decision-making and vigorous competition as with conspiracy.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Irrespective of whether that is correct, Defendants ignore that Plaintiffs rely on more than mere allegations of high market concentration to show that the flash memory market is prone to collusion. Rather, in addition to market concentration, they allege the existence of multiple and on-going business relationships, cross-licensing and joint ven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>ture agreements, high barriers to entry, and homogeneity in products. <em>(E.g., </em>DP Compl. \u00b6 43, 44, 48, 49, 93, 106-107.) When these allegations are considered in tandem, allegations of high market concentration can appropriately be relied upon as a factor to suggest price collusion. <em>SRAM, </em>580 F.Supp.2d at 903 (denying motion to dismiss where market concentration allegations accompanied by allegations concerning an ongoing agreement to exchange price information for the purpose of stabilizing or increasing prices). Wdiile Defendants\u2019 assertion that high market concentration was attributable to \u201cindependent decision-making and vigorous competition\u201d ultimately may prove to be valid, the Court cannot resolve this issue on the merits at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Defendants\u2019 secondary contention is that \u201crapidly shifting market shares\u201d of the various Defendants exemplifies \u201cvigorous competition.\u201d (Mot. at 14.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support, Defendants cite <em>Williamson Oil Co., Inc. v. Philip Morris USA, </em>346 F.3d 1287, 1318 (11th Cir.2003), where the court noted that shifts in market share between competitors undermined a showing of collusion. In reaching that conclusion, the court focused on the fact that \u201c[tjhese sharp market share shifts were at least as great as those that occurred between 1980 and 1991, <em>an unquestionably competitive period.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). This case is distinguishable, however. Unlike <em>Williamson, </em>there is nothing in the pleadings that would enable the Court to make such comparisons. Perhaps more fundamentally, Defendants\u2019 argument relies on inferences being drawn in <em>their </em>favor which, of course, is the antithesis of the standard of review applicable to a motion to dismiss. Indeed, <em>Williamson </em>involved the review of a motion for summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">D. Supply Shortages</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">Defendants next contend that the Complaint fails to allege any facts supporting an inference of an express agreement to limit the supply of NAND flash memory, and that the market forces of supply and demand \u2014 not collusion \u2014 explain the alleged supply shortages. (Mot. at 14-16.) In support of its argument, Defendants rely on <em>In re Citric Acid Litig., </em>191 F.3d 1090, 1100-101 (9th Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cCitric Acid </em>\u201d), where the court held that the defendant\u2019s failure to increase production more rapidly did not establish a price fixing conspiracy because \u201c[t]he timing of this decision ... does not fit with [plaintiffj\u2019s theory of the conspiracy.\u201d Unlike <em>Citric Acid, </em>the Complaint in this case alleges that the supply shortage was orchestrated by Samsung which, in turn, had the effect of controlling prices in the time period that followed. <em>{See </em>DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 94-98.) Defendants also overlook that <em>Citric Acid </em>involved a motion for summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss, where Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations must be taken as true. Thus, while the evidence adduced in the action ultimately may support such a defense, the Court finds, as above, that such a determination is premature at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">E. Price Stability</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">\u201c[Rjising prices do not themselves permit an inference of a collusive market dynamic. Even in a concentrated market, the occurrence of a price increase does not in itself permit a rational inference of conscious parallelism or supracompetitive pricing.\u201d <em>See Brooke, </em>509 U.S. at 237, 113 S.Ct. 2578. <em>Brooke </em>recognized that prices may rise due to market forces, and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>is entirely possible that increases in price and output could occur simultaneously where there is \u201cgrowing product demand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[u]nder these conditions, a jury may not infer competitive injury from price <em>and </em>output data absent some evidence that tends to prove that output was restricted or prices were above a competitive level.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Defendants argue that \u201cprices were not rising, but falling \u2018rapidly\u2019 as suppliers reduced their costs and competition led those cost savings to be passed through to consumers, even as demand for NAND flash memory experienced \u2018huge increases.\u2019 \u201d (Mot. at 17) (citing DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.) That is not an accurate characterization of the DP Complaint. Plaintiffs allege that, historically, memory manufacturers have been able to maintain their profit margins even as the price of memory (on a per gigabit basis) declines. (DP Compl. \u00b6 76.) They allege that such \u201cunnatural price stability\u201d was the result of Defendants\u2019 \u201ccollusively agreeing to reduce or limit capacity for the purpose of stabilizing or increasing prices.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, even in times where there was an oversupply of NAND flash memory, Defendants\u2019 conspiratorial conduct \u201ccaused those prices to <em>decrease at a lesser rate </em>than would have been the case under competitive conditions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 77.) Given these allegations, <em>Brooke </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">Separately, Defendants maintain that any fluctuations and or stability in the price for NAND flash memory is attributable to competitive market forces, as opposed to a collusive agreement among the Defendants to control the market. (Mot. at 17.) The authorities cited by Defendants, however, are inapposite. In <em>In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., </em>502 F.3d 47 (2d Cir.2007), the district court dismissed an antitrust complaint which relied entirely on parallel conduct, conelusory averments of conspiracy and references to a European investigation into price fixing. In affirming the dismissal, the Second Circuit focused on (1) the failure to specify \u201cany particular activities by any particular defendant,\u201d (2) non-specific allegations of parallel conduct, and (3) the lack of any facts establishing any possible nexus between the European conspiracy and any conduct in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 50. In contrast, the pleadings herein provide much more detail regarding the intracompetitor communications directed at coordinating flash memory pricing and facts regarding the flash memory market structure showing its conduciveness towards collusive pricing schemes. Likewise, facts are alleged regarding the overlap between the companion antitrust investigations in the DRAM/SRAM markets <em>and </em>the NAND flash memory market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Late Fee </em>fares no better. In that case, credit cardholders who paid excessive late fees and/or over-limit fees brought a class action against credit card issuers under section 1 of the Sherman Act. The centerpiece of plaintiffs\u2019 claims was set forth in a single paragraph of the complaint which was comprised of a chart showing that several of the defendants charged the same or similar late fees. <em>Late Fee, </em>528 F.Supp.2d at 962. This Court concluded that the complaint was devoid of facts suggesting a preceding agreement, and the scant allegations showed nothing more than parallel conduct. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, the Complaint is far more detailed. Here, Plaintiffs allege facts that the flash memory market is a highly concentrated with high barriers to entry \u2014 conditions that are conducive to a price fixing conspiracy. (DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-48.) In addition, it is alleged that Defendants exchanged highly sensitive competitive information <em>(id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 78-114), and openly communicated with one another to \u201ccoordinate\u201d pricing <em>(e.g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b680, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>87, 88, 104.) Lastly, unlike the allegations made in <em>Late Fee, </em>the Complaint in this case contains extensive, detailed allegations as to when, where and who engaged in at least some of the meetings that gave rise to the alleged conspiracy. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 66-114.) These allegations easily satisfy the notice pleading requirements of the Federal Rules and readily distinguish this case from the conclusory allegations described in <em>Late Fee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">F. Joint Ventures and Cross-Licensing Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">Plaintiffs allege that various Defendants entered into a \u201cweb\u201d of cross-licensing and joint venture agreements as a means to facilitate collusive behavior. (DP Compl. \u00b6 49.) In their motion to dismiss, Defendants contend that their joint ventures and cross-licenses are \u201cunambiguously procompetitive,\u201d especially given the high entry barriers to the flash memory market. (Mot. at 18-19.) They further argue that the Plaintiffs fail to temporally link any joint ventures or cross-licenses to any price changes and that, at most, they show nothing more than an \u201copportunity\u201d to conspire, and do not by themselves support an inference of collusion. <em>(Id.) </em>As a general proposition, it is true that agreements between competitors may be entirely benign. <em>See Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, </em>547 U.S. 1, 7, 126 S.Ct. 1276, 164 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006). That, however, does not necessarily support Defendants\u2019 conclusion that the joint venture and cross-licensing agreements, as alleged in the pleadings, are irrelevant for purposes of the instant motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">The Ninth Circuit has aptly observed that \u201cdirect evidence will rarely be available\u201d to prove the existence of a price fixing conspiracy. <em>See Petroleum Prods., </em>906 F.2d at 439. It is for that reason that \u201ccircumstantial evidence is the lifeblood of antitrust law.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>410 U.S. 526, 534 n. 13, 93 S.Ct. 1096, 35 L.Ed.2d 475 (1973). In this case, the allegations regarding Defendants\u2019 participation and use of joint venture and cross-licensing agreements go beyond merely alleging that Defendants\u2019 joint ventures, licensing agreements and other business affiliations simply fostered an \u201copportunity\u201d to collude. To the contrary, Plaintiffs alleged that such agreements were used as the means to maintain and achieve the end result of the conspiracy by controlling the supply, and thereby permitting increases in the price for the products. (DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-59, 93-94, 106-07.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While these allegations may not expressly state that the agreements themselves were illegal, they nonetheless may be considered with the pleadings as a whole in determining the existence of a \u201cplausible\u201d conspiracy. <em>See High Fructose, </em>295 F.3d at 662 (noting that \u201cambiguous\u201d evidence should be considered in antitrust claims because \u201cmost cases are constructed out of a tissue of such statements and other circumstantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>G. Trade Shows and Trade Association Meetings</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">The Complaint alleges that \u201cDefendants belong to a web of different trade associations and participate in various industry trade shows, all of which provide forums at which they can collude to fix prices and limit capacity for NAND flash memory.\u201d (DP Compl. \u00b6 50.) One such association is the Compact Flash Association (\u201cCFA\u201d), in which Defendants Samsung, Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and SanDisk all are members. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 51.) The CFA allegedly holds regular meetings and participates in trade shows throughout the world. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 52.) Plaintiffs assert that these meetings and trade shows provide a vehicle for the \u201ccartel\u2019s members\u201d to communicate regularly to \u201cfacilitate the development of a conspiracy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 59.) In response, Defendants claim that their membership in a trade association is presumptively legitimate and that their attendance at such industry meetings and events generally does not establish illegal collusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">Generally, there is nothing particularly nefarious in attending industry functions. <em>See In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., </em>527 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1023 (N.D.Cal.2007) <em>(\u201cGPU </em>/\u201d). Nor is there anything necessarily improper with their participation or membership in industry trade associations. <em>See Citric Acid, </em>191 F.3d at 1098. Indeed, trade associations serve a beneficial and legitimate function. <em>See McDaniel v. Appraisal Institute, </em>117 F.3d 421, 424 (9th Cir.1997). That notwithstanding, courts have recognized that trade association affiliations and attendance at industry events may be alleged to show that putative conspirators had the opportunity and means to develop and/or further their alleged collusive scheme. <em>See Todd v. Exxon Corp., </em>275 F.3d 191, 213 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cthe frequency of the meetings is itself problematic for the same reason that the exchange of current price data is suspect: It tends to facilitate the policing of price conspiracies.\u201d). And while \u201cthese allegations cannot alone support Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, [ ] such participation demonstrates <em>how and when </em>Defendants had opportunities to exchange information or make agreements.\u201d <em>SRAM, </em>580 F.Supp.2d at 903 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">The Court also disagrees with Defendants that dismissal is warranted on the ground that Plaintiffs fail to identify \u201cwho attended these meetings, what was discussed at them, or how they purportedly related to the conspiracy other than providing an opportunity for the parties to talk to one another.... \u201d (Mot. at 20.) Not only do Defendants fail to assert any authority in support of their contention that this level of specificity-akin to Rule 9(b)-is required, their argument is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u201c[s]pecific facts are not necessary\u201d at the pleading stage. <em>See Erickson, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2200. <em>Twombly </em>merely requires enough facts in the complaint as a whole to \u201cnudge [plaintiffs\u2019] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Thus, while Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding trade organizations and trade meetings, <em>standing alone, </em>may not state a claim under the Sherman Act, they may properly be considered along with the other allegations in the Complaint as discussed above for purposes of the assessing the sufficiency of the Complaint. <em>See SRAM, </em>580 F.Supp.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">H. Relationship Between Dram/Sram and Flash Memory Conspiracies</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">Plaintiffs posit that the Defendants\u2019 alleged conspiracy to manipulate pricing for NAND flash memory was modeled after their pricing schemes in the markets for DRAM and SRAM memory, which are the subject of DOJ investigations. (DP Compl. \u00b6 71.) According to Defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>the DRAM/SRAM investigations are irrelevant for purposes of establishing a conspiracy regarding NAND flash memory on the ground that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a nexus between the DRAM/ SRAM pricing schemes and the alleged conspiracy to control the price of NAND flash memory. (Mot. at 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">In <em>United States v. Andreas, </em>216 F.3d 645 (7th Cir.2000), the court recognized that evidence concerning a prior conspiracy may be relevant and admissible to show the background and development of a current conspiracy. In <em>Andreas, </em>the court addressed a claim that there was a conspiracy to fix prices and control the output of Lysine, an amino acid. On appeal, the court rejected defendants challenge to the admissibility of evidence concerning a similar scheme involving the related market for citric acid. The court found that there was evidence that the citric acid scheme \u201cprovided the blueprint for and motivating force behind the nascent lysine scheme,\u201d and thus, was admissible to provide context as to how the lysine conspiracy operated. <em>Id. </em>at 665; <em>see also High Fructose, </em>295 F.3d at 661 (same). Likewise, in <em>SRAM, </em>the district court acknowledged that \u201c[although the DRAM guilty pleas are not sufficient to support Plaintiffs\u2019 clams standing on their own, <em>they do support an inference of a conspiracy in the SRAM industry.\u201d </em>580 F.Supp.2d at 903 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">Defendants ignore the above authority, and instead, focus on the fact that the employees who pleaded guilty to price fixing in the DRAM investigation worked for only <em>two </em>of the Defendant companies. (Mot. at 21-22, Reply at 12-13.) While that may be so, the Court notes that the two companies involved, Samsung and Hynix, collectively controlled the <em>majority </em>of the flash memory market <em>and </em>together paid fines approaching half a billion dollars. (DP. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 69, 46.) In addition, at least seven of the employees involved are alleged to have had responsibility for NAND flash memory pricing, sales, marketing and operations in the United States. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 67-69.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given these employees\u2019 overlapping involvement in controlling DRAM and flash memory pricing, coupled with the significant market power wielded by their employers, it is reasonable to infer that their involvement in the DRAM conspiracy had at least some connection to the alleged conspiracy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">Defendants also attempt to distinguish the two conspiracies by claiming, inaccurately, that the DRAM case involved raising prices, while this case involves restricting supplies. (Mot. at 22.) In fact, the Complaint expressly alleges that \u201cDefendants and their co-conspirators conspired to <em>fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price of NAND flash memory sold in the United States....\u201d </em>(DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 33 (emphasis added).) Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants specifically discussed controlling prices with regard to all memory products. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-80, 82, 84-85, 87-88, 102.) But even if the flash memory scheme focused more on affecting output, the fact remains that the purpose of both conspiracies was to artificially control and impact the memory market in order to generate or preserve profits. At bottom, while these facts may not prove the existence of a conspiracy with respect to NAND flash memory, they are properly pleaded for the purpose of establishing the plausibility that such a conspiracy existed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>I. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The Court concludes that the Complaint alleges \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 576, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Direct Purchaser Complaint is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">IV. <em>INDIRECT PURCHASER COMPLAINT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">A. Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">Separate and apart from the Direct Purchaser Complaint, 33 individuals and entities have filed an Indirect Purchaser Complaint, which also is the subject of a joint motion to dismiss. Unlike the Direct Purchasers, the Indirect Purchasers\u2019 claims are \u201climited in scope to NAND Flash Memory purchased indirectly where NAND Flash Memory is entirely a standalone product or a substantial component of another product....\u201d (IP Compl. \u00b6 12.) Examples of such products include flash memory cards, USB flash drives, flash-based digital music players (i.e., iPods, etc.) and higher end mobile telephones and computing devices. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss presents five central arguments: (1) Plaintiffs fail to satisfy pleading requirements of <em>Twombly; </em>(2) Plaintiffs lack standing to assert state law antitrust claims; (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 consumer protection claims fail as a matter of law; (4) Plaintiffs cannot plead a claim for unjust enrichment alongside claims that seek a remedy at law; and (5) Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims under the laws of states where none of them resides. Defendants\u2019 arguments regarding <em>Twombly </em>fail for the reasons discussed <em>supra </em>in the section of this Order analyzing the motion to dismiss the Direct Purchaser Complaint. As to the remaining four grounds for dismissal, the Court discusses them seriatim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-11\">B. Standing to Pursue State Antitrust Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-12\">1. Applicability of the <em>AGC </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-13\">In <em>Illinois Brick Company v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 730, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977), the Supreme Court held that indirect purchasers generally may not sue for money damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. In response to <em>Illinois Brick, </em>a number of states passed \u201crepealer\u201d statutes which expressly allow indirect purchasers to recover money damages for antitrust violations under state law. <em>See California v. ARC Am. Corp., </em>490 U.S. 93, 97-98, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86 (1989). In the present case, Plaintiffs\u2019 third claim for relief for state antitrust violations is predicated on the repealer statutes of Alabama, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin. (IP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 187-205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-14\">In their motion to dismiss, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs lack standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>to bring state antitrust claims on the ground that they cannot meet the requirements set forth in <em>Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983) <em>(\u2018AGC\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c[T]he Supreme Court in <em>[AGC] </em>identified certain factors for determining whether a plaintiff who has borne an injury has antitrust standing. These factors include: (1) the nature of the plaintiffs alleged injury; that is, whether it was the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall; (2) the directness of the injury; (3) the speculative measure of the harm; (4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and (5) the complexity in apportioning damages.\u201d <em>American Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. General Tel.

Resolution of that question is predicated on state law. In analyzing questions of state law, federal courts are bound by the decisions of the state\u2019s highest court. <em>See United Broth. of Carpenters and Joiners of America Local 586 v.

If \u201cthere is relevant precedent from the state\u2019s intermediate appellate court, the federal court must follow the state intermediate appellate court decision unless the federal court finds convincing evidence that the state\u2019s supreme court likely would not follow it.\u201d <em>Ryman v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>505 F.3d 993, 994 (9th Cir.2007) (emphasis omitted). Relevant decisions of courts in other jurisdictions also should be considered. <em>See Giles v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>494 F.3d 865, 872 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">Defendants summarily argue that <em>AGC </em>governs the standing inquiry to Plaintiffs state antitrust claims under Arizona, California, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, West Virginia, Wisconsin law. (Mot. at 17.) The Court concurs with Defendants only with respect to Iowa, Nebraska and California. The highest courts in both Iowa and Nebraska have held that the <em>AGC </em>factors apply to their antitrust laws. <em>Southard v. Visa USA Inc., </em>734 N.W.2d 192, 198-99 (Iowa 2007); <em>Kanne v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., </em>272 Neb. 489, 723 N.W.2d 293, 302-03 (2006). As such, the Court is compelled to find that <em>AGC </em>applies to Indirect Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims based on Iowa and Nebraska law. <em>See Carpenters, </em>540 F.3d at 963. As to California, its Supreme Court has not reached this issue, but at least one of its intermediate appellate courts has applied these factors to its antitrust law, the Cartwright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 16720 <em>et seq. See Vinci v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., </em>36 Cal.App.4th 1811, 43 Cal.Rptr.2d 337 (1995); <em>Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., </em>232 F.3d 979, 987 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the Court finds that <em>AGC </em>applies to Plaintiffs\u2019 California law antitrust claims as well. <em>See Ryman, </em>505 F.3d at 994 (holding that intermediate appellate court decisions generally are binding).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">The Court disagrees that <em>AGC </em>applies to any of remaining states in dispute. With respect to Arizona, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota and West Virginia, there are no state court appellate decisions or compelling decisions from other jurisdictions to provide this Court with guidance on how to \u201cpredict\u201d how the highest court of each state would rule on this issue. <em>See Dimidowich, </em>803 F.2d at 1482. However, Defendants note that each of these states has harmonization provisions calling for their respective statutes to be construed in accordance with federal law. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 44-1412 (\u201cin construing this article, the courts may use as a guide interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable federal antitrust statutes\u201d); Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 59-829 (\u201cthe courts of this state in construing [Nebraska\u2019s antitrust statute] shall follow the construction given to the federal law by the federal courts\u201d); Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 598A.050 (\u201cThe provisions of this chapter [under Nevada law] shall be construed in harmony with prevailing judicial interpretations of the federal antitrust statutes\u201d); N.M.

Codified Laws \u00a7 37-1-22 (\u201cIt is the intent of the [South Dakota] Legislature that in construing this chapter, the courts may use as a guide interpretations given by the federal or state courts to comparable antitrust statutes.\u201d); W.Va.Code \u00a7 47-18-16 (\u201cThis [West Virginia] article shall be construed liberally and in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable federal statutes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">As to Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota and Wisconsin, the Court has not been directed to any pertinent court decisions or any harmonization provisions, as in the case of the other states at issue. However, Defendants focus the Court\u2019s attention on cases purporting to demonstrate that states interpreting their antitrust laws look to federal antitrust precedents for guidance. <em>See Orr v. Beamon, </em>77 F.Supp.2d 1208, 1212 (D.Kan.1999) (\u201cstanding under the Kansas antitrust statutes requires an antitrust injury similar to that required under the Sherman and Clayton Acts\u201d); <em>Davric Maine Corp. v. Rancourt, </em>216 F.3d 143, 149 (1st Cir.2000) (\u201cWe have noted that the \u2018Maine antitrust statutes parallel the Sherman Act,\u2019 and thus have analyzed claims thereunder according to the doctrines developed in relation to federal law.\u201d); <em>First Med Representatives, LLC v.

Mississippi Real Estate Comm\u2019n, </em>872 F.2d 127, 129 (5th Cir.1989) (combining analysis of Mississippi and federal antitrust claims); <em>Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co., </em>282 N.C. 643, 194 S.E.2d 521, 530 (1973) (\u201cthe body of law applying the Sherman Act, although not binding upon this Court in applying [North Carolina\u2019s antitrust law], is nonetheless instructive in determining the full reach of that statute.\u201d); <em>State v.

This Court, however, is reticent to adopt an across-the-board rule that a state\u2019s harmonization provision, whether created by statute or common law, is an appropriate means of predicting how a state\u2019s highest court would rule regarding the applicability of <em>AGC </em>to state law antitrust claims. Neither party has provided the Court with the requisite, individualized analysis on a per state basis to enable the Court to render such a determination. As a consequence, \u201cthis order declines to undertake the backbreaking labor involved in deciphering the state of antitrust standing in each of those states on this motion \u2014 particularly since, as shown below, indirect purchasers have shown standing under <em>AGC </em>for consumers who bought finished [flash memory products].\u201d <em>See In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., </em>540 F.Supp.2d 1085, 1097 (N.D.Cal.2007) <em>(\u201cGPU II\u201d). </em>Thus, the Court concludes that AGC\u2019s standing analysis applies only to Plaintiffs\u2019 state antitrust claims based on California, Iowa and Nebraska law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">2. Application of the <em>AGC </em>Factors to Plaintiffs\u2019 Antitrust Claims Under California, Iowa and Nebraska Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">\n<em>a) Nature of the Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">The first factor under <em>AGC </em>is whether the injury alleged by Plaintiffs is the type the antitrust laws are intended to prevent. <em>See American Ad Mgt., </em>190 F.3d at 1055. \u201cA plaintiff may only pursue an antitrust action if it can show antitrust injury, which is to say \u2018injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Dynamic Random Access Memory (Dram) Antitrust Litig., </em>516 F.Supp.2d 1072, 1089 (N.D.Cal.2007) <em>(\u201cDRAM I\u201d) </em>(quoting <em>American Ad Mgmt., </em>190 F.3d at 1055). \u201cThe requirement that the alleged injury be related to anti-competitive behavior requires, <em>as a corollary, </em>that the injured party be a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors.\u201d <em>Bhan v. NME Hosps., Inc., </em>772 F.2d 1467, 1470 (9th Cir.1985) (emphasis added); <em>see also Tanaka v. University of Southern Calif., </em>252 F.3d 1059, 1063 (9th Cir.2001) (the anticompetitive effects must be felt in the \u201crelevant market\u201d). To determine whether an injured plaintiff is indeed a market participant, \u201cthe focus is upon the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of demand\u201d between the product or services involved. <em>Bhan, </em>772 F.2d at 1470-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-9\">In this case, Plaintiffs contend that they were injured by \u201cpaying higher prices for products containing NAND Flash Memory than they would have in the absence of Defendants\u2019 conspiracy.\u201d (IP Compl. \u00b6 148; Opp\u2019n at 23.) Defendants do not dispute that this is the type of injury that antitrust laws were intended to protect against. <em>See American Ad Mgt., </em>190 F.3d at 1055. Rather, Defendants\u2019 central contention is that Plaintiffs cannot show that they are \u201cparticipants\u201d in the restrained market. (Mot. at 9-10.) More specifically, Defendants assert that the alleged anti-competitive conduct occurred only in the market for <em>direct </em>purchasers of NAND flash memory, which is different than for <em>indirect </em>purchasers where the relevant market ostensibly is defined by where the particular product containing flash memory is sold. (Mot. at 9-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-10\">The argument posited by Defendants was rejected in <em>GPU II, </em>540 F.Supp.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>1098. In that case, direct and indirect purchasers brought federal and state antitrust claims against producers of graphics processing units (\u201cGPUs\u201d). GPUs are devices used in computers, servers, work stations, gaming consoles and mobile communication devices. Direct purchasers alleged that they purchased GPUs directly from manufacturers, while indirect purchasers alleged they purchased finished products that contained GPUs. Defendants moved to dismiss the indirect purchasers\u2019 claims on the ground that they were not participants in the relevant market because they \u201cparticipated\u201d in the market for the finished product containing GPUs, as opposed to the market for GPUs themselves. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected that distinction, however, noting that GPUs \u201care separate components of a computer and that any costs attributable to them are traceable through the chain of distribution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">The court in <em>TFT-LCD </em>applied similar reasoning in a class action involving thin film transfer liquid crystal display (\u201cLCD\u201d) panels and products. 586 F.Supp.2d at 1123. As in <em>GPU I, </em>the defendant manufactures argued that the indirect plaintiffs could not be considered participants in the relevant market for LCDs, since they purchased finished products containing LCD panels. The court found the alleged distinction to be uncompelling in view of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the market for LCD panels and the market for the products into which the panels are placed are \u201cinextricably linked and intertwined,\u201d and as a result, the demand for LCD panels directly derives from the demand for such products in which it is used as a component. <em>Id. </em>The court added that \u201cthere are factual questions about the relevant market,\u201d such as whether the indirect purchaser plaintiffs actually participated in the market for LCD panels through their purchases of products containing such panels or whether that market was \u201canalytically distinct\u201d from the market for LCD panels. <em>Id. </em>In either event, the comet concluded that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient at this stage to weigh in favor of standing under the first factor of <em>AGC.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">As in <em>GPU I </em>and <em>TFT-LCD, </em>Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts that they, as Indirect Purchasers of NAND flash memory-based products, are in the \u201csame market\u201d as Direct Purchasers, at least as far as antitrust standing is concerned at this stage of the proceedings. The Complaint alleges that NAND flash memory has a variety of applications. It can be purchased as a stand-alone item or incorporated as a central component of finished products, such as digital music players, USB drives, and so on. (IP Compl. \u00b6 73.) Regardless of how it is sold, however, NAND flash memory provides essentially the same functionality; that is, versatile, digital storage that is <em>not </em>dependent on the presence of power to maintain its memory. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71-72.) Thus, while the markets for NAND flash memory and products that contain NAND flash memory technically may be different, in practice, both markets are inextricably intertwined and there is inherent cross-elasticity of demand between the two. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 73.) For purposes of the instant motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show that they are market participants for purposes of <em>AGC. </em>However, it bears noting that the actual determination of whether indirect purchasers are \u201cparticipants\u201d in the same \u201crelevant market\u201d for purposes of antitrust standing is better suited to resolution upon a fuller record. <em>See TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">\n<em>b) The Directness of the Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">\u201cThe second <em>[AGC </em>] factor looks to whether [the] alleged injury was the direct result of [defendants\u2019] allegedly anticompetitive conduct.... To assess the direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>ness of this injury, we look to the chain of causation between [the] injury and the alleged restraint in the market[.]\u201d <em>Am. Ad Mgt., </em>190 F.3d at 1058. Defendants contend that there is no direct injury because NAND flash memory is merely a component of the finished product, and is but one of many variables affecting its price. (Mot. at 13.) They also claim that the distribution channels for finished products differ from those for NAND flash memory. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">In <em>TFT-LCD </em>and <em>GPU I, </em>the courts found that indirect purchasers of components had satisfied their burden of pleading directness of injury by alleging that the cost of the component was traceable through the product distribution chain. <em>Compare TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1123 (directness requirement met based on allegations that cost of component part comprised a substantial amount of the finished product cost and could be traced through the distribution chain); <em>GPU II, </em>540 F.Supp.2d at 1098 (same) <em>with DRAM I, </em>516 F.Supp.2d at 1092 (directness requirement not met where the \u201ccomplaint sets forth no allegations that, within the final purchase price of a given product purchased by plaintiffs for \u2018end use,\u2019 the ultimate cost of DRAM is somehow directly traceable or distinguishable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">In this case, the Complaint expressly alleges that \u201c[w]hen NAND Flash Memory is purchased by consumer as part of an electronic device, it is a distinct, physieallydiscrete hardware element of the end-use product and is identifiable by a specific, discrete part or model number that permits tracing. NAND Flash Memory is identifiable and traceable throughout the chain of the distribution to the end user. It does not undergo any alterations as it moves through the chain of distribution.\u201d (IP Compl. \u00b6 152.) The pleadings further allege that \u201c[t]racing can help show that changes in the prices paid by direct purchasers of NAND Flash Memory affect prices paid indirect-purchasers of the Flash Memory itself or products containing Flash Memory.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 154.) In addition, NAND Flash Memory allegedly \u201cmakes up an overwhelming majority of the cost of NAND flash-based memory devices and a substantial portion of the consumer devices in which NAND Flash Memory is packaged to be sold as a component.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 157.) These allegations are adequate to show that there is a chain of causation between Defendants\u2019 allegedly anticompetitive conduct and Plaintiffs\u2019 injury, which is the overpayment for flash memory products and finished products containing NAND flash memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">\n<em>c) Speculative Nature of Harm, and Complexity in Apportioning Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">The final third and fifth <em>AGC </em>factors-the speculative nature of the harm and the complexity in apportioning damages-may be considered together. <em>See DRAM I, </em>516 F.Supp.2d at 1092 (citing <em>American Ad Mgmt., </em>190 F.3d at 1054-55). As to these factors, Defendants make essentially the same arguments that they raised regarding AGC\u2019s second factor; namely, that NAND flash memory is just one of many components of a finished product, and as such, any attempt to distinguish the impact of its allegedly inflated price on the purchase price of a retail product would be speculative and excessively complex. (Mot. at 13-15.) As discussed above, Plaintiffs have alleged that the NAND flash memory, whether in the form of a product or as a component of a finished product, remains discrete and traceable to its manufacturer. This is sufficient for purposes of avoid dismissal. <em>See DRAM I, </em>516 F.Supp.2d at 1092-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">\n<em>d) Duplicative Recovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">\u201cThe risk to be avoided under [the duplicative recovery factor] is that potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>plaintiffs may be in a \u2018position to assert conflicting claims to a common fund ... thereby creating the danger of multiple liability for the fund.\u2019 \u201d <em>American Ad Mgmt., </em>190 F.3d at 1059 (quoting <em>Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., </em>812 F.2d 538, 542 (9th Cir.1987)). Defendants briefly assert that a duplicative recovery \u201cis a near certainty\u201d given that the Direct Purchasers\u2019 claims also are before the Court. (Mot. at 16.) Such a concern, however, generally is inapposite in the context of indirect purchaser state law antitrust claims. \u201cStates ... which have repealed <em>Illinois Brick </em>and allowed indirect purchasers to sue for antitrust violations, have necessarily made the policy decision that duplicative recovery may permissibly occur. Duplicative recovery is, in many if not all eases alleging a nationwide conspiracy with both direct and indirect purchaser classes, a necessary consequence that flows from indirect purchaser recovery. Accordingly, it is no bar against standing, and this factor does not weigh against standing.\u201d <em>DRAM I, </em>516 F.Supp.2d at 1094. In any event, the Court notes that Plaintiffs have alleged that the alleged overcharges by Defendants are distinct and traceable. (IP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 152-57.) In such instances, courts have acknowledged that the risk of duplicative recovery is less of a concern. <em>TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1124; <em>GPU II, </em>540 F.Supp.2d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">At bottom, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to establish standing at this stage of the pleadings for the California, Iowa and Nebraska Plaintiffs to pursue their antitrust claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">C. Consumer Protection Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AW3\">The next issue for the Court\u2019s consideration is Defendants\u2019 contention that Plaintiffs have failed to a state claim based on the consumer protection statutes of Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and West Virginia. (Mot. at 17.) As will be discussed below, the Court agrees with Defendants\u2019 motion, in part, and dismisses with prejudice Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the laws of Kansas, Maine, Rhode Island and West Virginia. The Court also dismisses Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the laws of the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico and New York, but grants leave to amend to correct the deficiencies, as explained below. The motion to dismiss is denied as to Plaintiffs\u2019 consumer protection claims based on the law of Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">1. Arkansas<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">The Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\u201cADTPA\u201d), Arkansas Code \u00a7\u00a7 4-88-101 <em>et seq., </em>prohibits \u201c[deceptive and unconscionable trade practices,\u201d including \u201c[ejngaging in any other <em>unconscionable, </em>false, or deceptive act or practice in business, commerce, or trade.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4-88-107(a)(10) (emphasis added); <em>see also id., </em>\u00a7 4-88-108 (prohibiting deception, fraud and false pretense). While there appear to be no published state appellate rulings directly on point, Arkansas courts have construed the statute broadly. <em>E.g., State ex rel. Bryant v. R &amp; A Inv. Co., </em>336 Ark. 289, 985 S.W.2d 299, 302-303 (1999) (usury scheme constituted \u201cuncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>scionable\u201d conduct). In addition, several district courts interpreting the ADTPA have found that the term \u201cunconscionable trade practices\u201d is sufficiently broad to encompass price fixing. <em>See In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., </em>602 F.Supp.2d 538, 582-83 (M.D.Pa.2009) <em>(\u201cChocolate Confectionary </em>\u201d) (conspiracy to fix and stabilize chocolate confectionary prices); <em>In re Neto Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig., </em>350 F.Supp.2d 160, 178 (D.Me.2004) <em>(\u201cNMV\u201d) </em>(conspiracy to keep Canadian-manufactured vehicles from entering the U.S. automobile market).</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Relying on a footnote in <em>NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 178 n. 22, Defendants contend that the district court rejected \u201cthe very same theory of deception- \u2014 the failure to disclose an alleged conspiracy \u2014 that Plaintiffs espouse in this case.\u201d (Reply at 17.) That contention lacks merit. Though the Complaint alleges that Defendants acted in a \u201cdeceptive\u201d manner <em>\u201cto </em>cover up their illegal acts,\u201d the pleadings also allege that Defendants engaged in \u201cunconscionable conduct\u201d by misleading the public into believing that the prices they were paying for NAND flash memory were set by the free market when, in fact, they were not. (IP Compl. \u00b6 208e.) Moreover, the footnote cited by Defendants does not pertain to the ADTPA, but rather, refers generally to state consumer protection statutes that prohibit only \u201cfraudulent or deceptive conduct.\u201d <em>NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 177 n. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Defendants also urge the Court to follow Judge Alsup\u2019s ruling in <em>GPU I </em>where he found that plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead \u201cgrossly unequal bargaining power\u201d was fatal to their claims based on the consumer protection laws of Arkansas, among other states. 527 F.Supp.2d at 1029-1030. This Court does not find the analysis set forth in <em>GPU I </em>to be pertinent to the issue presented herein, particularly in light of the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s view that an unconscionable act is one that is \u201can act that \u2018affronts the sense of justice, decency, or reasonableness,\u2019 \u201d including acts <em>\u201cviolative of public policy or a statute.\u201d Baptist Health v. Murphy, </em>365 Ark. 115, 226 S.W.3d 800, 810-11 (2006) (emphasis added). Here, Plaintiffs allege specifically that \u201cDefendants\u2019 conduct with regard to the sales of NAND Flash Memory, including their illegal conspiracy to secretly fix the price of NAND Flash Memory at supracompetitive levels and overcharge customers, was substantively unconscionable because it was one-sided and unfairly benefitted Defendants at the expense of Plaintiffs and the public.\u201d (IP Compl. \u00b6 208f.) Such allegations, construed in favor of Plaintiffs, can be considered to constitute a violation of public policy. For these reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 ADT-PA claim is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">2.

Chartone, Inc., </em>908 A.2d 72, 90 (D.C.2006); <em>Chocolate Confectionary, </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 584 (\u201cthe DCCPPA subsumes a Sherman Act claim and creates an indirect purchaser cause of action for conspiratorial price fixing regardless of whether defendants have engaged in deceptive conduct.\u201d) (citing D.C. state case law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">With respect to their claims under the DCCPPA, Plaintiffs alleges that they paid \u201cartificially inflated prices\u201d for NAND flash memory as a result of Defendants\u2019 alleged suppression and elimination of price competition. (IP Compl. \u00b6 210e.) Absent, however, are allegations that Plaintiffs were charged \u201cunconscionably high\u201d prices that were unreasonably favorable to the seller, resulting from a lack of meaningful choice of alternatives under the circumstances. <em>Ford, </em>908 A.2d at 90. As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the DCCPPA are deficient and GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the DCCPPA. Because this deficiency could be cured by amendment, Plaintiffs will be granted leave to amend to include the requisite factual allegations as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">3. Hawaii</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Plaintiffs bring a consumer protection claim under Hawaii\u2019s Antitrust Act, Hawaii Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 480 <em>et seq. </em>(Compl. \u00b6 212e). Citing Hawaii Rev. Stat. \u00a7 480-13.3, Defendants argue that such a claim is not ripe given the requirement that Plaintiffs must first provide the state attorney general the opportunity to prosecute the claim on their behalf. (Mot. at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">Section 480-2 prohibits (1) \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d and (2) \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d Hawaii Rev. Stat. \u00a7 480-2(a), (d) and (e). Under section 480-13.3(a)(l), \u201c[a] class action for claims for a violation of this chapter <em>other than </em>claims for <em>unfair or deceptive acts or practices </em>may be filed, and may be prosecuted on behalf of indirect purchasers by a person other than the attorney general,\u201d provided that the class plaintiffs first serve a copy of the complaint on the attorney general. The attorney general has sole discretion as to whether the state will proceed with the action or file its own action. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 480-13.3(a)(4). If the attorney general declines to so proceed, the class plaintiff shall have the right to proceed with the action. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 480-13.3(a)(5)(C). Subdivision (b) states that \u201c[t]his section shall not limit the rights of consumers to bring class actions against any person based on unfair or deceptive acts or practices declared unlawful by section 480-2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">Plaintiffs acknowledge that <em>unfair competition </em>claims are subject to the attorney general notification requirement, but contend that their claim for <em>unfair or deceptive acts </em>should be allowed to proceed. (Opp. at 43.) As Defendants point out, the flaw in that argument is that the Complaint alleges <em>both </em>grounds as a basis for recovery in a single claim. (IP Compl. \u00b6 212(e).) To the extent Indirect Plaintiffs desire to pursue a claim under Hawaii law, they will need to expressly limit their claim to the unfair and deceptive acts aspect of the Hawaii Antitrust Act. Consequently, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim based on section 480-2 is GRANTED. Plaintiffs will be allowed leave to amend to allege a claim for unfair or deceptive acts or practices only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">4. Kansas</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">Plaintiffs do not oppose dismissal of their claims under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act, Kan. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 50-623 et seq. (Opp\u2019n at 40 n. 43.) Therefore, De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>fendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under Kansas law is GRANTED, which is dismissed without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">5.Maine</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">The Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cMUTPA\u201d) prohibits \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d as well as \u201cunfair or deceptive ... conduct of any trade.\u201d Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5 \u00a7 207 (Me.2008). The Maine Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]n pricing cases under the Act the inquiry is whether the price has the effect of deceiving the consumer, or inducing her to purchase something that she would not otherwise purchase.\u201d <em>Tungate v. MacLean-Stevens Studios, Inc., </em>714 A.2d 792, 797 (Me.1998). Applying this standard, the Court concurs with Defendants that the MUTPA does not create a cognizable claim for collusive pricing. Logically, charging <em>higher </em>prices would not deceive or induce a consumer to purchase an item he or she would not otherwise purchase. <em>See GPU I, </em>527 F.Supp.2d at 1031 (\u201c[a]rguing that higher prices induced consumers to make purchases simply does not make sense.\u201d); <em>accord Chocolate Confectionary, </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 584-86; <em>TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">In an attempt to distinguish <em>Tungate, </em>Plaintiffs argue that its holding applies <em>only </em>to the portion of the MUTPA that pertains to claims based on \u201cunfair and deceptive acts,\u201d and does not address the standard for claims based on \u201cunfair methods of competition.\u201d (Opp\u2019n at 44.) In support of their position, Plaintiffs cite <em>NMV, </em>where the court narrowly construed the <em>Tungate </em>court\u2019s holding as applying only to the MUTPA\u2019s restriction on \u201cunfair or deceptive acts.\u201d <em>NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 187 n. 40. The Court disagrees with the <em>NMV </em>court\u2019s restrictive reading of <em>Tun-gate. </em>By its own terms, the <em>Tungate </em>standard applies broadly to \u201cpricing cases <em>under the Act.\u201d </em>714 A.2d at 797 (emphasis added). There is nothing in <em>Tungate </em>to support the purported distinction advocated by Plaintiffs. As a decision of Maine\u2019s highest court, the Court is bound to follow the holding in <em>Tungate. See Carpenters, </em>540 F.3d at 963. In accordance with <em>Tun-gate, </em>the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs claim under the MUPTA. Because any amendment would be futile, said dismissal is without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">6. New Hampshire</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), N.H.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 358-A:2, on the ground that Plaintiffs have not alleged that any unfair or deceptive acts took place <em>within </em>New Hampshire. <em>See Pacamor Bearings, Inc. v. Minebea Co., Ltd., </em>918 F.Supp. 491, 504 (D.N.H.1996) (CPA requires that \u201coffending conduct\u201d occur within the state\u2019s borders). Though Plaintiffs acknowledge that their Complaint lacks such allegations, they briefly contend that the CPA should be read broadly in light of <em>LaChance v. U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co., </em>156 N.H. 88, 931 A.2d 571, 580 (2007). (Opp\u2019n at 44.) <em>LaChance </em>merely states that \u201cindirect purchasers may bring claims under the CPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. It does not, as Plaintiffs suggest, address the requirement that the offending conduct occur within the state. Given Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to state a cognizable claim under the CPA, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this claim, with leave to amend to cure the deficiency if Plaintiffs are able to do so in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">7. New Mexico</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">The New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (\u201cNMUPA\u201d), New Mexico Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 57-12-1 <em>et seq., </em>prohibits both \u201cunfair deceptive trade practices\u201d and \u201cunconscionable trade practices in the conduct of any trade or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>commerce.\u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57-12-3. Under New Mexico law, an unconscionable trade practice is \u201can act or practice ... which to a person\u2019s detriment: (1) takes advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience or capacity of a person to a grossly unfair degree; or (2) results in a gross disparity between the value received by a person and the price paid.\u201d N.M.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 57-12-2(E); <em>NMV, </em>350 F.Supp.2d at 195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">Defendants contend, without citation to relevant authority, that \u201cunconscionable trade practices\u201d is limited to cases where \u201cgrossly unequal bargaining power\u201d is alleged. (Mot. at 17.) Courts have taken a broader view of the NMUPA, however. \u201cFederal courts generally permit NMUPA actions in price-fixing cases provided that the plaintiff alleges a \u2018gross disparity\u2019 between the price paid for a product and the value received.\u201d <em>Chocolate Confectionary </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 585 (citing cases); <em>TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1127. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint does not contain the requisite allegations, even under a more expansive reading of the statute. The Complaint simply alleges that \u201c[t]here was a gross disparity of <em>bargaining power </em>between the parties with respect to the price charged by Defendants and NAND flash memory,\u201d (IP Compl. \u00b6 218(c) (emphasis added).) \u201cGross disparity\u201d between the <em>price paid for a product and the value received </em>is <em>not </em>alleged. Given the absence of the requisite allegations, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 NMUPA claim. Plaintiffs will be allowed leave to amend to cure this deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">8. New York</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">Section 349 of New York\u2019s General Business Law provides, in relevant part, that: \u201cDeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state are hereby declared unlawful.\u201d \u201c[S]ection 349 is directed at wrongs against the consuming public.\u201d <em>See In re Rezulin Prods.

A plaintiff asserting a section 349 claim \u201cmust prove three elements: first, that the challenged act or practice was consumer-oriented; second, that it was misleading in a material way; and third, that the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the deceptive act.\u201d <em>See Stutman v. Chem. Bank, </em>95 N.Y.2d 24, 29, 709 N.Y.S.2d 892, 731 N.E.2d 608 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action under section 349 fails on the ground that there is no particular conduct directed specifically <em>at the Indirect Purchasers. </em>(Mot. at 20.) In <em>Paltre v. General Motors Corp., </em>the court held that consumers who purchased or leased vehicles \u201cfailed to set forth a viable cause of action to recover damages for deceptive business practices\u201d based on allegations of price-fixing among automobile manufacturers \u201cbecause the alleged misrepresentations were either not <em>directed at consumers </em>or were not materially deceptive.\u201d <em>See Paltre v.

Here, the Complaint only avers that Defendants \u201cpublicly provided pretextual and false justifications\u201d for their price increases and made \u201cpublic announcements concerning the changes in the prices of NAND Flash Memory.\u201d (IP Compl. \u00b6 219c.) Other than the supposed statements made to the \u201cpublic,\u201d there are no specific allegations that the misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>was directed <em>at </em>any particular group, let alone Indirect Purchasers in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Plaintiffs fail to address <em>Paltre. </em>Instead, they simply assert that a section 349 claim is sustainable where the deceptive conduct is directed at a \u201cbroad group of individuals.\u201d (Opp\u2019n at 45.) That argument misses the mark. The question presented is not whether anticompetitive conduct falls within the purview of section 349. Rather, the issue framed by Defendants\u2019 motion is whether the misrepresentations were directed <em>at </em>Indirect Purchasers of NAND flash memory. Such allegations are absent from the pleadings, which aver only that Defendants made \u201cpublic announcements\u201d intended to create the illusion of free market pricing. (IP Compl. \u00b6 219c.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As such, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.

Laws \u00a7 6-13.1-1 <em>et seq., </em>on the ground that price fixing does not constitute \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d as defined by the UTPCPA. (Mot. at 22.) Section 6-13.1-2 provides that \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\u201d To determine whether a practice is \u201cunfair\u201d under the statute, the .court is to consider: \u201c(1) Whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise-whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).\u201d <em>See Ames v. Oceanside Welding and Towing Co., Inc., </em>767 A.2d 677, 681 (R.I.2001) (internal quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">The Court concurs with Defendants that price fixing is not within the ambit of the UTPCPA. The statute defines \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d to consist of 19 separately enumerated practices, <em>none of which includes price fixing. </em>R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 6-13.1-l(6)(i)-(xix). t In <em>ERI Max Entertainment, Inc. v. Streisand, </em>690 A.2d 1351, 1354 (R.I.1997), a video store owner sued Blockbuster Video (\u201cBlockbuster\u201d) and Barbra Streisand (among others) for violating the state\u2019s antitrust and unfair practices statutes. The store\u2019s claim was based on an agreement in which Blockbuster was granted exclusive access to a Streisand concert video containing an extra song not found on versions of the videotape distributed elsewhere. In rejecting plaintiffs unfair competition claims, the Rhode Island Supreme Court explained that \u201ca finding of unfair competition must be predicated upon conduct on the part of the respondent that reasonably tended to confuse and mislead the general public into purchasing his product when the actual intent of the purchaser was to buy the product of the complainant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1353-54. The court then concluded that the defendants\u2019 exclusive distribution agreement was not the type of \u201cunfair conduct\u201d that the Act was intended to encompass. <em>Id. </em>It is clear under the foregoing authority, which is binding on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>this court, the \u201cprice fixing conspiracy\u201d alleged in this case (IP Compl. \u00b6 221c) is not governed by the UTPCPA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For these reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.

West Virginia</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (the \u201cWVCCPA\u201d), W.V.Code \u00a7 46A-6-101 <em>et seq., </em>should be dismissed because the statute does not encompass price fixing. (Mot. at 23.) The WVCCPA states, in part, that: \u201cThe legislature hereby declares that the purpose of this article is to complement the body of federal law governing unfair competition and unfair, deceptive and fraudulent acts or practices in order to protect the public and foster fair and honest competition. It is the intent of the legislature that, in construing this article, the courts be guided by the interpretation given by the federal courts to the various federal statutes dealing with the same or similar matters. To this end, this article shall be liberally construed so that its beneficial purposes may be served.\u201d W. Va.Code \u00a7 46A-6-101(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Seizing upon the state legislature\u2019s directive that the WVCCPA be \u201cliberally construed,\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the statute should be read to encompass price fixing. (Opp. at 47.) The Court disagrees. Price fixing is not among the 16 enumerated definitions of \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practicesf.]\u201d W. Va.Code, \u00a7 46A-6-102. Rather, on their face, each of these definitions pertains to misrepresentations or deceptive practices relating to goods and services. For example, the statute prohibits acts such as \u201c[p]assing off goods or services as those of another\u201d; \u201c[u]sing deceptive representations or designations of geographic origin in connection with goods or services\u201d; \u201c[m]aking false or misleading statements of fact concerning the reasons for, existence of or amounts of price reductions\u201d; and \u201c[engaging in any other conduct which similarly creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, price fixing or similar anticompetitive conduct cannot be reasonably construed to fall within the scope of the WVCCPA. <em>See TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1130 (WVCCPA does not include price fixing schemes); <em>GPU I, </em>527 F.Supp.2d at 1030 (same); <em>DRAM I, </em>516 F.Supp.2d at 1119 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Federal Trade Comm\u2019n v.

(Opp\u2019n at 47.) While both cases support the general notion that indirect purchaser cases may be brought under the WVCCPA, neither stands for the proposition that the provision of the WVCCP at issue \u201cjustifies allowing allegations of antitrust price-fixing brought by indirect purchasers to go forward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 WVCCPA claim. Since amendment to this claim would be futile, said dismissal is without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>D. Unjust Enrichment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Finally, Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims under the laws of Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Tennessee. They argue that the laws of each of these states \u201cbar an action for unjust enrichment where the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law.\u201d (Mot. at 24.) As a general principle, Defendants are correct that \u201c[i]t is a basic doctrine of equity jurisprudence that courts of equity should not act ... when the moving party has an adequate remedy at law .... \u201d <em>Mort v. United States, </em>86 F.3d 890, 892 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, </em>503 U.S. 60, 75-76, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992) (\u201cit is axiomatic that a court should determine the adequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to equitable relief\u2019). In response, Plaintiffs contend that they are allowed under the Federal Rules to allege claims in the alternative, even if they are inconsistent with one another. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(d)(3) (\u201cA party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">The difficulty for the Court is that neither party focuses on the appropriate issue. The laws governing claims for unjust enrichment vary from state to state. \u201c[S]ome states recognize unjust enrichment as a separate free-standing claim, while others do not.\u201d <em>GPU II, </em>540 F.Supp.2d at 1100. Instead of analyzing the laws of each state separately, Defendants relegate their discussion to a string cite contained in a footnote in their moving papers. (Mot. at 24 n. 9.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The lack of individualized analysis by the parties is unhelpful. For example, Defendants cite <em>Community Guardian Bank v. Hamlin, </em>182 Ariz. 627, 630, 898 P.2d 1005 (Ariz.Ct.App.1995) for the proposition that an unjust enrichment claim \u201crequires that there be no remedy provided at law.\u201d (Mot. at 24 n. 9.) More recent Arizona authority, on the other hand, suggests that the \u201cadequate remedy at law\u201d requirement turns not on whether the plaintiff has a remedy \u201cproviding all the relief the party desires,\u201d but rather, on \u201cwhether there is a contract which governs the relationship between the parties.\u201d <em>Trustmark Ins. Co. v. Bank One, Arizona, NA, </em>202 Ariz. 535, 541 n. 5, 48 P.3d 485 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">The Court declines to independently address the viability of Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims with respect to the aforementioned states. In the event Defendants desire to seek a judicial resolution of this issue, they should discuss the laws of each state separately. Such analysis should be supported with citations to relevant authorities demonstrating that Plaintiffs cannot, as a matter of law, maintain a separate claim for unjust enrichment where they, at the same time, are pursuing claims based on state antitrust and consumer protection statutes. For these reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims under the laws of Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Tennessee is DENIED without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-11\">E. Lack of a Representative Plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-12\">Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 second, third and fourth claims for relief to the extent that such claims are based on the laws of a state where no representative has been named; to wit, Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Hawaii and New Hampshire. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>(Mot. at 16.) \u201cA class cannot assert a claim on behalf of an individual that they do not represent.\u201d <em>GPU I, </em>527 F.Supp.2d at 1026; <em>accord In re Ditropan XL Antitrust Litig., </em>529 F.Supp.2d 1098, 1106-107 (N.D.Cal.2007). Where, as here, a representative plaintiff is lacking for a particular state, all claims based on <em>that </em>state\u2019s laws are subject to dismissal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Plaintiffs concede that they lack representatives for claims predicated on the laws of each of the aforementioned states. However, they request leave to amend to join a class representative for each of those states, except as to Alabama. Defendants argue that allowing the joinder of additional plaintiffs should be disallowed as futile on the ground that Plaintiffs lack standing. As discussed, the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to establish standing with respect to their state law antitrust claims, and certain of their consumer protection claims may be viable upon proper amendment. The proposed amendment to join the missing representatives, therefore, would not be entirely futile. The Court thus GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs\u2019 second, third and fourth claims under the laws of Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Hawaii and New Hampshire. Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend to join representative class members to the extent their joinder is consistent with this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">F. Miscellaneous Requests</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">Several of the parties have filed requests for judicial notice (\u201cRJN\u201d). (Docket 399, 448, 419, 377.) All requests are unopposed, except for the RJN filed by Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. (\u201cHynix\u201d) (Docket 377), to which the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs have filed an objection (Docket 400). The unopposed RJNs are GRANTED. As to Hynix\u2019s RJN, the Court\u2019s ruling does not rely on any of the materials submitted therein. Therefore, Hynix\u2019s RJN is DENIED AS MOOT and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 objections are OVERRULED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">Direct and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs also filed a motion for administrative relief in which they submit copies of three district court decisions that were rendered following the scheduled hearing date on the motions to dismiss. (Docket 454). The Court finds that under the circumstances, the submission of these authorities is authorized and appropriate under Local Rules 7-3(d) and 7-11, and as such, the motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">Finally, Defendants filed a motion for a protective order to stay discovery during the pendency of the above-discussed motions to dismiss. (Docket 379). As the Court has now resolved the motions, this motion is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">V. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">For the reasons stated above,</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-13\">1.

All parties shall be on the line and shall call (510) 637-3559 at the above indicated date and time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">. Although Defendants have filed joint motions to dismiss, the following Defendants have filed their own motions to dismiss: San-disk (Docket 370); Hitachi (Docket 372); Renesas (373); Hynix (Docket 376); and Toshiba (Docket 382).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">.

On January 5, 2007, Plaintiff Trong Nguyen, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, sued Defendants for violating section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. The Court later related and consolidated 23 cases with the <em>Nguyen </em>action. The Court appointed interim lead counsel for the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs on November 15, 2007. (Docket 256, 257.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">. The Indirect Purchaser Complaint adds Hitachi America, Ltd. and Hitachi Semiconductor America as defendants.

Two weeks after issuing <em>Twombly, </em>the Supreme Court clarified in <em>Erickson </em>that <em>Twombly </em>did not signal a switch to fact-pleading in the federal courts. <em>Erickson </em>reaffirmed that under Rule 8 \"[sjpecific facts are not necessary; the statement need only 'give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.' \" 127 S.Ct. at 2200 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955); <em>see also Airborne Beepers &amp; Video, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Mobility LLC, </em>499 F.3d 663, 667-668 (7th Cir.2007) (\"[flaking Erickson and Twombly together, we understand the Court to be saying only that at some point the factual detail in a complaint may be so sketchy that the complaint does not provide the type of notice of the claim to which the defendant is entitled under Rule 8.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">. The references to \"Complaint\u201d and \"Plaintiffs\u201d in this section refer to the Direct Purchaser Complaint and the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">. In addition to the joint motion to dismiss, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, SanDisk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>Hynix filed their own, separate motions to dismiss. The arguments adduced in those motions overlap with those presented in the joint submission. Their central point of contention appears to be the lack of specific allegations directed at their particular company. This argument fails. For pleading purposes, allegations of antitrust conspiracy need not be detailed on a \"defendant by defendant\u201d basis. <em>See SRAM, </em>580 F.Supp.2d at 903-907 (rejecting argument plaintiffs must allege each defendant\u2019s specific role in an antitrust conspiracy); <em>accord In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 822 (3rd Cir.1982); <em>In re Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., </em>894 F.Supp. 703, 712 (S.D.N.Y.1995). Defendant Hitachi America Ltd.\u2019s separate argument that Plaintiff\u2019s claims are time-barred is unsupported by any evidence which, in any event, would be impermissible on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">. The Court notes that the Complaint does not allege that market shares among the Defendants were \u201crapidly shifting.\u201d That simply is Defendants\u2019 characterization of some of the data alleged in the pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">. For example, the Complaint alleges that as early as 2002, industry participants called for cooperation among competitors to \"prevent a price war,\u201d and that Defendants heeded these suggestions. (DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.) It further is alleged that consistent with this strategy, Renesas was created in 2003 as a joint venture by Defendants Hitachi, Ltd. and Mitsubishi. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 64.) It thus is plausible to conclude that the formation of Renesas was itself a conspiratorial act to control prices and supply. <em>See Petruzzi\u2019s IGA Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Darling-Delaware Co., Inc., </em>998 F.2d 1224 (3rd Cir.1993) (noting that a range of circumstantial evidence can show collusion; \" \u2018[f]or example, have they attended meetings or <em>conducted discussions at which they had the opportunity to conspire; </em>have they acted against their own economic best interests; have they engaged in parallel behavior that is economically irrational unless an agreement exists; <em>has at least one participant expressly invited common action by the other \") </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">. It also is noteworthy that nearly all of the Defendants in this case sell DRAM and NAND flash memory. (DP Compl. \u00b6 66-69.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\u201d) has begun investigating Defendants for price-fixing <em>flash </em>memory. (DP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 115-118.) Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>suggest that this development may be used to create an inference of anti-competitive activity. However, as noted by Defendants, the mere fact that an investigation is under way is not by itself an appropriate consideration for purposes of determining the adequacy of the pleadings. <em>See SRAM, </em>580 F.Supp.2d at 903 (\u201cThe Court agrees that the existence of the investigation [regarding SRAM] does not support Plaintiffs' antitrust conspiracy claims\u201d); <em>GPU I, </em>527 F.Supp.2d at 1024 (finding that it would be sheer speculation to infer anti-competitive behavior from a mere investigation, as opposed to a proceeding which results in charges or civil or criminal penalties).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1190-16\">. All references to \"Plaintiffs\u201d and \u201cComplaint\u201d in this section are to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs and the Indirect-Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Class Action Complaint, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">. It bears noting that the Indirect Purchasers Plaintiffs are comprised of those who purchased (1) flash memory as a \"stand-alone product\" and (2) products where flash memory is a \"substantial component\u201d of a finished product. (IP Compl. \u00b6 12.) Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is limited specifically to the latter category, i.e., \"Flash Memory-based products.\u201d (Mot. at 12.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">. As noted, Defendants have not demonstrated that <em>AGC </em>applies to Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims based on the laws of Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, South Dakota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, West Virginia and Wisconsin, and they have not advanced any other ground for dismissing these particular claims at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">. Defendants do not specifically address the consumer protection laws of Arkansas, the District of Columbia or New Mexico, but present a single argument that each of these three jurisdictions requires a showing of unequal bargaining power. (Mot. at 17; Reply at 17.) Because the statutes of each of these jurisdictions differ, the Court addresses each separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">. Although Plaintiffs contend that they, in fact, have made the requisite allegations, the cited paragraphs of the Complaint do not support their assertion. (Opp'n at 46) (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 174, 219.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">. Aggrieved purchasers are not without a remedy, as the Defendants\u2019 actions may be subject to the state's antitrust provisions. R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 6-3 6-2 (b). However, indirect purchasers lack standing to bring a private claim under that statute. <em>See Siena v. Microsoft Corp., </em>796 A.2d 461, 464-65 (2002) (holding that the state attorney general has standing as <em>parens patriae </em>to protect the rights of indirect purchasers in antitrust matters since they cannot bring such actions themselves directly).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">. The bulk of Plaintiffs' argument also is set forth in a lengthy string cite in a footnote. (Opp'n at 48 n. 47.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
