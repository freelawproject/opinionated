Whitlow, who was adjudged guilty of the crime of grand theft by the court, a jury having been duly waived, appeals from the judgment of conviction, and from the order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Appellant was charged with obtaining $300 from one Ethel McCarthy, on or about March 18, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Briefly, the evidence reveals that Miss McCarthy, a child nurse by occupation, was working in an employment agency in the early part of the year 1939; she became acquainted at that time with the defendant, who was seeking employment. After they had seen each other daily for about six weeks, they appear to have arrived at an understanding regarding the possibility of prospective marriage. In the early part of March, 1939, Miss McCarthy told the defendant that she was intending to go into an employment agency business, and they discussed the matter of the purchase by her of a one-half interest therein for the defendant, who was still unemployed. Whitlow, however, was interested in purchasing a one-half interest in a gasoline station located at Third Avenue and Venice Boulevard, in Los Angeles, owned by a Mr. C. P. Graham. They drove out one day to the gasoline station, and the defendant talked to Mr. Graham out of Miss McCarthy\u2019s hearing. Two or three days later, on Saturday afternoon, March 18th, Miss McCarthy gave the sum of $300, which she had borrowed from an individual, to Whitlow for the purpose of completing the purchase of his one-half interest in the filling station. Miss McCarthy did not see the defendant until the next day, Sunday, at which time he stated that he was investigating the service station deal further. On Tuesday morning, the defendant told her that he had lost the $300 in gambling on Saturday night, Sunday night and Monday night. Miss McCarthy saw the defendant on one occasion thereafter, at which time he promised to repay the money lost. Some two weeks later Miss McCarthy reported the matter to the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">At about the same time as the incident above related, namely, on March 22, 1939, the defendant obtained $225 from a Mrs. Ida E. Morse for the asserted purpose of purchasing an interest in a gasoline station, which money was also lost in gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>It was claimed by defendant at the trial that the money was obtained from Miss McCarthy as a loan, for which reason it is contended on appeal that the evidence is insufficient to support the judgment. Primarily, it was the function of the trial judge to determine the truth of the defendant\u2019s testimony, in which connection, in all probability, it was no more impressive at the trial than the record reveals it to be on appeal. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the court\u2019s finding of guilt. All of the elements of the crime were fully established.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">It is next contended that the testimony of Mrs. Morse, with regard to the $225 obtained from her, was irrelevant and hence that its admission was error. It is further urged that the district attorney\u2019s effort to establish, by the testimony of Mrs. Morse, that the defendant also resorted to the marriage lure in his transaction with her, amounted to prejudicial misconduct. In that connection the record reveals that the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">Redirect examination by Mr. Blalock, deputy district attorney :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">\u201cQ. Mrs. Morse, did this defendant ever propose marriage to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201cMr. Hamilton (Defendant\u2019s attorney) : Objected to as immaterial, if the Court please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">\u201cA. We didn\u2019t talk things like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. .Blalock) : Did the defendant ever propose marriage to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">\u201cMr. Hamilton: Just a moment. May I have a ruling on my objection? I don't know why we should embarrass this witness or what the materiality of that question is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">\u201cMr. Blalock: Merely further corroboration of the <em>modus operandi </em>of this defendant in securing money from women.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-13\">\u201cMr. Hamilton: I cite the remarks of the district attorney as misconduct. It is an insinuation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-14\">\u201cMr. Blalock: There is no insinuation. I expect to be able to establish that he proposed marriage to Mrs. Morse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-15\">\u201cMr. Plamilton: She answered the question that they didn\u2019t talk about such things, and I don\u2019t think it is material or competent to any issues in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-16\">\u2018\u2018 The Court: It is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-17\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Blalock: Do you recall now, Mrs. Morse, whether this defendant ever proposed marriage to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201cA. Not in any serious way at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201cQ. Well, did be ever propose marriage to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cMr. Hamilton: Just a moment. I object to that. The matter has been answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201cA. I am not going to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">\u201cMr. Blalock: The witness says she is not going to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">\u2018Q. By Mr. Blalock: As a matter of fact, didn\u2019t you say to him, \u2018Well, Bob, don\u2019t be silly. I am old enough to be your grandmother?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">\u201cMr. Hamilton: Just a moment. Now I am going to object to that as an attempt on the part of the district attorney to impeach his own witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">\u201cThe Court: Objection sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">In the circumstances, such evidence was not inadmissible, either with regard to the fact of obtaining the money, or with reference to the evidence sought to be introduced regarding a proposed marriage. The intent in the mind of the defendant at the time he obtained the money from Miss McCarthy was a fact in issue. Evidence of any other facts from which the fact in issue is logically inferable, is relevant. Defendant\u2019s contention, therefore, that the effort to introduce such testimony amounted to prejudicial misconduct is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">There being no errors in the record, the judgment and the order denying the motion for a new trial are, and each of them is, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
