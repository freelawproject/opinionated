She was traveling between 20 and 25 miles an hour about twelve feet from the west curb line of the boulevard. Plaintiff was traveling in the same direction, about a block and a half ahead of said defendant and from two to three feet from the west curb of the boulevard. Both parties retained their respective speeds, traveling in a straight line, until said defendant was approximately 10 feet behind plaintiff, at which time he suddenly turned to his left in front of the ear being operated by defendant Payne, and the left front of the latter\u2019s car struck the rear guard of plaintiff\u2019s bicycle, causing him to fall to the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Plaintiff relies for reversal of the judgment on these propositions <em>:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\n<em>First: There is no substantial evidence to sustain the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the court predicated thereon.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">\n<em>Second: The trial judge committed prejudicial error by his conduct during the trial of the action.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">\n<em>Third: The trial court committed prejudicial error in sustaining objections to evidence offered by plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">\n<em>Fourth: The trial court committed prejudicial error m instructing the jury as follows:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">\n<em>1.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\">\n<em>\u2018\u2018The fact that I instruct you upon the measure of damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover is not to be taken by you as an intimation that I either believe or do not believe he is entitled to recover damages.

The instructions upon the measure of damages are given you to guide you in fixing the damages which plaintiff is entitled to recover only in the event you believe from the evidence and the instructions I have given you that the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The giving of such instructions is no indication that the court believes or does not believe that the plaintiff is entitled to recover. That is a question for your sole and exclusive determination upon the evidence and the instructions which 1 have given you.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\n<em>2.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\n<em>\u201cWhere the operator of a motor vehicle, without negligence on his part is by a sudden emergency placed in a position of imminent peril to himself or to another, without sufficient time in which to determine with certainty the best course to pursue, he is not held to the same accuracy of judgment as is required of him under ordinary circumstances, and is not liable for injuries caused by his machine if an accident occurs, even though a course of action other than that which he pursues might be more judicious, provided he exercises ordinary care in the stress of circumstances to avoid an accident.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\n<em>\u201cTherefore, if you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant MARIE PAYNE in operating her motor vehicle was, without negligence on her part, placed by a sudden emergency in a position of imminent danger or peril without sufficient time in which to determine with certainty the best course to pursue, she would not be held to the same accuracy of judgment as would be required of her under ordinary circumstances and would not be liable for injuries caused by her machine if an accident occurred, even though a course of action other than that which she actually pursued might have been more judicious provided she exercised ordinary care in the stress of circumstances to avoid an accident.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\n<em>3.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">\n<em>\u201cIf, from all the evidence in this case, you find that the defendant Marie Payne was operating her automobile in an ordinary, prudent and careful manner and as an ordinary prudent person under all the circumstances would have operated it, then, regardless of dll other questions, your verdict must be against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendants.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\n<em>4.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>\u201cThe mere happening of an accident raises no presumption of negligence and you must not assume nor find, merely because it is undisputed that an accident occurred in which the plaintiff was injured, that the defendants were negligent or that they are legally responsible for the happening of the accident or the result thereof.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>5.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\n<em>\u201cYou are instructed that as a matter of law no liability attaches where the injury results from what is termed an unavoidable and inevitable accident.

The rule requiring the sounding of a horn before overtaking another vehicle is applicable only to a motor vehicle driven outside of a business or residence district.

An' examination oi the record discloses substantial evidence in connection with the inferences which may be reasonably drawn therefrom to support the facts set forth above and each and every finding of fact upon which the verdict of the jury was necessarily predicated. From the evidence adduced at the trial the jury may have very properly believed that defendant Marie Payne was proceeding in a southerly direction on Harvard Boulevard at a speed of from 20 to 25 miles per hour; that she was proceeding on the right-hand side of the street, while plaintiff was likewise proceeding south on the same boulevard, and that suddenly without any warning, between the intersections and without looking to ascertain if he could proceed in safety, he made a left-hand turn into the path of the automobile being operated by said defendant and that this act constituted negligence on his part which was the sole proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">It is too well settled to need the citation of authority that when an inference can be reasonably deduced from the evidence sustaining a finding of the trial jury, this court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial jury. Further discussion of the evidence is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The second proposition is likewise untenable. Plaintiff complains of the following incidents which occurred during the course of the trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">(1) When the defendant Payne was testifying, under Code of Civil Procedure, section 2055, called by plaintiff and replying in an inaudible voice, the court advised her, \u201cDon\u2019t get nervous. No witness has ever been beaten or kicked in this court so you don\u2019t have to be nervous about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">(2) When said defendant was asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to reply to a question which went unanswered and which she did not state she misunderstood but asked him to repeat it, the court stated to plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cDon\u2019t make it complex. Objection is sustained. Stricken out. I said it is complex.\u201d No objection had been interposed by defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>(3) When plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked defendant Payne, after she had testified that the accident occurred between Pico and Washington on South Harvard and that between the first two streets there was another intersecting street, whether the accident happened between Pico and Venice or Venice and Washington, and defendant\u2019s counsel stated that there was no need to take a lot of time to find out where the accident happened, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggested that it was cross-examination, the purpose of which was not only to determine that fact but to test the witness, the court stated, \u201cI know, but it takes a lot of time\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">(4) When defendant\u2019s counsel stated that there was no issue of where it happened, the court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Let her answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">(5) When plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the defendant Payne to describe the nature of the accident, whether it was a collision between her automobile and the boy, the court stated, \u201cThat is asking a question which, of course, is very, very leading, and not proper cross-examination. If you mean how the accident happened, that is all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\"><em>(6) </em>After defendant Payne testified that she was about a block and a half behind plaintiff when she first saw him plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked her how far plaintiff was behind the point of impact when she first saw him, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201cQ.

Thereupon the following proceedings occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201cQ. Well, anywhere ? A. No. He was right near the bicycle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201cQ. He was not on the bicycle? A. Yes, I believe he was. I am not positive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: That depends on what you mean by \u2018on\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">\u201cQ. By MR.

Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">(8) On plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of defendants\u2019 sole witness, Ripley, the following proceedings took place: \u2018</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-13\">\u201cQ. Where had you started your ride, Mr. Ripley, this morning, the morning that you saw this accident, from your home? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\">\u201cQ. Where did you live? A. I lived at that time on West Adams boulevard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">\u201cQ. You were coming north on South Harvard, is that right? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-16\">\u201cQ. Now, there are stop signals on Washington, are there not? Washington and South Harvard? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-17\">\u201cQ. There were on that date? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-18\">\u201cQ. And did you stop at any buttons or a stop signal before\u2014\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: The objection is sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-20\">(9) During plaintiff\u2019s direct examination the following proceedings took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-21\">\u201cQ. You say you traveled about six feet from the curb line along South Harvard boulevard ? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-22\">\u201cQ. Then you say you began gradually to go into the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-23\">\u201cMR. JORZ: Just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-24\">\u201cTHE COURT: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-25\">\u201cMR. FALCONE: I am repeating what I thought the witness said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: I know you are. It is not necessary. The jury are supposed to be intelligent. I am willing to stipulate that they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cMR. FALCONE: It is a little boy, and I am trying to make it easier for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t like this repetition of testimony by counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">(10) During the examination just referred to the following proceedings also occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">\u201cQ. Can you tell the jury what injury you received, if any, from the impact of the automobile? A. I had a bump on my head and a black eye, some bruises on my arm and leg. I guess that is about all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\u201cQ. Which eye was bruised? A. This one, here (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">\u201cQ. Indicating the left eye? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">\u2018\u2018Q. Eldon, can you tell the jury your mental. condition immediately after the collision with the automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: The objection is sustained. He is not a psychiatrist. He can tell what he felt, what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-14\">\u201cQ. By MR. FALCONE: Eldon, how did you feel after the accident? A. Well, I got tired and had headaches for a while after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-15\">\u201cQ. Do you remember very clearly, Eldon, what happened the next two or three days? A. No, I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">(11) During the direct examination of Dr. Alphonse I. Wray, an expert witness for plaintiff, the following proceedings occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-17\">\u201cQ. Did you find any injury to his head other than the black eye? A. I couldn\u2019t positively tell, because in cases of that nature where we get\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you find anything the matter with his head ? A. I found that left area surrounding the eye and the head had been considerably swollen, sir, and deep bleeding which we call ecchymosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-19\">\u2018\u2018Q. Did you or did you not, Doctor, find any injury to the brain, any brain condition ? A. That I could not determine. I made X-rays in order\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-20\">\u201cMR. JORZ: I don\u2019t want to interrupt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: You have already answered. You say you do not know. A. My diagnosis was concussion of the brain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(12) Again, during the examination of Doctor Wray, the following proceedings occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cQ. Would the fact that these X-rays were negative to you, that is you read them negatively, eliminate the possibility of any injury to his brain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cMR JORZ: Object to that upon the ground that is asking for a possibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u2018\u2018 THE COURT -. The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u2018\u2018Q. By MR. FALCONE: Doctor, would the X-ray reveal all injuries to the brain ? A. Not even would it reveal fractures. You can take these X-rays and they very frequently do not reveal even fractures when there is a fracture at the base of the skull.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201cMR. JORZ: Pardon me, if the court please. The doctor testified that his X-rays disclose nothing. I submit to indulge in a lot of speculation is misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">\u2018\u2018 THE COURT: There is no question about that. That is pure speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">\u201cQ. By MR. FALCONE: Doctor, as I understand you, you treated Eldon the first time for something else in December, 1936, is that right? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">\u201cQ. You had him more or less under your professional care ever since? A. I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">\u201cQ. You are familiar with his case history ? A. I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">\u201cQ. You are familiar with the type of brain tumor he was operated on for? A. I saw him immediately afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-15\">\u201cQ. Doctor, with your knowledge of Eldon\u2019s case, with your knowledge of his physical condition, with your knowledge of the examination you have conducted of Eldon, the findings you made from the examination, and the treatment you have prescribed for him as a result thereof, have you or have you not an opinion as to the probable consequence reasonable to ensue from that traumatic injury that he suffered on February 4th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-17\">\u201cQ. By MR. FALCONE: Doctor, did you or did you not form an opinion, based upon your observations of Eldon\u2019s condition, February 4, 1938, to-wit: ecchymosis and bruises on his body, injuries to his limb and to his finger, and your diagnosis of brain concussion, and based upon your knowledge of the history of the ease, particularly with reference to the brain tumor surgery, as to whether or not the brain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tumor condition was aggravated by the conditions you found on February 4, 1938?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">(13) Again, daring the same examination, this occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cQ. Doctor, in your opinion is Eldon at the present time cured of any of those conditions which you found on February 4, 1938 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">HR. JORZ: I object to the form of the question as indefinite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u2018 \u2018 THE COURT: The objection is sustained. He said he had bruises on the arm, leg, ecchymosis to the eye, a bump on the forehead, the eye was closed, and he indicated cold applications. I can tell you what he said then. Do you want to base something else on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">\u201cQ. By MR. FALCONE: Doctor, how long would it take to determine whether or not the conditions which Eldon suffered from February 4, 1938, and the causes thereof had any effect on his brain, particularly with reference to the brain tumor ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: He answered that. He said not any. He just answered. He said it would not have any. He said there was no metastasis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">\u201cMR. FALCONE: He answered some time ago that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: He has answered. He said no metastasis, which means it was not disturbed, nothing done, just the same as it was before. That is correct. That is what you said, is it not? A. I answered one question for one thing and I did not answer the other question. If I am permitted to answer the question put before me, if Your Honor will permit it, I will be very glad to answer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think you have already answered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-14\">\u201cMR. PIERCE: The doctor\u2019s statement was that there had been no metastasis. He did not state that would be the only possible and probable result of this injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-15\">\u201cMR. JORZ: \u201cI object to any possibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: To the possibility the objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-17\">\u201cMR. FALCONE: Well, probabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: What is your prognosis? I will ask him that one question. A. My prognosis of this case is guarded; as I stated in the early part of the examination, that when a child or any person is subjected to a concussion of the brain, that your results are not determined within a few days or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>few hours; that it may extend of a period of time of a year\u2014 from a few days to a year or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cMR. JORZ: I ask that that be stricken out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: That is stricken out as not responsive to any question, a lecture on the subject, and not answering the question. Now you may ask your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cMR. FALCONE: I will ask to repeat Your Honor\u2019s question: what his prognosis of the patient was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: That is what you are trying to get. I think he is entitled to answer it, if he will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cQ. By MR. FALCONE: Doctor will you give the court and the jury to the best of your ability what your professional prognosis was of the boy? A. I have stated that was guarded; that I could not say what the results would be from the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: He says he can\u2019t say. That answers your question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">\u201cREDIRECT EXAMINATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">\u201cBy MR. FALCONE: Q. Doctor, is the amount of $125 a reasonable value of the services that you rendered Eldon since February 4, 1938 ? A. It is not excessive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">\u201cMR. FALCONE: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: He did not ask you that. Would you repeat the question ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">\u201cMR. FALCONE: The Court, doctor, stated that your answer was not responsive. A. Yes, repeat the question. (The last question was read by the reporter.) A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">(14) During the direct examination of Dr. Leo J. Adelstein, an expert witness for plaintiff, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-17\">\u201cQ. By MR. FALCONE: Doctor, based upon your knowledge of Eldon\u2019s- condition, particularly your examination of him, your findings, to wit, that he was sick and vomited, was obliged to and did lie on his back most of the time, your examination of his eye grounds, your diagnosis of the presence of some pressure, some pressure from a tumor of the brain, particularly of the pineal gland; based upon your surgery of that brain condition, and your observation and treatment and care of Eldon was thereafter post-operatively; assume that Eldon was involved in an accident in which he was thrown from a bicycle, and thrown to the pavement, bumped his head against the pavement and suffered a brain concussion in the left frontal area of his head which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>was discolored, that he had ecchymosis and swelling of the eye, closing of his left eye, what in your opinion would be the effect of those traumatic injuries that he suffered in that accident upon the condition of his brain? A. I would say the likelihood would be that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cMR. JORZ: I object to the \u2018likelihood\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2018Likelihood\u2019 does not mean anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cA. In my opinion he would suffer an aggravation of the previous condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201c Q. By MR. FALCONE: Doctor, would that aggravation necessarily manifest itself in a year or six months ? A. It usually does within six months to a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201cQ. Does it ever manifest itself after a year? A. Well, ordinarily not, although that is possible; but it usually manifests itself sooner than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">\u201cMR. JORZ: I will ask that that be stricken out and the jury instructed to disregard possibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes. Stricken out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">The errors which plaintiff predicates upon the foregoing incidents will not be considered by this court for the reason that plaintiff did not lay the proper foundation in the trial court for review here. Unless the harmful result of the alleged misconduct of the trial judge cannot be obviated by appropriate instructions of the trial court, error cannot be predicated in' this court on such alleged misconduct in the absence of (a) assignment of such misconduct as error, and (b) a request to the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard it. <em>(Sitkei </em>v. <em>Ralphs Grocery Co., </em>25 Cal. App. (2d) 294, 296 [77 Pac. (2d) 311].) In the instant case plaintiff did not assign the trial judge\u2019s alleged misconduct as error, nor did he request him to instruct the jury to disregard such alleged misconduct, although the harm thereof, if any, might well have been obviated by appropriate instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">The third proposition is without merit. The court\u2019s rulings on objections and on its own motion to questions asked witnesses were proper or in no way prejudicial to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">The instructions set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of plaintiff\u2019s fourth proposition are correct statements of the principles of law contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The instructions contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 of plaintiff\u2019s fourth proposition are correct statements of the principles of law contained therein. <em>(Zohner </em>v. <em>Sierra Nevada etc. Co., </em>114 Cal. App. 85, 90 [299 Pac. 749] ; <em>Sitkei </em>v. <em>Ralphs Grocery Store, supra, </em>at 296.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The instructions contained in paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 of plaintiff\u2019s fourth proposition are all correct statements of the principles of law incorporated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The trial court did not commit error in refusing plaintiff\u2019s instructions A and B, set forth in plaintiff\u2019s fifth proposition, for the reason that the law is established in California that if a jury under proper instructions returns a general verdict in favor of the defendant in a negligence action, error may not be predicated upon the refusal to give or the giving of erroneous instructions relative to the issue of damages. <em>(Hurd </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>49 Cal. App. 361, 363 [193 Pac. 507] ; <em>De La Torre </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>203 Cal. 374, 378 [264 Pac. 485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The rules of law in the instructions set forth in paragraphs C, D, and N of plaintiff\u2019s fifth proposition were fully covered by instructions given to the jury, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cYou are instructed that the drivers of automobiles have no special right or privilege in the use or enjoyment of the public highways \u00a7,nd streets of this state; the law indeed imposes upon them a degree of care commensurate with the peculiar hazard attending the operation of said automobiles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">\u201cYou are instructed that negligence is the failure to fulfill a legal duty to exercise the proper degree of care whereby injury accrues to a party to whom the duty is owed; it consists of the omission to do something which an ordinarily prudent and reasonable person would have done under given circumstances, or in doing something which an ordinarily prudent and reasonable person would not have done under given circumstances; it is the failure to exercise ordinary care under given circumstances; it is not absolute or to be measured in all cases in accordance with some precise standard, but always relates to some circumstances of time, place, and person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">\u201cYou are instructed that the California Vehicle Code, section 510 thereof, in force and effect at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>accident involved in this case, provided: \u2018No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201cYou are instructed that bicycle riders on the public highways and streets of this state have the same rights as automobile drivers to the use of said public highways and streets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The instructions set forth in paragraphs H, I, M, O, P, and Q of plaintiff\u2019s fifth proposition were correctly refused, in view of the fact that they assume that the accident was a rear-end collision, which is contrary to the implied finding of the jury which is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The instructions set forth in paragraphs E and G of plaintiff\u2019s fifth proposition were properly refused, because the substance of the instructions was given to the jury in other instructions read by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Plaintiff has failed to point out wherein the failure to give instructions F and R in his fifth proposition resulted in prejudice to him. Therefore the alleged error predicated upon the refusal to give such instructions must be disregarded by us. (Const., art. VI, sec. 4\u00bd.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The substance of the law as set forth in the instructions in paragraphs J, K, and L of plaintiff\u2019s fifth proposition was given to the jury when the trial court instructed it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">\u201cYou are instructed that chapter VII, section 671b, of the Vehicle Code, which pertains to the requirements of sounding a horn on a motor vehicle, does not require the use of a horn in passing if a vehicle intends to pass another vehicle under any and all circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">\u201cTherefore, the question of sounding the horn is a matter which is left to the sound judgment of the operator of the motor vehicle in the exercise of ordinary care. The Vehicle Code leaves the question of sounding the horn up to the driver and requires the sounding of a horn when reasonably necessary to insure safe operation. The horn shall not otherwise be used in a business or residence district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201cHowever, there is no evidence in this case establishing the locality of the accident as being in a residence or business district. The rule requiring the sounding of a horn before overtaking another vehicle is applicable only to a motor vehicle driven outside of a business or residence district. Therefore, the failure upon the part of defendant Marie Payne to sound a horn immediately prior to the happening of the accident does not constitute negligence as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Wood, Acting P. J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on February 26, 1940. Carter, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
