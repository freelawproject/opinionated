The minute orders entered did not specify that the motions for new trials were granted on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdicts. February 21, 1939, appellant appealed from the foregoing order. Thereafter on July 12, 1939, the trial court made the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cIn the Superior Court op the State op California in and for the County op Los Angeles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">\u201cJoe Snyder and Belle Snyder, Plaintiffs,\"'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">v.

Dockweiler</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiD\">Judge, Superior Court\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">It is to have the foregoing order of the trial court, which is applicable to both of the above-entitled cases, made a part of the record in this court that respondents make their motion for a diminution of the record. No valid reason has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>been urged by appellant in opposition to this motion. It appears to us that it should therefore be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal is predicated upon the rule of law that, where a motion for new trial is granted upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, an appellate court will not disturb the ruling of the trial court if the record discloses a conflict in the evidence, and an appeal from the order granting a new trial will under such circumstances be dismissed by the appellate court. <em>(Robbins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>9 Cal. App. (2d) 580, 583 [50 Pac. (2d) 826].) Applying the foregoing rule to the facts of the instant case, it appears that the trial court granted the motions for new trials on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdicts; and it further appears that there is a substantial conflict in the evidence. Therefore, respondents\u2019 motion should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">For the foregoing reasons the motions (1) for a diminution of the record and (2) to dismiss the appeal are and each is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Moore, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
