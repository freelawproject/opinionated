At the present time buyers are indebted to seller for the unpaid purchase price of said business in the sum of $22,183.98, plus interest from the 1st day of September, 1938, at 7% per annum. Notwithstanding the monthly payments required to be made by said original agreement, the buyers shall pay to seller the following monthly installments beginning with the 30th day of September, 1938, and up to and including the installment due January 31, 1939;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cThe sum of $500.00 per month, less the sums which the buyers are required to pay on the promissory note in the particular month as referred to in paragraph 2, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cThe net amount of said $500.00 payment shall be then applied first to the interest due, and the remainder to principal on the unpaid balance of said original agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201c4.

(Said inventory must be completed by buyers within ten days after the close of the six months\u2019 period.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201c(b) Should the financial statement show that the business for the six months\u2019 period ending February 1, 1939, was carried on at an operating profit, then this amended agreement shall automatically continue for an extended period of six months from February 1, 1939, and the payments to be made to seller shall be at the same rate provided for the first six months\u2019 period as above specified plus an amount equal to the interest on said promissory note for the particular months.

The escrow holder shall be authorized to comply with the said notice from the buyers by delivering the bill of sale and other title papers to the seller and by delivering to the buyers the release. This privilege to surrender the business accorded the buyers shall be a joint one, and can only be exercised by the buyers jointly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cIn the event that one of the buyers withdraws from the operation of said business during the existence of this amended agreement, then the seller shall have the immediate right of repossession, and written notice to the escrow holder by the seller that one of said buyers has withdrawn from the business shall be sufficient authority for said escrow holder to immediately deliver to the seller the bill of sale and other papers covering said business, and to deliver to the buyers the releases hereinbefore referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c9.

Sarah Berger, wife of Herman Berger, and Mabel Selig, wife of Harry Selig, join in the execution hereof for the purpose of consenting to the provisions hereof and binding whatever interests they have in buyers\u2019 business under the Community Property Laws of the State of California, and Eunice D. Cline joins in the execution hereof for the purpose of consenting to the provisions hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u201cIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands the day and year hereinabove first set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cChas.

April 5, 1939, defendants\u2019 motion to dissolve the attachment, on the ground that the note was secured by a mortgage and lien upon property of the defendants, in virtue of the agreement herein-above set forth, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">This is the sole question to be determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\n<em>Did the agreement above set forth constitute a mortgage or lien upon personal property of defendants within the purview of section 537, subdivision 1, of the Code of Civil Procediere, so as to prevent the issuance of a ivrit of attachment f</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">This question must be answered in the negative. A reading of the agreement fails to disclose any provision providing that upon defendants\u2019 failure to pay any installment or to pay the sum due on the promissory note plaintiff would have any right under the terms of the contract to repossess himself of the property referred to in the agreement. Paragraph 6 of the agreement contains the only condition upon which the plaintiff would have the right to repossess himself of the properties described in the agreement, that condition being that, should defendants operate the business at a loss, then plaintiff might take possession of the properties. The agreement in no way provides a security or lien for the enforcement of the promissory note set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">For the foregoing reasons the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">Moore, P.
