In the laws of 1853 it is stated in the form I have quoted; while in Swan <em>&amp; </em>Critehfield it is \u201c that he has a legal estate therein,\u201d instead of a real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The motion will, therefore, be overruled, and leave given to answer in ten days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
