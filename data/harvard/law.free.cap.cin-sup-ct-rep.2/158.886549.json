The plaintiff* is not in privity with the city, and can not in any way, that I can discover, directly avail himself of this bond which is to the city only.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">The demurrer will therefore be sustained as to Long and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Eiedeldey, and the plaintiff may have ten days to elect whether lie will pursue Ryan &amp; Co., or the city, and the other party will then be stricken out.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
