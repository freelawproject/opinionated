The last-named section provides that advertisements for bills for improvements shall be advertised in some newspaper of general circulation in said corporation, and in two, if there are so many.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Dy section 8 of the same code, very general and comprehensive powers are given to municipal corporations, \u201cembracing authority to contract and be contracted with, to acquire, hold, and possess property, real and personal,\u201d etc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>This general grant of power is express, and operates to confer authority to make contracts in regard to matters properly pertaining to the carrying on of the municipal government, except so far as that authority is limited by other provisions of the municipal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">If, then, there were no provisions whatever as to the publication of the ordinances of the city, I know of no restriction in the statute by which it would be unlawful lor the city government to cause such publications to be made in such manner as the city council should deem to be expedient.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Does, then, the language of section 100 of the municipal code expressly or impliedly limit the power of the city council in that particular? It requires that the ordinances shall he published in some newspaper of general circulation in the corporation. But it does not expressly, nor impliedly, say that that is all the publication that shall be permitted or procured. Nor is there any such limitation of power expressed or implied in section 562 of the municipal code. That section requires the publication of the notice of all improvements to be contracted for in some newspaper of general circulation, and in two if there are so many in the corporation. There is no language of restriction in either section. The council have as much power to publish as it would have had under, the general powers in section 8, if there had been no provisions like that in section 100. \u2019 It may give such additional publicity to an ordinance as it may deem expedient, and it may employ other means .than newspapers, in general circulation, if in its discretion such other means are deemed useful. It may publish in a-newspaper'which is printed in the German language; but the publication must be made in at least one paper of general circulation in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">I.t is not denied in the petition that the Cincinnati <em>Daily Times </em>is a newspaper in general circulation. It is denied, however, that the <em>Courier </em>is such a newspaper. In the view which I take of this provision of the statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Times </em>being admitted to be a newspaper in general circulation, the publication in that paper complies with the requisition of the statute, and it is not material that the <em>Courier </em>should be a paper in general circulation; and the allegation that it is not, is not a ground for the interference of the court with the discretion exercised by the city council in this particular. The general allegation that such publication is useless and a waste of money, being in relation to a matter entirely within the discretion of the city council, and not in violation of any law, does not change the rule we adopt at all. If the council should proceed to make a contract for an improvement without publishing the required notice, the court might interefere, as there would be a violation of law, and the act would be <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">But I do not see that the petition makes a case for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The motion for an injunction must be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
