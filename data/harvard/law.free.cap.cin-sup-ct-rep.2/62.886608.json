Auburn Street Railway Company for a period of fourteen months at $150 per month. The petition does not allege that the services were rendered at defendant\u2019s request, and this omission is made the ground of a special demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">This would not be a good <em>indebitatus </em>count before the Code, nor is it sufficient now. Every fact which the plaintiff must prove to enable him to maintain his action, and which the defendant has a right to controvert in the answer, must be stated. It must appear that the defendant either actually requested the services rendered or did that which would amount to a request. It can not be said that there is justly due and owing to the plaintiff the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>claimed (which is a conclusion of law) unless the services were rendered on request or what is tantamount. This would then be a contract by which the party is bound.</p>\n<p id=\"A0n\">Demurrer sustained and leave to amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
