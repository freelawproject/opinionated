In March, 1869, defendant was discharged in bankruptcy from all debts existing on the 17th of September, 1868. Subsequently, the defendant\u2019s wife devised to him a piece of property in this county, upon which plaintiff' levied an execution six days after defendant\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The plaintiff averred that this property belonged to the defendant at the time the debt was incurred; that it was fraudulently transferred to defendant\u2019s wife, and that the process by which it reached the defendant was fraudulent and void, and therefore he had a right to subject it to the payment of his debt. The defendant claimed the discharge was regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The court held the issue was one which ought not to be tried on a motion. The plaintiff was prosecuting his claim and had made a levy. <em>Prima facie, </em>the defendant was entitled to have the motion granted. 3 Barb. 360; 1 Id. 273, 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">To entitle the plaintiff to prosecute his remedy, it was not sufficient that he should content himself with a levy of his execution, when the judgment had been satisfied, for aught that appeared of record^ by the discharge in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
