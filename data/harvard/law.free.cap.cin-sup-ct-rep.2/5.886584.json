He was acting strictly within the order of reference to which both parties consented, thereby waiving their right of trial by jwy-</p>\n<p id=\"b13-13\">Nor does it appear to be right to allow either party to try the issues before the master, and then allow them to speculate on the result of another trial on the same issues to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-14\">Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
