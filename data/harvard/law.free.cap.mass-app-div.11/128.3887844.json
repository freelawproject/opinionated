The trial court found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cI find that the plaintiff was at the time of the commencement of this action and had been for about thirteen years a permanent member of the regular police force of the Town of Arlington, and I find that as such he was a member of the defendant corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\">\u201cI find that sometime in the month of September 1940, the plaintiff was disabled from the performance of his duties as a police officer by reason of an accident sustained in the performance of his duty as a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">\u201cI find that on August 28,1942, the plaintiff procured a leave of absence from the police force of the Town of Arlington and enlisted in the United States Coast Guard, where he served as a Chief Petty Officer until July 17, 1943, and I further find that on or about September 10, 1942 the plaintiff sustained an injury while a member of the United States Coast Guard which disabled him from the performance of his duties as a member of the Coast Guard, and as a result on July 17,1943 he received an honorable discharge from the Coast Guard under the following conditions,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\u2018Physical disability, existing prior to enlistment, ordinary discharge under honorable conditions. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cI find that the plaintiff immediately thereafter applied for re-instatement as a member of the regular police force of the Town of Arlington and that after an examination by Dr. Edward W. Feeley, on behalf of the Town of Arlington, the plaintiff was re-instated as a member of the regular police force of the Town of Arlington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201cI find that the plaintiff did not disclose to Doctor Feeley upon his examination the accident which occurred to him while a member of the Coast Guard, for the reason as given by the plaintiff that had he done so he might not have been re-instated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201cI find that several times between July 27, 1943 and October 24, 1943 the plaintiff was disabled from performing his full duty as a member of the Arlington police force by reason of the injury to his bach which he originally sustained in September 1940 and which was aggravated by reason of the injury he received on or about September 10,1942 and that during such time as he was disabled he received disability benefits from the defendant corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>\u201cI </em>find that during a period from August 1943 <em>to </em>December 1944 that the plaintiff in addition to carrying on Ms duties as a regular member of the Arlington police force worked at various periods outside the time he was engaged as a police officer for private concerns, to wit: as a truck driver, as a guard and as a machine operator, but that he performed no such work during-any of the time in which he claimed to have been disabled and during which he received or sought disability benefits from the defendant corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-3\"><em>\u201cI </em>find that fr.om October 25, 1944 to December 7, 1944, the plaintiff was prevented from performing his full duties as a regular member of the Arlington police force, by reason of the disability above mentioned and that for three days of this period he received disability benefits from the defendant. For twenty-two days he was paid directly by the Town of Arlington under a regulation of the Town, which provided that the Town pay police officers for sick leave for not more than 30 days in any 12 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">\u201cI find that during the period of his disability he was treated at various times by Dr. Edward W. Feeley, a qualified physician in the Town of Arlington, who diagnosed his condition as a sacroiliac strain, Avith spasmodic incapacity, temporary in nature, and that during such period his condition Avas such as to incapacitate him from performing his full duties as a regular member of the Arlington police force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201cI find that there were nineteen days during the months of Noxmniber and December of 1944 during-which the plaintiff was disabled from performing his full duties as a police officer in the Toavii of Arlington for Avhich he received no compensation from any source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201cI find that on October 28, 1944 the plaintiff made application to the Selectmen of the Toavii of Arlington for a pension on account of his inability to perform the full duties of a regular police officer in the Town of Arlington and that in consequence of such application the plaintiff Avas examined by Dr. B.

I also feel that a low back brace would give him considerable support. I see no reason why he cannot carry on with some of his police duties. \u2019 \u201cI find that on December 7, 1944 the Chief of Police of the Town of A rlington ordered the plaintiff to report for duty at 12:45 A. M. on December 8, 1944 and that the plaintiff did report for duty and since that time he has been performing some of his duties as a police officer in the Town of Arlington, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">\u201cHe has been stationed at the desk inside of the police station house in Arlington, but he has not been performing his full duties as a police officer in the Town of Arlington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201cI find that at no time prior to December 8,1944 the plaintiff ever requested he be given light work as a police officer or be relieved from performing his full duties as a police officer in the Town of Arlington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201cI find that on November 20, 1944 the plaintiff made application to the defendant corporation for disability benefits under the provisions of the by-laws of the defendant corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201cI find that the by-laws of the defendant corporation provided as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">\u2018ARTICLE II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_c\">Membership</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">\u2018The Association shall be composed of those persons only who are attached, either permanently or for the statutory probationary period, to the regular police force of the Town of Arlington, and of those who have been retired under the pension law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">\u2018 Section 2.

As a matter of law there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding for the plaintiff. 2. As a matter of law the legal relationship between the plaintiff and defendant is one of contract. <em>Goldman vs. Commercial Travelers, </em>302 Mass. 74. 3. As a matter of law the defendant is an insurer. <em>Peters et al. vs. Companions of the Forest, </em>303 Mass. 70. 4. As a matter of law the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is an action for damage for breach of contract. <em>Cargelon vs. Commercial Trav., </em>184 Mass. 8. 5. As a matter of law the plaintiff is a member of a beneficiary association and has a contractual right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>which does not depend entirely on association\u2019s by-laws. <em>Goldman vs. Commercial Trav., </em>302 Mass. 74. 6. As a matter of law any ambiguity appearing in the constitution and by-laws must be resolved in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Peters, et al. vs. Companions of the Forest, </em>303 Mass. 70. 7. As a matter of law an inconsistency in the constitution or by-laws must be resolved in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Peters, et al. vs. Companions of the Forest, </em>303 Mass. 70. 8. As a matter of law the purpose of Article III as contained in the by-laws of the defendant corporation cannot be modified by a mere directory clause in the constitution or by-laws. 9. As a matter of law the decision of the executive board is not final nor binding upon the plaintiff. <em>Goldman vs. Commercial Trav., </em>302 Mass. 74. 10. As a matter of law the constitution and by-laws of the defendant corporation must be strictly interpreted in the light of the natural meaning of the language used. 11. As a matter of law nothing may be added or detracted from the clear and unequivocal terms of the constitution and by-laws. 12. As a matter of law the \u2018good faith\u2019 of the executive board is not a part of the constitution and by-laws of the corporation. 13. As a matter of law a denial of a claim of disability predicated on beliefs or opinion and without actual knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s physical condition cannot be sustained. 14. As a matter of law the word \u2018shall\u2019 as used is mandatory, calling* for an imperative and unescapable obligation. <em>(In re </em>Opinion of Justices of Supreme Court, 300 Mass. 591.) 15. As a matter of law the word \u2018shall\u2019 as used in Article XI, Section 2 of the constitution and by-laws of the defendant corporation is mandatory. 16. As a matter of law interpretation of doubtful and ambiguous by-laws must be made in the light of past conduct of those charged with administration of the same to which great weight must be given before they are disturbed. <em>Modern Finance Co. vs. Holz, </em>29 N. E. (2nd) 922. 17. As a matter of law uncontradicted evidence upon a vital issue should not be disregarded without grave consideration. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Eelative to the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings, the court acted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>As to No. 1, I rule that the evidence warrants but does not require a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">I gives Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,10, 11,14,15,16 and 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">I deny Nos. 5, 8, 9 and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">I deny No. 12 because while \u20181 good faith\u201d of the Executive Board is not a part of the statute and by-laws of the defendant corporation, I rule that the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the Executive Board in denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for benefits may be taken into consideration in passing upon the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The Court found for the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANq\">\u201cThe Court being in doubt, as a matter of law, as to whether or not a-finding should be entered for the defendant, I hereby report the same to the Appellate Division for final determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201cIf as a matter of law, the Appellate Division should find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then I find that the plaintiff has sustained damages in the sum of One Hundred Fourteen (114) Dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The fundamental issue in this case is as to whether the relationship between the parties is one whereby the defendant is an insurer or whether the relationship is one whereby the plaintiff is a member of a voluntary association and bound by the various restrictions as laid down in <em>Richards vs. Morrison et al., </em>229 Mass. 458 at 460; <em>Dittemore vs. Dickey, </em>249 Mass. 95; <em>Snay vs. Lovely, </em>276 Mass. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">In <em>Commonwealth vs. Wetherbee, </em>105 Mass. 149, the court says at page 160, \u201cA contract of insurance is an agreement, by which one party, for a consideration, (which is usually paid in money, ** **) promises to make a certain payment of money upon the destruction or injury of something in which the other party has an interest. In fire insurance and in marine insurance the thing insured is property; in life or accident insurance, it is the life or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>health of a person.\u201d See also <em>Peters vs. Companions of the Forest of America, </em>303 Mass. 70, where- the contract was construed as one of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">An -analysis of the provisions of the agreement between the parties leads to conclusion that the agreement was a \u25a0contract of insurance. Contracts with social organizations and other corporations not insurers differ fundamentally from the insurance case. In the former type of case as illustrated by <em>Richards vs. Morrison, </em>229 Mass. 459 at 460 and 461, the court said, \u201cThe decision of the organization and its officers acting in good faith in accordance with the rules on that subject is the final tribunal. There is no \u25a0general appeal to the court.\u201d See also <em>Dittemore vs. Dickey, </em>249 Mass. 95 at 108 and 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">However, on the other hand, if we hav-e a -contract of insurance, then as was said in <em>Goldman vs. Commercial Trav., Assoc., </em>302 Mass. 74 at 79, \u201cThe final determination of the plaintiff\u2019s rights did not rest solely upon the decision of the board. The directors wrere required to act fairly and impartially in passing upon the plaintiff\u2019s- claim, and, if acting as reasonable men in the proper and faithful discharge of -their duties, they were honestly and reasonably unable to come to any conclusion other than that they were not satisfied that the plaintiff had presented a claim within the certificate, then they were justified in rejecting his claim.\u201d See also <em>Noyes vs. Eastern Accident Assoc., </em>190 Mass. 171; <em>Traiser vs. Commercial Trav., Assoc., </em>202 Mass. 292; <em>Page vs. Commercial Trav., Assoc., </em>225 Mass. 335 at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The trial judge has found that the directors have acted without malice and impartially. That of itself does not mean that they could not have acted unreasonably. The burden on the board of acting reasonably -and impartially is subject to review by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The plaintiff has filed various requests for rulings of laiw. Of these the trial judge has denied, requests Nos. 5, 8, 9 and 13. These requests in substance directed the court\u2019s attention to the law as laid down in the <em>Goldman </em>case above tiled. Under the law in this case, the hoard of directors had not the arbitrary right of disposition which is a feature of the pure association contract. The trial judge did not find that the directors were honestly and reasonably unable to come to any conclusion other than they were not satisfied that the plaintiff had presented a claim within the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">The court has found that the directors acted without malice and impartially. Whether or not that covers the \u2018situation is debatable. It would seem that the plaintiff is entitled to have his case tried in accordance with the law in the <em>Goldman </em>case. Therefore it would not appear that the findings of the judge satisfy <em>Bresnick vs. Heath, </em>292 Mass. 293 at 297, 298, nor <em>Himmelfarb vs. Novadel Agene Corporation, </em>305 Mass. 445. In short the trial judge\u2019s findings of specific facts do not cure the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Therefore the finding for the defendant is vacated, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
