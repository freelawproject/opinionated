Code, ch. 134, <em>l </em>31, p. 536, 7. The indictment charged that the defendant did wilfully, corruptly and falsely swear that the schedule contained to the best of his knowledge and remembrance, a full account of all his estate and such debts as were owing to him, when in truth certain debts owing to him (which were described in the indictment) \u201cwere not embraced or included in '\u00abthe said schedule so subscribed and delivered by the said Cook, and the said Cook then and there well knew and remembered that the said schedule did not contain the said debts.\u201d But there was no averment that the defendant knew or remembered that the debts omitted in the schedule were owing to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-23\">The defendant demurred to the indictment: whereupon, with his consent, the court adjourned to this court the question, What judgment ought to be given upon the demurrer?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-24\">A written argument of the case was submitted by R.

The court is therefore of opinion and doth decide, that the demurrer to the indictment ought to be sustained. _</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
