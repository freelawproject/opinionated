Memorandum: The record does not support the contention that County Court imposed a more severe sentence than defendant bargained for when he pleaded guilty. The court honored its promise not to impose the maximum sentence of 81/s to 25 years, and no other commitment with respect to sentencing was made. Upon our review of the record, we conclude that \"the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of [the] case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation,\u201d establish that defendant\u2019s attorney provided meaningful representation <em>(People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147). The sentence is not unduly harsh or severe. We have examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without merit.
