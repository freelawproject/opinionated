ARC acts as an intermediary between participating airlines and travel agents. Specifically, the air carriers execute a carrier services agreement with ARC authorizing it to enter into contracts with travel agents on the carriers\u2019 and ARC\u2019s behalf. ARC then provides blank traffic documents to the travel agents which are sold to customers and honored by the carriers. Each week the travel agents are required to report the amount of ticket sales to ARC and deposit the proceeds in an account which ARC forwards to the carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The defendant, S and N Travel, Inc., doing business as Superior Travel (hereinafter S and N), allegedly breached its agreement with ARC by failing to remit funds that were owed to the carriers. Initially, ARC commenced suit in Federal court, where it was dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction <em>(see, Airlines Reporting Corp. v S &amp; N Travel, </em>857 F Supp 1043, <em>affd </em>58 F3d 857). Subsequently, ARC brought this action, again in its own name, against S and N and the latter\u2019s officers and shareholders, seeking to collect in excess of $100,000, which ARC claims is owed under the Agent Reporting Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The Supreme Court correctly held that ARC was a real party in interest so that it could maintain this action in its own name <em>(see, </em>CPLR 1004). \"As between a principal and agent, an agent may bring the action: '(1) when the contract was made in the agent\u2019s name * * * or (3) when the defendant has acknowledged that the plaintiff possesses a general agency authorizing him to act in all matters\u2019 \u201d <em>(College Mgt. Co. v Belcher Oil Co., </em>159 AD2d 339, 341, quoting 2 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 1004.12; <em>see, Watts v Phillips-Jones Corp., </em>211 App Div 523, 529, <em>affd </em>242 NY 557). At bar, ARC was a person \"with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another\u201d within the meaning of CPLR 1004 <em>(see also, </em>General Construction Law \u00a7 37). Moreover, the customs and dealings of the parties indicate that ARC was acknowledged by the defendants as the carriers\u2019 general agent. Thus, the trial court did not err in holding that ARC was the real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The defendants\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Mangano, P. J., O\u2019Brien, Thompson and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
