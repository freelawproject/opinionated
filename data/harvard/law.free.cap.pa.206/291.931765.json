It is further agreed if an injunction issue the bail shall be $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-8\">2. The plaintiff is the owner in fee of a lot of land situated on the south side of the Main street, hi the city of Bradford, and having erected thereon a two-story double boarded building, twenty feet wide in front on Main street and extending back eighty feet. This building rests on stone piers and has wooden sills and floors, and a wooden ceiling, and shingle roof, and the outsides of the building covered with wooden siding. It was constructed about twenty years ago, and has become somewhat decayed, and needed new sills, new first floor, and the ceiling needed strengthening by new joists,- \u2014 it needed a new roof and required painting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-9\">8. The'plaintiff made a parol contract with FrankS. Slattery to make the following repairs upon said building: To put in new joists and sills for the first floor, and a new floor, a new steel ceiling,' a new galvanized iron front and galvanized bay window, to raise the building by splicing at the bottom next to the sills, two feet and six inches, so that the storeroom on the first floor would be two feet, six inches higher than at present, to paper the building upstairs and paint it and put on new shingles or slate roof and to put in new piers for the foundation if it was found that they were needed. No changes were to be made in the external sides of the building, the walls were to remain outside as they were except the raising of the same two feet six inches. The building was nob to be widened or lengthened, the back room upstairs was to be made into a kitchen. The external appearance of the building was to remain the same except the galvanized iron front.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>4. The plaintiff\u2019s lot and building is within the fire limits of the city of Bradford and is covered by ordinance of the city of Bradford No. 907, the material part of which so far as this case is concerned is as follows: \u201c Within which no building shall hereafter be constructed or reconstructed except of brick, stone, iron or other incombustible material,\u201d etc. This ordinance is authorized and is in accordance with the act of assembly approved May 23,1889, art. 5, sec. 3, cl. XL, p. 277, as amended by the act of assembly of May 16, 1901, sec. 14, p. 224.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">5. That plaintiff being about to have the repairs mentioned above made upon his building was stopped by the city authorities on the ground that what he was doing was reconstruction of his wooden building, and was therefore in violation of the said ordinance and the acts of assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">6.

That the work which the plaintiff had undertaken to perform upon building No. 28 Main street, in the city of Bradford, is a construction or reconstruction of a building, such as is prohibited by said ordinance No. 907, of the city of Bradford, approved November 26,1901.

Words of a statute, unless in some way controlled by the context, are to be considered in the ordinary and popular acceptation of the terms used. Statutes or ordinances thereunder in derogation of the common-law right of the citizen and depriving him of his common-law right to use and enjoy his property are to be considered most strictly against the public and in favor of the citizen. Penal statutes or ordinances, or ordinances and statutes penal in their character, are to be considered most strictly against the public and in favor of the citizen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-4\">Now let us look at the meaning of the words \u201c construct \u201d and \u201c reconstruct.\u201d Webster says \u2014 construct: to put together, in their proper place and order, the constituent parts of, to build, to form, as to construct an edifice, \u201c to build.\u201d Reconstruct : to construct again, to rebuild, to form again or anew. The Century Dictionary \u2014 to construct again, to rebuild. In De Wald et al. v. Woog, 158 Pa. 497, the word \u201creconstruct\u201d seems to have been judicially considered. In that case the old structure was an old-fashioned two-story house, and it seems to us the changes made were much more important and extensive than those contemplated by the plaintiff in this case, yet it is held that it was not a reconstruction or a new building or a rebuilding. In this case, Landis\u2019s Appeal, 10 Pa. 379, is cited. In this ease, Counter, Judge, says on page 380, \u201cIn the common understanding and language of the people, when we speak of the erection or construction of a house or building, we mean the erection of a new house or building, not the rebuilding of an old one.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">It is a maxim with the courts that statutes in derogation of the common law must be construed strictly: Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, page 60; Brooms\u2019 Maxims, page 33.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">Penal statutes must be construed strictly in favor of the accused : Bercher v. Commonwealth, 103 Pa. 528 ; Gallagher v. Neal, 3 P. &amp; W. <em>183; </em>Cake v. Jacoby, 2 W. N. C. 391.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">Statutes for regulation of trade imposing fines and forfeitures are to be construed strictly as penal, and not liberally as remedial laws: Commonwealth v. Shopp, 1 Woodward, 123.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">A municipal ordinance imposing a penalty must be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>according to its spirit and intent. An act may be within the limit and yet no violation of the ordinance: Philadelphia v. Wright, 4 Phila. 138.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">In our opinion the proper legal construction of the words \u201cconstruct\u201d and \u201creconstruct\u201d found in-the act of May 23, 1889, as amended by the act of May 16, 1901, section 14, page 224, and embodied in the ordinance of the city of Bradford, No. 907, is to prohibit the construction or building of a wooden structure within the limits fixed by the ordinance. That the word \u201creconstructed\u201d simply has the legal effect of preventing any evasion of the prohibition created by the words \u201c no building shall hereafter be constructed,\u201d that is to say, the ordinance cannot be evaded by claiming the right to reconstruct or rebuild a wooden building which had been demolished or destroyed either by accident or design. But the words <em>\u201c </em>constructed \u201d or \u201c reconstructed \u201d cannot be construed to prohibit an owner from repairing his wooden building which .stands within the fire limits. And we are clearly of the opinion that the repairs contemplated by the plaintiff as set out in our findings of fact, do not amount to construction or reconstruction within the meaning of the law. The building will not be materially enlarged, in. fact it will be no wider and no longer than when the repairs were begun. It will be two feet and six inches higher; but the new front will be galvanized iron and the ceiling and wainscoting will be steel, and certainly this reduces the fire risk, and the roof will be slate in place of wooden shingles. To say that the contemplated repairs amount to a reconstruction or constructing again or rebuilding of the wooden structure seems to us putting a forced and unusual meaning upon these terms. If to put a new front in a building and a new ceiling and a new roof and painting the building is a reconstruction of a building, then we do not understand the meaning of these terms. Having reached this conclusion, it follows that the plaintiff is entitled to repair his building and that the action of the city in refusing to permit him to do so is illegal and must be restrained. We are not, however, disposed to restrain the city from preventing the plaintiff from' putting shingles on the building for a roof, and say that the roof must be of slate or some other noninflammable material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>DECEBE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\">And now, October 29,1902, tbe above entitled cause coming on to be heard upon bill and answer and testimony of witnesses, and having heard the same, and the arguments of solicitors for the respective parties, upon due consideration of the premises, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that an injunction issue restraining the defendant, the city of Bradford, George H.
