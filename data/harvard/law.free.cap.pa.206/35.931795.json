In order to carry out these objects and the duty which it owed to its said lessors and the public in the premises, it became necessary for the defendant company to acquire real estate and to erect thereon buildings for the housing, storage, and handling of cars when not in use and over night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">It accordingly purchased with a portion of the money representing its capital stock premises situate on the east side of Sixteenth street, from Jackson to Wolf, in the twenty-sixth ward of the city of Philadelphia, described in the lien, and constructed thereon the building mentioned in the scire facias, which is a car barn for the housing and care of its cars as aforesaid. The building is used for the storage of cars over night, which cars otherwise would have to stand upon the public streets. A small portion of it is used as the office and headquarters of the superintendent, who is actually in charge of the business at said car barn, looking after the said cars and dispatching them upon their various trips.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">Said property was purchased and used for the purposes aforesaid, and was indispensably necessary to the operation of said defendant company\u2019s public franchises, and was used for no other purposes whatsoever. As said property represented part of defendant\u2019s capital stock, it was liable to pay, and has paid, to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a tax for said year upon the said property as part of such capital.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">Said property was, and is, part of the public works of defendant, and used as such only, was essential to the carrying out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>of the public purpose for which it was incorporated as aforesaid, and defendant received, no profit or income therefrom by way of rental or otherwise. Defendant is advised, and therefore avers, that such being the case, the local authorities of the county are without power to impose the tax aforesaid, not only b.ecause it would result in double taxation upon the same property, contrary to the intent of the acts providing for the levying and collection of taxes, but because, if such property was subject to seizure and sale piecemeal, the defendant would be crippled in the exercise of the public functions required of it, and that such power has not been conferred upon the local authorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-3\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-5\"><em>Ellis Ames Ballard, </em>with him <em>Rufus E.

L. 385, which provides that: \u201c The offices, depots, car houses, and other real property of railway corporations situate in said city, the superstructure of the road and water stations alone excepted, are and hereafter shall be subject to taxation by ordinance for city purposes.\u201d The power of the legislature to impose this tax and to delegate its authority to do so to the municipality has been settled by our decisions: Penna. R. R. Co. v. Pittsburg, 104 Pa. 522; Jermyn v. City of Scranton, 186 Pa. 595. Nor is this case within the class of cases in which it has been held that in the absence of an express declaration it will be presumed that the legislature did not intend to subject to taxation as real estate the property of a corporation that is essential to the exercise of its franchises and has once been taxed as a part of its capital. The power to tax and the intention to tax are clear, and the single question to be considered is whether a traction motor company which leases and operates street railways is within the provision of the act of 1858.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The act subjects to taxation for city purposes \u201c the real property of railway corporations situate in the city, the superstructure and water stations alone excepted.\u201d It is argued that the exception of the \u201c superstructure and water stations \u201d indicates that steam railroads only were meant, since they are the only roads owning their right of way or having water stations. That the word \u201c railway \u201d is used is of little or no importance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>construing the act. The words \u201crailway\u201d and \u201crailroad\u201d have been used indiscriminately by the legislature, and have no strict technical meaning in our statutes. A number of passenger railways were incorporated about the time of the passage of the act of 1858, and some of them in the special acts of incorporation are designated as \u201c railway companies \u201d and some as \u201c railroad companies.\u201d The rule established by our decisions is that these words used in the statutes will be considered as synonymous, and either will be held to apply to both kinds of roads, unless there appears from the title of the act, its purpose or its context something to indicate that a particular kind of a road is intended: Hestonville, etc., Railroad Co. v. Philadelphia, 89 Pa. 210; Gyger v. Phila. City Pass. Ry. Co., 136 Pa. 96; Cheetham v. McCormick, 178 Pa. 186; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Transit Co., 192 Pa. 596. The exemption from taxation of the superstructure and water stations clearly indicates that steam railroads were included, but it does not follow that passenger railway companies were excluded. The word used applies to both kinds of roads, and we see no ground on which it can be held that either is exempted from the operation of the act. A.n act similar to the one under consideration was construed in Penna. R. R. Co. v. Pittsburg, 104 Pa. 522. This act provides that \u201call real estate situated in said city owned or possessed by any railroad company shall be and is hereby made subject to taxation for city purposes, the same as other real estate in the city.\u201d It was held that the act applied to both steam railroads and passenger railways, and that under it the land, buildings and improvements thereon of the companies were liable to taxation for city purposes, although they were essential to the exercise of corporate franchises in the operation of the roads. There is no real distinction between these acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\">It remains to determine whether for the purpose of this inquiry there is a distinction between passenger railway companies and traction motor companies. Companies of the latter class are incorporated under the Act of March 22, 1887, P. L. 8, and the grant of power is to enter upon streets upon which passenger railways have been constructed, with the consent of the railway company, and to construct, maintain and operate thereon motors, cables, electrical and other appliances for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>traction of the cars of the passenger railways. They are given power to \u201c lease the property and franchises of street passenger railways which they may desire to operate, and to operate said railways.\u201d By the Acts of May 15,1895, P. L. 63 and P. L. 64, they are authorized to buy and own the franchises of street passenger railways, to lay out new lines, and to operate their different lines as a general system. A traction company whose business is confined to the construction of appliances for street railway companies, or to the operation of motors, cables, electrical or other appliances for the traction of the cars of such companies, has but little resemblance to a street railway company and more to a construction or power company. But when, as in this case, it operates a railway and leases the property and franchises of various railway companies and operates them on its own account, it is exercising the franchises of a street railway company, as it is authorized to do, and it enjoys the privileges granted to and becomes subject to the liabilities imposed by law upon such companies. This view is in harmony with all of our decisions touching the subject: Rafferty v. Central Traction Co., 147 Pa. 579; Reeves v. Phila. Traction Co., 152 Pa. 153; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Allentown, etc., Rapid Transit Co., 192 Pa. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
