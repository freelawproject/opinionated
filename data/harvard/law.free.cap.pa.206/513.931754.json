Such an agreement is or may be beneficial to a creditor, or detrimental to the debtor, and this is sufficient to make it a good consideration for the promise: 1 Chitty on Contracts (11th ed.), p. 62; 1 Parsons on Contracts (8th ed.), p. 453; Hearn v.

The rule that payment of a smaller sum is not a consideration to support an accord and satisfaction in regard to a larger sum due, has always been regarded as more logical than just or businesslike, and even small circumstances of variation have always been held sufficient to prevent its application. Hence a payment in advance, no matter how short a time, has been uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>formly held to constitute a good consideration.
