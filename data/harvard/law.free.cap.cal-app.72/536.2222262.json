Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that, independent of said section 18, the matter of penalty for the commission of the felony defined 'by said Motor Vehicle Act is sufficiently covered by other general provisions of the Penal Code which must be read in connection with and considered as a part of the felony defined in said act.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Section 17 of said code declares that \u201ca felony is a crime which is punishable with death or by imprisonment in the state prison. ...\u201d Manifestly, the felony under consideration is not punishable with death, and therefore must be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison; that being so, the minimum and maximum duration of such imprisonment is fixed by sections 18a and 671 of said code. Section 18a reads: \u201cExcept in cases where a different minimum punishment is prescribed by law, for every offense declared to be a felony and punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, the minimum punishment shall be imprisonment in the state prison for not less than six months\u201d; and section 671 provides: \u201cWhenever any person is declared punishable for a crime by imprisonment in the state prison for a term not less than any specified number of years, and no limit to the duration of such imprisonment is declared, the court authorized to pronounce judgment upon such conviction may, in its discretion, sentence such offender to imprisonment during his natural life, or for any number of years not less than that prescribed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">It will be observed that the language of both of these sections is much broader than the language of section 18. Section 18a, which was added to the code after the Isch case was decided (Stats. 1919, p. 7), is not restricted, like said section 18, to cases of felony \u201cprescribed by this (Penal) code,\u2019\u2019 but by its terms applies to all felonies except those wherein a different minimum punishment \u201cis prescribed by law\u201d; and section 671 contains no words of limitation whatever.  The fact that the maximum penalty specified by said section 671, if inflicted, might be severe, does not in itself serve as grounds for abolishing the crime sought to be punished, because the imposition of the. maximum penalty is not imperative, and it cannot be assumed that in case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>conviction a penalty wholly disproportionate to the offense will be inflicted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hallawell, </em>8 Cal. App. 563 [97 Pac. 320].)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The writ is discharged and the prisoner is remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Fresno County.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Cashin, J., and Tyler, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
