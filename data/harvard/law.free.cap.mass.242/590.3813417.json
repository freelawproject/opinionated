The court after due notice to all parties interested entered a decree appointing a special commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The statute provides that, \u201cThe special commission shall meet as soon as may be after its appointment, and, after notice to and a hearing of the parties,\u201d shall determine which party shall pay the charges and expenses of making the alterations and future charges for keeping the bridge or crossing and the approaches thereto in repair, and may apportion all such charges, expenses and costs between the railroad company and the railway company having tracks in the way, and the counties, cities or towns where the crossing is situated and other cities and towns which may be specially benefited, make a written report and return it to the court. St. 1906, c. 463, Part I, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The decree of the county commissioners is specific and it is to be specifically performed. <em>Roxbury </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, </em>6 Cush. 424, 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">If all parties interested had entered into an agreement before the commission was appointed, that the bridge should be rebuilt and the alterations made and the entire cost in the first instance paid by the petitioners, the commission would have been charged only with the duty to determine by whom the charges and expenses of rebuilding should be paid, and make therefor the proper apportionment and award. <em>Directors of Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, petitioners, 232 </em>Mass. 171. <em>Selectmen of Brookline, petitioners, </em>236 Mass. 260. St. 1906, c. 463, Part I, \u00a7 28, is explicit. The party designated to construct the bridge having carried into effect the decision of the county commissioners may recover in an action of contract of any other party the proportion awarded to be paid by such other party with interest, and if the party so designated un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>reasonably neglects or refuses to carry the decision into effect any other party who is thereby affected may proceed to do it, and may in an action of contract recover from each and all of the others the proportions awarded to be paid by him or them respectively and from the party so neglecting or refusing all charges, expenses and costs occasioned thereby. G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">The bridge having been previously built by the petitioners, apparently on their own initiative, the special commission subsequently appointed had no authority to determine by whom the cost should be paid, and its award that the respondent should bear any portion was invalid. It is contended that this defence has been waived. While it could be found that a representative of the respondent appeared in response to a notice that the commission would hold a hearing to decide whether any part of the costs should be assessed upon the county, and made no specific objection that the bridge had already been constructed, but objected generally to any part of the expense being apportioned to the county, his appearance and conduct could not confer jurisdiction to make the award. The county never had consented to the construction of the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">It follows as matter of law that as to this respondent there were no costs, charges and expenses which could be apportioned, or which on appeal could be revised by a jury under St. 1906, c. 463, Part I, \u00a7 27, G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 63. <em>Fourth National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>214 Mass. 549. The respondent\u2019s second, third and sixth requests, that, \u201cThere is no such report and award of the special commission before the jury as warrants any finding by them as to cost or maintenance of the bridge or roadway thereon or approaches thereto against the county of Worcester;\u201d that \u201cUpon all the evidence before the jury no award whatsoever for costs of construction, alterations or maintenance of the bridge described in the petition, the roadbed thereof or the approaches thereto can be made by the jury;\u201d and that \u201cThere is no evidence of any waiver on the part of the county commissioners of any matter of defence under the petition in the case,\u201d should have been given. The exceptions accordingly must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
