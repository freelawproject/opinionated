It is too late to object in the Superior Court that a complaint filed originally in a district court is insufficient in form. R. L. c. 219, \u00a7 21 (see now G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 17). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>13 Allen, 550. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>175 Mass. 325, 328. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galatta, </em>228 Mass. 308, 311. If the motion had been seasonably filed, it could not properly have been allowed. The complaint follows the language of St. 1916, c. 290, \u00a7 22 (see now G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24) and is sufficient. It describes with accuracy and certainty the offence set forth in the statute. It is not open to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>objection that the name of the person collided with and injured is not stated. R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 17 (now G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 17). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>193 Mass. 464, 468. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>199 Mass. 583. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>213 Mass. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\">If the defendant desired to be informed of the name of the person injured, upon request therefor he was entitled as of right to a statement of particulars for the purpose of obtaining that information. R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 39 (see now G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 40). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>227 Mass. 57, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The evidence offered by the Commonwealth to show who the injured person was, and that she was struck and knocked down by an automobile operated by the defendant, was plainly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
