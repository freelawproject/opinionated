L. c. 152, \u00a7 18. By this section if an insured person enters into a contract with an independent contractor to do such person\u2019s work, or if such a contractor and the insured would, if such work were executed by employees immediately employed by the insurer, be liable to pay compensation to the employees, the insurer shall pay to such employees any compensation which would be payable to them if the independent contractor was insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We are of opinion that these provisions are inapplicable. It was not until St. 1913, c. 807, that the workmen\u2019s compensation act was so extended as to include workmen, laborers and mechanics employed by counties, cities and towns, and districts having the power of taxation upon their acceptance of the statute as therein provided. While the procedure and the jurisdiction of the industrial accident board are declared to be the same as under the provisions of St. 1911, c. 751, and acts in amendment thereof, the right to compensation is expressly limited \u201cto such laborers, workmen and mechanics employed by it as receive injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment.\u201d And the codification found in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75, has made no material change. The word \u201cinsurer,\u201d as used in \u00a7 18, is defined in \u00a7 1, cl. 7, \u201cany insurance company which has insured the compensation payable by an employer under this chapter.\u201d If the provisions for the benefit of employees of an uninsured independent contractor, who engages to do work for a subscriber, are to be extended to public employees putting them on a parity with employees who are protected under \u00a7 18, the change must be made by the Legislature; it cannot be supplied under the guise of implied construction. <em>Clancy\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 316. <em>Centrello\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 456. <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
