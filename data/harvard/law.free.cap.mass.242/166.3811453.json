The defendant was not insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. At the close of the evidence the defendant moved for a directed verdict; this motion was overruled and the jury found for the plaintiff. The defendant not being insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, it was not a defence to the action that the employee was negligent, that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, or that the employee assumed the risk of injury. <em>G. </em>L. c. 152, \u00a7 66. St. 1911, c. 751, Part I, \u00a7 1. The only question involved in this case is, was there any evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence for the consideration of the</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The plaintiff testified that the wooden boxes, about three feet long, two feet wide and deep, \u201cwere piled against the wall;\u201d that \u201cthe boxes were piled starting with one box, then another, and then another, and that they were piled up higher and higher to a distance of twelve feet in height; that the boxes extended from the wall so that the first box was about five feet away from where the witness was working;\u201d that when the box fell from the foreman\u2019s hands \u201che was climbing upon the boxes . . . [[and] was taking boxes from the top and throwing them down;\u201d that she \u201csaw a box falling from his hands\u201d when he was on \u201cthe third box up\u201d and was \u201ctaking boxes from the top of the pile.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The jury viewed the premises and saw the boxes against the wall as they were piled at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence is very slight. But we cannot say that as matter of law there was no evidence of negligence to submit to the jury. The jury saw the way in which the boxes were arranged, and they could find that it was a negligent act for a person to climb on these boxes or to stand on the third box from the floor and attempt to take one of them from the top of the pile and throw it to the floor when only a few feet from the plaintiff; and that because of this negligence of the foreman the plaintiff was injured. In our opinion the case was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
