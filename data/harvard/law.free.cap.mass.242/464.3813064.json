The plaintiff, whose place of business is in Chicago, is a dealer in a large way in horse butts, and is represented in Boston by an agent, one Needham. The defendant, who is in the leather business in Boston, orally agreed with Needham to purchase of his principal one thousand butts, varying in price, according to certain standards. The date when the defendant\u2019s order was accepted, and when the agreement may be said to have been entered into finally, can be fixed as April 17, 1920, which is the date of a letter from the plaintiff at Chicago to its agent in Boston, informing him that it would ship the thousand horse butts to the place designated by the defendant. The goods were delivered to the carrier at Chicago on either May 17.or 18; it was difficult to determine which, from the bill of lading. When the goods were in transit, viz. on May 22, the defendant notified the plaintiff at Chicago by telegraph that, as the butts were not shipped promptly, he refused to receive them. The goods, which were sent C.O.D. arrived at their destination on June 1, and the defendant refused to receive them. They were returned to the [plaintiff who is now in possession of them, exercising the rights of owner. In the first place, I find that no time was expressly fixed by the parties for the delivery of the goods, and therefore the plaintiff was bound to deliver them within a reasonable time. Whether the goods were delivered within a reasonable time must be determined from all the circumstances, which, in substance, were as follows: From April 1, 1920, to May 29, 1920, freight embargoes, so called, were placed by the railroad companies against shipments of goods from Chicago to Massachusetts. These embargoes resulted from strikes which seriously affected shipments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>from the west to the east, and I find that when the contract was made, the defendant, as well as the plaintiff, knew that serious difficulties would be encountered in transportation. Within a few days after the order was accepted, viz. on or about April 20th, the plaintiff tried to ship the goods, but the railroad companies refused to accept them. The efforts of the plaintiff to forward them are fully described in the deposition of one Eisendrath, its business manager. The plaintiff used, as I believe, in this respect, a high degree of diligence, and it was not its fault that the goods were not shipped earlier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-3\">\u201cUpon all the evidence, I find that the butts were delivered to the carrier within a reasonable time. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\">\u201cUpon this evidence, I am of opinion that there was a sufficient note or memorandum to satisfy the statute. It is to be noted that the letter of May 20 from the plaintiff to the defendant states that the invoice is enclosed, and I find that, in fact, it was enclosed. The letter and invoice were received by the defendant, who on May 22 wrote, saying: \u2018Your favor of the 20th inst. received. As the butts were not shipped promptly, I refuse <em>to </em>accept them,\u2019 and I treat this as an acknowledgement that the invoice was received. These letters constitute some evidence that the invoice contained all the stipulations of the contract, and as was said in <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Evans, infra, </em>that the defendant made no objection to the plaintiff\u2019s statement of the contract, but only to the manner of its performance in failing, as he claimed, to send the butts promptly. The words in the defendant\u2019s letter, \u2018the butts\u2019 have the same meaning as \u2018these butts,\u2019 and refer to those mentioned in the invoice. The letter fairly construed is the same as if it said: \u2018I bought of you at the prices mentioned in the invoice the goods described therein, but they were not sent in time.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $825.04; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-6\"><em>L.

The exceptions to the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>mission of evidence, not having been argued, may be treated as waived, leaving for decision the questions, whether any contract between the parties was proved, and if a contract was consummated, whether it is unenforceable because of the statute of frauds, which is duly pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">The case was tried without a jury, and on the evidence the judge was warranted in making the following findings. The plaintiff, doing business in Chicago, Illinois, as a dealer in horse hides, was represented in Boston by one Needham with whom the defendant, a dealer in leather in Boston, agreed to buy of the plaintiff \u201cone thousand butts, varying in price, according to certain standards,\u201d the total amount being $4,105. The time when the defendant\u2019s order was accepted, and when the agreement was finally concluded, \u201ccan be fixed as April 17, 1920,\u201d which was the date of the plaintiff\u2019s letter to Needham, \u201cinforming him that they would ship the thousand horse butts to the place designated by the defendant.\u201d The butts were delivered to the carrier at Chicago \u201con either May 17 or 18; it was difficult to determine which, from the bill of lading.\u201d While the butts were in transit the defendant notified the plaintiff by telegram, that, not having been promptly shipped, \u201che refused to receive them.\u201d The butts \u201cwhich were sent cash on delivery\u201d arrived on June 1 and the defendant in accordance with his telegram declined to accept, and they were returned to the plaintiff, which at the time of the trial held possession, exercising the rights of an owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">We assume that the contract was made here and the legal rights of the parties are governed by our laws. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. </em>194 Mass. 89. <em>P. Garvan, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>210 Mass. 275, 280. See <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>99 Mass. 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">It appears that no time for performance was fixed by the parties, and the plaintiff accordingly had the burden of proving that it tendered delivery within a reasonable time. It was a question of fact on all the evidence, and the finding that the plaintiff was not in default in failing to ship earlier, not having been unwarranted, cannot be set aside as matter of law. Sales act, St. 1908, c. 237, \u00a7 43, cl. 4. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. supra. Nickerson </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>216 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>416, 420. The contract was completed when transfer of possession was tendered, and the price then became due and payable. Sales act, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 19, Rule 5. <em>Haskins </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>115 Mass. 514, 533. The defendant\u2019s second request that there is no evidence of any contract as alleged in the declaration, and the fifth request, there is no evidence that the plaintiff performed its part of the contract were refused rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">By \u00a7 4, \"A contract to sell or a sale of any goods ... of the value of five hundred dollars or upward shall not be enforceable by action unless . . . some note or memorandum in writing of the contract or sale be signed by the parties to be charged or his agent in that behalf.\u201d The effect of the statute is to require certain evidence to prove that a contract has been made; and a contract can exist at common law independently of the statute. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Hargraves, </em>118 Mass. 325, 332. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Simonds, </em>124 Mass. 19. It is settled that a letter or several letters relating to the' subject matter may constitute a sufficient memorandum. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>161 Mass. 248, 252. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>204 Mass. 346, 356. The question is one of fact, and the judge has found for the plaintiff. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Smith, supra. </em>It therefore becomes necessary to review the evidence to ascertain whether his conclusion was justified. The correspondence shows that on May 20, 1920, the plaintiff wrote the defendant enclosing an itemized invoice of the butts with prices and terms of shipment, and stating that the goods had been shipped, and a \"draft on you for the amount of invoice, payable on arrival of shipment\u201d has been drawn and forwarded. The defendant replied on May 22 acknowledging receipt of the letter and, as \u201cthe butts,\u201d meaning these butts, were not shipped promptly, he declined to accept them. On June 1 the plaintiff\u2019s agent wrote the defendant requesting him to \u201c advise if you intend to take these butts in accordance with the conditions of the purchase,\u201d and \u201cour confirmation of sale by letter of April 13th.\u201d The letter of April 13, thus incorporated by reference, was signed in the name and behalf of the plaintiff by Needham. It stated in substance, \"We beg to confirm the conversation of the writer with you today offering you ten thousand green salted horse butts . . . and confirm your instructions\u201d as to their shipment. The defendant replied to the letter of June 1, \u201cI have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>already informed your Chicago office on the 22nd of May that I will not accept the Butts as they were not shipped promptly and therefore cannot use them.\u201d It could be found that when this letter was written, signed and posted by the defendant, he had received the letter of May 20 and the invoice enclosed in that letter, and there can be no question of his full knowledge of the terms of the contract. The letter indeed says, \u201cthe butts were not shipped promptly,\u201d and the judge well could find that the invoice stated the contract as agreed upon by the parties. <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>19 Pick. 502. The defendant raised no question that he was not responsible because he had not executed any contract in writing, and he did not repudiate the contract; but only' claimed that it was unenforceable because of the delay. It seems clear, or at least it could be so found, that the defendant did not object to the contract as claimed by the plaintiff, but attempted to rescind because of alleged inexcusable delay in performance. The letter of June 2 is unintelligible unless read with the previous letters. The judge could say in view of all the correspondence ending in the letter of June 1 that there was a contract which the defendant had recognized, and that it was of no consequence that he did not specifically say, \u201cthat the letter you sent refers correctly to its terms.\u201d If the defendant had denied that he had ever made a contract, or that the plaintiff\u2019s statement of it was incorrect, no sufficient memorandum would have been shown. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>15 East, 103. <em>Thirkell </em>v. <em>Cambi, </em>[1919] 2 K. B. 590. If however the correspondence is read as a single instrument in the light of all the circumstances, Lee v. <em>Butler, </em>167 Mass. 426, <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>95 U. S. 289, the case at bar comes within the doctrine of <em>George Lawley &amp; Sons Corp. </em>v. <em>Buff, </em>230 Mass. 21, that the defendant\u2019s written recognition of the contract and its terms, as found by the judge, was sufficient. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Hargraves, </em>118 Mass. 325, 335, 336. <em>Louisville Asphalt Varnish Co. </em>v. <em>Lorick &amp; Lowrance, </em>29 S.

Compare <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Lewiston Mill Co. </em>150 N. Y. 314. The judge having reached this conclusion, properly declined to rule that the plaintiff could not recover, and that the contract was within the statute, and that there was no evidence of any note or memorandum signed by the party to be charged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>or by any person by him lawfully authorized. The remaining exceptions to the findings and rulings shown by the judge\u2019s memorandum are disposed of by reasons previously stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
