(the \u201cFund\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Fund\u2019s petition, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2), for an ancillary hearing with regard to the Fund\u2019s interest in certain property that was subject to a criminal forfeiture order. The district court held that the Fund\u2019s constructive trust on the property is not a legal interest that can defeat the government\u2019s forfeiture claim. After review, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">\n<em>A. Mortgage Fraud Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">This case involves a mortgage fraud scheme by which defendant Stacey Shefton fraudulently obtained $726,856.60 in loan proceeds from Long Beach Mortgage Company (\u201cLong Beach\u201d) by presenting fraudulent documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">The scheme began on November 23, 2004, when Lawrence Dillard (the \u201cbuyer\u201d) agreed to purchase real property at 1254 Greenridge Lane in Lithonia, Georgia (the \u201cGreenridge Property\u201d) from PremierOne Properties (the \u201cseller\u201d). Before that sales transaction, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (\u201cGreenPoint\u201d) already had two security deeds of record (the \u201cGreen-Point mortgages\u201d) on the Greenridge Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-16\">In order to purchase the property, the buyer obtained two loans, totaling $800,000, from Long Beach. The Fund issued title insurance policies to Long Beach that insured Long Beach\u2019s security deeds securing the new loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-17\">Before closing, the seller informed the closing attorney that GreenPoint had sold its existing mortgages on the Greenridge Property and assigned them to Wilshire Mortgage Company (\u201cWilshire\u201d). The seller gave the attorney statements purportedly from Wilshire that showed the amounts due to Wilshire to pay off the existing mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-18\">At closing, the closing attorney issued two payoff checks, totaling $726,856.60, payable to Wilshire out of the Long Beach loan proceeds. The attorney mailed the checks to the address provided in Wil-shire\u2019s loan payoff statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-19\">Several months later, Long Beach discovered that the GreenPoint mortgages had never been assigned to Wilshire or anyone else. Moreover, they were in default. Consequently, the first and second GreenPoint mortgages had not and would not be canceled. Long Beach\u2019s security deeds were subordinate to the existing GreenPoint mortgages, leaving Long Beach with little or no security for its loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-20\">Long Beach made claims on the two title policies issued by the Fund, and the Fund paid off the total amount due under the GreenPoint mortgages to clear the encumbrances on Long Beach\u2019s title. On or about October 31, 2005, the Fund paid GreenPoint a total amount of $742,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-21\">This mortgage fraud scheme that resulted in the Fund\u2019s $742,000 loss was perpe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>trated by Stacey Shefton and others. Shefton was affiliated with both Wilshire and the seller PremierOne, and leased the unused office space to which the payoff checks were sent. Shefton obtained for his personal use the entirety of the Long Beach funds which were supposed to be used to pay off the existing mortgages and thus to clear title to the Greenridge Property and give Long Beach its desired security positions. Thus, because Shefton diverted the Long Beach loan proceeds to himself, Long Beach is the direct victim of Shefton\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">\n<em>B. Criminal Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Shefton was indicted and pled guilty to wire fraud. As part of his plea agreement, Shefton agreed to forfeit to the United States certain property in his possession or control (the \u201cForfeited Property\u201d) that constituted or derived from proceeds Shef-ton obtained as a result of the wire fraud. The Forfeited Property includes a car; a motorcycle; the funds in six different bank accounts; approximately $300,000.00 in cash seized from a storage facility; and furniture, appliances, and other personal property located at the Greenridge Property. Shefton admitted in his plea agreement that the cash and all the funds in the bank accounts represented proceeds of the mortgage fraud scheme by which Shefton intercepted the Long Beach loan proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">The government sought, and the district court granted, a preliminary order of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">Thereafter, the Fund asserted a legal interest in the Forfeited Property that Shefton obtained from the Long Beach loan proceeds. The Fund petitioned the district court for an ancillary hearing, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2), to adjudicate the validity of the Fund\u2019s alleged interest in the property. According to the Fund\u2019s petition, the Forfeited Property is, or can be traced to, the Long Beach loan proceeds,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Shefton fraudulently obtained, and Shefton\u2019s fraud was the sole reason the Fund had to pay off the Green-Point mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">The government moved to dismiss the Fund\u2019s \u00a7 853(n)(2) petition. The government recognized Long Beach (and the Fund) as a victim of Shefton\u2019s fraud. However, the government argued that the Fund, \u201cone of the many victims of the Shefton ... fraud scheme,\u201d was merely an unsecured creditor and lacked standing to contest the forfeiture. Specifically, the government contended that the Fund did not have a \u201clegal interest\u201d in the Forfeited Property, as required by \u00a7 853(n)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">The Fund responded that it had the requisite legal interest through Long Beach. Shefton fraudulently obtained from Long Beach the proceeds of Long Beach\u2019s loans and used those proceeds to acquire the Forfeited Property. Long Beach was therefore entitled to a constructive trust on Shefton\u2019s Forfeited Property bought with Long Beach\u2019s money. And, pursuant to the terms of the Fund\u2019s title insurance policies and state law, the Fund was subrogated to the rights and claims of Long Beach against Shefton once it paid off the GreenPoint mortgages on Long Beach\u2019s behalf. Thus, the Fund succeeded to all of Long Beach\u2019s rights and disabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>ties with respect to the Long Beach loan proceeds fraudulently transferred to Shef-ton. <em>See Landrum v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>241 Ga.App. 787, 527 S.E.2d 637, 638 (2000). In other words, the Fund stands in the shoes of Long Beach. For simplicity, we will refer hereafter to the Fund\u2019s interest in the Forfeited Property, though the interest at the time of the fraud was Long Beach\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">In reply, the government did not contest that the Forfeited Property was, or was purchased with, the Long Beach loan proceeds. Instead, the government noted that Congress has not defined the term \u201clegal interest\u201d in \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A), and argued that \u201cit would frustrate the operation and effect of the forfeiture statute\u201d to construe as a \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A) \u201clegal interest\u201d a constructive trust that arises \u201cwhenever a victim to a fraud voluntarily transfers money to another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the Fund\u2019s constructive trust claim could not be imposed to defeat the government\u2019s forfeiture claim. The Fund appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">\u201cIn the context of third-party claims to criminally forfeited property, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Watkins, </em>320 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2003). Because the district court disposed of the Fund\u2019s ancillary hearing petition on the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, we assume (as did the district court) that the facts alleged in the petition are true. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.2(c)(1)(A). Thus, the only issues before us in this appeal are legal ones meriting <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">Section 853 governs criminal forfeiture proceedings, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c), and provides that persons convicted of certain criminal violations shall forfeit to the United States any property used to commit or facilitate the crime, or any property \u201cconstituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained\u201d from the crime, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(l)-(2). \u201cAll right, title, and interest\u201d in the forfeited property \u201cvests in the United States upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">Section 853(n) establishes a procedure for third parties who claim an interest in forfeited property to avoid its forfeiture. Such parties may \u201cpetition the [district] court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of [their] alleged interest in the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 853(n)(2). The statute establishes the following standard by which third-party interests are adjudicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-12\">If, after the hearing, the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-13\">(A) <em>the petitioner has a legal </em>right, title, or <em>interest in the property, and such </em>right, title, or <em>interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the </em>right, title, or <em>interest </em>was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or <em>was superi- or to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture </em>of the property under this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-14\">(B) the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest in the property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-4\">the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 853(n)(6) (emphasis added). The Fund does not claim to be a \u201cbona fide purchaser for value\u201d under \u00a7 853(n)(6)(B); rather, it proceeds exclusively under the \u201csuperior legal interest\u201d prong in \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A). Thus, under \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A) the Fund must establish that: (1) Long Beach (the Fund\u2019s subro-gor) had a legal interest in the Forfeited Property, and (2) Long Beach\u2019s interest was superior to Shefton\u2019s interest in the Forfeited Property (3) at the time of Shef-ton\u2019s fraud. If the Fund can demonstrate all three elements, then the order of forfeiture is invalid. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">The parties agree that we apply state law to determine the nature of the Fund\u2019s interest in the Forfeited Property. <em>United States v. Fleet, </em>498 F.3d 1225, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). On the other hand, whether the Fund\u2019s interest in the Forfeited Property is superior and thus renders the forfeiture order invalid under \u00a7 853(n)(6) is a matter of federal law. <em>Id. </em>We first examine the nature of the Fund\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">\n<em>A. State Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">Under Georgia law, a constructive trust arises \u201cwhenever the circumstances are such that the person holding legal title to property, either from fraud or otherwise, cannot enjoy the beneficial interest in the property without violating some established principle of equity.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12 \u2014 93(a); <em>see St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Meeks, </em>270 Ga. 136, 508 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1998) (\u201c[A] constructive trust is a remedy created by a court in equity to prevent unjust enrichment.\u201d). Georgia courts have imposed constructive trusts upon money obtained by one person from another through fraud. <em>See, e.g., Bateman v. Patterson, </em>212 Ga. 284, 92 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-11\">The Fund\u2019s petition alleges that Shefton obtained the $726,856.60 in payments from the Long Beach loan proceeds by presenting fraudulent loan payoff statements from Wilshire. As a result, Long Beach was deprived of the bargained-for security for its loans, and, pursuant to its policies, the Fund was required to pay off the Green-Point mortgages on Long Beach\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-12\">Assuming the facts alleged in the Fund\u2019s petition are true, we conclude that the Fund has established it is entitled to imposition of a constructive trust on the Forfeited Property under Georgia law. Shefton obtained the proceeds of the Long Beach loans through fraud; thus, he \u201ccannot enjoy the beneficial interest\u201d in the property he obtained from those loan proceeds \u201cwithout violating [an] established principle of equity.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 53-12-93(a); <em>see Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Weekes, </em>241 Ga. 169, 244 S.E.2d 46, 48 (1978) (\u201cA constructive trust arises ... by equity with respect to property acquired by fraud ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-13\">We recognize the government argues that the Fund is not entitled to a constructive trust because the Fund has an adequate remedy at law based on the Attorney General\u2019s authority, pursuant to \u00a7 853(i)(l), to remit forfeiture \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d However, \u00a7 853(i)(l) remission is a non-judicial remedy left entirely to the discretion of the Attorney General. <em>DSI Assocs. LLC v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number><em>States, </em>496 F.3d 175, 186-87 (2d Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Lavin, </em>942 F.2d 177, 185-86 (3d Cir.1991). Under Georgia law, equitable remedies, such as constructive trusts, are not precluded by the existence of an alternate remedy that is \u201cnot as complete or effectual as the equitable relief.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 23 1 4, Given that \u00a7 853(i)(l) leaves to the government, which holds the forfeited property, full and unre-viewable discretion as to whether it will release some or all of it, \u00a7 853(i)(l) remission is certainly not as complete or effectual as the equitable relief of a constructive trust. Thus, we conclude that the Fund has, under these facts, established an entitlement to a constructive trust on the Forfeited Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">\n<em>B. Federal Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">We turn now to the effect of the Fund\u2019s constructive trust on the forfeiture order. We agree with the large majority of courts that have determined (1) that a constructive trust, despite being an equitable remedy, constitutes a \u201clegal right, title, or interest in ... property\u201d under \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) that a constructive trust can render a forfeiture order invalid pursuant to that subsection. <em>See United States v. $4,224,958.57, </em>392 F.3d 1002, 1004-05 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that if the petitioners can prove the defendant defrauded them of funds he forfeited to the government, they are beneficiaries of a constructive trust and can challenge the forfeiture); <em>United States v. Schwimmer, </em>968 F.2d 1570, 1574, 1582 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that Congress\u2019s reference to \u201clegal right, title, or interest\u201d included interests arising in equity and that \u201ca constructive trust warrants an amendment of an order of forfeiture ... if ... the property ordered forfeited is traceable to property held in constructive trust\u201d); <em>Lavin, </em>942 F.2d at 185-87 &amp; n. 10 (concluding that Congress\u2019s reference in \u00a7 853(n) to \u201clegal\u201d interests extended also to equitable ones, but determining that \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A) did not apply under the facts of the case because the defendant\u2019s forfeiture-causing drug trafficking activity began three years before his constructive-trust-causing embezzlement); <em>United States v. Campos, </em>859 F.2d 1233, 1238-39 (6th Cir.1988) (stating in dicta that a constructive trust would constitute a superior interest under \u00a7 853(n)); <em>United States v. Marx, </em>844 F.2d 1303, 1308 (7th Cir.1988) (holding that a constructive trust interest in forfeited property can entitle a petitioner to relief from forfeiture).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">Only one circuit court has concluded that a constructive trust cannot invalidate a forfeiture order. <em>See United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg), S.A., </em>46 F.3d 1185, 1190-91 (D.C.Cir.1995). In <em>BCCI, </em>the District of Columbia Circuit agreed with the other circuits that Congress did not intend \u201cto draw the ancient, but largely ignored, distinction between technically legal and technically equitable claims in forfeiture challenges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190. However, it concluded that a constructive trust \u201cis a <em>remedy </em>that a court devises after litigation,\u201d and therefore it cannot \u201cbe interposed as superior to the government\u2019s forfeiture claim\u201d because forfeiture vests title in the government at the time of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing. <em>Id. </em>at 1190-91. The district court adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number><em>BCCI\u2019s </em>holding in dismissing the Fund\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">We are unpersuaded by the reasoning in <em>BCCI. </em>First, one of its premises is incorrect. Although a constructive trust is a judicially recognized remedy, see <em>Meeks, </em>508 S.E.2d at 648, it arises when the underlying equities exist, not when it is announced, <em>United States v. 1419 Mount Alto Rd., </em>830 F.Supp. 1476, 1481-82 (N.D.Ga.1993) (applying Georgia law); see <em>also $4,224,958.57, </em>392 F.3d at 1004 (\u201cIt is an elementary mistake to suppose that a court creates the trust .... The obligation on the fraudster is imposed by law and arises immediately with his acquisition of the proceeds of the fraud.\u201d). Thus, the Fund\u2019s constructive trust arose upon transfer of the Long Beach loan proceeds to Shefton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">Second, the issue is not, as the court in <em>BCCI </em>stated, whether a petitioner\u2019s constructive trust interest \u201ccan be interposed as superior to the government\u2019s forfeiture claim.\u201d <em>BCCI, </em>46 F.3d at 1191. Rather, it is whether the petitioner\u2019s interest is superior to the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>interest in the forfeited property. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A) (stating that a criminal forfeiture order may be invalidated if \u201cthe petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property ... [that] was superior to any right, title, or interest of the <em>defendant </em>at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">Accordingly, we agree with the majority of circuits that have held that a construc-five trust can serve as a superior legal interest under \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A) and thus can serve as grounds for invalidating a criminal forfeiture order. We reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Fund\u2019s petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">. As mentioned above, Shefton admitted that the cash and all the money in the bank accounts represented Long Beach loan proceeds. The Fund's petition further alleged that Shefton used the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds to purchase the car, motorcycle, furniture, appliances, and other personal property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1317-7\">. Some of the cases discussed below construed the criminal forfeiture provisions set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(7 )(6). But this Court has held that statute is \"substantively identical\u201d to \u00a7 853(n)(6) and has applied \u00a7 853(n) and \u00a7 1963(Z) precedent interchangeably. <em>Watkins, </em>320 F.3d at 1283 n. 2 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1318-8\">. The government contends that the Fund\u2019s involvement did not begin until it paid off the GreenPoint mortgages, which occurred well after the fraud, which ensued when the Long Beach loan proceeds were transferred to Shefton. Hence, the government argues, the Fund's interest in the Forfeited Property arose after forfeiture, too late to satisfy \u00a7 853(n)(6). However, as mentioned above, the Fund was subrogated to Long Beach's rights. Consequently, the Fund legally \u201cstands in the shoes\u201d of Long Beach, <em>see Landrum, </em>527 S.E.2d at 638 (quotation marks omitted), and thus the relevant issue is the nature of Long Beach's interest \u2014 not the Fund's \u2014 at the time of the fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
