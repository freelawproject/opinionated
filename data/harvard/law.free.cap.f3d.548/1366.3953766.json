The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>concluded that Jones was ineligible for a reduction of his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines did not lower his base offense level given the quantity of crack cocaine for which he was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 3582(c)(2) allows courts to reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">In November 2007 the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which reduced base offense levels under the sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (Supp.2007); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. Later, Amendment 713 made 706 retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. Amendments 713 and 706 have generated a large number of appeals from federal prisoners who were sentenced under the earlier, harsher guidelines for crack cocaine, but who allege that their applicable sentence range was lowered by the retroactive application of Amendment 706. <em>See, e.g., Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325-26; <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 2008 WL 4867909 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">In order for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to apply, however, the defendant must have been sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (\u201cA reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [a]n amendment [listed as retroactive] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (holding that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized when Amendment 706 had reduced the defendant\u2019s base offense level, but did not change his actual sentence range under the guidelines because he was sentenced as a recidivist under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 908 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that the defendant was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where the sentencing amendment concerned the possession of firearms and did \u201cnot apply factually in Armstrong\u2019s case\u201d because his sentence had not been affected by the possession of a firearm); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[A] district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when <em>that </em>defendant was sentenced <em>based </em>on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-10\">In this case, Jones pleaded guilty in 1994 to conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The Presentence Investigation Report at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>tributed more than 50 kilograms of crack cocaine to Jones. At the sentencing hearing, his attorney disputed that quantity, arguing that Jones should be accountable for no more than 12 kilograms. The district court declined to resolve that dispute because the 1994 sentencing guidelines provided a base offense level of 38 for defendants responsible for 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (1994). Therefore, whether Jones was responsible for 12 kilograms or 50 kilograms of crack cocaine made no difference in his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">Under Amendment 706, the guidelines now provide a base offense level of 36 for defendants who are responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2). However, a base offense level of 38 still applies to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms or more. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Accordingly, the distinction between 12 and 50 kilograms of crack cocaine that did not matter in 1994 still does not matter in 2008, and the base offense level for that quantity range has not decreased. Even if Jones were accountable for only 12 kilograms of crack cocaine, as his attorney argued at his sentence hearing in 1994, Amendment 706 did not change his applicable base offense level. It is still 38. <em>United States v. Wanton, </em>525 F.3d 621, 622 (8th Cir.2008) (affirming denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that was based on Amendment 706, and holding that \u201cthe new amendment does not apply where more than 4.5 kilograms of crack is involved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">Acknowledging this, Jones nonetheless contends that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which made the sentencing guidelines advisory, effectively lowered his applicable guidelines range because a particular guidelines range in the <em>post-Booker </em>era is lower than the same range in the <em>pre-Booker </em>era. It is lower, Jones argues, because it is only advisory and the sentencing court may impose a lesser sentence than the range indicates. To begin with, one could say that the same guidelines range is also higher than before <em>Booker </em>because now the court can impose a harsher sentence than the range indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">Either way, the argument is unconvincing. It is foreclosed by the language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which allows courts to reduce a sentence only when a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered <em>by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). In <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005), we noted that <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d <em>See also Cortorreal v. United States, </em>486 F.3d 742, 744 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he <em>Booker </em>decision cannot be the basis for a Section 3582(c)(2) motion to modify a sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>500 F.3d 486, 490 (6th Cir.2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">Because the Sentencing Commission has not lowered the sentencing range applicable to Jones, the district court correctly ruled that it lacked authority to reduce Jones\u2019 sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">. Once it is established that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court's decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also White, </em>305 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
