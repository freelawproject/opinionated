The district court awarded both compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and \u2014 in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 \u2014 costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to Bivens\u2019s counsel Linda J. Ehrlich and Randall C. Marshall.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bivens\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees was significantly reduced and he now appeals that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Section 1988 allows for the recovery of \u201creasonable\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The starting point for determining the amount of a \u201creasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). The product of these two figures is the lodestar and there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that the lodestar is the reasonable sum the attorneys deserve. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 565-66, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">When a district court finds the number of hours claimed is unreasonably high, the court has two choices: it may conduct 'an hour-by-hour analysis or it may reduce the requested hours with an across-the-board cut. <em>See Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 783 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that where the billing record is voluminous, \u201cthe district court need not engage in an hour-by-hour analysis!; r]ather, ... it may [] reduce [the hours devoted to litigation] in gross if a review of the resubmitted fee request warrants such a reduction\u201d) (emphasis added). In determining what is a \u201creasonable\u201d hourly rate and what number of compensable hours is \u201creasonable,\u201d the court is to consider the 12 factors enumerated in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-13\">When the number of compensable hours and the hourly rate are reasonable, a downward adjustment to the lodestar is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>merited only if the prevailing party was partially successful in its efforts. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., </em>996 F.2d 1144, 1150 (11th Cir.1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">Here, in fashioning the attorneys\u2019 fees award, the district court first calculated a reasonable hourly rate for Ehrlich and Marshall.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After calculating a reasonable hourly rate \u2014 which Bivens does not dispute \u2014 the court then engaged in an hour-by-hour analysis for 463.3 of the 616.4 hours requested by Ehrlich and all of the 51.7 hours requested by Marshall. For each of 15 specific categories of requested hours, the court found a certain portion of those hours to be \u201creasonable\u201d and explicitly stated so. The court never explicitly used language from <em>Johnson </em>but it is clear that the court considered the first <em>Johnson </em>factor (the \u201ctime and labor required\u201d) in fashioning a \u201creasonable\u201d number of hours for each specific category of requested hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">After conducting this hour-by-hour analysis, the district court then applied a further 35% across-the-board reduction in the requested hours. This reduction applied to those hours already subjected to the hour-by-hour analysis and found to be \u201creasonable,\u201d in addition to the 153.1 other (primarily administrative) hours requested but not specifically discussed in the hour-by-hour analysis. In applying this 35% reduction, the district court explained that it had applied the <em>Johnson </em>factors. The district court specifically stated that it considered the \u201cattorney\u2019s skill,\u201d \u201ctype of case,\u201d \u201cpreclusion of other employment,\u201d \u201ctime limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances,\u201d \u201cdifficulty and novelty of the case,\u201d and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the \u201ctime and labor required,\u201d a <em>Johnson </em>factor already considered in the hour-by-hour analysis. After applying this reduction, the court stated that the new figure was \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">Having arrived at a reasonable hourly rate and a reasonable number of compen-sable hours, the district court thus arrived at the lodestar. The district court then adjusted the lodestar amount; it reduced it by 50% based on the \u201cexcessive amount of time spent on some activities in disproportion to the relatively straight-forward nature of the claim, and the isolated, brief encounter that led to the lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">We review the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion, reviewing questions of law <em>de novo </em>and reviewing findings of fact for clear error. <em>Atlanta Journal and Constitution v. City of Atlanta Dept. of Aviation, </em>442 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2006). An error of law is <em>per se </em>abuse of discretion. <em>Resnick v. Uccello Immobilien GMBH, Inc., </em>227 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2000). Any reductions to the requested hours must be concisely and clearly explained to allow for appellate review; otherwise, we must remand. <em>Loranger, </em>10 F.3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">We conclude that the district court erred in two ways. First, in arriving at the lodestar, the district court conducted both an hour-by-hour analysis <em>and </em>applied an across-the-board reduction of the requested compensable hours. Our circuit\u2019s precedent states that the district court is to apply either method, not both. <em>See id. </em>The reason for this is easy to understand: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>by requiring the district court to conduct either analysis instead of both, we ensure that the district court does not doubly-discount the requested hours, as was the case here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore remand to the district court to determine the \u201creasonable\u201d number of compensable hours to be included in the lodestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Second, the district court erred in adjusting the lodestar downward by 50%. Such an adjustment is warranted only if the plaintiff was partially successful in his claims. <em>Resolution Trust Corp., </em>996 F.2d at 1150. Here, the plaintiff was fully successful: he was successful on all his claims and was awarded both damages and injunctive relief. Therefore, a downward adjustment was in error. Further, the downward adjustment was error because the court considered the <em>Johnson </em>factors in applying a downward adjustment. The <em>Johnson </em>factors are to be considered in determining the lodestar figure; they should not be reconsidered in making either an upward or downward adjustment to the lodestar \u2014 doing so amounts to double-counting. <em>See City of Burlington v. Dague, </em>505 U.S. 557, 562-63, 112 S.Ct. 2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">Accordingly, we VACATE the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">. The facts that gave rise to this case are explained in depth in the district court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and need not be repeated here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">. Those factors are: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the \"undesirability\u201d of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. <em>Id. </em>at 717-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-15\">In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">. What constitutes partial success is determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434-36, 103 S.Ct. 1933.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">. The court also discussed the reasonable fee owed to the expert, but that finding is not disputed in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">. The district court determined that 183.7 hours was \"reasonable\u201d for Ehrlich's 15 specific categories of requested hours and 35 hours was \"reasonable\u201d for Marshall, but the district court then reduced these figures by an additional 35% and called this new total \"reasonable\u201d as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">We note that the district court may not have meant to doubly-discount the 218.7 hours found to be \"reasonable\u201d for Ehrlich and Marshall; rather, it may have applied the 35% across-the-board discount to reduce the 153.1 primarily administrative hours requested (and not subjected to an hour-by-hour analysis) to a \"reasonable\u201d amount. Indeed, applying a 35% reduction to both the 218.7 and the 153.1 figures is the mathematical equivalent of applying an 85% reduction to the 153.1 hours and adding that number to 218.7. But the district court did not state that it was reducing the 153.1 hours by 85%. It stated that it was reducing <em>both </em>the 218.7 and the 153.1 figures by 35%, resulting in a double-discounting of the 218.7 figure. Because the district court determined a given number of hours was \"reasonable\u201d but then discounted that number again to arrive at another number that it also found was \"reasonable,\u201d we do not have a clear picture of which figure the district court determined to be \"reasonable.\u201d We, therefore, must remand to the district court to determine the reasonable number of compensable hours for the lodestar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
