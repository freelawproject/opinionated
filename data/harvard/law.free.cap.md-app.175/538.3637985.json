Handy, appellant, of numerous drug and weapons charges. His appeal presents two thorny issues. The first pertains to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to convictions arising from appellant\u2019s presence in the home of another during a police raid. The second requires us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>determine whether the court was entitled to impose separate sentences for each gun \u201cpossessed\u201d by the defendant in regard to a single drug trafficking conviction. In turn, we must ascertain, in a case of possession of a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense, whether the unit of prosecution is the gun or the drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">In particular, Handy was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of Md.Code (2002, 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 5-602 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d) (Count 2); possession of marijuana, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 5-601(c)(1) (Count 4); possession of \u201ccontrolled paraphernalia,\u201d in violation of C.L. \u00a7 5-620 (Count 6); possession of drug paraphernalia, proscribed by C.L. \u00a7 5-619 (Counts 7 and 8); four counts of possession of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to a drug trafficking crime\u201d (Counts 9, 11, 12, 13), in violation of C.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 621(b)(1); possession of a regulated firearm by a person under 21 years of age (Counts 20, 22, 23, 24), in violation of Md.Code (2003, 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 5-133(d) of the Public Safety Article (\u201cP.S.\u201d); and altering the serial number on a firearm (Count 26), in violation of P.S. \u00a7 5-142(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to the four firearms that appellant was convicted of possessing in relation to the single drug trafficking offense, the court imposed four sentences, two of which were consecutive and two of which were concurrent to the drug trafficking crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In total, appellant was sentenced to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but fifteen years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On appeal, Handy presents two questions, which we quote;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>1. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain the convictions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">If a defendant is convicted of a single drug trafficking crime, and possession of several firearms during and in relation to drug trafficking, and if a single violation of Criminal Law Article \u00a7 5-621 (b)(1) occurs, are multiple consecutive sentences for each firearm illegal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse three of appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences under C.L. \u00a7 5-621 for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime (Counts 11, 12, 13), but affirm the remaining convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The incident occurred on February 7, 2005. Appellant, who was born on October 22, 1986, was eighteen years old at the time of the occurrence and at the trial, held in June 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">At approximately 8:30 p.m. on February 7, 2005, Salisbury City Police Detective Brian Tilghman, along with other members of the Wicomico County Narcotics Task Force (the \u201cTask Force\u201d), executed a search and seizure warrant at 115 Delaware Avenue in Salisbury. Because the officers had information that \u201cthere were numerous subjects inside the residence,\u201d they used a \u201cbreak and go\u201d entry method, by which they broke a window located about \u201csix or seven feet\u201d from the side door. Detective Tilghman explained that the distraction gave the officers \u201ca little bit of time to get through the door and kind of have a little bit of the element of surprise.\u201d Tilghman was the third officer of the 12-person team to enter through the side door into a small hallway leading from the outer door to the kitchen. The first two officers \u201ccontinued into the living room,\u201d which was adjacent to the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Detective Tilghman estimated the kitchen to be \u201cmaybe a 15-foot room.\u201d Upon entering the kitchen, appellant was one of two subjects \u201crunning\u201d through the kitchen, \u201cdirectly at\u201d Tilghman. Appellant took \u201cfour or five steps\u201d across the length of the room. As he ran, \u201c[h]e was in arms reach of at least four firearms which were clearly visible upon [Detective Tilghman\u2019s] entry to the residence.\u201d Two of the weapons were located on the kitchen table and the other two were located on a pair of stools \u201cright beside the table,\u201d which were around three feet tall. Detective Tilghman testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">Immediately upon entering the kitchen, it was \u2014 they were large, three of the weapons were large revolvers, kind of like you see back in the wild, wild west days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">There were two firearms, one large revolver and one small semiautomatic handgun on the kitchen table, and then two other large revolvers on top of two stools which were stacked up like a shelf in the kitchen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">Some of them \u2014 I would have been blind not to see them. It was that blatant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">After \u201ca brief struggle,\u201d appellant was subdued and placed in flex-cuffs. According to Maryland State Trooper First Class Kenneth Moore, a member of the Task Force, Handy did not have any drugs, paraphernalia, weapons, or ammunition on his person, nor any significant amount of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Trooper Moore testified as an expert \u201cin the valuation and identification of controlled dangerous substances\u201d and \u201cthe common practices of users and dealers of controlled dangerous substances.\u201d He recalled that he and a fellow officer conducted a physical surveillance of the residence \u201cfor about an hour and 15 minutes\u201d before the police made their entry. Moore was parked across the street from the house, and was \u201cable to observe ... the front door as well as the side door.\u201d According to Moore, \u201cthe only person that came or went from that residence\u201d was \u201ca confidential informant\u201d who had been sent by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Before entering through the side door, Moore waited \u201cout front until the residence was secured.\u201d At around 8:30 p.m., after Detective Tilghman\u2019s team made the initial entry, Troop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>er Moore entered the house and \u201ccould smell burnt marijuana.\u201d There were \u201ceight persons total in the house.\u201d Moore did not know whether the police had announced their presence, because he \u201cdidn\u2019t make entry.\u201d But, he heard \u201cpeople inside, a female saying, F, it\u2019s the police. So I am assuming somebody yelled something or at least they recognized them.\u201d He immediately observed that appellant and Gary Simpson, a juvenile, were being detained in the kitchen, and that a \u201cnumber of persons in the living room area\u201d were also in custody. Moore also observed four handguns in the kitchen-two weapons on the table and two resting on stools.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Trooper Moore summarized his observations of the crime scene, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">As soon as you enter the kitchen area, you see a very small kitchen, kind of cluttersome, some small chairs just to the left as you enter the door, there is a kitchen table with a window and the blinds had fallen down on top of the table. Sitting on top of the table, you saw a revolver style handgun on the left-hand side of the table. On the right-hand side, there was a small semiautomatic style handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">Immediately to the left of the table, there was \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if there was a small table or two stools. I think it may have been two stools with a box or a board or something on top of it. On top of there were two additional revolvers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">You could see that there is a small closet just to the right of the table. The two persons that had been detained are to the middle of the table, I guess, more or less in the floor just a matter of feet from the table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">The kitchen wasn\u2019t that big. It may have been 10 feet. 12 feet at the most in length and then probably 8 feet, it may have been 8 by 10 total, the entire kitchen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">In the closet, it was a partially open closet. Upon looking in that closet, there was a sawed-off shotgun ... determined to be a 16 gauge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">On top <em>of </em>the kitchen stove that was there, there was some U.S. currency there, two cell phones and several small bags with like letter symbols, yellow symbols on it that each contained what I believed to be marijuana. That package was taken and sent to the Maryland State Police lab for analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">There was also on the kitchen table a box with some dice it in [sic], some plastic bags, sandwich bags, a scale, a small digital scale. On that scale as well as a razor blade, you could see white trace amounts of a substance. To me through my initial observations, I believed it to be cocaine residue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">There was a small trash can sitting behind the kitchen table. The entire top of that was filled with partial plastic bags. What we run into in investigating drugs [sic] crimes, that persons often used [sic] the sandwich bags, reason why is it doesn\u2019t raise any eyebrows, but they take and pack the substance that they are selling via cocaine, marijuana, what have you, down to the corners of the bags, tie them and they cut it, and that\u2019s how they distribute whatever they are selling at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">[T]hey take the stuff and open [the bag], and stuff it in it, and then whatever they are selling as a product, the packaging gets sent down to the corners of the bag, and then that way, it [sic] can seal it off and tie it easier, and what you have left is just a partial bag, the top half of the bag with both corners gone. There was several of those bags on the immediate top of the trash can in the kitchen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">At the scene, appellant gave Trooper Moore his date of birth. At the detention center, appellant again provided the same information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the scene, Moore asked Handy \u201cif he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>wanted to speak ...,\u201d and appellant responded that \u201che didn\u2019t know shit and didn\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Trooper Moore testified that \u201cfive plastic baggies\u201d were seized from the stove. Based on laboratory analysis, the five plastic bags contained 6.3 grams of marijuana. The digital scale and razor blade recovered from the kitchen table both \u201ccontained trace amounts of cocaine.\u201d From the kitchen closet, the police recovered a Winchester .16 gauge shotgun, which was \u201cloaded with single rounds.\u201d The two weapons retrieved from the stools included a Ruger Model .22 revolver and a Smith and Wesson .357 Magnum. According to Moore, the Ruger \u201cwas loaded with six live .22 caliber rounds in it,\u201d and the Smith and Wesson was \u201cloaded with six rounds of live ammunition.\u201d The weapons seized from the kitchen table included a Ruger Super Blackhawk .44 Magnum revolver and a Berreta semiautomatic .22 caliber handgun. The Ruger Super Blackhawk \u201cwas loaded with six rounds of .44 Magnum ammo.\u201d Moore testified that it appeared that, through the use of a \u201cmetal object,\u201d someone \u201cactually gouged the metal numerous times in an attempt to deface the serial number.\u201d The Berreta was loaded \u201cwith one in the chamber as well as five additional rounds and the magazine in the weapon.\u201d It, too, appeared to have been \u201cscraped and scratched as if someone had attempted to remove off the serial number from the weapon.\u201d However, the police were able to discern the serial numbers on both the Ruger and the Berreta.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In reviewing a sketch of the first floor of the house, which was \u201cnot to scale,\u201d Moore confirmed that it was \u201ca fair representation of the layout of the home.\u201d According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Moore, the living room was the \u201csame width\u201d as the kitchen and \u201c[m]aybe 14 feet or so long, 16 feet tops.\u201d Describing the sketch of the premises, Moore stated: \u201cIt contains where the table was placed inside of the kitchen, where that shelf, the two stools are put together and acted as a shelf where the two handguns were recovered from ... the kitchen. The closet, where the stove and refrigerator or [sic] were positioned in there....\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The State also presented five photographs to the jury. According to Moore, one photograph \u201cdepicts the top of the trash bag ... found in the kitchen with all the plastic baggies, partial baggies sitting on top of it.\u201d With respect to a third photograph, Moore stated: \u201cThis is a picture of the top of the stove as we found it that day to the right-hand corner, bottom right corner of the stove, you see that\u2019s the marijuana, suspected marijuana, that was located there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Referring to the next photograph, Moore testified: \u201cThis is a picture of the small stand or the two stools that were placed together that were located to the left of the kitchen table in which two of the revolvers were recovered from. This is as they were found.... The stand is right there. That\u2019s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>kitchen table [next to it], and that\u2019s the stand as soon as you come in [through the hallway entrance].\u201d As to the final photograph, Trooper Moore said: \u201cThis is a picture of the kitchen table. It depicts the revolver on the left-hand side of the table. The semiautomatic, we actually unloaded to make it safe.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The following testimony is pertinent with respect to the alleged drug operation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Trooper Moore, can you explain the significance of the packaging of the marijuana as it relates to personal consumption versus someone dealing drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">[TROOPER MOORE]: Combined with the scales, plastic baggies and stuff that were there, the marijuana was broken down into individual amounts as you have found it there. It wasn\u2019t any kind of bulk matter. It was sold in what is commonly sold as 10 or 20 dollar bags, depending on who the seller is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">They were readily accessible. It was pretty apparent that they were probably there for whoever the next customer may be to come up to purchase the marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Can you explain or describe to the jury the significance of the scales and how that relates to your thought regarding personal consumption?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">[TROOPER MOORE]: Normal persons that are going to use, be it smoke marijuana, ingest some type of cocaine or other substance, they normally don\u2019t weigh it ... Scales, what we find are permanently used to reweigh and help package additional quantities ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: The packaging devices or the remainder of the bags that were located in the trash, explain the significance of those as it relates to the individual who would be using drugs versus an individual who would be selling them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">[TROOPER MOORE]: Persons that want to buy or us e the drug, they normally buy it already packaged. It\u2019s already in that little knot I described earlier or that small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>plastic bag. They normally don\u2019t have the need to break it down into small baggies and cut it up, and upon looking at those baggies, there were several baggies there. There were probably 20 to 30 baggies that were in that trash can that had been cut or been manufactured or changed to what I recognized to be consistent with a person involved in the drug trade or distribution of drugs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Can you explain to the jury whether individuals work together in a drug dealing business or is it solely a sole proprietorship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">[TROOPER MOORE]: No sir. Now days, [sic] everybody tries to find a partner, some kind of team player, if you will, to work with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Can you think of any legitimate reason why a user of controlled dangerous substances would have the remnants of those baggies that you saw at this residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">[TROOPER MOORE]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">According to Trooper Moore, \u201cthe majority of drug dealers\u201d in the county \u201carm themselves for fear ... of other drug dealers\u201d robbing them. The following exchange is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: What again, as an expert, <em>what is the significance of those firearms </em>coupled with the drugs and the circumstances within that house? [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>[TROOPER MOORE]: <em>The persons in this house had either been robbed or were anticipating being robbed by someone. </em>There is no doubt in my mind that they had armed themselves just for that purpose. They were either attempting to or going to retaliate against somebody or something was out there that we didn\u2019t know about, about some of, be it turf war, drug war, something going on. I mean, <em>that\u2019s very unusual to find that amount of guns. They were open to everybody in the house. Anybody in the house could have been armed at any given second.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><em>The people in the kitchen were just a matter of feet from all the guns. </em>The people in the living live [sic] room could get to them in five or six short steps. <em>Those guns were placed so that anybody in that residence could have access to them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Is there any significance regarding the location of the marijuana, its proximity to an entry or exit of a residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">[TROOPER MOORE]: During the controlled purchases which we made that day, given the information we received leading up to that day, was that the side door, <em>the kitchen area is where the dealing went as well as where the guns were, </em>so it made common sense to us, perfect sense, that once we went in, that was there because <em>that\u2019s the sales room more or less. That\u2019s where they conduct their business..</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\"><em>That\u2019s where they are prepared to defend themselves or what have you with the guns, </em>and it is easy access for the drugs that they have there. They can come in here, they get it here, a short business, and they are gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: In your training and experience, if these firearms were being possessed for the protection of the property, just the residence, itself, is there any reason why those firearms would be loaded and left out in the fashion that they were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>[TROOPER MOORE]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: What does that indicate to you? [TROOPER MOORE]: <em>That they were there primarily for the drug dealers for the dealing that was going on to protect their profit or to fend off or do what they had to do to help their drug business.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: To your knowledge, was there anything within that residence that prohibited or prevented Mr. Handy from having access to those firearms? [TROOPER MOORE]: As I said, <em>anybody in that living room, in that kitchen were just a few steps away from any of those guns.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">On cross-examination, Trooper Moore conceded that, prior to the night of the raid, the police \u201chadn\u2019t actually sat and conducted any kind of lengthy surveillance\u201d of the house, although they had \u201cheard information about it.\u201d He identified Latonya Smith as the tenant and sole adult who resided at the residence, along with her two small children, who were present during the raid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moore was not sure whether appellant lived at the house. A man referred to as \u201cMr. Brown\u201d was also present. When Brown tried to run through the front door of the house as the police made their entry, Moore tackled him. Brown \u201chad some drugs on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Defense counsel questioned Moore about some of the contraband admitted into evidence. With respect to the scale, Trooper Moore stated that it was a \u201c[h]igh precision pocket balance,\u201d which could be used for purposes other than to weigh drugs. Moore confirmed that the marijuana seized by the police weighed \u201cabout six grams,\u201d and that each of the \u201clittle bags\u201d weighed \u201cabout a gram,\u201d which \u201cwould represent 5, 10, to $20.\u201d The trace amounts of cocaine were too small for the police to weigh. Moore also acknowledged that the guns confiscated from the kitchen were \u201cnot illegal in and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>themselves.\u201d Although the police attempted to obtain fingerprints from the weapons, the lab technician found \u201c[n]one of any evidentiary value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">On redirect, Trooper Moore clarified that although the weapons seized at the house were generally legal, it was illegal for a person under 21 years of age to possess them. He also explained that it is not uncommon for an individual participating in a drug operation not to have any currency. He stated: \u201cNormally, one person will sell, distribute or carry, and another person will be the money man. That way if they get caught, they don\u2019t all get caught with one pile, and they lose all of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defense moved for judgment of acquittal. As to the marijuana, the defense argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">We move for judgment of acquittal because there has been no testimony that my client possessed the marijuana, that he knew the marijuana was on the table, that he exercised any dominion and control over the marijuana ... It\u2019s not his house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The defense made similar arguments with respect to possession of the sandwich baggies, scale, and razor blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The prosecutor responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">Your Honor, there are several factors in determining possession and certainly the knowledge element, unless there is an admission, you are never going to know exactly what a person is thinking, so you have to infer intent or the thought process through the totality of the circumstances. And given the location of the marijuana, given the location of other contraband which would support knowledge of all the contraband within the residence, certainly the contraband located in the kitchen which is what we are talking about here, that would support his knowledge, and I believe that in the light most favorable to the State, there is ample evidence of joint constructive possession with the other occupants within the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The court denied the motion, based on \u201cthe proximity and the other surrounding circumstances.... \u201d As to the drug trafficking charges, defense counsel then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">I move for judgment of acquittal each [sic] of those counts for the same reasons, and that is the State has failed to prove that there was a nexus between the guns on the tables and the opinion testimony by the officer that he thought a drug trafficking crime had occurred. That the State did not sufficiently prove that any drug trafficking crime occurred, except that there were drugs present where some firearms were present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">Further, there was no testimony that these were regulated firearms which I think is a necessary element. And there has been no argument, or there has been no testimony, I would submit, that my client possessed or used those drugs[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] in relation to any drug \u2014 or participated in any drug trafficking crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The State responded: \u2018Your Honor, it\u2019s a matter of law. And included in the instruction submitted to the Court that the handgun is a regulated firearm. Handguns have been introduced into evidence.\u201d The court denied the motion, stating: \u201cThere is a sufficient nexus at this point that a rationale [sic] trier or fact could find the essential elements of those charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Regarding the charges of underage possession of a regulated firearm, counsel for the defense moved for judgment of acquittal \u201cfor the same reason,\u201d and further asserted that the State \u201cfailed to prove [appellant] is under the age of 21.\u201d Finally, the defense moved for judgment of acquittal as to the charge of altering a serial number on a firearm on the ground that the State had failed to prove that appellant possessed the firearm in question. The court reserved ruling on the underage possession charges and denied the motion with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the alteration of a serial number charge, noting that \u201cif the jury can find possession ... there is a presumption he is the one who obliterated it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Thereafter, the defense called Handy as its only witness. Handy confirmed that he gave his birth date (October 22, 1986) to the police when they asked for it. Appellant testified that he lived with his mother at 648 West Main Street in Salisbury, and confirmed that he was in Salisbury on the night of February 7, 2005. He described the course of events as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">I was coming from my house on February 7th, and my friend, Gary Simpson, was at the store, I was coming from down the street because I just got finished eating with my mom, and he asked me, did I want to go to 115 and deliver a video game?[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] And</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnE\">I told him, yes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">So he said we had to go to his house first. So we went to his house. I had to go get my jacket because it was cold outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">So then his mother told him to be back after he gets done delivering the game. So we go there. He delivers the game, and he was chit-chatting a little bit and just as we was about to leave, the police came in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Handy claimed that he arrived at the house in question \u201c[l]ike two to three minutes\u201d before the police entered. According to Handy, he had never been at that house before, although he knew who lived there. He recalled that he was in the living room when the police arrived, while Gary was in the kitchen. When asked to describe what happened when the police entered, he responded: \u201cThey came in, and they came in with guns and stuff, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on. They said, get down on the ground, so that\u2019s what I did. Then the officer that was arresting me, he grabbed me up, threw me into the kitchen and then hit me in the face. Then he put me under arrest.\u201d Appellant had no guns, ammunition, drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>or drug paraphernalia on his person. Indeed, he claimed that the first time he saw the guns was \u201cwhen [he] went in there,\u201d and he denied knowing that there were guns on the kitchen table or elsewhere. Handy also denied that the marijuana or any of the other contraband belonged to him. In particular, appellant denied any knowledge of the razor blade and the scale on the kitchen table, and claimed that he was not aware that \u201cany of those guns or drugs or paraphernalia were in the kitchen.\u201d He responded in the negative when asked if he had \u201ceven gone in the kitchen before the police officers pushed [him] in the kitchen ...\u201d Further, he stated that he did not smoke any marijuana while he was at the house, and that nobody had smoked it in his presence. When asked whether anybody tried to speak with him after his arrest, Handy said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure which one of the officers it was, but he asked me if we was to do a fingerprint on any of these guns, would my fingerprints be on them, and I told him no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On cross-examination, appellant reiterated that Latonya Smith lived at the house. Appellant was not sure what time he arrived at the residence, but he had left his own house \u201caround 7:30.\u201d From his house, Handy went to a store called \u201cSandi\u2019s One Stop,\u201d to \u201cget something to drink,\u201d and unexpectedly encountered Gary. It took him \u201clike a minute, minute or two\u201d to get to the store, and he was at the store \u201c[f]or a minute\u201d before he left with Gary to go to Gary\u2019s house. According to appellant, it took the pair \u201c[a]bout five minutes\u201d to get to Gary\u2019s, and they only stayed at Gary\u2019s house for \u201cone to two minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Appellant recalled that he entered Smith\u2019s house through the front door, and there were \u201cjust a whole lot of people\u201d at the house. He saw Ms. Smith, but he did not recognize any of the other people who were there. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: When you \u2014 so it is your testimony this afternoon that you didn\u2019t run into the kitchen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: So Detective Tilghman who testified this morning, he\u2019s lying?[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">[APPELLANT]: I didn\u2019t run at him when the police came in. They came in there. They was like, get down on the ground. I didn\u2019t do nothing but get on the ground. I never ran at them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: So Detective Tilghman is lying? [APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In rebuttal, the State recalled Trooper Moore. He stated that, during his surveillance of the residence, he was positioned \u201c[m]aybe 45 to 50 yards away\u201d from the house, and \u201cboth doors\u201d were visible. He was certain that nobody had entered the front door during his watch; the police informant had entered through the side door of the house. Moore testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">From my vantage points [sic] in watching it, you could see anybody that came up and down the street as well as passed by in front of the residence. The driveway leading up to the right side of the residence where the side door was, you could see portions of the front yard just to the opposite side of the front porch, the front porch, itself, the front door as well as the side door. You could see anybody that came in and out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">I actually observed \u2014 there is [sic] cat or it turned out to be a cat, I thought it was some kind of rat, skunk. It was fairly close. Everything was visible. Lighting wasn\u2019t bad, wasn\u2019t an issue. You could have see [sic] anybody that came or went from that residence in and around that yard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afz\">On cross-examination, Moore confirmed that \u201cit was dark that night,\u201d but \u201c[i]t was well lit enough\u201d so that he was able to see the cat. He also confirmed that, at the time, he had been \u201ctrying to coordinate with [the other officers] the execution of the search warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">At the close of evidence, counsel for the defense renewed the motion for judgment of acquittal. The court again denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the motion. As noted, appellant was convicted of numerous offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The court held a sentencing hearing on July 1, 2005, at which the State argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">Your Honor, I have had the occasion to run Mr. Handy\u2019s juvenile history ... these would be his first adult convictions. However, Mr. Handy does have two commitments on his record. He has an extremely lengthy history of contact with the juvenile justice system----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">And obviously the State doesn\u2019t need to belabor the point that guns and drugs are about as bad a combination as you can get in this county or any other place in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">Mr. Handy is exposed under the firearm and drug trafficking crimes to five years without parole under four counts. And while the legislature has provided or has not excluded the possibility of running those times concurrent with one another, I don\u2019t know that that is necessarily the appropriate course. I do know that, however, whatever you sentence, the maximum on those counts would be 20 years. You have to impose the minimum mandatory of five and that five is without parole ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Defense counsel provided the court with information as to the sentences imposed on four others charged in the incident. Only one received a sentence as large as six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The court observed that appellant\u2019s juvenile record was \u201chorrendous, including 20 prior offenses in the juvenile system including six assaults, three thefts, one robbery, one unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, the others being disorderly conduct and malicious destruction, two commitments.\u201d Thereafter, the court imposed a total sentence of fifteen years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appellant argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his convictions, because it faded to show that he \u201cexercised any dominion or control over the contraband.\u201d As Handy notes, of the eight adults found in the house at the time of the police raid, Ms. Smith was the only person who actually lived at the premises. He adds: \u201cThere was no evidence, whatsoever, that Appellant ever slept there or even spent more than \u2018about and hour\u2019 in that house,\u201d and \u201cno evidence tied him to anything at all in the house____\u201d Handy continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Appellant was not asleep at that time, there was no evidence that Appellant was smoking marijuana, much less that he exercised dominion or control over, the baggies of marijuana, the firearms, or the paraphernalia. Mere presence when others are smoking marijuana, does not make a person guilty of possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Handy adds that no marijuana or contraband, including \u201cparaphernalia, weapons, drugs, firearms, rolling papers, razor blades, ammunition, or any \u2018significant amount of money,\u2019\u201d were found on his person. Moreover, he notes that \u201c[t]he police found no fingerprints \u2018of any evidentiary value\u2019 on any of the firearms,\u201d he \u201cmade no incriminating statements,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u201cthe police never even suggested that he appeared to be under the influence of marijuana.\u201d Appellant elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">It is not enough, that an individual was in close proximity to contraband so that he <em>could have </em>exercised dominion or control over it. For example, a guest at a party where marijuana is being smoked by others is not guilty of possession of marijuana, if he is offered a puff but, not wishing to partake, declines the offer. Even though the guest was in close proximity to the contraband and knew of its presence, he is not guilty of possession, because he did not exercise any dominion or control over it. (Emphasis in brief.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Analyzing the factors set forth in <em>Folk v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 518, 275 A.2d 184 (1971), discussed <em>infra, </em>the State maintains that \u201cthree of the four determining factors are present\u201d in this case. First, the State points out that \u201cHandy was in very close proximity to the contraband\u201d when the police raided the residence. Moreover, it notes that the firearms were \u201cin plain sight on the kitchen table\u201d at the time of the arrest; the \u201cdigital scale, empty plastic sandwich bags, and a razor\u201d were also visible; and the other contraband seized by the police was also easily accessible and in the \u201csame \u2018very small\u2019 room as Handy.\u201d In the State\u2019s view, the fact that the guns, drugs, and paraphernalia were in \u201cplain sight\u201d supports the conclusion that appellant \u201chad knowledge of the contraband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In addition, the State argues that the circumstances of Handy\u2019s presence support \u201ca reasonable inference that he was involved in the use of marijuana and the handguns.\u201d In this regard, it points out that \u201cwhen the police entered the kitchen, Handy ran toward the entry team and attempted to get past them, presumably to leave through the door the team entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The standard of review for the sufficiency of evidence is well settled. We must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). <em>See Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821 (2002); <em>White v. State, </em>363 Md. 150, 162, 767 A.2d 855 (2001); <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). But, \u201cit is not the function of the appellate court to undertake a review of the record that would amount to a retrial of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Pagotto, </em>361 Md. 528, 533, 762 A.2d 97 (2000). Nor is it the function of the appellate court to determine the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence. <em>Jones v. State, </em>343 Md. 448, 465, 682 A.2d 248 (1996); <em>McCoy v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 535, 537, 703 A.2d 237 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 235, 707 A.2d 1329 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Of import here, the same standard applies to all criminal cases, including those resting upon circumstantial evidence. <em>Jensen v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 103, 117-120, 732 A.2d 319, <em>cert. denied, </em>356 Md. 178, 738 A.2d 855 (1999). \u201c[C]ircumstantial evidence alone is \u2018sufficient to support a conviction, provided the circumstances support rational inferences from which the trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Painter v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 1, 11, 848 A.2d 692 (2004) (citation omitted). <em>Accord Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 226, 627 A.2d 1029 (1993); <em>Wilson v.

State, </em>342 Md. 392, 400, 676 A.2d 80 (1996), \u201c \u2018[cjircumstantial evidence is as persuasive as direct evidence.

State, </em>346 Md. 452, 458-59, 697 A.2d 462 (1997). \u201cPossess\u201d under \u00a7 5-101(u) of the Criminal Law Article \u201cmeans to exercise actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u201d \u201c \u2018Control\u2019 of a controlled dangerous substance has been defined as the exercise of a \u2018restraining or directing influence over\u2019 the thing allegedly possessed.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 457, 697 A.2d 462; <em>see McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Contraband need not be found on a defendant\u2019s person in order to establish possession. <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 432, 842 A.2d 716 (2004). To prove possession of contraband, whether actual or constructive, joint or individual, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused knew \u201cof both the presence and the general character or illicit nature of the substance.\u201d <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 651, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). Thus, \u201c[a]n individual\u2019s knowledge of the contraband is a key element in finding that individual guilty of possessing it ...\u201d <em>Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 432, 842 A.2d 716. Indeed, knowledge of the presence of an object is generally a prerequisite to the exercise of dominion and control. <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 649, 547 A.2d 1041. Knowledge \u201cmay be proven by circumstantial evidence and by inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651, 547 A.2d 1041. <em>See White, </em>363 Md. at 161, 767 A.2d 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>We turn to review the case law that is pertinent to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In <em>Folk v. State, supra, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 275 A.2d 184, the Court discussed constructive possession of contraband. We observed that four factors formed \u201c[t]he common thread\u201d of the cases sustaining convictions based on a theory of joint possession, id at 518, 275 A.2d 184:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">1) proximity between the defendant and the contraband, 2) the fact that the contraband was within the view or otherwise within the knowledge of the defendant, 3) ownership or some possessory right in the premises or the automobile in which the contraband is found, or 4) the presence of circumstances from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the defendant was participating with others in the mutual use and enjoyment of the contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Although most of the cases applying the <em>Folk </em>factors concern constructive possession of illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia, this Court has employed the same analysis in cases involving constructive possession of other contraband. <em>See, e.g., McIntyre v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 504, 521-22, 897 A.2d 296 (2006) (applying the factors to possession of child pornography); <em>Samuels v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 486, 495, 459 A.2d 213 (1983) (applying the analysis to possession of stolen goods). In <em>McDonald v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 371, 785 A.2d 836 (2001), we addressed the issue of constructive possession of a handgun. Quoting <em>Price v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 487, 499, 681 A.2d 1206 (1996),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we recognized that \u201c \u2018the proximity between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>defendant and the contraband and the fact that the contraband was within the view ... of the defendant\u2019 \u201d were among the \u201cseveral factors\u201d relevant to the analysis. <em>McDonald, </em>141 Md.App. at 380, 785 A.2d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In <em>McDonald, </em>the weapon was found on the floor of the car in which the defendant was riding, and the defendant was \u201cthe only person in the back seat of the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He was also \u201cthe person closest to the weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the police officer saw the defendant \u201creaching down to place something on the floorboard,\u201d and observed \u201cthe butt of a handgun sticking out between appellant\u2019s feet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We regarded the evidence as sufficient to support a finding that the defendant constructively possessed the handgun, and that he \u201cput it on the floor in an attempt to hide it from the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 785 A.2d 836. <em>See also State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 550, 823 A.2d 664 (2003)(holding the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the lessee driver of a vehicle had knowingly transported a handgun recovered from the trunk of the vehicle in question).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\"><em>Cook v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 122, 578 A.2d 283 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 502, 583 A.2d 276 (1991), a case concerning the constructive possession of narcotics, is particularly analogous to the case <em>sub judice. </em>On appeal, Martin Cook and William Darby challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. <em>Id, </em>at 126, 578 A.2d 283. Applying the <em>Folk </em>factors as to constructive possession, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">Significantly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>three of the above elements are present. When the police executed the raid, they found appellants <em>within several feet </em>of a table laden with cocaine and packaging paraphernalia. The cocaine and accompanying paraphernalia <em>were not secreted away, and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>one could not conclude, by any stretch of the imagination, that appellants were unaware of its presence. </em>The house was one from which the police had observed a man exit on several occasions to conduct drug transactions. The house was sparsely furnished and was without electricity. <em>This evidence, in the expert opinion of Officer Trogdon, indicated that the house was being used as a base for a drag operation in which the appellants played a role. Therefore, despite the lack of proof that appellants had a proprietary or possessory interest in the house, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that appellants exercised joint and constructive possession of the cocaine.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 134-35, 578 A.2d 283 (emphasis added). <em>See also Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 443, 842 A.2d 716 (finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the passenger\u2019s convictions for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia found \u201cstrewn throughout\u201d the inside of a stolen vehicle); <em>In re Ondrel M., </em>173 Md.App. 223, 236, 918 A.2d 543 (2007) (holding the evidence sufficient to support a finding that the juvenile, a front seat passenger of a vehicle occupied by four persons, was in possession of marijuana recovered from a crumpled piece of newspaper behind the driver\u2019s seat); <em>Larocca v.

Shortly thereafter, the defendant was arrested as he exited from a door leading out of the basement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">When the police entered the basement, they found three \u201copen or partially opened drawers\u201d that contained several small baggies of marijuana, a small digital scale with white residue, and a dinner plate with a razor blade and white residue on its surface. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 796 A.2d 821. No drugs or paraphernalia were found on the defendant\u2019s person, however. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 796 A.2d 821. In reversing Moye\u2019s drug convictions, the Court of Appeals said, <em>id. </em>at 17-18, 796 A.2d 821:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">[W]e are left with nothing but speculation as to Moye\u2019s knowledge or exercise of dominion or control over the drugs and paraphernalia found in the [couple\u2019s] basement. Similar to the defendant in <em>Taylor, </em>Moye did not have any ownership or possessory right in the premises where the drugs and paraphernalia were found ... No evidence was adduced at trial as to how long Moye had been staying at the [couple\u2019s] home. On this record, therefore, we cannot conclude that Moye had any ownership or possessory right to or in the [couple\u2019s] home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">As to the proximity factor, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 18, 796 A.2d 821:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">There is also nothing in the record establishing Moye\u2019s proximity to the drugs during the time he was in the basement. The evidence failed to establish where Moye was located in the basement in relation to the substances in question and the duration of his sojourn. The trial testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ny established that one of the officers observed Moye looking out of a window at the back of the basement shortly before he exited the house. The record does not indicate where the window at the back of the basement was in relation to the drugs and paraphernalia found in the counter drawers. The photographs entered in evidence at trial, however, show that the window above the counter area where the drugs were found was covered completely with cardboard, which would have made it impossible for the police to have observed Moye through that vantage point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Moreover, the Court determined that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to discern whether, \u201cduring the time [the defendant] traveled into the basement from the first floor of the home prior to exiting through the basement door, he had, in fact, stood over the drawers in the counter and had the \u2018plain view\u2019 vantage point urged by the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 796 A.2d 821. The Court reasoned, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">[T]here were no facts established at trial as to whether Moye was present in the room with the drugs for any given amount of time other than to say that he left [the couple\u2019s] home through the basement door. The State offered no evidence to suggest any relationship between [the basement tenant] and Moye which would have established that Moye frequented the basement ... or that he was aware of what items were stored in the drawers of the counter area. Thus, we are confronted with a situation where a person has been convicted of possessing controlled dangerous substances and yet we cannot gauge whether he even knew the contraband was in the basement and controlled or exercised dominion over the CDS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">We also conclude that based on the evidence in this record, no reasonable inference could be drawn that Moye was participating with others in the mutual enjoyment of the contraband. There is no evidence concerning whether Moye [or the other occupants] were observed using drugs on the night in question. Although the facts may lead a trier of fact to believe that <em>sememe </em>may have been using marijuana in the ... home, the evidence fails to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>who </em>may have been using it, and <em>when </em>such use may have taken place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">(Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See also White, </em>363 Md. at 166-67, 767 A.2d 855 (holding the evidence insufficient to support a finding that the defendant, a front seat passenger in a car owned by the driver, possessed cocaine recovered from inside a box of pots and pans in the trunk of the vehicle); <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 459, 697 A.2d 462 (finding the evidence insufficient to establish that the defendant, one of four occupants of a hotel room, constructively possessed marijuana concealed in a container belonging to another, although \u201cmarijuana had been smoked recently\u201d in the room where the defendant was present); <em>Livingston v.

We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The evidence supported a finding that appellant was in close proximity to the contraband. As we have seen, appellant was in the kitchen at the time of the trial, where the contraband was located. Detective Tilghman testified that the kitchen was small, with a length of only \u201cabout fifteen feet.\u201d When the police entered the home, appellant \u201cwas in arms reach of at least four firearms,\u201d as well as the drugs and paraphernalia. Similarly, Trooper Moore stated that the \u201ckitchen wasn\u2019t that big,\u201d and estimated it was \u201c12 feet at most in length\u201d or perhaps \u201c8 by 10 total.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Trooper Moore also offered his expert opinion with respect to the significance of the firearms coupled with the drugs in the house. His testimony, discussed earlier, indicated that the individuals in the kitchen were engaged in a large-scale drug operation. He stated: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that they had armed themselves just for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Although Trooper Moore could smell \u201cburnt marijuana,\u201d under <em>Taylor, </em>846 Md. at 459, 697 A.2d 462, that evidence did not establish that appellant had used the drug. But, the evidence showed the house was a base for a drug operation in which, in the light most favorable to the State, Handy \u201cplayed a role.\u201d <em>See Cook, </em>84 Md.App. at 134-35, 578 A.2d 283. Notably, Detective Tilgman stated that appellant ran \u201cfour or five steps\u201d across the kitchen before he was subdued. In <em>Jason v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 102, 262 A.2d 774, <em>cert. denied, </em>258 Md. 728 (1970), the Court noted that one of the defendants \u201cattempted to flee\u201d from the police, and we held the evidence sufficient to support a finding of constructive possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>narcotics and paraphernalia found in various places throughout the premises in question. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 262 A.2d 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">To be sure, the evidence did not establish that appellant had a possessory interest in the premises; only Latonya Smith and her children resided there. Appellant\u2019s lack of a possessory interest is not dispositive, however. Under <em>Cook, </em>84 Md.App. at 134-35, 578 A.2d 283, \u201cdespite the lack of proof that [appellant] had a proprietary or possessory interest in the house,\u201d the presence of the other three <em>Folk </em>elements permitted the jury to conclude that appellant exercised constructive possession of the contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Appellant testified at trial that he was at the house only \u201ctwo or three minutes\u201d before the police raid. In his brief, he states: \u201cThere was no evidence, whatsoever, that Appellant ever slept [at the premises] or even spent more than \u2018about an hour\u2019 in that house.\u201d But, appellant was present with permission. Moreover, Trooper Moore testified that he conducted a physical surveillance of the residence \u201cfor about an hour and 15 minutes\u201d before the police made their entry, and he did not see anyone enter the residence during that time. Thus, appellant\u2019s testimony that he was at the house only \u201ctwo or three minutes\u201d before the police raid was inconsistent with Moore\u2019s testimony that no one had entered the house through the front door during his watch of one hour and fifteen minutes. Because appellant was not seen entering the house, the jury could easily infer that appellant was present before the surveillance began, and thus was inside for the entire length of the surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In addition, the evidence supported a finding that the marijuana and guns were in appellant\u2019s \u201cplain view,\u201d particularly given the length of time he was in the house. Detective Tilghman testified that, \u201cimmediately\u201d upon entering the kitchen, he observed \u201ctwo firearms, one large revolver and one small semiautomatic handgun on the kitchen table, and then two other large revolvers on top of two stools.\u201d He stated: \u201cI would have been blind not to see them. It was that blatant.\u201d Trooper Moore\u2019s testimony was to the same effect. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>photographs of the table and the stools corroborated the officers\u2019 testimony. Clearly, appellant was present long enough, in a small house, to see the objects located in plain view in a public part of the house. And, as we have seen, appellant was found in the same room of the house where the contraband was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The testimony showed that the razor blade, scale, and empty sandwich bags were on the kitchen table, although neither the razor blade nor the scale is discernable in the photograph. The photograph depicts two commercial boxes, which presumably contained the sandwich bags. The table appears to be cluttered with several other items, including a waste paper basket, a radio, several drink containers, and a fallen blind. As to the kitchen stove, the baggies filled with marijuana are discernable in the right-hand corner. The jury could have concluded that these objects would have been visible to someone in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We acknowledge that this is a close case. But, it was for the jury to decide whose version of events to believe. Clearly, the jury did not credit Handy\u2019s explanation for his presence in the house, nor was it required to do so. <em>See Acquah v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 29, 54, 686 A.2d 690 (1996) (\u201cThe jury is the trier of fact and is not obliged to believe the explanations or denials offered by the defendant.\u201d) Applying the cases discussed above, along with the standard of review, we cannot say that the jury\u2019s conclusion was unsupported by the evidence with respect to the possessory charges relating to the handguns, drugs, and paraphernalia</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Appellant was convicted of four counts of violating C.L. \u00a7 5-621, possession of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to a drug trafficking crime\u201d (Counts 9, 11, 12, 13), for which he received four separate sentences. For Counts 9 and 11, he received sentences of ten years, with all but five years suspended. Count 9 was to run consecutive to Count 2 (the drug trafficking charge), and Count 11 was to run consecutive to Count 9. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>For Counts 12 and 13, he received sentences of ten years, with all but 5 suspended, concurrent to Counts 9 and 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">C.L. \u00a7 5-602, the underlying drug trafficking crime, criminalizes possession with intent to distribute. C.L. \u00a7 5-621 proscribes possession of \u201ca firearm under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to the drug trafficking crime[.]\u201d C.L. \u00a7 5-621, captioned \u201cUse of weapon as separate crime,\u201d provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">(a) <em>Definitions. </em>\u2014 (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">(2) \u201cDrug trafficking crime\u201d means a felony or a conspiracy to commit a felony involving the possession, distribution, manufacture, or importation of a controlled dangerous substance under \u00a7\u00a7 5-602 through 5-609 and 5-614 of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">(b) <em>Prohibited. </em>\u2014 During and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, a person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">(1) possess a firearm under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to the drug trafficking crime ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">(c) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 (1) In addition to the sentence provided for the drug trafficking crime, a person who violates subsection (b) of this section is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">(i) for a first violation, imprisonment for not less than 5 years and not exceeding 20 years ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">Appellant challenges the imposition of \u201cmultiple consecutive sentences for each of four firearms that he was convicted of possessing, all consecutive to the sentence for the drug trafficking crime.\u201d He points out that, under C.L. \u00a7 5-602, he was convicted of \u201ca single \u2018drug trafficking crime,\u2019... <em>i.e., </em>the felony of possession with intent to distribute marijuana,\u201d and \u201cwas also convicted\u201d under C.L. \u00a7 5-621(b) of possession of a firearm \u201c \u2018under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>to the drug trafficking crime ... He asserts that \u00a7 5-621(c)(1), which prescribes the penalty for such convictions, \u201cdoes not address the issue of multiple firearms possessed during and in relation to the very same drug trafficking crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Handy rejects any suggestion that the General Assembly intended to permit the kind of sentence imposed here with respect to possession of multiple firearms. Appellant submits that \u201cthe intent of the Maryland legislature is clear, only with respect to providing a consecutive sentence for a single firearm violation, under Criminal Law Article \u00a7 5-621, and not with respect to possession of multiple firearms.\u201d He explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT3\">If the legislature meant to provide for a consecutive sentence for each firearm possessed, it could easily have said so. If maximum, consecutive sentences were permissible for each of the four firearms possessed, here, the maximum sentence, for \u201ca first violation,\u201d \u00a7 5-621(c)(l)(i), would be 80 years imprisonment, consecutive to the maximum sentence of five years for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. <em>See </em>Criminal Law Article, \u00a7\u00a7 5-602(2) and 5-607(a). In short, the Maryland legislature would have to have intended that a life sentence was permissible, for a \u201cfirst\u201d offense. The 18 year-old defendant, in this case, could be ordered to serve 85 years in prison, under that absurd theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Appellant does not argue that there was an insufficient nexus between the weapons and the drug trafficking crime. Such a claim would obviously lack merit. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>154 Md.App. 286, 309, 839 A.2d 769 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 Md. 618, 846 A.2d 402 (2004), we said: \u201cIt is now well settled that the trier of fact is entitled to find that when (1) drugs are discovered under circumstances that indicate the person possessing those drugs intended to distribute them, and (2) a gun is discovered in close proximity to the drugs, the gun was possessed \u2018in relation to\u2019 a drug trafficking crime.\u201d Rather, appellant asserts that the sentencing statute at issue here is ambiguous with respect to whether consecutive sentences may be imposed for the possession of multiple firearms during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>single \u201cdrug-trafficking crime.\u201d Therefore, he contends that \u201cthe rule of lenity applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Handy argues: \u201cWhere the statute is ambiguous and the legislative intent is not clear, the rule of lenity applies, and the defendant gets the benefit of the doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted.) In <em>Melgar v. State, </em>355 Md. 339, 347, 734 A.2d 712 (1999), the Court explained: \u201c[T]he rule of lenity instructs that a court \u2018not interpret a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the Legislature] intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347, 734 A.2d 712 (citations omitted) (alterations in <em>Melgar).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The State counters that appellant\u2019s constructive possession of \u201cfour distinct firearms\u201d resulted in \u201cfour separate violations of \u00a7 5 \u2014 621(b),\u201d and thus the trial court \u201cproperly imposed a separate sentence for each violation.\u201d In its view, \u201cThe plain language and legislative history of \u00a7 5-621 ... support separate convictions and sentences for each firearm possessed in connection with a drug trafficking offense.\u201d The State posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Brown v. State, </em>311 Md. 426, 434 [535 A.2d 485] (1988) defined \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d as \u201cwhat the legislature intended to be the act or course of conduct prohibited by the statute for purposes of a single conviction and sentence.\u201d Here, the central question is whether the legislature intended the prohibited act to be the possession of a firearm (with nexus to drug trafficking), or the drug trafficking offense itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">According to the State, \u201c[w]hen interpreting other statutes proscribing the possession of firearm [sic], this Court has determined that the unit of prosecution is the gun.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Looking to the legislative history of Article 27, \u00a7 281A, a former codification of C.L. \u00a7 5-621, the State argues that C.L. \u00a7 5-621(b) \u201cwas enacted to reduce [the risk of drug-related homicide] by making the possession of <em>any </em>firearm during a drug trafficking offense a separate felony.\u201d (Emphasis in brief.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s \u201cstacking\u201d contention, even though it could result in the imposition of an eighty-year prison term for a first-time offense, the State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">Many criminal statutes have maximum sentences that, if imposed consecutively in the appropriate circumstances, would render what Handy posits as \u201cabsurd\u201d results. A \u201cfirst offender\u201d who burglarizes four houses on the same block in one night could also properly be sentenced to eighty years in prison pursuant to Criminal Law \u00a7 6-202.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] It is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion whether such a sentence is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment \u201cprohibits cumulative punishment as well as successive prosecution.\u201d <em>Hubbard v.

Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Article 27, section 281A(b) provided that, \u201c \u2018[d]uring and in relation to any drug trafficking crime, a person who <em>uses, </em>wears, carries, or transports a firearm is guilty of a separate felony....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143 n. 3, 626 A.2d 946 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals reversed the petitioner\u2019s conviction under the statute, holding that \u201c \u2018use\u2019 requires that the defendant \u2018carry out a purpose or action\u2019 or \u2018make instrumental to an end or process\u2019 or \u2018apply to advantage\u2019 the firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 626 A.2d 946 (citation omitted). Notably, the codification at issue in <em>Harris </em>did not contain a provision comparable to C.L. \u00a7 5-621(b)(l), which makes it a crime to <em>\u201cpossess </em>a firearm under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to the drug trafficking crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See Johnson, </em>154 Md.App. at 306, 839 A.2d 769 (recognizing that, \u201c[i]n 1996, in response to <em>Harris, </em>the General Assembly amended section 281A(b) by expanding the crime to include a person who \u2018possesses\u2019 a firearm in conjunction with a drug trafficking offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In its interpretation of Art. 27, \u00a7 281A(b), the <em>Harris </em>Court referred to case law construing former Article 27, \u00a7 36B(d), which proscribed \u201c \u2018use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>331 Md. at 148, 626 A.2d 946.

Therefore, when it was passed, the Legislature knew, or, at least, is presumed to have known how we had defined \u201cuse.\u201d Possessed of that knowledge, the Legislature\u2019s proscription of \u201cuse\u201d without any clear indication that it intended that a different meaning be given the term leads inevitably to the conclusion that it adopted the definition we had theretofore given it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 147-50, 626 A.2d 946 (some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Further, the Court discussed the legislative history of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">As we have indicated, section 281A was enacted in 1989 as part of the Drug Kingpin Act.

Had the punishment of one who possesses a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime been the Legislature\u2019s goal, it would not have been necessary for it to delete that term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 150-52, 626 A.2d 946 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Thereafter, the Court considered the State\u2019s argument that case law interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), which the Court recognized as \u201cthe federal counterpart to section 281A(b),\u201d supported the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 154, 626 A.2d 946. The Court rejected the view of \u201c[t]he majority of federal courts\u201d; those courts held that \u201ca firearm is \u2018used,\u2019 for purposes of the statute, if possession is an integral part of the predicate offense or if the firearm is within easy reach and available to protect the user during the ongoing drug trafficking offense.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 156-57, 626 A.2d 946 (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">We stated earlier that section 281A(b), though similar in language to \u00a7 924(c)(1), contains language identical to section 36B, and \u201cuse\u201d in that statute has been interpreted, by this Court, as requiring conduct different from possession\u2014 an active, rather than passive, employment of a handgun. That interpretation, of which the Legislature was aware when it enacted section 281A(b), conflicts with the way \u201cuse\u201d has been interpreted by the majority of the federal courts construing \u00a7 924(c)(1). The interpretation given a federal statute ordinarily is persuasive in interpreting a state statute patterned upon the federal statute. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>case <em>sub judice, </em>not only is the authority interpreting the federal statute not uniform, but the legislative history of the state statute suggests that a different meaning of \u201cuses\u201d was intended, since the Legislature chose to use the same language in section 281A(b) as it had used in section 36B, knowing the gloss we had put on the latter. It follows that the General Assembly did not intend to equate \u201cuses\u201d with \u201cpossesses\u201d as the majority of federal courts have done. This is particularly so where, as here, the Legislature amended the statute specifically to delete \u201cpossess\u201d and replaced it with terms that are not, in all circumstances, its equivalent. We are obliged to follow the intent of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The State cites <em>Griffin v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 575, 579-80, 769 A.2d 259 (2001); <em>Manigault v.

The Court looked to the statutory text in concluding that \u201cthe legislative intent was that a person wearing, carrying, or transporting more than one handgun is guilty of more than one crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, the Court interpreted \u201cthe prohibition spelled out in the statute in the light of the legislative findings and declaration of policy ... the penalties authorized ... and the separate misdemeanor provisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Manigault, </em>61 Md.App. at 274, 486 A.2d 240, the defendant was convicted and sentenced separately for the possession of a single weapon used to perpetrate an assault upon two separate victims during \u201cthe course of a single criminal episode.\u201d The Court reversed one of the possession convictions, concluding that it was \u201can improper second conviction for the same, identical offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 486 A.2d 240.

The unit of prosecution is the victim. <em>With respect to the use of a handgun to perpetrate a crime of violence ..., the unit of prosecution is the crime of violence. </em>Assuming that the other elements have been proved, two victims imply two crimes of violence. That, in turn, implies two separate crimes of using a handgun to commit a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">With respect to the possession of a handgun ..., however, the unit of prosecution is the gun, not the victim. <em>Pinkett v.

Circuit in <em>U.S. v. Anderson, </em>59 F.3d 1323 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 999, 116 S.Ct. 542, 133 L.Ed.2d 445 (1995) (subsequent history omitted). In that case, the defendant received four convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), which were tied to a single \u201cpredicate offense\u201d of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 1324. In reversing three of the convictions,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 1327-28:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">[I]f Congress had for a moment contemplated \u2014 or intended the prospect \u2014 that a defendant would be charged, as was appellant, with four \u00a7 924(c)(1) violations appended to one underlying drug crime, we think it virtually inconceivable that Congress would have used the language of \u00a7 924(c)(1). It would have been all too easy to have written the words \u201ceach time\u201d or \u201con each occasion\u201d in the section to make that meaning clear ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">Section 924(c)(1) provides very serious penalties for repeated violations. The first conviction requires a five-year sentence, and the second and succeeding violations call for 20 years each. Under the government\u2019s interpretation, then, three or four \u201cuses\u201d or \u201ccarries\u201d during one underlying drug crime or crime of violence would, as a practical matter, bring a life sentence. If Congress had intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that result, we would of course honor the choice; but we think that if Congress had wished the statute to operate in that fashion, it would have used language making it obvious</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The court noted that the majority of its \u201csister circuits have determined that only one \u00a7 924(c)(1) violation can be appended to any single predicate crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328. According to the court, the federal circuits so holding have \u201crelied on two strands of analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first of those is that Congress\u2019s intent was to limit the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 to the underlying predicate offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The other rationale is that the statute is \u201cambiguous as to the appropriate unit of prosecution, and therefore the rule o f lenity\u201d should apply. <em>Id.

The statutory text does not clearly indicate that the Legislature intended to subject a defendant to multiple sentences for multiple weapons in connection with a single offense of a \u201cdrug trafficking crime.\u201d Nor does the legislative history of the statute clearly reveal the legislative intent.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And, some of the gun cases discussed above are distinguishable because the underlying offense prohibited in the statutes at issue was the act of possessing a gun. In contrast, the predicate offense here is that of drug trafficking, and the possessory handgun offense is tied to that crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">There has been a dramatic increase in the number of drug related homicides, especially among innocent victims. Current law does not make the mere possession of a handgun for possible future use illegal. This component would alter that situation. It provides for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\u2014 It makes the use or possession of any firearm during and in relationship to a drug trafficking crime a separate felony offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">\u2014 It provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years and a maximum sentence of up to 20 years.

Like its federal counterpart, C.L. \u00a7 5-621 provides very serious penalties. But, if the Legislature had intended multiple sentences for each weapon involved in a single drug trafficking offense, it could have explicitly so stated. Applying the rule of lenity, we hold that the unit of prosecution under C.L. \u00a7 5-621 is the drug offense, rather than the gun.

According to the sketch, which was admitted into evidence, the stove abutted the front wall of the kitchen, to the right of the entry-way to the living room. The table was positioned length-wise along the left wall of the kitchen. The stool shelf was situated on the rear wall, to the left of the entrance from the hallway connecting the side door to the kitchen. The sketch also showed that the closet was located on the front wall of the kitchen, immediately to the left of the living room entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Moore marked on the diagram the various locations of the marijuana, paraphernalia, and weapons seized from the kitchen table, stove, the two stools, and closet. Using a \"# 1,\u201d he indicated that the scale and razor blade were retrieved from the middle of the table. He also used a <em>\u201c# </em>1\u201d to mark the location of the marijuana on the right-hand side of the stove. He marked the location of the Ruger .22 and Wesson .357 Magnum with a \"# 3\u201d and \"# 5,\u201d respectively, on the left and right sides of the stools. In addition, Trooper Moore indicated the location of the Ruger .44 Magnum with a \"# 4,\u201d which he represented was on the side of the table closer to the hallway entrance. A \u201c# 6\u201d marked the location of the Berreta .22 caliber on the other side of the table, which was closer to the living room. Finally, he indicated with a \"# 7\u201d the placement of the Winchester .16 gauge shotgun on the right-hand side of the kitchen closet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\">. We did not find any testimony with respect to the denomination of the currency found on the stove. The photograph depicts what looks to be a $1 bill and a $10 or $20 bill.

Defense counsel initially objected to Trooper Moore's opinion testimony on the subject of the guns.
