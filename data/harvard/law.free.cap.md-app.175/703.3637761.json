Marcus contends that the circuit court erred in dismissing the exceptions. We agree that the exceptions should not have been dismissed. Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In Juvenile Petition No. 606237011, the State alleged that Marcus was delinquent and committed the following delinquent acts: wearing/carrying/transporting a handgun, wearing/carrying/transporting a dangerous or deadly weapon, and possessing a regulated firearm. An adjudicatory hearing was held before a juvenile master on September 14, 29, and October 5, 2006. Only two witnesses testified. The arresting police officer testified as the State\u2019s witness, and 14-year-old Marcus testified in his own defense. Their testimony was mostly compatible, but the police officer testified he observed Marcus throw down an item that turned out to be a revolver, whereas Marcus testified he never had possession of a gun, and that the object he had jettisoned as the police officer approached was a bag containing some marijuana. A fingerprint analysis of the gun, ordered by the State, was in progress and not completed by the conclusion of the hearing, but, to avoid further delay in completing the hearing, the State stipulated that Marcus\u2019s fingerprints were not on the gun. In her oral findings of fact at the conclusion of the adjudicatory hearing, the master stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The Court finds the testimony of the State\u2019s witness to be consistent and credible. And, also, finds, quite frankly, the Respondent\u2019s testimony to be consistent and credible, except for that one point. What was it that he threw? And, in that area, the Court finds that the State\u2019s witness was most consistent and credible. Therefore, finds that the State has met [its] burden beyond a reasonable doubt, [and] finds the facts sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The master thereafter entered a written recommended order dated October 6, 2006, and found all three counts sustained. The master\u2019s written findings that were set forth in the support of the master\u2019s recommendation that t he charges be sustained stated simply:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">[T]he following evidence was accepted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">The testimony of witnesses supported the sustained counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">Conflicting testimony concerning the sustained counts was resolved in favor of the witnesses for the State. Parties stipulated that Respondent\u2019s fingerprints were not found on the revolver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">A disposition hearing was held on November 3, 2006, at the conclusion of which the juvenile master entered a written recommendation that the court find that Marcus \u201cis a delinquent child.\u201d The master further recommended that Marcus be placed \u201cunder an order of probation to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services,\u201d and subject to a number of conditions during the indefinite period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Within five business days, on November 9, 2006, Marcus filed a \u201cNotice of Exception and Request for Hearing\u201d that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">Pursuant to Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, section 3-815(c) [sic] and Rule ll-lll(e) of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, please be advised that the Respondent excepts to the findings and proposed orders of Master Zakia Mahasa, on the 3rd day of November, 2006, in the above-captioned petition(s) and requests that the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>be set for a hearing de novo, before the Judge of this Honorable Court and in support of the exception, notes these errors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">Respondents council [sic] is excepting to Master Mahasa\u2019s findings at the adjudicatory hearing held on 10/6/06 and the disposition hearing on 11/3/06. Master Mahasa erred in her admission of an [sic] non experts [sic] testimony on the operability of a handgun over Respondents council [sic] objection. Moreover, Master Mahasa erred in her facts and findings in the adjudicatory and disposition hearing.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On December 8, 2006, the case was called for a hearing in the circuit court on Marcus\u2019s exceptions. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney moved for a postponement because of a calendar mixup that precluded the prosecuting attorney who had been handling the case from being present, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-nx\">[T]he State is requesting a postponement.... [T]he State did not know it was in today. That in addition, Judge Edward Hargadon has issued a policy that had to be filed in all exception hearing [sic], and it is my understanding, since I don\u2019t know the contents of the file that policy was not filed in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The pinch-hitting prosecutor was correct that no \u201cexceptions policy\u201d order similar to the one quoted in <em>Forster, supra, </em>398 Md. at 302-03, 920 A.2d 1049, had been filed in the present case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notwithstanding that fact, the presiding judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>took issue with Marcus\u2019s failure to comply with the policy of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City regarding the filing of exceptions in juvenile matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">THE COURT: ... I reviewed the Court file, and [, counsel,] it does not look like you complied with Judge Hargadon\u2019s policy pertaining to the filing of exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I would object to the policy. I filed exceptions on the ninth, I believe, of November ----Specifying what I was excepting to, and the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>tion request. And, what was the date of Judge Hargadon\u2019s Order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">THE COURT: There\u2019s no date in the Order ... but as I recall it went into effect early October.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">[Defense Counsel]: ... Your Honor, still I did file the exception and the exception does specifically state what I\u2019m excepting to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">[Prosecutor]: But it also requires that the excepting party file a Memo concerning the specific issues raised in the exceptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">In fact, the exceptions policy order quoted in <em>Forster v. Hargadon, supra, </em>398 Md. at 302-03, 920 A.2d 1049, only requires a memorandum to be filed \u201c[i]f the party filing an exception requests a hearing <em>on the record.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The exceptions policy order does not require such a memorandum if the party filing the exception requests a hearing <em>de novo. </em>Nevertheless, the presiding judge noted that Marcus had not filed any memorandum, and, even though no exceptions policy order had been entered in this case, continued the discussion as if such an order had been entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ald\">THE COURT: It says that in addition to the delivery of copies of the exception and memorandum to all parties, the party filing exceptions on [the record] shall deliver a copy of the exception and the memorandum to the presiding Judge, or if a Judge has not been designated to the Judge in charge. I checked[,] my office didn\u2019t get anything. It also says, \u2014 well, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I filed my exceptions[.][T]he law i[s] very clear that my Client is allowed an exception de novo hearing based on filing in the exceptions with the Clerk\u2019s office, which was properly done within five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>days. That is the law. The law that my Client is entitled to an exception de novo, as long as I file the exception within five days. That is what the law states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">THE COURT: But what does the Court \u2014 what does Judge Hargadon\u2019s policy say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, see the policy v.[sic] law. The law states that my Client is given the right to an exception de novo hearing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">THE COURT: No doubt about it, but as part of the law, administrative bodies also promulgate policies for the efficient administration of the law, and Judge Hargadon as the Judge in charge of Juvenile decided to implement a policy to make the law operate more efficiently. I realize your office sought a stay. The Court of Appeals has not acted and so the policy of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, according to Judge Hargadon and Judge Holland, unless and until the Court of Appeals stays the policy, the policy implementing the law will remain in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Well Your Honor, then I would argue that my Memorandum is included in the Notice of Exception, I filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">THE COURT: All right. Let\u2019s cut to the chase. This will be reset for [the prosecutor who had been handling the case] to be here. It will be reset for the State to summons [its] witnesses and it\u2019ll even be reset for [defense counsel] to comply with the policy. Pick a date, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I will be objecting to the reset, because in essence aren\u2019t you granting the State\u2019s postponement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">THE COURT: Yes, I am, but I\u2019m doing you a favor, because you didn\u2019t comply with the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">[Defense Counsel]: I understand that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\">THE COURT: Let me make it easy for you. You failed to comply with the policy, your exceptions [sic] dismissed. Thank you. I\u2019ll make it real easy for you. Your exceptions [sic] dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-13\">[Defense Counsel]: And, I object on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>THE COURT: Well object for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m going to object for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">THE COURT: Have a good day. Your exceptions [sic] dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">[Defense Counsel]: (inaudible) Postponement policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">THE COURT: I gave you half a loaf of bread. You didn\u2019t want it, you\u2019re [sic] exceptions [sic] dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">In the court\u2019s written order dated December 12, 2006, adopting the findings and disposition recommended by the master, the court recapped the ruling made at the hearing on Marcus\u2019s exceptions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">As a result of the Exception hearing in the above case(s), the Court finds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">... This Court ruled that the Exception request was not filed according to the [prosedures/guide lines] [sic] outlined by the Juvenile Administrative Judge. [Defense counsel] objected and requested that the Court proceed. The Court agreed to postpone the Exception due to the unavailability of the State and the fact that Counsel for the respondent had not complied with the Court\u2019s exception policy. Exception is dismissed by Court for failure to comply with the Court\u2019s exception policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">On December 14, 2006, Marcus noted an appeal to this Court from the circuit court\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">The single \u201cquestion presented\u201d in appellant\u2019s brief is: \u201cWhether [the court] erred in dismissing the exceptions.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Because we view the statement of exceptions filed by Marcus as sufficient to preserve his right to a <em>de novo </em>hearing, we answer appellant\u2019s question \u201cyes.\u201d We hold that the circuit court erred in basing its dismissal of the exceptions on the juvenile\u2019s alleged failure to comply with a local \u201cexception policy\u201d <em>that </em>\u2014 as <em>applied in this case </em>\u2014 purportedly imposed requirements beyond those set forth in Rule 11-111 and CJP \u00a7 3-807(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because appellant does not challenge the validity of either Rule 11-111 or CJP \u00a7 3-807 \u2014 and indeed, did not challenge either the rule or the statutory provision at the circuit court level \u2014 there is no dispute of the fact that both provisions are properly applicable to this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>no scheduling order was entered in this case \u2014 either in the Hargadon exceptions policy format or otherwise \u2014 we do not reach the issue of whether dismissal of the exceptions would have been an appropriate sanction for a party\u2019s failure to comply with a properly crafted scheduling order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Upon measuring Marcus\u2019s notice of exceptions against the plain language of the controlling State statute and rule, we conclude that Marcus was entitled to a <em>de novo </em>hearing on his exceptions. In the words of Rule 11 \u2014 111(c) and CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(4), Marcus was entitled to be heard <em>de novo </em>with respect to \u201cthe matters to which exceptions have been taken.\u201d The right to a <em>de novo </em>hearing before a judge is important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>because, as the Court of Appeals put it bluntly in <em>State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 599-600, 714 A.2d 841 (1998), \u201cit [is] clear from the rules and case law that masters have no judicial authority----In concise summation, masters are not judges, nor are they judicial officers.\u201d This is not to belittle the extremely valuable contribution masters make to the efficiency of the juvenile justice system, but, as the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Domingues v. Johnson, </em>323 Md. 486, 492, 593 A.2d 1133 (1991): \u201c \u2018Litigants ... in all judicial proceedings[ ] are entitled to have their cause determined ultimately by a duly qualified judge of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Ellis v. Ellis, </em>19 Md.App. 361, 365, 311 A.2d 428 (1973).)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Although the State contends that \u201cMarcus J. merely filed a bald exception and failed to \u2018specify those items to which [he] objected]\u2019 as required by Section 3-807(c)(l) and Rule 11-lll.c,\u201d our review of the Notice of Exception and Request for Hearing filed by Marcus leads us to conclude otherwise. Using language similar to the wording of the first sentence in Rule 11 \u2014 111(c) that provides \u201c[a]ny party may file exceptions to the master\u2019s proposed findings, conclusions, recommendations or proposed orders,\u201d appellant\u2019s timely notice of exceptions stated: \u201cthe Respondent excepts to the findings and proposed orders of Master Zakia Mahasa, on the 3rd day of November, 2006.\u201d The notice further stated: \u201cRespondent[\u2019]s coun[se]l is excepting to Master Mahasa\u2019s findings at the adjudicatory hearing held on 10/6/06 and the disposition hearing on 11/3/06____ Master Mahasa erred in her facts and findings in the adjudicatory and disposition hearing.\u201d In addition, the notice of exception pointed to the allegedly erroneous admission of opinion testimony, given by the police officer who was the State\u2019s only witness and who was not qualified as an expert, regarding the operability of the handgun Marcus was alleged to have possessed. In compliance with the second sentence of Rule ll-lll(c), the notice of exception further specified \u201cwhether the hearing is to be <em>de novo </em>or on the record,\u201d and stated that the appellant \u201crequests that the matter be set for a hearing <em>de novo.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The third sentence of Rule ll-lll(c) mandates that a hearing on the exceptions <em>shall </em>be promptly scheduled. The rule specifies: \u201cUpon the filing of exceptions, a prompt hearing shall be scheduled on the exceptions.\u201d There is no indication in this rule that the circuit court has discretion to decide <em>whether </em>to conduct a hearing <em>\u201con the </em>exceptions.\u201d This is consistent with the provision of CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(2) that specifies that a juvenile \u201cwho files exceptions may elect a hearing <em>de </em>novo....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Both the rule and the statute include the statement that \u201cthe hearing shall be limited to those matters to which exceptions have been taken.\u201d But we must reconcile and harmonize this limiting provision with the other language in CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(1) giving the parties the option of filing exceptions to <em>\u201call </em>of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we have considered whether the all-encompassing nature of Marcus\u2019s exception to the master\u2019s \u201cfacts and findings\u201d at both the adjudicatory hearing and the disposition hearing is sufficiently specific as to the nature of his complaint to satisfy the specificity requirement set forth in both Rule ll-lll(c) (the exceptions \u201cshall specify those items to which the party excepts\u201d) and CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(1) (the party \u201cshall specify those items to which the party objects\u201d). Although the appellant\u2019s exception is stated broadly, it does accurately and adequately communicate that Marcus was seeking a <em>de novo </em>hearing on all issues, as he was entitled to elect. As noted above, CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(l) specifically provides that any party \u201cmay file written exceptions to any <em>or all </em>of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations____\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because a juvenile is, in fact, entitled to elect a <em>de novo </em>hearing on exceptions, and is entitled to file exceptions to \u201call of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations,\u201d we view the exceptions filed by Marcus as sufficiently specific to communicate his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>election to avail himself of that right. Indeed, requiring a party who elects a <em>de novo </em>hearing with respect to \u201call of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations\u201d to state in greater detail what those findings and recommendations were would be redundant and serve no useful purpose. We conclude that the statute and rule do not impose such a hurdle in the path of a party seeking a <em>de novo </em>hearing as to all matters decided by the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand this case for a <em>de novo </em>hearing on appellant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED.

In <em>Forster </em>v. <em>Hargadon, </em>398 Md. 298, 299-301, 920 A.2d 1049 (2007), the Court of Appeals gave the following overview of the juvenile hearing process in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">With an exception not relevant here, Rule ll-llla.2. authorizes a Juvenile Court master to hear any case or matter assigned by the court. Proceedings before a master are recorded. CJP \u00a7 3-807(b)(2); Rule 11-110a. In keeping with the limited role of the master, both the Rule and the statute specify that the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the master do not constitute final orders or final action by the court. Rule ll-llla.2. and CJP \u00a7 3-807(d)(l). Within ten days after the conclusion of a disposition hearing, the master must transmit to the judge the entire file in the case, together with a written report of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations. A copy of the report is served on each party to the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">Both CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(l) and Rule 11-111c. permit any party to file exceptions to any or all of the master\u2019s proposed findings, conclusions, recommendations, or order. Rule 11-111c. specifies, however, that \"[ejxceptions shall be in writing, filed with the clerk within five days after the master's report is served upon the party, <em>and shall specify those items to which the party </em>excepts, <em>and whether the hearing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number><em>is to be de novo or on the record.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Those requirements are also set forth, in generally similar language, in the statute. See CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(l) and (2). Both the Rule and the statute permit an excepting party, other than the State in a delinquency case, to elect a hearing <em>de novo </em>or one on the record made before the master. Rule 11-111c. and CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">Both the Rule and the statute make clear that, whether the hearing is <em>de novo </em>or on the record, <em>\u2018\u2018the hearing shall be limited to those matters to which exceptions have been taken.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <em>See </em>Rule 11-111c. and CJP \u00a7 3-807(c)(4). As noted, all of those requirements \u2014 that exceptions specify whether the hearing before the court is to be <em>de novo </em>or on the record, that, in either event, they specify the issues to which the aggrieved party excepts, and that the hearing, whether <em>de novo </em>or on the record, is limited to those matters to which exceptions have been taken \u2014 are imposed by State law and are Statewide in application!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">(Footnotes omitted.)
