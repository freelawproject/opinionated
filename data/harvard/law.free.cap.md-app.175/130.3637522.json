Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defense motion for a new trial, based on a claim of juror misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">II. Whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain Scott\u2019s convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">III. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying a motion to recuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">The jury heard testimony from Detective Mark Lunsford, of the Baltimore City Police Department, that, on February 21, 2003, he was working in an undercover capacity in a parked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>car in the 500 block of Laurens Street. Shortly after 3:00 pm, a black Chevrolet Malibu parked about 20 feet in front of Lunsford\u2019s car. The driver of the Malibu, later identified as Terrance Scott, got out and opened the trunk. He then stood by the back of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While Scott was standing next to the open trunk, a man approached and handed him what Lunsford described as \u201cU.S. currency in bill form.\u201d After Scott accepted the cash, he \u201creached in the trunk [and] ... handed ... this black male small items, which were consistent in size and shape of street level packaged narcotics.\u201d Scott then closed the trunk and walked towards a nearby store.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Lunsford formed the opinion that he had just witnessed a narcotics transaction, and called for an arrest team. When the arrest team arrived, Lunsford exited his car and together they arrested Scott \u201cright by the store.\u201d A search incident to the arrest yielded $237 in currency and a \u201cremote car opening device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Scott denied that he had been driving the Malibu, and explained that the keys he had been holding belonged to a cousin, and that he had driven his cousin\u2019s car without permission. Lunsford took the keys from Scott and operated the remote, which unlocked the vehicle. The passenger compartment of the car was searched, and police found a temporary vehicle registration in Scott\u2019s name, 81 vials of a substance later identified as cocaine, and four bags of marijuana. Recovered from the trunk were 244 gel-caps containing heroin. Scott was taken into custody and the vehicle was towed from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Lunsford, who was accepted by the court as an expert in the fields of drug enforcement, identification, packaging, and street-level narcotics distribution, opined that, based on his training and experience, the drugs were packaged not for personal use, but for distribution. One of the arrest team members, Detective Kenneth Ramberg, testified that the keys recovered from Scott fit the black Malibu.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The jury also heard from Savitri Sharma, a criminologist with the Baltimore City Police Department, who was accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>as an expert in the analysis of controlled dangerous substances. Her analysis of the contraband was recorded on a Baltimore City Police Department Form No. 442 Drug Analysis Report, which was admitted as State\u2019s Exhibit 41. Surveying \u201ctrace\u201d amounts, Sharma reported, and testified at trial, that the samples tested positive for heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The defense presented the testimony of two witnesses who contradicted the State\u2019s case, especially the State\u2019s theory that Scott had driven the Malibu. Latasha Young recounted that, as she looked out of her window overlooking the scene, she saw Scott walk up the street and enter a store. She denied seeing Scott drive the Chevrolet Malibu, and further denied seeing any drug transaction. Damon Bowen said that he was \u201cjob hunting\u201d with Scott that day. He recounted that they drove to Laurens Street that afternoon in Bowen\u2019s green Grand Cherokee, and that they both went into the store that was owned by Bowen\u2019s uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We shall review additional facts as they relate to the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>1. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defense motion for a new trial, based on a claim of juror misconduct.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Scott moved for a new trial, primarily on a claim of juror misconduct, arguing that juror number 496 failed to respond truthfully to a <em>voir dire </em>question. After a hearing, the court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Scott asserts that, subsequent to the verdict, the defense learned that juror number 496 had a \u201cnegative history with Mr. Scott with respect to her sons.\u201d Scott also maintains that this juror \u201cinstilled a fear of the defendant\u201d that caused the members of the jury to express \u201cconcern for their safety.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>He maintains, therefore, that because of the asserted juror misconduct, the trial court \u201cerred\u201d by denying his motion for a new trial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of Scott\u2019s motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 298-99, 825 A.2d 1008 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">During the jury selection process, the court asked the prospective jurors whether anyone knew the defendant. Prospective juror 496 did not respond to this query, but did respond in the affirmative when later questioned about another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In his motion for a new trial, Scott asserted in part that \u201ca juror did not answer truthfully to <em>voir dire </em>posed to the panel; namely ... [that she] did not stand when asked by the Court whether she knew Mr. Scott, and it has been revealed on information and belief that [the juror] in fact has known or known of Mr. Scott for many years.\u201d The motion was initially summarily denied by a chambers judge, and then heard fully by the trial judge at the disposition hearing on June 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\n<em>The Motion Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The transcript of the hearing on Scott\u2019s motion for a new trial reflects the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... Your Honor ... [w]e did not receive any response to [our subpoena request for information about the juror] in our office and what we wanted to do, Your Honor, was we wanted to subpoena Juror No. 496____ And what we had learned after the trial was that [the juror] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>has a history with Mr. Scott and that came to our attention after the trial as well as the specifics of that history. Your Honor, on information [and] belief the defense has learned that [the juror] has a negative history with Mr. Scott with respect to her sons. Her sons and Mr. Scott used to be in the same neighborhood. They used to run together and there is a negative history between [the juror\u2019s] children and Mr. Scott. After the jury verdict was read and after the jurors were about to, actually right before they were about to be released there came a note to the court where the jurors were expressing some concern over their safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">We believe it was [juror 496] who had precipitated that concern among the jurors. She knows Mr. Scott. She did not disclose any of that information [on] <em>voir </em>dire.... Your Honor, we wanted to subpoena [the juror] to question her. I never received this. I would have made every attempt in the world to get [the juror] here today for this motion for a new trial for her testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">She did not stand up when it was asked whether or not she knew him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">THE COURT: ... we agree on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, Your Honor, what we wanted, I\u2019m sorry\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">THE COURT: Let me finish. And now of course you\u2019re stating that it\u2019s, I believe the words you use is has known or known of Mr. Scott for many years. There\u2019s really a, I don\u2019t know who knew this. I assume you\u2019re getting this from your client and if so, he probably knew it all along all through the trial, if that\u2019s true and he didn\u2019t say anything. I mean when did he suddenly have this sudden shot of enlightenment? And the other problem I have is that you\u2019re asking me to disregard that whether or not the juror was truthful or not and I have to then look at whether or not your client is a truthful person or is trying to get out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>this trial. And in this case it\u2019s obvious that the jury didn\u2019t believe him....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">And you come into court and I\u2019m supposed to grant a motion for a new trial based upon the belief that your client suddenly discovered after the trial was over that this child of this woman had disputes with somebody connected with his family and didn\u2019t like him in the neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, if I could clarify my exact request at this point. Because I did not receive a copy of the certificate of record what I\u2019m simply asking, Your Honor, is to be given the opportunity to summons [the juror] and bring her before the court to find out exactly what she knew, if anything, about Mr. Scott on the day of trial. That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The trial judge inquired about Scott\u2019s address and that of the juror, and pointed out that these addresses were \u201cfar apart.\u201d Defense counsel reiterated his request to question the juror at a hearing about the extent, if any, of her knowledge, and again complained that the jury commissioner failed to respond to his subpoena. The trial judge then inquired about the nature and extent of Scott\u2019s knowledge of this juror:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">THE COURT: When did your client tell you this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My client intimated to me at the close of evidence that he suspected he knows who that juror is. He did not give a name. He just said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">THE COURT: When did he tell you this? When? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: At the close of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">THE COURT: Close of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He suspected he knew who that person was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">THE COURT: Did you bring this to my, did you bring this to my attention when I could have asked the juror once the juror was in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I did not bring it to your attention, Your Honor, because he did [not] give me information. He just simply said, I suspect I know who that person is. THE COURT: When I not only had the jury in the courtroom but I also still had alternates in the courtroom. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And it wasn\u2019t until afterwards. It wasn\u2019t until everything had closed that the family came back days later with more specific information about who this person was. <em>And yes, Your Honor, I will grant you that. I will grant you that, that once there was a suggestion even the remotest hint that there could be some knowledge between these two individuals I should have come up to the court. That\u2019s right. I should have done that. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">THE COURT: What\u2019s your position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Burkett [v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 438, 319 A.2d 845 (1974) ] said they look dis-favorably [sic] upon challenges to juror prejudice after the defendant has been convicted. In this case the defense knew prior to that conviction that the defendant might know this person, that they might have some history and I think the defense has waived their right to challenge that juror by not bringing that up prior to the close of the trial prior to that guilty verdict. And Your Honor, I will also point out the defendant participated in the entire voir dire process. If he recognized this [juror], likely he recognized her the very first time that she stood up and this juror came to the bench to answer a different question. The defendant was at the bench with his counsel. He had an opportunity at that time to say also, I know this person and to question her about the relationship. That didn\u2019t happen. Your Honor, it\u2019s the State\u2019s position that the defendant knew the entire time of whatever relationship he may have to [the juror]. The defendant possibly thought ... knowing [the juror] would [be] to his benefit and so he decided not to say anything and now he\u2019s been convicted and all of a sudden it\u2019s an issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>* * H=</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">THE COURT: I might point out that the defendant did not take all the strikes that were available to him ... and if there was any doubt in his mind that there might have been some reason why this Juror ... might have known him through ... family, through [the] neighborhood, then he could have, you could have done something at that time. It seems like this is another way to try to avoid the verdict. In addition to that everything you\u2019ve told me doesn\u2019t add up. The addresses are entirely different including the current address of the juror but including the past address of the juror. Motion for a new trial is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\n<em>The Need for Juror Candor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The Court of Appeals has recently emphasized that \u201c[v]oir dire is critical to assure that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantees to a fair and impartial jury will be honored.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>399 Md. 146, 158, 923 A.2d 44 (2007) (citing cases). The Court added in <em>Stewart </em>that \u201c \u2018[wjithout an adequate <em>voir dire </em>the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to remove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the court\u2019s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be fulfilled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rosales-Lopez v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 188, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 68 L.Ed.2d 22 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 904 A.2d 534 (2006), the Court addressed the issue of whether the defendant was entitled to a new trial because of juror misconduct. The juror at issue in <em>Williams </em>failed to disclose that a member of her family was employed as a secretary in the office of the State\u2019s Attorney charged with prosecuting Williams. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 904 A.2d 534. The juror had not been questioned about her failure to answer the <em>voir dire </em>inquiry. Nevertheless, after hearing argument, the trial court concluded that the relationship was \u201cpretty remote; a sister of a secretary in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 904 A.2d 534. The trial judge denied the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The Court of Appeals granted a writ of certiorari before oral argument in this Court. Writing for the Court, Chief Judge Bell emphasized the defendant\u2019s right to trial by an impartial jury, and pointed out that \u201c'one of the ways to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury is to expose the existence of factors which could cause a juror to be biased or prejudiced through the process of <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 904 A.2d 534 (quoting <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 331, 825 A.2d 1008 (2003)). The Court emphasized that \u201c[i]f there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect the juror\u2019s decision of the case, or \u2018any circumstances which may reasonably be regarded as rendering a person unfit for jury service,\u2019 the defendant may challenge that juror for cause, and, if that fails, strike him or her peremptorily.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 904 A.2d 534. (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The Court of Appeals reviewed decisions of this Court wherein the trial judge had examined the jurors in question before exercising its discretion to grant or refuse further relief. <em>See Leach v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 611, 425 A.2d 234 (1981); and <em>Burkett v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 438, 319 A.2d 845 (1974). Unlike those cases, the trial court in <em>Williams </em>made \u201cno comparable inquiry as a predicate [for the exercise of discretion].\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>394 Md. at 112, 904 A.2d 534. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">We endeavor to be clear on this point. Where the juror is available for further voir dire and is further voir dired, a trial court may exercise the discretion <em>Burkett </em>requires it to exercise. But, the trial court\u2019s sound discretion can only be exercised <em>on the basis of the information that the voir dire reveals and the findings the trial court makes as a result. </em>On the other hand, where the juror is not available or is not voir dired, there simply is neither a basis for the findings of fact, which must form the predicate for the exercise of discretion, nor for the exercise of discretion that <em>Burkett </em>contemplates. That the trial court may believe that it is \u201cpretty remote\u201d that an answer to a voir dire question would uncover bias or prejudice does not, and cannot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>replace the need for the court to make findings of fact on the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">We hold that, where there is a non-disclosure by a juror of information that a voir dire question seeks and the record does not reveal whether the non-disclosure was intentional or inadvertent, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. That the disclosure would not automatically have required a strike for cause does not matter; it is the inability of the defendant to have the benefit of a further investigation by the court, he or she being deprived of the ability to delve into the juror\u2019s state of mind for bias and of a finding in that regard, that is decisive. The perceived \u201cremoteness\u201d of the potential bias does not preclude bias; without a finding of fact in confirmation, it cannot be a sufficient reason to deny a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>Williams, </em>394 Md. at 113-15, 904 A.2d 534 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On the record before us, however, we need not reach the issue of whether the assertion that the juror\u2019s children had \u201cnegative issues\u201d with Scott would be sufficient to prompt the factual inquiry that he sought from the trial court, and that <em>Williams </em>requires. We reach that conclusion because it is clear that, on these facts, Scott has waived any complaint about a jury that included the juror in question. Notwithstanding counsel\u2019s acknowledgment that he should have alerted the trial court to a potential conflict, Scott and his counsel chose to remain silent, apparently hoping for a favorable verdict, rather than bring the matter to the court\u2019s attention at a time when the problem could have been resolved. The trial court emphasized that, until the jury retired to deliberate, there were alternate jurors available to replace juror 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The Court of Appeals has made clear in <em>Williams </em>that, in the circumstance of a possibly compromised juror, the trial court must afford a defendant the opportunity to be heard before ruling on a motion for new trial. Nonetheless, we do not find in either <em>Williams or Burkett, </em>or other Maryland cases, a discussion of whether, in given circumstances, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>defendant can waive that right by not acting on information known to him. Put another way, can a defendant, possessed of information that might disqualify a juror, withhold that information until after the verdict and then assert it as a basis for a new trial? Other jurisdictions, however, have taken up the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In <em>State v. Bianco, </em>391 N.J.Super. 509, 918 A.2d 720 (App. Div.2007), the New Jersey intermediate appellate court addressed the issue of whether the trial court erred in denying a defense motion for a new trial because of a juror\u2019s failure to disclose his past acquaintance with the defendant and a relative of the victim. The juror had realized during deliberations that he <em>knew </em>the defendant, but did not come forward. The trial court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and concluded that the juror had not recalled, during <em>voir dire, </em>that the defendant or the victim\u2019s grandmother were known to him. The court also made a factual finding that, during the trial, the defendant was aware that the juror knew him. In denying the motion, the trial court also found that defendant had made a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d not to raise the matter during trial. The New Jersey appellate court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Although the trial court in <em>Bianco </em>conducted a hearing on the misconduct claim, and no examination of the juror was conducted in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we consider the <em>Bianco </em>case to be instructive because one of the alternate bases for the appellate court\u2019s affirmance in <em>Bianco </em>was the defense\u2019s waiver of the issue. The appellate court discussed its earlier opinion in <em>State v. Thompson, </em>142 N.J.Super. 274, 361 A.2d 104 (App.Div.1976), a case cited by the Court of Appeals in <em>Williams. </em>The New Jersey court\u2019s treatment of this issue is apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">When the court and counsel are misinformed, or inadequately informed, and the parties\u2019 ability to exercise peremptory challenges is infringed, then it may be said that there has been a deprivation of the parties\u2019 fundamental right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 282, 361 A.2d 104 (App.Div.1976). It matters not, in this regard, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the juror\u2019s omission or misstatement is deliberate or, as here, unintentional. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 361 A.2d 104.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">The failure of voir dire to produce accurate information, however, does not compel the granting of a new trial in all cases. This case presents circumstances which fully support the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for a new trial. First, because defendant was aware, prior to the verdict, of the juror\u2019s omission, and remained silent until after the verdict was rendered, he waived his right to complain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">Although the need to obtain accurate information during jury selection cannot be understated, a defendant may waive the right to complain about shortcomings in the selection process, or of a juror\u2019s failure to disclose information, if defendant knowingly failed to seek the juror\u2019s removal prior to the rendering of the verdict____ Although our courts have not decided this precise issue, we conclude that defendant\u2019s knowing failure to speak prior to the jury\u2019s verdict constitutes a waiver of his right to later complain of Juror ll\u2019s continued participation in the case, as all other courts, which have encountered this circumstance, have concluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">* * * '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">In generally adhering to the waiver concept expressed by these federal and state courts, we conclude that when a defendant knows a juror has failed to reveal during voir dire that he and defendant were once acquainted, he has waived the right to later complain of the juror\u2019s continued service on the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-11\"><em>Bianco, supra, </em>918 A.2d at 725-26 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">In <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>295 F.3d 461 (5th Cir.2002), a juror was sleeping, and the jury alerted the court to this fact. The presiding judge had not seen the juror nodding off, and with defense counsel\u2019s approval, advised the jury not to concern itself about it. In the motion for new trial, it was asserted that the defendant had an unobstructed view of the sleeping juror. The district court rejected this challenge, and the court of appeals affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hansen v. Johns-Man-ville Prods. Corp., </em>734 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir.1984) (examining claims of juror misconduct). We have repeatedly held that defense counsel must call any juror inattentiveness to the attention of the court when it is first noticed. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

When a defendant is aware that a prospective juror has failed to disclose information that is sought by <em>voir dire, </em>and fails to alert the trial court of the fact until after the verdict, he has waived the right to later complain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of Scott\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\n<em>2. Whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain Scott\u2019s conviction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Scott concedes that the evidence is sufficient to sustain his convictions for possession of the controlled substances, but asserts that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his convictions for possession with intent to distribute. He contends that the State has failed to prove that \u201call or substantially all of the substances were in fact cocaine, heroin and marijuana[,]\u201d resting his challenge on the fact that the chemist analyzed only trace, rather than gross, amounts of the substances that were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\n<em>Preservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Initially, the State asserts that appellant has not preserved this question, pointing out that defense counsel failed to raise the issue of the forensic chemist\u2019s testimony until after the trial court had instructed the jury. While counsel moved for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case, and again at the close of the evidence, and argued his grounds, he did not argue the point now made on appeal until just before the jury began to deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. The State has not and still has not and there\u2019s been no evidence to establish demand control [sic] over what was tak[en] from the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">THE COURT: Same argument that you made before? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. The testimony has been he was in the presence of Mr. Bowen all day. The testimony by Ms. Young is that there was no activity involving the black Chevy Malibu outside. The State has not established demand control [sic] over the seized evidence, plain and simply. They haven\u2019t established knowledge .... They\u2019ve only established if the State\u2019s witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>are to be believed. Mere proximity ... is not good enough. The State has not made a prima facie case of any of the seized evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Only after the court instructed the jury did the defense question the evidentiary foundation that all of the material seized was contraband:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor, can I just be heard on the motion for judgment of acquittal on one other matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you. Defense would be making a motion on the judgment of acquittal on the fact that the case laws [sic] requires something a little bit more than trace amounts to be tested when we\u2019re dealing with amounts exceeding 20 pills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Even though the point was not raised until the eleventh hour, we are satisfied that, on these facts, the issue of evidentiary sufficiency has been preserved. In <em>Pugh v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 624, 650, 654 A.2d 888 (1995), the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, but failed to renew that motion at the close of the evidence, choosing instead to renew its motion after the court instructed the jury. We held that Pugh\u2019s motion was untimely because he had not renewed his motion \u201cat the close of all the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>Maryland Rule 4-324(a). In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>the defense did renew its motion at the close of all the evidence, and, with leave of the trial court, further elaborated on that motion after the jury had been instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\n<em>The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original). Our role on appeal is not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>retry this case. <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). Determinations of credibility lie within the province of the trier of fact. <em>See Pinkney v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 311, 326, 827 A.2d 124 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The State adduced sufficient evidence to support Scott\u2019s convictions. \u201cMaryland has long held that there is no difference between direct and circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 226, 627 A.2d 1029 (1993). <em>See State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 534, 823 A.2d 664 (2003). In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>348 Md. 104, 112-14, 702 A.2d 741 (1997), the Court, collecting cases, noted \u201cthat the great weight of authority from other state and federal courts recognizes that circumstantial or indirect evidence may be sufficient, standing alone, to establish the nature of a controlled substance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Meeks, </em>857 F.2d 1201, 1204 (8th Cir.1988) (stating that \u201c[pjroof of the existence of a controlled substance need not be by direct evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Where the State introduced evidence that portions of the substances were shown by analysis to be cocaine, heroin, or marijuana, the jury was entitled to infer, circumstantially, the identity and nature of the remainder of the contraband recovered from the same source at the same time. The circumstantial case is bolstered by the observations of Detective Lunsford, whose account the jury was free to believe or disbelieve, who stated that he witnessed what, in his opinion, he considered to be a narcotics transaction. He saw Scott open the trunk of the Malibu, receive currency from a buyer, and hand over to the buyer small items \u201cconsistent in size and shape of street level packaged narcotics.\u201d That testimony, added to the testimony of the forensic chemist that samples from the suspected contraband tested positive for the narcotics in question, provided evidence from which the jury could infer both possession and possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\n<em>3. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying a motion to recuse.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"> We come now to Scott\u2019s assertion that the trial judge abused his discretion by denying a defense motion for recusal. We disagree and explain. We review the trial judge\u2019s decision on a motion to recuse for abuse of discretion. <em>Cicoria v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 403, 427, 598 A.2d 771 (1991), <em>aff'd </em>332 Md. 21, 629 A.2d 742 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The recusal issue arose during the pre-trial suppression hearing. The prosecutor had examined Lunsford regarding the detective\u2019s education and experience, and counsel and the court were discussing the evidentiary ramifications of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005). The transcript discloses that during this discussion the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">THE COURT: The purpose of Ragland isn\u2019t to release all the drug dealers back out on the street, or alleged drug dealers back out on the street of Baltimore. The purpose of the opinion is to advise the defense of expert witnesses and that you now have received that notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">After a recess, defense counsel voiced his concern about the trial judge\u2019s remarks regarding <em>Ragland. </em>The transcript reflects the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... I had basically objected to the Court receiving Officer Lunsford as an expert for the State\u2019s failure to provide notice.... The Court\u2019s response was it is not the purpose of Ragland, if I remember the Court\u2019s response correctly, to put drug dealers back on the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">THE COURT: Or alleged drug dealers back on the street is what I said, or alleged drug dealers back on the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I do not remember the second half of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>In either case, it is [the] Defense position that the Court\u2019s partiality is contained [sic] for whatever reason whether it\u2019s upon Defense motion, or perhaps would it, the knowledge that it brought to this case before it was called for the motion to suppress. We would be making a motion that the Court would excuse itself on the basis of that statement. THE COURT: Denied. Check your record and the record speaks for itself[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In <em>Chapman v. State, </em>115 Md.App. 626, 631-32, 694 A.2d 480 (1997), we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u201cIt is well settled in Maryland that fundamental to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is an impartial and disinterested judge.\u201d <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 105, 622 A.2d 737 (1993). The accused has a right to a trial in which the judge is not only impartial and disinterested, but who also has the appearance of being impartial and disinterested. <em>Scott v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 464, 486, 677 A.2d 1078 (1996). Maryland Rule 16-813, Canon 3C(l)(a) of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct, reflects this principle and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">(1) A judge should not participate in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s partiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">(a) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">A party attempting to demonstrate \u201cthat a judge is not impartial or disinterested has a high burden to meet.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>110 Md.App. at 486, 677 A.2d 1078. \u201cThis is so because there is a strong presumption in Maryland, and elsewhere, that judges are impartial participants in the legal process, whose duty to preside when qualified is as strong as their duty to refrain from presiding when not qualified.\u201d <em>Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107, 622 A.2d 737 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">To overcome the presumption of impartiality, the party requesting recusal must prove that the trial judge has \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>personal bias or prejudice\u201d concerning him or \u201cpersonal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings.\u201d <em>Boyd [v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 80, 581 A.2d 1 (1990) ]. Only bias, prejudice, or knowledge derived from an extrajudicial source is \u201cpersonal.\u201d Where knowledge is acquired in a judicial setting, or an opinion arguably expressing bias is formed on the basis of information \u201cacquired from evidence presented in the course of judicial proceedings before him,\u201d neither that knowledge nor that opinion qualifies as \u201cpersonal.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>321 Md. at 77, 581 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>Craven v.

State, </em>321 Md. 69, 86, 581 A.2d 1 (1990))). Finally, \u201c[t]he recusal decision ... is discretionary and the exercise of that discretion will not be overturned except for abuse.\u201d <em>Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107, 622 A.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">We discern no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in its denial of the motion for recusal, and conclude that the court\u2019s discussion of <em>Ragland </em>does not betray a \u201cpersonal\u201d bias that would compel recusal. Again, \u201c[o]nly bias, prejudice, or knowledge derived from an extrajudicial source is \u2018personal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632, 694 A.2d 480 (quoting <em>Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107, 622 A.2d 737).

The threat of prejudice is greatest when a judge overpowers a jury, <em>United States v.

We find no support for Scott's contention that the juror in question influenced the jury by causing them to fear Scott. Shortly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>returning its verdict, the jury sent out a note informing the trial court that a member of the jury heard someone, not a juror, remark \"he\u2019s not guilly brother\u201d as the juror walked past. After the verdict was read, the trial court released the jury but required the others to remain in the courtroom for ten minutes. The court admonished defense counsel to \"instruct this family I don\u2019t want any conversation or any remarks again to any of these jurors when they pass by or anything else.\u201d There is no basis in the record for the suspicion that juror number 496 prompted this concern.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">. <em>Cf.
