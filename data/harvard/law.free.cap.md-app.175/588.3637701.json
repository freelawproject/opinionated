The child\u2019s out-of-court statements, made when she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>almost eight years old, were a key part of the State\u2019s evidence against Frederick Roscoe Coates, appellant, the former boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother. At a trial held in May of 2005, a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County convicted Coates of second degree rape (vaginal intercourse in the victim\u2019s bedroom; Count Two); second degree sexual offense (fellatio; Count Three); and child abuse (Count Five), for which he was sentenced to a total term of thirty-five years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Coates presents two questions for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">I. Did the trial court err in admitting the complainant\u2019s out-of-court statements as substantive evidence under the medical treatment and diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule, where the statements were made 14 months after any abuse had ended and the State failed to meet its burden regarding the declarant\u2019s state of mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">II. Did the trial court err in permitting an expert witness who offered the hearsay to also testify about the complainant\u2019s credibility?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Jazmyne was born on December 19, 1995. The alleged acts of abuse last occurred in September of 2002, and were discovered in the Fall of 2003. A few weeks later, in November 2003, Jazmyne was examined by Heidi Bresee, a pediatric nurse practitioner. During the examination, Jazmyne made statements impheating appellant. On February 17, 2005, the State notified appellant that it intended to call Bresee as \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>expert in forensic examinations of sexual assaults.\u201d In a letter to defense counsel on February 20, 2005, the State amplified the notice, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">Ms. Bresse [sic] will testify that her observations of the victim\u2019s vaginal area are consistent with Jazmyne\u2019s disclosure of vaginal penetration. Ms. Bresse [sic] will opine that an object penetrated Jazmyne\u2019s vagina. The object could be an adult male\u2019s penis or fingers. She has ruled out a child\u2019s fingers as the penetrating object. She will further opine that Jazmyne\u2019s hymen was narrow and that the loss of hymen occurred over time from abuse. The observations are consistent with repeated abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">The State may also introduce the videotape of the victim\u2019s sexual assault examination.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">On March 18, 2005, appellant filed a \u201cMotion in Limine to Exclude Testimony,\u201d seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>to bar Bresee\u2019s opinion testimony and admission of the videotape. The defense argued, among other things, that Jazmyne\u2019s statements to Bresee were not admissible under Md. Ride 5-803(b)(4), the hearsay exception for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, because \u201cJazmyne was not seeking medical treatment when she spoke to Ms. Bresee.\u201d Further, appellant claimed that Ms. Bresee\u2019s opinion would invade the jury\u2019s role in judging the credibility of witnesses, because Bresee \u201cwould merely serve to vouch for\u201d the credibility of Jazmyne.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In support of his position that Jazmyne was not seeking medical treatment at the time of her meeting with Bresee, appellant pointed to a statement Jazmyne made some ten days before the examination, in which she allegedly said she \u201c \u2018wanted these people to go to jail.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defense also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>urged the court to consider that Jazmyne did not present in an emergency situation. Rather, she was seen \u201cone year after the alleged incidents ended____\u201d Moreover, appellant argued that Jazmyne \u201chad no symptoms, no pain, and no injuries to be examined or treated,\u201d and Bresee \u201cdid not conduct a complete medical exam of Jazmyne, a complete pelvic exam, draw blood to test for sexually transmitted diseases, do vaginal swabs for gonorrhea and chlamydia, or provide any treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The State countered that Jazmyne\u2019s statements were admissible under Rule 5-803(b)(4) because \u201cthey were taken and given for dual medical and forensic purposes.\u201d As evidence of a medical purpose for the exam, the State noted that Bresee referred Jazmyne for mental health counseling as well as HIV testing. Further, it maintained that Bresee\u2019s physical findings were consistent with the child\u2019s disclosure of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">At a motion hearing on April 7, 2005, defense counsel expressed concern that Bresee\u2019s testimony lacked a sufficient basis in fact and would not be limited to her physical findings. Rather, she would testify to \u201ca significant connection\u201d between the physical findings and appellant. The State responded that it would show that Coates had access to the child without regard to Bresee. The State also represented that it would only seek to use the videotape in the event that Jazmyne\u2019s credibility was impeached.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court said, in part:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>As I understand it, the questions to [Ms. Bresee] having to do with any allegations in this incident are ... whether or not certain findings were consistent with ... multiple acts of intercourse or penetration....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">Ms. Bresee is not going to say having [sic] anything to do with [Coates\u2019s] access to [Jazmyne]. She\u2019s not going to say anything about that. The State\u2019s going to argue that, once they\u2019ve brought out through someone else that there was access to the child, but they\u2019re not going to ask Ms. Bresee that question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Denying the motion <em>in limine, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Okay, I am going to deny the motion in limine with respect to Ms. Bresee based on the State\u2019s proffer as to the limited questions they intend to ask about the interview with Jasmine, and the issue of the physical findings as they relate to and [are] consistent with multiple acts of sexual intercourse [and/or] digital penetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">At the time of trial, Jazmyne was nine and a half years of age. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: And how are [boys and girls] different? [VICTIM]: Because girls have vaginas and boys have penis. [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And have you ever seen a penis before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">[VICTIM]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Whose penis have you seen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>[VICTIM]: Bikie\u2019s.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Besides Bikie, have you seen anyone else\u2019s penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">[VICTIM]: My brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And what\u2019s your brother\u2019s name again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">[VICTIM]: Lorenzo.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Now do you call this something besides a vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">[VICTIM]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: What do you call it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">[VICTIM]: A coochie (phoenetic [sic] sp.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: A coochie. Okay. All right. Now, has anyone ever touched your coochie or your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agx\">[VICTIM]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: Who has?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">[VICTIM]: Bikie, Carl and Jemal [sic].[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADB\">[PROSECUTOR]: And Jemal [sic]. All right. And Carl. Who\u2019s Carl?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>[VICTIM]: He is a man. My grandmother\u2019s boyfriend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. And when you lived with Bikie, how did you feel about Bikie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">[VICTIM]: I felt first fine. And then until it came to the doing it part, sort of bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. Well, let\u2019s go back to that. You said that when you would sleep at night, where would you sleep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">[VICTIM]: In my bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And when people were sleeping at night, do you remember where your mom and Bikie slept?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-h\">[VICTIM]: In their bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you said that things were okay until you were doing it. What does doing it mean? Can you tell us what that means for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">[VICTIM]: Sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. And what is sex? Do you know what that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">[VICTIM]: Sex means when you\u2019re humping another boy and a girl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And you said that you would do it with Bikie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">[VICTIM]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. [W]hen you had sex with Bikie, I\u2019m going to show you again the [anatomically correct diagrams]. Remember, do you remember if anything on Bikie would touch any part of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">[VICTIM]: His penis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\">[VICTIM]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: And where would that touch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-20\">[VICTIM]: To my vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-21\">[PROSECUTOR]: To your vagina? And do you remember if it would go into your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>[VICTIM]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Jazmyne stated that she and Coates had intercourse in the basement of \u201cthe house,\u201d as well as the two bathrooms, her room, and her mother\u2019s room. She also supplied details regarding sexual positions, condoms, anal intercourse, and claimed that Coates \u201cput his penis in [her] mouth.\u201d Further, Jazmyne claimed that Coates took her to his job at the Lake Forest Mall, where he would \u201ctake me into the bathroom and start doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The following colloquy as to the timing of the alleged abuse is also relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... [D]o you remember how old you were when you and Bikie would do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">[VICTIM]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you remember how many times you and Bikie would do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">[VICTIM]: Like a million times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Do you remember what grade you were in when Bikie did it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">[VICTIM]: Second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. Do you remember what time of year it was it happened that you and Bikie were doing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">[VICTIM]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">In addition, Jazmyne stated that she and Carl Edmonds had sex \u201c[j]ust one time.\u201d Afterwards, she recalled that her \u201cunderpants were bleeding\u201d and that she \u201ctried to wash it so [her] grandmother wouldn\u2019t get mad.\u201d With regard to Lee, Jazmyne stated that he \u201cwould try to do the same thing like Bikie. He\u2019d wake me up and then take me in, I think that was his room, and start humping me.\u201d When asked how many times Lee \u201chump[ed]\u201d her, Jazmyne responded: \u201cJust like one time.\u201d She recalled that the incidents with Lee and Edmonds occurred after Coates had abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">Jenkins testified that she and appellant were romantically involved from approximately the Spring of 1999 until September 2002. During much of that time, Coates lived with Jenkins and Jazmyne, who was then between the ages of three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>and six. Jenkins often worked long hours and attended night school. As a result, Jenkins relied on others to help care for Jazmyne. Coates; Lakisha Casey, Jenkins\u2019s friend; and Tina and Carl Edmonds, Jenkins\u2019s mother and step-father, were among those who helped attend to Jazmyne. Jenkins characterized Jazmyne\u2019s relationship with Coates as \u201c[v]ery close.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Jenkins recalled that on one occasion she noticed blood in Jazmyne\u2019s underwear, and took her to the doctor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She was informed that the bleeding was due to a yeast infection that Jazmyne had scratched. Another doctor found that Jazmyne had a urinary tract infection. Neither doctor raised any concerns about abuse, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">After Coates\u2019s relationship with Jenkins ended in September 2002, Jenkins began a relationship with Melvin Martin, who moved in with Jenkins and Jazmyne. Martin\u2019s son, Lorenzo, also spent time at Jenkins\u2019s home. Lorenzo was six years old in November of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">According to Jenkins, in the Fall of 2003 (i.e., about one year after the end of Jenkins\u2019s relationship with Coates), Jazmyne began to exhibit strange behavior. She recalled that, while in the tub, Jazmyne would \u201csit on the soap or run the hot water on her body and just [sic] mannerisms that didn\u2019t seem normal for her.\u201d In addition, Jazmyne would put the back of her heel near her vagina and she \u201cwould just wiggle her ankle.\u201d Jenkins also observed Jazmyne insert the leg of a Barbie doll into her vagina. According to Jenkins, Martin once found Lorenzo naked in the basement with Jazmyne.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In November 2003, Jazmyne asked Jenkins: \u201c[C]an little kids have babies?\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Jenkins responded: \u201cNo. Because if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>they do, they\u2019ll die.\u201d At that point, Jazmyne began to scream but Jenkins \u201cdidn\u2019t know exactly what was wrong with her,\u201d so she \u201cjust held her.\u201d Jenkins claimed that Jazmyne then revealed that \u201cshe had sex with Bikie.\u201d In particular, Jazmyne said that Coates \u201cput [his] dingy inside of her coochie.\u201d Jenkins continued: \u201cAnd I looked at her and I was like when? And she just said, when he was here. I said, well, why didn\u2019t you tell me? And she said she was scared and she didn\u2019t want to.\u201d Jazmyne also told her mother that Lee had abused her. About a month later, she told her mother about Edmonds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">After the initial disclosures, Jenkins did not immediately take Jazmyne to the hospital or to the police. She explained that she thought she \u201ccould find [Coates] on [ her] own.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Bresee, a Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (\u201cSAFE\u201d) nurse and a pediatric nurse practitioner, testified, without objection, as an expert in \u201cthe medical assessment and treatment of child sexual abuse and assault and sexual assault forensic examinations.\u201d On November 14, 2003, about three weeks after Jazmyne was interviewed by CPS and the police, Ms. Jenkins took Jazmyne to the Shady Grove Adventist Hospital, where the child was seen by Bresee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">At the outset, Bresee explained the technique she uses when interviewing children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">When I first meet the child, typically they\u2019re with a parent or a guardian and it\u2019s very important for me to establish a rapport so they\u2019re comfortable with me, so they are able to give a medical, you know, disclosure to me as to their reason for coming to see me so I can make sure they get appropriate medical treatment. And so usually I\u2019ll engage them in conversation, where do you go to school, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>what types of things do you do for fun, ... what do you do for the summer, do you go to camp, do you like to swim, and typically that really gets a child talking. And ... sometimes I\u2019ll sit on the floor and we\u2019ll play with ... some of the toys I have in the office and that\u2019s how I work on establishing a rapport with the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Bresee recalled that she saw Jazmyne and her mother in her office, \u201cwhich also serves as an examination ... area.\u201d As to her examination of Jazmyne, Bresee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">Ms. Jasmine T. presented with her mother, Kimberly Jenkins\u2014 I [told] both Jasmine and her mother, Kimberly, that I need to get some basic information on where she lives, who she lives with, things she does for fun, her medical history, and also go through what we call a \u201creview of symptoms\u201d and that\u2019s looking to see if she has any ... stomachaches or earaches or any complaints of illness____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Bresee added that this step is necessary to determine whether the victim is \u201ccomplaining of anything that would warrant ... medical assessment and treatment.\u201d Claiming that the treatment plan is tailored to the specific needs of the child, Bresee illustrated by explaining that if Jazmyne had said she was having pain with urination, Bresee would have ordered an urinalysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Bresee explained to Jenkins that \u201cit\u2019s very important that I hear from [Jazmyne] why she\u2019s [here] to see me.\u201d After Bresee gathered the background information, she spoke with Jazmyne alone.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Bresee showed Jazmyne diagrams of the human body to determine the names the child used for various body parts. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you ever discuss with the child the difference between the truth and a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">[BRESEE]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: And can you please explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury (a) why that is important and (b) how you go about doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">[BRESEE]: Sure ... first off, it\u2019s important for me to establish that they can ... identify the differences between the truth and a lie. And I stress-once I have established that they are able to tell me the difference between the truth and a lie, and in this case I asked Jasmine if she could tell me, you know, I have a VW, a Barbie VW bug that\u2019s bright red, and I would ask her, ... \u201cIf I said that VW bug is blue, is that the truth or a lie?\u201d and she would say, \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d \u201cIf I said that VW bug is red, would that be the truth or a lie?\u201d And she said \u201cThe truth.\u201d So, she was able to distinguish between a truth and a lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">Then I just stress the importance of them telling the truth, that what they\u2019re here to see me for is medical assessment and treatment and it\u2019s very important that I know as many of the details, as they can recall, as to what happened to them that brought them to see me, so then I can make appropriate medical interventions and treatment plans accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The defense objected when the State moved to introduce the medical record of Jazmyne\u2019s examination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At a bench conference, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I object to the whole record, I object to the interview for two reasons. One of the reasons is that I understand she is going to admit it for, under the exception of her medical diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the fact that she names people who did it is irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment. That is reason number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">Reason number two is I think it is a violation of <em>Crawford [v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004)] because clearly these, when these interviews are done, there is a dual purpose and I think that was conceded by the State, that it is testimonial and that it violates <em>Crawford </em>because it is testimonial, they intend to use it at trial, and I think Jasmine recognized that because she asked Heidi if they were going to \u201cgo out and get them\u201d or \u201cAre they going to jail?\u201d And we didn\u2019t, obviously, didn\u2019t have an opportunity to cross-examine her at the time that she gave the statement. So, for those two reasons, I object to the interview notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I believe that (a) they are made in, the statements are made in pursuant to a medical diagnosis; that actually naming the person is important, especially for this particular type of medical diagnosis, to determine whether the exposure to any sexually transmitted diseases or to anything of those natures. So, the whole thing becomes relevant to the appropriate medical diagnosis, which the nurse practitioner was trying to formulate at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">In reference to <em>Crawford, </em>Jasmine testified. I mean, she has been here. The opportunity of confrontation has been provided in terms of what she said here, and so I just don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we reach <em>Crawford.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that is a misreading of <em>Crawford. </em>I think all of the eases clearly state it is an opportunity to cross-examine at the time the statement is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">THE COURT: I still think this is an unresolved issue, but I am informed that it has been resolved and that, as long as a child testifies ... is not a basis to exclude. But they are being offered under a different explanation of the hearsay rule anyway, which is for medical treatment. The only question I have is, I haven\u2019t looked at them to determine if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>anything would need to be redacted, but in general, I think they are going to be admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The court then determined that, before the medical records would be published to the jury, counsel and the court would go through the records for possible redaction of identifying names. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, the clerk of the court, outside the presence of the jury, asked the judge whether to redact any portion of Bresee\u2019s notes. The judge responded in the negative. Defense counsel renewed her objection. After closing arguments, defense counsel once again reminded the court of her objection to Bresee\u2019s notes. The notes were admitted, without redaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The medical record does not reflect that Bresee personally administered any medical tests or collected any lab samples. It indicates that Ms. Jenkins reported that Jazmyne suffered from vaginitis and urethritis/epididymitis in 2002. Moreover, it reflects that Jazmyne reported that she had experienced abdominal/pelvic pain, and pain while urinating, as well as vaginal bleeding that she attributed to Edmonds\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">When the State resumed its examination of Bresee, she reported that she told Jazmyne that she is \u201ca special nurse who works with kids who might have been touched in a way that hurt or bothered them.\u201d Bresee asked Jazmyne \u201cif something like that had happened\u201d to her. According to Bresee, Jazmyne answered in the affirmative. Bresee continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">And I asked if she could tell me about that, and her response was, \u201cWell, the first one was Bikey (phonetic sp.). He was my mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend. He put his private inside my private.\u201d I asked, \u201cHow many times did he do that to you?\u201d and her response was, \u201cA lot of times.\u201d I asked, \u201cDo you remember when this happened?\u201d and she said, \u201cA long time ago.\u201d I asked, \u201cDo you remember how old you were?\u201d and she said \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">I asked her if Bikey had made her do anything else, and she said, \u201cYes. He made me lick his private, and he would lick my private too.\u201d I asked if she ever saw anything come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>out of his private, and she said, \u2018Yes, white stuff.\u201d And then I asked her if Bikey had, \u201cDid Bikey tell you not to tell anyone?\u201d and she said, \u2018Yes. He told me not to tell my mommy. He told me if I would let him do it to me, then I could go see my mommy and he would also let me smoke a cigarette.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">I asked, \u2018You smoked a cigarette?\u201d because it kind of took me off guard, and she responded, \u2018Yes. Bikey gave it to me after he put his private in me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">At that point, defense counsel noted a continuing objection to Bresee\u2019s testimony as to the contents of her interview with Jazmyne. The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I just want to clarify something for the record. I am not interrupting and objecting to each and every sentence here, but I do have an objection as I stated at the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">THE COURT: A continuing objection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: A continuing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">THE COURT: \u2014 to the contents of the interview. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Bresee continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">I asked her, \u201cDo you remember if it hurt when he did that?\u201d and she said, \u2018Yes. It hurt a lot. I cried.\u201d I asked her if she ever remembered seeing blood. She said, \u201cOnly when Carl[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] put his fingers inside me. That made me bleed.\u201d So, I asked her to finish talking about [Coates] before she told me about anything else, and she agreed. And I asked, \u201cIs there anything else about [Coates] I should know?\u201d and she said, \u2018Yes. He did it to my friend Eomy,\u201d and then she spelled her friend\u2019s name, E-O-M-Y. \u201cHe touched her butt, but she won\u2019t tell her mommy ... Eomy will talk to me and her friends about it, but she doesn\u2019t want to talk to her mommy about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">And I asked at that point if she, if Jasmine had told Ms. Karen Vasserman, the CPS worker, about her friend Eomy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>and she said, \u201cYes.\u201d And then I asked specifically if [Coates] had ever shown her pictures of people without their clothes on, and she said, \u201cYes. He showed me pictures in magazines and a movie on TV.\u201d And then I asked if there was anything else about [Coates] I should know, and she asked me, \u201cAre you going to go out and find him now?\u201d and I responded, \u201cNo, but Detective Buckley is working hard to find him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The following colloquy is also relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you have training in terms of age-appropriate language, determining whether a child is using vocabulary that is appropriate to their age? Are you ever taught that in the interviewing techniques?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">[BRESEE]: That\u2019s part of the Cornerhouse technique, [its] age-appropriate interviewing and asking questions that the child is going to understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: In terms of evaluating what Jasmine [sic] said to you, was she using age-appropriate language? In terms of her age and how she was speaking to you, what did you think about what she was telling you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">[BRESEE]: For a 7-year-old, it was, to me, it\u2019s not appropriate for a 7-year-old to describe licking private parts or fingers in their vagina. In the context of what I do, it\u2019s age-appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: In terms of the details that she provided you, why were the type of details she provided you significant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">[BRESEE]: They were personal in nature to her. She was able to recount the pain, which is a personal experience, that if you \u2014 you can\u2019t really describe pain unless you\u2019ve experienced pain. She also was able to describe white stuff coming out of a private part, which is, you know, beyond her knowledge, should be beyond her knowledge of a 7-year-old, and the acts that she was describing were personal to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: In the Cornerhouse technique, training of interviewing, is part of that, are you taught to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>or try to determine when the child is telling you about a fantasy versus reality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">[BRESEE]: It is discussed, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And what were some of the techniques you were taught to make this determination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">[BRESEE]: Basically to get, to establish the truth versus lie, to understand that we are talking about the here and now in that, you know, I only want her to tell me what she recalls actually happening to her and then what\u2019s personal in nature as, again, pain, bleeding, different types of things that had happened to her. The cigarette was very personal to her. She remembered it happening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Following her conversation with Jazmyne, which lasted about forty-five minutes, Bresee conducted a \u201chead-to-toe physical assessment.\u201d Bresee explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">[W]e start with height and weight, vital signs, which are temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and then I start by doing an assessment, head-to-toe, looking in their eyes, ears, nose, mouth, working down, their chest, their breast, you know. I look at their skin and, you know, feel their scalp as I\u2019m working down, and I go all the way down to the toes minus the genitals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">The exam of the private parts in this case is the last part Ido....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Bresee testified that she explained to Jazmyne the nature of a pelvic examination, including the use of a MedScope camera for light and magnification. No anal injuries were found. But, upon examination of the child\u2019s vagina, Bresee observed \u201cphysical signs that were suggestive of a sexual nature____\u201d She explained: \u201c[T]he edges of the hymen for a 7-year-old should be very crisp and sharp ... almost translucent in appearance. With [Jazmyne], what I saw [was] very dull, rounded edges, with a very narrow hymen.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">In Bresee\u2019s view, the condition of Jazmyne\u2019s hymen was indicative of repetitive, penetrating trauma, rather than a onetime incident, such as insertion of an object (e.g., a toy), or a straddle injury. According to Bresee, the clinical findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>coupled with the child\u2019s disclosures, were \u201cvery highly suggestive of sexual abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Bresee also opined that there was \u201cprobable abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">At the conclusion of the examination, Bresee provided Jenkins with a form entitled \u201cPediatric Discharge Instructions,\u201d which recommended follow up care as needed, as well as testing for \u201cSTD-HIV,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> including the phone number for a local clinic. The form also said: \u201cCounseling is recommended for any victim of sexual abuse or assault,\u201d and included the handwritten name and phone number of the person to contact for the initial assessment and screening. Bresee also provided her office voice number if Jenkins had any questions or concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Ann Hoffman, a social worker, testified for the State as an expert in Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome. Hoffman stated that abused children often delay disclosing extended abuse, and typically do so a \u201cbit at a time.\u201d She added that children who are abused at a young age tend to display heightened sexualized behaviors, and often bond with the abuser. Hoffman also described the process of \u201cgrooming,\u201d in which an abuser gains a child\u2019s trust through special attentiveness. When asked how accurate a child who has suffered sexual abuse may be in recounting the exact number of times of abuse, Hoffman replied that \u201cit\u2019s difficult ... for children to enumerate ... and it\u2019s difficult [for them] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>remember the specific details of any one incident.\u201d Moreover, she testified that many children display a flat affect in describing the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Following Hoffman\u2019s testimony, the State rested. No witnesses were called for the defense. In its instructions to the jury, the court stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">As jurors, you are the sole judges of whether a witness should be believed. In making this decision, you can apply your own common sense and everyday experiences. In determining whether a witness should be believed, you should carefully judge all of the testimony and evidence and the circumstances under which each witness has testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">You should consider such factors as the following: the witness\u2019 behavior on the stand and manner of testifying, did the witness appear to be telling the truth, the witness\u2019 opportunity to see or hear the things about which testimony was given, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 memory, does the witness have a motive not to tell the truth, does the witness have an interest in the outcome of the case, was the witness\u2019 testimony consistent, was the witness\u2019 testimony supported or contradicted by evidence that you believe, and whether and the extent to which the witness\u2019 testimony in court differed from the statements made by the witness on any previous occasion. You need not believe any witness, even if the testimony is uncontradicted. So, you may believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u2022 An expert is a witness who has special training or experience in a given field. You should give expert testimony the weight and value that you believe it should have. You are not required to accept any expert\u2019s opinion. You should consider the expert\u2019s opinion together with all of the other evidence. In weighing the opinion of an expert, you should consider the expert\u2019s experience, training and skills, as well as the expert\u2019s knowledge of the subject matter about which the expert is expressing an opinion. Now, in this case, there were two expert witnesses, and as to Ann Hoffman\u2019s expert testimony, it is not to be taken as a confirmation of Jasmine T.\u2019 [s] credibility or that abuse in fact occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">You have heard testimony that Jasmine T. made a statement before trial. Testimony concerning that statement was permitted only to help you decide whether to believe the testimony that the witness gave during the trial. It is for you to decide whether to believe the trial testimony of Jasmine T. in whole or in part, but you may not use the earlier statement for any purpose other than to assist you in making that decision.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In closing argument, the State argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Jasmine\u2019s word alone, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt, of her word alone, is enough evidence to convict the defendant. And you must decide that credibility based on her demeanor to you, on prior statement[s], hear [sic] the statements to Ms. Bresee in the medical records, which are going to go back to you, in which Jasmine talked about what [Coates] did to her. She said, \u201cWell, the first one was [Coates]. He was my mom\u2019s ex-boyfriend. He put his private inside my private.\u201d Ms. Bresee asked, \u201cHow many times did he do that to you?\u201d Jasmine says, \u201cA lot of times.\u201d She talked about how he made her lick his private and that he would lick her private, too, and that she would see white stuff coming out of his private and how he would let her smoke cigarettes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>You must determine accuracy. You can look at it to determine the credibility of Jasmine, her accuracy of her memory </em>\u2014 again, <em>consistent with what she told Ms. Bresee. </em>What is the interest in the outcome of this case? What are Jasmine\u2019s motives for making up that it was the defendant who did this to her? He is out of the house. He is no longer with mom. There has absolutely been no evidence as to show any motive or interest for Jasmine to say this other than for being the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Coates contends that the trial court erred and abused its discretion \u201cby permitting the State to introduce Jazmyne\u2019s statements, through the testimony of Ms. Bresee, as substantive evidence under the medical treatment and diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d Appellant mounts numerous arguments to support his position. He maintains that the State faded to satisfy the \u201cfoundational requirements of the exception,\u201d because the circumstances \u201cdemonstrated that Jazmyne was not seeking treatment when she spoke to Ms. Bresee,\u201d nor did the State \u201cshow Jazmyne thought Ms. Bresee would treat her in the future.\u201d Consequently, he maintains that the child\u2019s statements were not provided for a \u201cmedical purpose.\u201d Moreover, Coates complains that Bresee\u2019s testimony improperly and unfairly bolstered Jazmyne\u2019s credibility and usurped the jury\u2019s function. He argues: \u201cBecause the required guarantee of trustworthiness was not present, the trial court should not have admitted Jazmyne\u2019s statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Appellant considers \u201csignificant\u201d the lapse of time between the alleged abuse and Bresee\u2019s examination of Jazmyne. According to Coates, \u201cWhen the event giving rise to a potential injury is still recent, a child is more likely to understand the medical connection between the event and the physician\u2019s examination of her, and thus is also more likely to answer questions truthfully.\u201d He avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Ms. Bresee spoke with Jazmyne 14 months after the alleged abuse had ended, and Jazmyne exhibited no signs of injury or illness prior to the interview. A 14 month delay is far beyond that contemplated in cases that ruled in favor of admitting statements under the medical exception. Those cases consistently emphasize the close proximity of the statement to the alleged criminal act when upholding a trial court\u2019s decision to admit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Appellant continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">By the time Ms. Bresee interviewed Jazmyne, 14 months had elapsed since any alleged abuse by Mr. Coates had ended____ Even when Ms. Jenkins heard the allegations, she did not take her daughter to a hospital for 21 days.... She was more concerned with finding Mr. Coates than seeking treatment for Jazmyne. Nothing in Ms. Jenkins\u2019 testimony suggested she thought Jazmyne needed medical treatment after she learned she was abused. Nor did Ms. Bresee\u2019s notes mention any complaints. In fact, Ms. Jenkins took Jazmyne to Ms. Bresee only because Ms. Bresee had been assigned to the case by CPS----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Furthermore, looking to \u201cthe content\u201d of the interview, appellant insists that it \u201cdemonstrated that the declarant did not perceive a medical purpose\u201d for the examination, and showed that the child did not provide her statements in connection with medical treatment. To the contrary, argues Coates, Jazmyne\u2019s statements reflected that her motivation in speaking to Bresee \u201cstemmed from her desire to apprehend Mr. Coates, not a need for treatment.\u201d According to appellant, \u201cthe most direct evidence of Jazmyne\u2019s state of mind\u201d was apparent when Bresee asked Jazmyne if \u201cthere was anything else she should know about Mr. Coates\u201d and Jazmyne responded: \u201c \u2018Are you going to go out and find him now?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Coates also complains that Bresee\u2019s questions \u201cfocused on gaining information about Mr. Coates, not Jazmyne\u2019s medical condition.\u201d He explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Ms. Bresee\u2019s message [to Jazmyne] did not convey that she medically treats children, only that she \u201cworks with\u201d them.... Throughout her interview with Jazmyne, Ms. Bresee focused on physical symptoms that had long ago disappeared. This is why, despite hearing that Jazmyne experienced bleeding and burning urination after Mr. Edmonds abused her, Ms. Bresee ordered collected no blood or urine samples, and performed no lab tests____ Instead, Ms. Bresee asked investigative questions irrelevant to future treatment, which indicated to Jazmyne the interview was not about her physical well being[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Based on what transpired during the interview, appellant asserts that Jazmyne \u201cdid not arrive in Ms. Bresee\u2019s office seeking medical treatment, and Ms. Bresee\u2019s questions did not change her state of mind. Instead, Ms. Bresee\u2019s questions conveyed to Jazmyne that she was part of the prosecution team.\u201d Appellant elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">The fact that Jazmyne felt it necessary to provide additional evidence against Mr. Coates, including the actual spelling of her Mend\u2019s name, demonstrates Jazmyne\u2019s state of mind was not that of a patient. She was not seeking medical help. Despite the irrelevance of this information to medical treatment, Ms. Bresee pressed on, imputing to Jazmyne the importance of conveying this information to authorities and, in doing so, implicitly identifying herself \u25a0with the investigation[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Appellant also contends that Bresee \u201cinvaded the jury\u2019s role as factfinder,\u201d because her testimony encroached on \u201cthe jury\u2019s function to determine credibility, and virtually dictated the outcome of the case.\u201d Given Bresee\u2019s status as an expert, coupled with the inclination of juries \u201cto defer to the opinions of witnesses who are \u2018clothed by the court with the mantle of an expert,\u2019 \u201d Coates complains that he was \u201cseriously prejudiced\u201d by Bresee\u2019s testimony. Noting that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s case turned on whether the jury believed Jazmyne\u2019s allegations against Mr. Coates,\u201d he posits that Bresee unfaMy bolstered Jazmyne\u2019s testimony and \u201cadd[ed] details she omitted during trial.\u201d Coates argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Jazmyne\u2019s testimony was vulnerable to begin with. She did not report any sexual abuse until more than a year after Mr. Coates left the home____ By the time she testified at trial, she had talked to a myriad of adults, including police, child protective service workers, social workers, therapists, and relatives, ... who could have shaped her recollections. She contradicted herself during testimony when she admitted, ... and then denied, ... seeing Ms. Casey\u2019s son Lorenzo\u2019s penis, and when she admitted, ... and then denied, that he witnessed some of the abuse. She could not remember times, dates, or how old she was when certain events occurred.... Under these circumstances, Ms. Bresee\u2019s endorsement of Jazmyne\u2019s testimony was critical to the State\u2019s case. Indeed, the prosecutor relied on Ms. Bresee\u2019s testimony during closing argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">According to appellant, it is clear that the jury had doubts about Jazmyne\u2019s credibility because it was unable to reach a verdict on two counts and, notably, those were the only counts in which the salient \u201cparts of Jazmyne\u2019s story ... were not repeated by Ms. Bresee.\u201d In Coates\u2019s view, this \u201cstrongly suggests that the jury was swayed by Ms. Bresee\u2019s improper bolstering.\u201d In the absence of Bresee\u2019s testimony, argues appellant, \u201cit is possible that the jury would have acquitted Mr. Coates of all charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">He continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">Ms. Bresee was, in essence, impermissibly acting as a human polygraph machine.11 ... The State\u2019s question about the \u201cCornerhouse technique\u201d and its utility for making a \u201cdetermination\u201d that a child knows her memories are not fantasy demonstrated this---- Just as a polygraph might measure a person\u2019s heart rate to determine their truthfulness, Ms. Bresee, as human lie detector, relied upon things that were \u201cpersonal in nature.\u201d This was particularly damaging because, in providing examples of \u201cpersonal\u201d memories that were specific to Mr. Coates, like the cigarette, ... Ms. Bresee not only testified that Jazmyne was credible when she said abuse had occurred, but also that she was credible in describing who did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>In addition, Coates contends that the improper bolstering of the child\u2019s credibility with her prior hearsay statements to Bresee cannot be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant underscores that the \u201ccritical issue\u201d of who sexually abused Jazmyne \u201cwas not resolved by Ms. Bresee\u2019s physical findings.\u201d Coates argues: \u201cUnless the jury believed Jazmyne\u2019s trial testimony was accurate, it had no basis to find Mr. Coates guilty.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201cGiven the reliability problems with Jazmyne\u2019s testimony, Ms. Bresee\u2019s stamp of approval could easily have tipped the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The State counters that Jazmyne\u2019s statements to Bresee were both \u201cgiven and taken in contemplation of medical treatment or medical diagnosis for treatment purposes,\u201d and met the requirements for the medical purpose exception to the hearsay rule. Therefore, argues the State, they were properly admitted as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">According to the State, there was a \u201cplethora of circumstantial evidence\u201d indicating that Jazmyne knew the purpose of her meeting with Bresee. For example, the child\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS3\">statements were taken in a hospital setting; the interview was conducted by a registered and presumably uniformed nurse; and there were other medical procedures performed, such as taking Jasmine\u2019s temperature, checking her pulse and blood pressure, determining her height and weight, and looking at different body parts, as might normally occur in a routine checkup.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Moreover, the State maintains that Jazmyne\u2019s question to Bresee \u201cabout whether she was going to find Coates does not negate that Jasmine understood the medical purpose for the examination.\u201d It also urges us to reject Coates\u2019s argument \u201cthat the victim was not seeking medical treatment [merely] because she had no known active injury....\u201d In this regard, the State points out that an important reason for an examination of a sexual assault victim is to determine whether the victim has contracted any sexually transmitted diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">With regard to Coates\u2019s claim that Bresee improperly addressed the veracity of Jazmyne\u2019s testimony, the State asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that Coates never objected at trial on this basis. Even if preserved, the State claims that the \u201ctrial court properly exercised its discretion regarding the scope of [Bresee\u2019s] expert testimony.\u201d Finally, the State argues that, even if Bresee\u2019s testimony was erroneously admitted, it was harmless error because it was \u201ccumulative to other properly admitted evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). As a general rule, hearsay is not admissible at trial. Md. Rule 5-802. \u201cA hearsay statement may be admissible, however, under an exception to the hearsay rule because circumstances provide the \u2018requisite indicia of trustworthiness concerning the truthfulness of the statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

We begin with <em>Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 1, 536 A.2d 666 (1988), which involved a two-year-old child who was brought to a hospital by Child Protective Services as the result of physical abuse. The physician observed numerous bruises on the arms, legs, and buttocks of the victim, and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>noted signs of irritation to the genital area. During the examination, the physician asked approximately five times, \u201c \u2018Who did this?\u2019 \u201d, and on each occasion the victim answered, \u201c \u2018Daddy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 536 A.2d 666. When asked about the two-year-old\u2019s understanding of the purpose of his questioning, the physician replied: \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t know what her understanding of the situation was.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 536 A.2d 666. Upon further inquiry, he stated: \u201c T don\u2019t believe that a two-year-old is capable of understanding a concept like why somebody is asking questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Writing for this Court, Judge Moylan determined that the child\u2019s statements did not satisfy the common law exception for statements to treating doctors, and therefore the trial court erred in allowing the treating physician to repeat the incriminating statements at the father\u2019s trial on charges of child abuse and assault. The Court reasoned that the victim lacked \u201cthe concerned physical self-interest,\u201d nor did she \u201cunderstand the nature or the purpose of her interview\u201d with the treating physician. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 536 A.2d 666. Because such knowledge lies \u201cat the very core of this particular evidentiary theory,\u201d said the Court, the victim\u2019s statements to the physician, implicating her father, were inadmissible under this theory. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In <em>In re Rachel T., supra, </em>77 Md.App. 20, 549 A.2d 27, decided the same year as <em>Cassidy, </em>the Court considered whether the statements by a four-year-old sexual assault victim to health care professionals were admissible at a Child In Need of Assistance hearing at which the victim did not testify. The Court reached a different result from the one in <em>Cassidy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Rachel was examined by her pediatrician after blood was found on her panties and in the toilet. Upon examination, the pediatrician suspected sexual abuse. Rachel was seen at a rape center the following day. The pediatric gynecologist arranged for a female social worker on his staff to take Rachel\u2019s medical history, \u201cin accordance with his usual procedure. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 536 A.2d 666. When asked about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>source of the bleeding, Rachel disclosed to the social worker that \u201c she had a secret with her Dad and that if she told her Mom her father would be in big trouble.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The history was included in the medical record. <em>Id. </em>The physician\u2019s subsequent physical exam indicated \u201con-going sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Thereafter, Rachel and her family were referred to a clinical psychologist specializing in sexual abuse. During their first session, Rachel depicted intercourse with anatomically correct dolls. When asked whether she had ever seen a penis, she responded that she had seen her father\u2019s. She also told the psychologist that, on two occasions, her father had put his penis in her, and that it hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Based on <em>Cassidy, </em>the circuit court excluded Rachel\u2019s statements to the social worker on the pediatric gynecologist\u2019s staff, and to the clinical psychologist. On appeal by the Department of Social Services and the child, this Court reversed. We concluded that Rachel\u2019s statements were part of the medical history obtained by the social worker and relied upon by the treating physician, and were therefore admissible as substantive evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 34-36, 536 A.2d 666. Notably, we reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 35, 536 A.2d 666 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">When the social worker met with Rachel, she explained to Rachel that the reason for Dr. Doran\u2019s examination and questions were \u201cbecause we were worried and wanted to see why there had been blood in her panties and in the toilet.\u201d Thus, Rachel knew that her statements would be used to provide appropriate treatment. Additionally, the persistent bleeding probably affected Rachel-the universally frightening nature of unexplained blood would have disturbed her and made her apt to tell the truth in order to become better. <em>Granted, by the time Rachel saw Dr. Doran, the bleeding had stopped, but it was recent enough to retain its sobering character.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The Court continued, <em>id. </em>at 35-36, 536 A.2d 666:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">Important to our decision in <em>Cassidy </em>was that the identity of the child\u2019s 31 abuser was not related to medical treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ment. In <em>Cassidy, </em>the evidence of abuse was primarily external \u2014 the child was bruised on the arms, legs, and buttocks. We noted in <em>Cassidy, </em>however, that \u201c[w]hen there is a danger that an assault victim may have contracted a communicable disease, of course, the identity of the assailant may take on significant medical pertinence.\u201d <em>Cassidy, </em>74 Md.App. at 34 n. 14, 536 A.2d 666. Unlike the child in <em>Cassidy, </em>the evidence, including the blood and Rachel\u2019s abnormally dilated hymen, presented this potential danger. For example, it was possible that Rachel had been exposed to a venereal disease, and may have required antibiotics. Additionally, Rachel\u2019s parents suggested that her bleeding and dilated hymen may have been caused by some inanimate object such as a broomstick. If that had been the case, a tetanus shot might have been required. Dr. Doran testified that, although he had no specific recollection of seeing Rachel more than once, his usual practice is to have a child return for a follow-up visit, to see if other medically significant findings appear and to decide whether to recommend that the child be referred for psychiatric treatment. <em>Ascertaining the identity of the abuser was also important in the instant case because effective treatment might have required Rachel\u2019s removal from the home. </em>Dr. Doran, having tried unsuccessfully to elicit information himself from Rachel, asked his specially trained social worker to speak to Rachel. He testified that use of this interdisciplinary team method was common practice where a child was unwilling to talk to a doctor, and that he relied on the information in making his diagnosis and prescribing treatment.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\"><em>Low v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 413, 705 A.2d 67 (1998), on which appellant relies, is also instructive. There, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>admitted the child sexual abuse victim\u2019s statement, concluding that it was made for both medical and forensic purposes. We reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In that case, the victim was eleven years of age when she moved in with her brother-in-law and his wife following the death of the victim\u2019s father. When she was twelve, the victim disclosed that her brother-in-law had sexually abused her. She was examined by a pediatrician, who was an expert in child abuse.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A social worker had referred the victim to the physician for a complete medical evaluation, during which the physician performed a comprehensive review of the victim\u2019s health. During the course of the examination, the physician noted evidence of sexual trauma. After the initial examination, the doctor concluded that no medical treatment was necessary, and she never saw the victim again. The trial court found that these facts were sufficient to qualify the doctor as a \u201ctreating physician.\u201d The doctor testified at trial that the victim\u2019s vagina and anus showed evidence of trauma and penetration by a foreign object.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">On appeal, we agreed with the appellant that the court erred in admitting various portions of the doctor\u2019s testimony, relating that the child said she was hurt when \u201c \u2018the perpetrator\u2019 put his penis in her vagina and in her \u2018butt\u2019 more than ten times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416, 705 A.2d 67. Speaking for the Court, the majority concluded that the doctor qualified, at best, as an \u201cexamining physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 705 A.2d 67. In our view, \u201cthe doctor\u2019s standard operating procedure of taking an oral history from the patient\u2019s parent, meeting with the patient, and asking the child patient if he or she knew why he or she was there [did] not in and of itself qualify her as a treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 705 A.2d 67. The Court continued, <em>id. </em>at 422-23, 705 A.2d 67:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">[The doctor] testified that after following the previous procedures she then \u201cmight say mom or dad is concerned about your health because of some unhappy experience that might have happened to you.\u201d There was, however, no evidence adduced at trial that [the victim] was in fact asked if she knew why she was there, or, even if asked, what [the victim\u2019s] reply might have been. In other words, [the doctor\u2019s] usual operating procedure, even if employed in relation to [the victim], did not give the impression of a doctor who would necessarily treat [the victim] on future occasions. In fact, when asked by defense counsel what her purpose was in conducting the examination of [the victim], [the doctor] replied only \u201c[f]or complete medical evaluation.\u201d No mention was made by the doctor of potential treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Court also found that the doctor\u2019s willingness to provide future medical treatment, if needed and requested by the victim\u2019s mother, did not render the doctor a treating physician. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 705 A.2d 67. The Court was \u201cnot entirely convinced by the record that [the doctor] \u2018could have\u2019 provided such continuing treatment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>This conclusion was partly based on the contents of a discharge form prepared by the doctor and provided to the victim, on which check marks were placed next to \u201cYour personal physician\u201d and \u201cCommunity Clinics\u201d as sources of continuing treatment. The doctor did not supply her own contact information.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Moreover, the Court was not satisfied that child-declarant understood that the purpose of the examination was a medical one. The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 424, 705 A.2d 67 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">[E]ven assuming for the sake of argument that [the doctor] could have provided [the victim] with subsequent treatment, the subjective beliefs of the doctor as to what she could and would do are immaterial to the issue. The heart of the issue returns to the guarantee of trustworthiness emphasized in <em>Cassidy, </em>and, in order to maintain that trustworthy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ness, <em>[the victim] must have contemplated the possibility of further treatment by the doctor. </em>The fact that [the doctor] thought she could give [the victim] follow-up treatment does not mean that [the victim] knew she could receive such follow-up treatment from the doctor, absent evidence that [the doctor] <em>communicated </em>those intentions to [the victim or the victim\u2019s] mother. And in the case at bar we have no such evidence before us. Additionally, <em>even if [the doctor] had rendered treatment, her doing so would have been incidental and secondary to her primary role as a forensic examiner.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Nor did the Court agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the doctor was both a treating physician as well as an examining physician, merely because the doctor gave the victim a complete physical examination in areas other than those affected by the alleged sexual abuse. The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 424-25, 705 A.2d 67:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">The conclusion that we instead draw is that a child of twelve years,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who has never before been seen by a doctor (and will never again be seen by this doctor), who is poked at and prodded in virtually every area of her body, and who is asked a multitude of questions, some quite sensitive in nature, is most likely, at the very least, an extremely intimidated little girl, who has little grasp of why she was sent to this strange doctor in a strange setting. If anything, [the victim] had a right to be downright suspicious as to why the doctor was examining her in body areas other than those stemming from the complained of incident, and that, in our opinion, would have promoted [the victim\u2019s] distrust of and perhaps dishonesty with the doctor much more than it would have facilitated a relationship of trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Accordingly, the Court\u2019s majority concluded that the doctor was not a treating physician. As a result, her testimony did not meet the requirements of Rule 5-803(b)(4).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">More recently, in <em>Webster, </em>151 Md.App. 527, 827 A.2d 910, we considered the admissibility of statements made by a four-year-old sexual assault victim to a SAFE nurse. In that case, the victim\u2019s neighbor discovered Webster touching the victim\u2019s pants in the neighbor\u2019s bathroom. Notably, the neighbor <em>immediately </em>took the victim to her mother. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and the victim was taken to the hospital, where a SAFE nurse interviewed the victim and performed a physical exam. At trial, Webster unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements to the nurse. The trial court allowed the nurse to testify that the victim told her \u201c \u2018that a man that she didn\u2019t know had licked her do-do and she told him not to and he said he was going to keep on doing it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 827 A.2d 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On appeal, the Court ruled that the testimony was properly admitted as substantive evidence. The Court recognized that a statement made to a treating nurse for dual purposes \u2014 both medical and forensic \u2014 may fall within the Md. Rule 5-803(b)(4) hearsay exception. <em>Id. </em>at 545-47, 827 A.2d 910. The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 545-46, 827 A.2d 910 (citation omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">The rationale for admitting this type of hearsay \u2014 that statements in contemplation of medical diagnosis or treatment are inherently reliable \u2014 may still exist in such circumstances. If the challenged statement has some value in diagnosis or treatment, the patient would still have the requisite motive for providing the type of \u201csincere and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>reliable\u201d information that is important to that diagnosis and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">That determination did not end our inquiry, however. We next reviewed the trial court\u2019s factual findings to ascertain whether the victim\u2019s statement \u201cwas both <em>taken and given </em>in contemplation of medical diagnosis or treatment----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 827 A.2d 910 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Mr. Webster conceded that the SAFE nurse\u2019s examination was <em>taken </em>for medical diagnosis or treatment. This Court noted that the record indicated that the SAFE nurse \u201cclearly articulated medical reasons for asking [the victim] what happened,\u201d because she testified that \u201ca sexual assault victim may have internal injuries or may have contracted a venereal disease, even though she feels no pain and bears no external signs of injury during the brief initial physical examination for \u2018major medical problems.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 827 A.2d 910. Thus, the first prong of the inquiry was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We next addressed Mr. Webster\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that the victim had a medical reason for <em>giving </em>a description of the assault. The appellant contrasted what the victim was told about the SAFE examination with what the four-year-old victim was told in <em>In re Rachel T. </em>According to Mr. Webster, there was \u201cno comparable evidence that [the victim] was told about the medical reason for the examination and questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 827 A.2d 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The Court agreed with Webster that the record did not reflect that the SAFE nurse provided the victim with a medical explanation for the examination, but disagreed that \u201csuch an explicit statement is necessary in every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549-50, 827 A.2d 910. We stated: \u201cAlthough telling a patient that the information she provides will help in diagnosis and treatment would support the admissibility of responsive statements, circumstantial evidence also may provide an adequate evidentiary foundation for admitting the statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 827 A.2d 910 (citation omitted). Therefore, we sought to determine whether \u201ccircumstantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that [the victim] understood the medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>cal purpose for the examination and questions, and that she told [the SAFE nurse] what happened in contemplation of medical diagnosis and treatment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Upon review of the record, we concluded that it contained sufficient circumstantial evidence to indicate that the victim understood the medical reasons for the SAFE nurse\u2019s examination. Of import here, we noted that the victim was <em>\u201cquestioned in emergent circumstances, within a few hours of the assault, </em>in a hospital setting,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he interview was conducted by a registered and presumably uniformed nurse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 827 A.2d 910 (emphasis added). Moreover, the SAFE nurse\u2019s examination immediately followed a triage nurse\u2019s brief examination for blood pressure and pulse, and an examination by a emergency room doctor who physically assessed the child for major medical problems. We also pointed out that the SAFE nurse asked questions such as \u201cwhat happened,\u201d instead of \u201cwho did this,\u201d which \u201cwas consistent with questions that nurses and doctors commonly ask even young children when they seek medical assessment and treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 827 A.2d 910. Finally, we were satisfied that the victim \u201cunderstood that there was a medical reason for truthfully telling [the SAFE nurse] what had been done to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 827 A.2d 910. Accordingly, we concluded that, under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(4), the trial court did not err in admitting the SAFE nurse\u2019s testimony as to the victim\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Bresee testified that she explained to Jazmyne that she was there to see Bresee for \u201cmedical assessment and treatment.\u201d Bresee also told Jazmyne that it was \u201cvery important that I know as many of the details ... as to what happened,\u201d in order to \u201cmake appropriate medical interventions and treatment plans____\u201d In the light most favorable to the State, Bresee had a valid medical reason for eliciting Jazmyne\u2019s account of the sexual assault; her questions were posed in contemplation of securing treatment for Jazmyne in the event that she suffered a latent injury or contracted a sexually transmitted disease. But, the evidence also suggested that Bresee had a dual purpose for her exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>nation; she clearly sought information as to the identity of the perpetrator and the details of his criminal misconduct. At least some of her questions were in the nature of a child-friendly interrogation, akin to a prosecutorial probing of \u201cwhodunnit,\u201d rather than an inquiry related to medical concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Even if Bresee\u2019s questions were not intended as an interrogation to aid the prosecution, the details she solicited concerning the sexual abuse and the identity of the perpetrator were not relevant to a medical purpose or the child\u2019s health needs. Clearly, some fourteen months after Jazmyne\u2019s last incident involving Coates, who no longer had any contact with the child, the questions seemed to have an \u201coverarching investigatory purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 91, 867 A.2d 314 (2005). To illustrate, questions such as \u201cHow many times did [Coates] do that to you?\u201d, and did you see \u201canything come out of his private,\u201d were not \u201cpathologically germane\u201d to treatment or diagnosis.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In the recent case of <em>Hall v. UMMS, </em>398 Md. 67, 92, 919 A.2d 1177 (2007), which involved the admissibility of medical records under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, the Court said: \u201cWhen addressing the issue of whether an entire medical record is admissible, generally, we have adhered to the rule that \u2018statements in a hospital record must be \u201cpathologically germane\u201d to the physical condition which caused the patient to go to the hospital in the first place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 919 A.2d 1177. (Citations omitted.) Therefore, only entries in medical records that are pathologically germane, i.e., relevant to the patient\u2019s diagnosis or treatment, fall within the business records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Id. </em>at 93, 919 A.2d 1177. <em>See also State v.

In <em>Yellow Cab Co. v.

We are satisfied that the \u201cpathologically germane\u201d standard applies in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Notably, this was not a case in which there was a concern as to the identity of the perpetrator, in order to prevent continued exposure of the child to the abuser. It was known to the State that appellant no longer had any contact with Coates. In contrast, the child\u2019s statements in <em>Cassidy, </em>implicating her father, were crucial, because it was a CI\u00d1A case and the question w as whether the child needed to be removed from the home of her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We also consider it significant that Jazmyne saw Bresee more than a year after the end of the sexual abuse, and at a time when she had no physical manifestations of illness or injury. In <em>Rachel T., </em>77 Md.App. 20, 549 A.2d 27, and in <em>Webster, </em>151 Md.App. 527, 827 A.2d 910, this Court favored admission of the victim\u2019s statements, in part, because the victims were seen by the health care providers almost contemporaneously with the abuse, and under emergent circumstances. Simply put, we cannot glean from this record the basis on which Jazmyne would have understood that she was being seen for medical treatment or diagnosis, some fourteen months after the last sexual abuse incident, and three weeks after her disclosure to her mother of what had occurred. For example, there is no indication that Jazmyne had any understanding, at her age, that she was at continued risk of developing a latent, sexually transmitted disease or HIV. Moreover, most eight-year-olds would not discern emergent circumstances or medical necessity in the absence of any medical complaints or symptoms. And, Jazmyne\u2019s inquiry as to whether Bresee would find Coates suggests that Jazmyne did not perceive that there was a medical purpose \u2014 or even a dual purpose \u2014 for the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Certainly, the examination conducted by Ms. Bresee was important. Even fourteen months after the last abusive oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>currenee, a child could be at risk for HIV or an STD, as was later shown here, or in need of mental health counseling. But, given the long delay between the last incident of abuse and the examination, coupled with the fact that Jazmyne was not exhibiting any symptoms of illness, there is no indication that she understood that there was a medical purpose for the examination. The significant lapse of time between the alleged abuse and Jazmyne\u2019s statements to Bresee raises concerns as to the circumstantial guarantee of reliability that undergirds the exception.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because we cannot say that Jazmyne comprehended that there was a medical purpose for Bresee\u2019s examination, the statements were not admissible under Rule 5-803(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Moreover, we disagree with the State\u2019s claim that appellant was not prejudiced by Bresee\u2019s testimony. Jazmyne\u2019s credibility was central to the case, and there is no question that Bresee\u2019s testimony corroborated important portions of Jazmyne\u2019s testimony. The State\u2019s contention that Bresee\u2019s testimony was merely cumulative is wholly unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

At the motion hearing, the court asked the prosecutor whether she intended to seek introduction of Jazmyne\u2019s statements to Bresee under Maryland\u2019s \u201ctender years\u201d statute. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2001, 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 11-304 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d). The court observed: \"We\u2019ve had no separate hearing on reliability and reporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>and so forth.\" <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 1 l-304(d)-(e). The State responded that it was not relying on C.P. \u00a7 11-304 as a means to admit the child's statements to Bresee. On appeal, neither party has addressed the admissibility of Jazmyne\u2019s statements to Bresee under the tender years statute, and we express no opinion as to the matter. <em>See generally Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 886 A.2d 876 (2005) (in case where child sexual abuse victim testified at trial, Court upheld admission of child\u2019s statements to social worker under C.P. \u00a7 11-304); <em>State v.

Jazmyne had not yet been diagnosed with an STD when she was seen by Bresse. According to the State, when the child was examined in March 2004, she was diagnosed with genital herpes.

The court did not propound an instruction tailored to the use of Ms. Bresee's testimony about Jazmyne's pre-trial statements.

Given that the parties agree that the court relied on Rule 5-803(b) in admitting Bresee's testimony about Jazmyne\u2019s statements, we decline to analyze the admission of the child\u2019s statements to Ms. Bresee under Rule 5-616(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-5\">FN2.
