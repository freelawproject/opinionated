John B. and Wendy B., appellants, are the parents of Max B. and Nicole B. After the children were found to be children in need of assistance (CINA), the Circuit Court for Montgomery County held a permanency planning hearing and ordered the plan changed from reunification with appellants, to placement with a paternal aunt for custody and guardianship. The CINA case was then closed. Appellants now ask us to conclude that the circuit court erred in closing the CINA case and failing to make \u201cactive efforts\u201d to prevent the break-up of the family as required by the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (hereinafter \u201cICWA\u201d). We agree with appellants\u2019 contention that the court failed to properly address the \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement of the ICWA. Therefore, we vacate and remand for further findings consistent with the requirements of this Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Ms. B. is a Native American and a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe. Max, born July 20,1999, is a registered member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe. Nicole, born February 28, 2002, is eligible for membership, but is not currently a registered member of the Tribe. Mr. B. is not of Indian descent. Mr. and Ms. B. are married, and were separated at the time of the permanency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>These proceedings began when the children were placed in shelter care by appellee, Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d), on May 24, 2005, due to parental neglect. The original CINA petition detailed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">Nicole has not yet been toilet trained; Max\u2019s front teeth are rotten; Max refuses to eat at school; the family does not have a regular meal schedule; Max has asthma; and his mother does not know his treatment protocol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Max and Nicole were found to be CINA by agreement of all parties on June 20, 2005. After the CINA declaration, the children were placed with their paternal aunt, Denise P. The Department\u2019s permanency plan was reunification with the parents. Thus, Mr. B. was ordered to participate in a substance abuse evaluation, submit to semi-weekly urinalysis, participate in regular psychiatric treatment, make efforts to maintain stable housing, and provide child support. Ms. B. was ordered to submit to a substance abuse evaluation, follow treatment recommendations, and submit to semiweekly urine screens. Mr. and Ms. B. were granted supervised visitation, and Mr. B.\u2019s telephone calls were monitored by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The next review hearing was held on September 15, 2005. The court was informed that Mr. B. had obtained housing, and had been hospitalized to detox from the methadone prescribed to treat his Oxycontin addiction. Mr. B. was willing to enter an in-patient drug treatment program and undergo mental health treatment, but needed assistance with the cost, as he lost his health insurance coverage. Mr. B. had tested positive for cocaine and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">At the September 15 hearing, the court was also updated on Ms. B., who lacked housing, was unemployed, was not consistently visiting her children, and had not attended the court ordered substance abuse evaluation. Specifically, Ms. B. visited her children four times in three months, and appeared intoxicated during visitation. The Department indicated that there was no phone number at which Ms. B. could be reached, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and she appeared to be under the influence of alcohol when at the Department\u2019s offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">At the end of the September 15 hearing, the B.\u2019s were ordered to complete weekly supervised visitation, participate in substance abuse evaluation, twice weekly urinalysis, and secure and maintain stable housing and employment. Mr. B. was also ordered to participate in mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In November 2005, the Department gave Mr. B. an application for pharmacy assistance, and discussed mental health treatment with him. The Department explained to Mr. B. that he needed substance abuse treatment before he could receive a mental health evaluation. In December 2005, there was a review hearing held, and a representative from the Yankton Sioux Indian Tribe came from South Dakota to speak to the circuit court regarding the tribe\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">A permanency planning hearing was held on April 27, 2006. At this hearing, the Yankton Sioux Tribe was granted intervenor status, but its motion to transfer jurisdiction was denied. The Department and counsel for the children argued that the appellants had made minimal progress. The evidence showed that Mr. B. was unsuccessfully discharged from Avery Road Treatment Center, an inpatient drug treatment center, after three weeks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. B. was then referred to Addiction Services Coordination for an evaluation, which he did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Ms. B. attended and was successfully discharged from the inpatient drug treatment program at Avery Road. Avery Road then referred her to Another Way, an out-patient methadone treatment facility. She stated that she started this program, but it was costly, and \u201cyou have to get a ride there.\u201d Ms. B. testified that she enrolled in an abused persons program, attended AA meetings, and a bible retreat. She also stated that she participated in an Indian Education Program with her children, where they attended class twice each week for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tutoring, computer education, Indian crafts, and holiday parties. Ms. B.\u2019s testimony also reflected her tense relationship with Ms. P., the children\u2019s aunt and guardian. She said, \u201cwhen I first had Max, and I lived in the basement, she was suffering from OCDC really bad. And, she used to come down in the morning and steal Max.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Ms. B. tested positive for benzodiazepine, cocaine, and an opiate on April 14, 2006. Ms. B. testified that she failed to see her children very often because she was \u201chiding.\u201d She said she was working four to ten hours a day in construction, but had little income because she was \u201cpaying off a tab\u201d to a hotel, for Mr. B. She planned to get a government job at Indian Health Services. She was living with Mr. B.\u2019s brother Tommy, in a home where Mr. B. lived on a different floor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. and Ms. B. each had a mix of positive and negative urine tests, and each had missed some of their urinalysis appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">At this April 27 hearing, Denise P. (paternal aunt), testified that the children were doing well. She said that Nicole is a \u201chappy little girl,\u201d and that Max is reading on grade level, and has done \u201cvery, very well in math.\u201d Ms. P. testified that she does not work outside the home because she suffers from obsessive \u2014 compulsive disorder, and receives disability payments. She stated that she takes medication for this disability, which she has been treating for 12 years. Ms. P. also testified that Mr. B. is \u201ca good father to his children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The Department\u2019s social worker, Karen Crist, testified that the Department changed its permanency plan in November 2005, with the new plan placing custody and guardianship with Ms. P. Christ stated that since November 2005, she gave Mr. B. the application for pharmacy assistance and discussed mental health treatment with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>At this April 2006 hearing, Nicole\u2019s therapist, Allison Fellowes-Conly, was accepted as an expert in clinical social work and treatment of abused and neglected children. She testified that Nicole made \u201cincredible improvement,\u201d as the girl changed from a \u201cvery afraid and guarded\u201d child to an individual who trusted her caregivers. She stated that Nicole suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, and her present symptoms include nightmares, disassoeiation, recurring memories of fights with her parents, and irritability. She summarized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acd\">she\u2019s done incredible work, and she\u2019s more of a full child now. She\u2019s smiling. She\u2019s singing. She\u2019s dancing. Whereas before, she was extremely guarded and restricted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMb\">Fellowes-Conly also testified that Max was coming along \u201cvery well\u201d in his therapy. The therapist stated that Ms. P. was great to work with, and used the advice given to her right away. There was also testimony from Mr. B.\u2019s brother, Vincent B., who said that he has noticed a tremendous change in the , children since they were in Ms. P.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">At the conclusion of the April 2006 hearing, the court changed the permanency plan from reunification with the parents to custody and guardianship with Ms. P. The court further ordered the parties to secure and maintain stable housing and employment, and participate in substance abuse treatment, twice weekly urinalysis and breathalyzers, parenting education, and psychological and psychiatric evaluations. The court decided to review the matter further in 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The next review hearing was held on July 21, 2006. Ms. B. was submitting to urine screens, but still had some positive test results showing illicit drug use. She missed nine scheduled urine and breathalyzer tests between May 18, 2006 and July 10, 2006. Her results were positive for benzodiazapine nine times, for opiates three times, and for cocaine once. On at least one date, Ms. B.\u2019s urine tested positive for alcohol. Also, Ms. B. attended a parenting class two times, but was unable to fully focus during the sessions. Ms. B. produced documentation that she had been attending AA meetings. Ms. B.\u2019s attorney also stated that her client had an emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tooth abscess, and was prescribed Vicodin for pain, which could account for some of the positive urines.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">At this July hearing, Mr. B. did not seek custody of the children, but, instead, he supported Ms. B. having custody. The Department stated that Mr. B. did not attend the responsible fathers program. Mr. B. had spoken with the Department prior to the hearing, and stated that he saw many beer cans in the trash at Ms. B.\u2019s residence, that she and his brother Tommy had been crashing and ingesting pills, and that his brother assaulted him. Mr. B. failed to appear for any of the mandatory urine or breathalyzer tests, provided no proof of employment, and had been kicked out of the rental unit he was living in.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In addition, the appellants were not referred for psychological and psychiatric evaluations, because neither party showed six consecutive negative urine screens. The Department had referred the parties to the Axcess program, to address mental health and substance abuse issues, but neither parent had attended.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The attorney for Nicole and Max agreed with the Department, and asked the case to be closed, stating that keeping the case open would \u201cmake things more unstable for the children.\u201d Also at this July hearing, an attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe testified that the Department had not made enough \u201cactive efforts\u201d, and was not in compliance with the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">At the close of the July 2006 permanency hearing, the court maintained the permanency plan of custody and guardianship to Ms. P., and closed the CI\u00d1A case, terminating the court\u2019s jurisdiction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">Both children demonstrate symptoms of experiencing trauma from when they were still in their parents\u2019 care. Neither parent is able to provide them with a consistent, stable and nurturing home environment to meet their needs. They need a sense of permanency[.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI8\">The parents appealed, asking us to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Did the court err in closing the CI\u00d1A case and terminating the court\u2019s jurisdiction where the Department failed to make active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the family, as required by the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AgbD\">I. Motion To Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The Department argues that Ms. B. failed to file a timely notice of appeal. The parents claim to be appealing jointly, and have filed one appellants\u2019 brief together. The Department, however, contends that the docket entries show that only Mr. B. filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The appeal is filed under the names \u201cJohn, Wendy B.\u201d, and is signed by John B. Ms. B. filed no separate appeal. Although the Department argues that Ms. B. did not file a sufficient notice of appeal, the notice filed indicates the intent of both parties to appeal the circuit court\u2019s decision. The appellants are represented by the same counsel, and are making the same arguments. Therefore, we will view the notice of appeal as an appeal by both parties, and address its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">II. Decision To Terminate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"AiD\">The Indian Child Welfare Act</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Mr. and Ms. B. argue that the circuit court closed the CINA case in error, by failing to find that the Department made active efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, as required by the ICWA. The pertinent section of the ICWA states:</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00a7 1912. Pending court proceedings</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">(a) Notice; time for commencement of proceedings; additional time for preparation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">In any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe____of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.... No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">(d) Remedial services and rehabilitative programs; preventive measures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">(e) Foster care placement orders; evidence; determination of damage to child</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">No foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">In Maryland, after a child is adjudicated CI\u00d1A, a circuit court maintains jurisdiction until the child reaches twenty-one, unless the court terminates the case sooner. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-804(b). Here, the court terminated jurisdiction by closing the CI\u00d1A case and awarding custody and guardianship to Ms. P., pursuant to CJP section 3-819.2. We must now determine if the court erred by violating the provisions of the ICWA when terminating jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The ICWA\u2019s Application To This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The Department argues that the ICWA does not apply in this instance. We disagree. The statute defines \u201cfoster care placement\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">[A]ny action removing an Indian child from its parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(l)(i). Here, Max and Nicole B. have been removed from their parents for placement in a home of a guardian, and Mr. and Ms. B. cannot \u201chave the[ir] child[ren] returned upon demand.\u201d Therefore, the ICWA does apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The Department also contends that it met the requirements of the ICWA, because it \u201cneither sought nor obtained a foster care placement for Nicole and Max or a termination of Mr. B.\u2019s and Ms. B.\u2019s parental rights. Instead, the Department sought to place the children under their aunt\u2019s guardianship.\u201d Under the ICWA, an \u201cextended family member\u201d is \u201cdefined by the law or custom of the Indian child\u2019s tribe or, in the absence of such law or custom, shall be a person who has reached the age of eighteen and who is the Indian child\u2019s grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin, or stepparent.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2). We agree that Ms. P. qualifies as an \u201caunt\u201d under this statutory definition. That does not mean, however, that closure of the CI\u00d1A case was appropriate. The Department, in making its argument stated above, ignores that a preference for placement with extended family members is not triggered until active efforts have been made to prevent the breakup of the children\u2019s family.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201cActive Efforts\u201d Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We must determine whether the Department made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to reunify the Indian family, under 25 U.S.C. section 1912(d). The \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOG\">to be determined by the trial court, before the termination case may proceed. The state is required to make an affirmative showing, \u201cto satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the break up of the Indian family and that those efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>In re H.J., </em>149 P.3d 1073, 1078 (Okla.Civ.App.2006) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>Nov. 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The determination of whether a social services agency has made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to prevent family breakup under the ICWA is a mixed question of fact and law. <em>See E.A v. Alaska Div. of Family and Youth Servs., </em>46 P.3d 986, 989 (Alaska 2002). In reviewing mixed questions of fact and law in Maryland, this Court will accept \u201cfactual findings unless clearly erroneous, but mak[e] its own determination whether the application of the law to that finding was \u2018legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>L.W. Wolfe Enters., Inc. v. Md. Nat\u2019l Golf, L.P., </em>165 Md.App. 339, 348, 885 A.2d 826 (2005) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>391 Md. 579, 894 A.2d 546 (2006). Here, the court did not specifically make factual findings regarding the ICWA, but did address the efforts that the Department made to reunify Mr. and Ms. B. with their children. At the final hearing on July 21, 2006, (at the conclusion of which the CI\u00d1A case was closed), the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: The Indian Child Welfare Act, in Section 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902(d), I believe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>requires the Department to make active efforts. The Adoption and Safe Families Act, which is another Federal Congressional Act, that does provide funding to states through Title IV(e), funding by the, through the Social Security Act, requires states primarily to make reasonable efforts; and that is what the Department has presented to you in its report regarding its \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">However, the Indian Child Welfare Act does require active effort. Active efforts are recognized by federal law to be applicable to native families, and active efforts require more than just the reasonable efforts that are alleged in the report by the Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">I do note that on, I believe page 2, of the report, where there is, about halfway down, a section entitled \u201cReasonable Efforts to Achieve the Permanency Plan,\u201d that the Department is primarily engaged in monitoring of the placement, which is not actually a service to the parents, supervising the visitation between the parents and the children, and primarily providing a referral, referral to other sources, referral to parenting, referral to evaluations, referral to mental health treatment, et cetera. And referral is actually a passive activity, where a department tells parents this is where you can go, they hand them a card, it\u2019s someplace to go to, and says go do it. You\u2019ve got this much time to get it done. That\u2019s not actually an active effort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">We do have a mother here who obviously has some issues that she has been dealing with, and the Tribe does believe that she has demonstrated some progress. It is true, and the Tribe also acknowledges, that Judge Algeo\u2019s finding of being relatively underwhelmed at the last hearing is correct. However, it does appear that even since that time, that the mother, at least \u2014 not to be confused with the father\u2019s situation \u2014 has made some additional progress that has been requested and ordered by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">The Tribe is also very concerned about the mother\u2019s apparent mental health condition. She does have a panic disorder, and this is recognized on page six of the Department\u2019s report. And there\u2019s also some illusion there where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>a \u2014 the Department is alluding to a communication it had with the mother, who is saying she is even afraid to leave the house on occasion. Well when you\u2019re doing a passive effort, go get this help, handing someone a card, for example, and a person has got a panic disorder, is on medication, has apparently some medical issues as well, and is afraid to leave the house, how, really truly, can a native mother get that done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">* H* * <em>* * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Tribes typically come fairly late to these kinds of proceedings, just by the nature of how things go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">THE COURT: By nature of the fact that usually the parents have absolutely nothing to do with the Tribe, other than the fact that there\u2019s some type of lineal descendant. That\u2019s the reason. It\u2019s not like we have an active member in the Tribe that\u2019s in South Dakota, and is part of the Tribe, and happened to come in here and had a liaison with someone else and had a child. I mean, that\u2019s the reason the Tribe comes late to these proceedings. These women and fathers \u2014 in this particular case, as far as the County would know, would have no idea that they\u2019re part of the Tribe. I mean they\u2019re not active participants in the Tribe. And there\u2019s no indication their lifestyle indicates that she\u2019s part of the Tribe. I don\u2019t think she goes to tribal meetings, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s involved in any of these tribal celebrations you\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">THE COURT: I had this case before Judge Algeo, and if she\u2019s a very active member of the Tribe, that\u2019s news to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApyB\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: She\u2019s not required under federal law to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t say that she was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: \u2014 be an active member of the Tribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m just indicating that how would we know? I could be a member of, say the Boy Scouts, but if I didn\u2019t tell anybody, no one would know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: Right. The Indian Child Welfare Act imposes an affirmative duty on departments of social services of the different states to investigate, and to find out whether or not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">THE COURT: Have they been out there? Is there anyone there that\u2019s had visitation with them? What\u2019s the Tribe going to do with them, other than come in here and say you didn\u2019t do everything you were supposed to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: One of the things that the Department needs to be doing and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">THE COURT: Forget the Department. They\u2019re doing everything wrong. What is the Tribe recommending be\u2014 what is this great Tribe going to do for these children? That\u2019s what I want to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: I object to your language, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">THE COURT: Well I object to you objecting, because all I\u2019m hearing is indictments of our system, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">THE COURT: Yes. You haven\u2019t said one positive thing. We haven\u2019t done one thing right, here in the state court, as far as you\u2019re concerned, or the Tribe is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">What I\u2019m saying is what is the Tribe doing for these children, now that they know there is a, that they\u2019re part of a tribe where there is a lineal connection? That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you? Because we\u2019re looking at the best interests of the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: That\u2019s why I\u2019m here today. And so the Tribe is specifically recommending that it be allowed to continue with discovery, to see more of what\u2019s happening in the file, to work with the Department of Social Services to do a relative search for relatives at the reservation, and to discuss with the aunt ways in which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>can, and should, and must, under federal law, assist these children in maintaining contact with the Tribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">Sir, there\u2019s a long history of tribes, tribal members relocating to urban areas for things like employment. It\u2019s my understanding that the mother in this case, who is a tribal member, did, in fact, relocate to this area, and was working with the Indian Health Serviee[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">Rockville, Maryland is a center for, a federal center for Indian health issues, and apparently that\u2019s why the mother is here. Tribes and tribal members are not limited in their rights, in regards to have to, just stay home, to be, to have and exercise your rights. We go all over the place, and rights follow us because we are citizens of our tribal nations. The\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">THE COURT: So you want a relative search, that these children may have relatives within the Tribe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">[Attorney for the Yankton Sioux Tribe]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">THE COURT: And what I\u2019m telling you is I\u2019d be happy to look at other possibilities, but I only have basically two choices. People are asking me now to close the case and leave the children with their aunt; or keep the case open and leave the children with their aunt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">I mean, those are the only things that anyone is asking me for, would you agree? You\u2019re saying keep it open because I haven\u2019t had, completed discovery, which I don\u2019t know exactly where that\u2019s going to take us. And you\u2019re saying keep it open, because the County hasn\u2019t provided themselves, they don\u2019t have the internal programs at their offices to deal with the mother and father\u2019s problem, and, number three, the County hasn\u2019t done a sufficient relative search within the Tribe. So I\u2019m trying to address those three issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">Number one, I don\u2019t fault the County for not finding a relative. It sounds that they, the Tribe has been on notice, the County has looked into that and there is no one that\u2019s come forward saying, I am a Tribe relative of this child and I\u2019d like to be part of this child\u2019s life. More importantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>even if someone is out there, they\u2019ve obviously had no contact with these two children, which is significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">Number two, the discovery that you would get, I don\u2019t know what that would lead to with respect to assisting the children at this point in their placement. Their files are pretty open. You have everything the other attorneys would have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag1\">The court and counsel then continued, addressing the sufficiency of the Department\u2019s efforts in aiding the B. family:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7N\">THE COURT: And as far as the County not being able to provide the service themselves, but directing it, that\u2019s for the legislature because they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not like they have the psychiatrist on call in their building and they\u2019re purposely telling mom to go somewhere else. This is the way that they operate. They provide the services, they let them know where the programs are and then the parents either show up or they don\u2019t, or they get something out of it or they don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: Well then if that\u2019s the case, then I think it\u2019s actually a matter that the Department is not complying with the Indian Child Welfare Act that requires active efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">THE COURT: Well, I guess it\u2019s question of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: Now the Department\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 definition of active effort. I don\u2019t agree with your definition. I think you can be active. I think, for example, a school principal at an elementary school can be active in recommending to a parent that the child go see a child psychiatrist. I don\u2019t think the school has to have a psychiatrist, you know, on their staff, and that\u2019s still being active.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: Well, the school is not held to the IQUA [sic] standards. It\u2019s just in child custody proceedings in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">THE COURT: Analogy. What I\u2019m saying is they don\u2019t necessarily have to have the parenting program conducted by themselves\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>THE COURT: \u2014 if, in fact, they have a reputable one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: It\u2019s a false analogy, I\u2019m sorry, because the IQUA [sic] doesn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">THE COURT: Well I disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: IQUA [sic] doesn\u2019t apply to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">THE COURT: All right. You may proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: One last thing I would like to bring up, in terms of the active efforts is, that it\u2019s my understanding that a benzodiazepine is essentially what Xanax is and Xanax is a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not going to accept that unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: \u2014 prescription\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">THE COURT: \u2014 do you have a psychiatrist or a pharmacist or someone else to testify? Because unless we have a medical person in here, I\u2019m not accepting yours or anyone else\u2019s definition of those drugs. I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think anyone is qualified here, unless you want to try and have somebody call you as a witness and qualify you. I just can\u2019t accept that. You know that. You\u2019re a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: Sure. Well, and I was a mental health professional. I\u2019m a licensed professional counselor in Miami.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">THE COURT: Well you may qualify, but you have to give up your role as the advocate here then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">[Attorney for the Tribe]: Well my concern though, in terms of that, is that if a mother\u2019s prescribed medication, part of which shows up on a UA to make her dirty, and she\u2019s taking that medication for a mental health disorder that the Department recognizes exists, and she can\u2019t get treatment for that mental health disorder until she has clean urines, do you see what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>conundrum about the panic disorder that I don\u2019t think has been adequately addressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The circuit court filed a written order, finding that \u201cReasonable [e]fforts have been made by the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter the \u2018Department\u2019) to achieve Reunification with the Child\u2019s parents as listed on page 2 of the Department\u2019s report dated July 12, 2006[.]\u201d The court did not mention the ICWA in this written order.

Additionally, in 1998, Maryland implemented the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act (hereinafter \u201cASFA\u201d). <em>See In re Karl H., </em>394 Md. 402, 419, 906 A.2d 898 (2006). As the Court of Appeals explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">Generally, the Act is designed to promote the adoption of children in foster care. To that end, the Act provides that a child\u2019s health and safety are paramount in determining whether reasonable efforts to preserve the family had been undertaken. In addition, the Act makes it easier to remove a child from [an] abusive family and speed up the adoption process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">Specifically, as to the provision that pertains to concurrent permanency plans, the Act essentially shortens the period for reunification, because the \u201cAct usher[s] in a requirement of concurrent planning under which the government must simultaneously provide parents assistance to reunify with their children and to prepare for permanent placement for dependent children should reunification fail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 421 n. 15, 906 A.2d 898 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Mr. and Ms. B. now argue that \u201creasonable efforts\u201d were insufficient, and the court erred in closing the children\u2019s CINA case when no showing was made to satisfy \u201cactive efforts\u201d under the ICWA. The ICWA does not define \u201cactive efforts,\u201d and no case law in Maryland has previously addressed this issue. The Supreme Court of South Dakota discussed the differences between the ICWA and the ASFA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">ICWA differs from ASFA in its means of promoting Indian children\u2019s best interests. ICWA ensures the best interests of Indian children by maintaining their familial, tribal, and cultural ties. It seeks to prevent capricious severance of those ties, whereas ASFA identifies permanency as a major consideration in promoting the best interests of children. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>further distinction between the two acts____is the requirement in ICWA that state agencies make \u201cactive\u201d efforts to provide services aimed at the prevention of a family breakup. ICWA provides no exception to this mandate. On the other hand, in an attempt to assist states in increasing the speed with which children might achieve the desired goal of permanency.... ASFA relieves states from making merely perfunctory remedial efforts in cases where a court has found that the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances of abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>People ex rel. J.S.B., Jr., </em>691 N.W.2d 611, 617 (S.D.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The South Dakota court concluded that the ASFA does not override the ICWA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">If it is perhaps open to question whether our Legislature understood the terms \u201creasonable efforts\u201d and \u201cactive efforts\u201d to be interchangeable, we do not think Congress intended that ASFA\u2019s \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d should undo the State\u2019s burden of providing \u201cactive efforts\u201d under ICWA. Three rules of statutory construction dictate otherwise. First, ICWA clearly offers no exception to its requirement of \u201cactive efforts.\u201d And ASFA does not mention ICWA, much less state that its exceptions to \u201creasonable efforts\u201d should apply to ICWA\u2019s \u201cactive efforts.\u201d In fact, no provision in ASFA specifically purports to modify ICWA. It would seem illogical that ASFA would implicitly leave unchanged certain ICWA provisions, like notice to tribes, intervention, and transfer to tribal courts, while modifying others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">Second, the rules of statutory construction require that the more specific statute controls. As between the two acts, ICWA is the more specific. ICWA deals with a discrete segment of our population, Native American families, who Congress found were best served by maintaining their relationships with their tribes and extended families[J * * <em>* * </em>* <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">Third, when interpreting a statute pertaining to Indians, the United States Supreme Court has stated, \u201cstatutes are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit....\u201d As Congress found when it enacted ICWA, it is to the benefit of Indian children to remain within their families and only after \u201cactive efforts\u201d to reunite those families have proven unsuccessful should the children be removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 619 (citations and footnote omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Definitions of \u201cactive efforts\u201d under the federal statute vary by state, and what constitutes \u201cactive efforts\u201d is usually fact specific. The majority of courts that have considered the \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement, however, have determined that it sets a higher standard for social services departments than the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d required by state statutes. <em>See In re Welfare of Children of S.W., </em>727 N.W.2d 144, 150 (Minn.Ct. App.2007), <em>review denied, </em>Mar. 28, 2007 (Minnesota Tribal/State Indian Child Welfare Agreement defines the term \u201cactive efforts\u201d as \u201cthorough, careful, and culturally appropriate efforts\u201d); <em>Winston J. v. State, Dept. of Health and Soc. Servs., Ofc. of Children\u2019s Servs., </em>134 P.3d 343, 347 n. 18 (Alaska 2006)(stating that the ICWA\u2019s \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement is more demanding than the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d required by the state statute); <em>In re Interest of Dakota L., </em>14 Neb.App. 559, 712 N.W.2d 583, 594 (2006)(recognizing that the \u201cactive efforts\u201d provision in the state\u2019s ICWA is \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d in the state statute); <em>In re A.N., </em>325 Mont. 379, 106 P.3d 556, 560 (2005)(determining that \u201c[t]he term active efforts, by definition, implies heightened responsibility compared to passive efforts. Giving the parent a treatment plan and waiting for him to complete it would constitute passive efforts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>We are persuaded that the cases cited in the previous paragraph properly interpreted the ICWA in holding that the \u201cactive efforts\u201d standard requires more effort than a \u201creasonable efforts\u201d standard does. We emphasize, however, that the requirement of \u201cactive efforts\u201d does not require \u201cfutile efforts.\u201d In an ICWA case, the South Dakota Supreme Court affirmed a termination of parental rights, after several years of efforts by the Department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">Under ICWA, DSS was bound by law to make \u201cactive efforts\u201d to reunite J.S.B. with his father, but it was not required to persist with futile efforts. Considering that DSS worked with the parents for several years, that J.S.B. had been removed from their custody three times because of substance abuse related neglect, that the child has been in foster care for much of his life, and that both parents continued their debilitating substance abuse, termination of parental rights was the least restrictive alternative available and in the best interests of J.S.B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\"><em>People ex rel. J.S.B., Jr., </em>691 N.W.2d at 621 (citation omitted and emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In contrast, here, the B. children were only removed once, and the Department\u2019s permanency plan was changed from reunification with the parents to custody with another relative after only 6 months of Department intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Moreover, there were alleged reasons why the B.\u2019s could not participate in the programs recommended by the Department. Ms. B. testified that she could not attend the recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cAnother Way\u201d methadone treatment program because she could not afford $300 a month, the cost of the program. Not only did Ms. B. have a panic disorder, but the testimony revealed that Mr. B. suffers from bipolar disorder. The B.\u2019s could not receive the necessary mental health evaluations because, under the Department\u2019s policy, mental health treatment was not offered until parents conquered their substance addictions. In this case, we think that it was necessary for the Court to consider if the Department sufficiently addressed the B.\u2019s mental disorders in deciding what \u201cactive efforts\u201d were required. On remand, the court may wish to consider Ms. B.\u2019s testimony that she enrolled in an abused persons program, attended AA meetings, participated in an Indian Education program with her children, and successfully attended an in-patient drug treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We do not know exactly what additional services the Department could have provided. It may have been able to identify funds to help pay for the \u201cAnother Way\u201d methadone treatment, or offer other assistance to Ms. B. to deal with her substance abuse problem. Quite possibly, the \u201cactive efforts\u201d standard, under these circumstances, would require the Department to do more than just recommend a program. The \u201cactive efforts\u201d standard may also have required that the Department facilitate Ms. B.\u2019s visitations with her children, which she said she could not make because she \u201cwas hiding\u201d in her house, possibly due to her panic disorder, by having a social worker accompany her when she leaves her home for the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Whether additional steps are required will depend not only on the particular facts of the case, but on what resources the Department has, a matter not addressed in this record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>burden is on the Department to demonstrate that a lack of resources prevented it from making more active efforts on her behalf. <em>See 25 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In relation to the \u201cactive efforts\u201d standard, the circuit court said only that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADs\">I guess it\u2019s a question of \u2014 definition of active effort. I don\u2019t agree with your definition. I think you can be active. I think, for example, a school principal at an elementary school can be active in recommending to a parent that the child go see a child psychiatrist. I don\u2019t think the school has to have a psychiatrist, you know, on their staff, and that\u2019s still being active.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Indeed, the circuit court appeared to equate the \u201cactive efforts\u201d standard with a \u201creasonable efforts\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">We think the Supreme Court of Alaska\u2019s explanation of what constitutes \u201cactive efforts\u201d better reflects the legislative purpose of the ICWA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">[W]e cited the distinction between \u201cactive efforts\u201d and \u201cpassive efforts\u201d drawn by Craig J. Dorsay, <em>The Indian Child Welfare Act and, Laws Affecting Indian Juveniles Manual </em>157-58 (1984). According to Dorsay, passive efforts entail merely drawing up a reunification plan and requiring the \u201cclient\u201d to use \u201chis or her own resources to[ ] bring [ ] it to fruition.\u201d Dorsay at 157-58. Active efforts, on the other hand, include \u201ctak[ing] the client through the steps of the plan rather than requiring the plan be performed on its own.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-10\"><em>A.M. v.
