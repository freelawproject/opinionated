Marquis, appellee (\u201cWife\u201d), an absolute divorce from David D. Marquis, appellant (\u201cHusband\u201d). In the judgment of divorce, the court ordered Wife to receive 50 percent of the marital portion of Husband\u2019s military retirement benefits \u201con an if, as, and when received basis[.]\u201d The court further directed that it would retain jurisdiction in the case for the purposes of a Constituted Pension Order (\u201cCPO\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Upon Husband\u2019s retirement from military service, the parties disagreed about whether Wife\u2019s portion of Husband\u2019s retirement benefits would be calculated before or after statutory, regulatory, or elective deductions were applied. Wife filed a petition for contempt, alleging that Husband was in default of the divorce decree because, <em>inter alia, </em>he failed to consent to Wife\u2019s proposed CPO. Following a hearing on the petition, the master issued a report recommending that the court find Husband in contempt. Husband thereafter filed exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations and petitioned for a hearing on the exceptions. The court did not conduct a hearing. The court entered an order finding Husband in contempt and requiring him to sign Wife\u2019s proposed CPO and pay $2,333.00 in attorney\u2019s fees to Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Husband timely appealed. He presents eight questions for our consideration, which we have consolidated into three:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>I. Did the court err by finding Husband in contempt of court for failing to sign Wife\u2019s proposed CPO?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\">II. Did the court err by entering a CPO that modified the parties\u2019 final judgment of absolute divorce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">III. Did the court err by granting Wife\u2019s motion to dismiss Husband\u2019s request for a hearing on his exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The parties married on August 8, 1986. Three children were born of the marriage: David Marquis, born September 30, 1988; Lindly Marquis, born July 7, 1990; and Matthew Marquis, born September 5,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Before the parties married, Husband entered into the United States Navy. He continued to serve in the Navy during the parties\u2019 marriage. The record indicates that Husband anticipated retiring on December 1, 2006, and, upon his retirement, Husband was eligible to receive military retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">On July 21, 2004, the parties divorced by a consent judgment of absolute divorce. In the judgment, the parties agreed that Wife would receive a 50 percent portion of the marital share of Husband\u2019s military retirement benefits. The judgment read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">ORDERED, that the parties agree that [Wife] will receive a portion of [Husband\u2019s] retirement from the United State\u2019s [sic] Navy on an if, as, and when received basis with the numerator being 197 months, being the total amount of months married, the denominator being the total months earned towards the retirement divided by one half[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">The court further ordered that it \u201cshall retain jurisdiction in this matter for the purposes of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order [ (\u2018QDRO\u2019) ] and/or a Qualifying Retirement Order[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Following the divorce, both parties filed contempt petitions containing allegations related to, <em>inter alia, </em>alimony, child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>support, and the sale of the parties\u2019 real property. The disposition of those issues is not raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On June 16, 2005, counsel for Wife mailed to counsel for Husband a proposed CPO that implemented the terms of the parties\u2019 judgment of divorce. Husband did not sign the proposed CPO, but he returned the draft to Wife with suggested changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">After incorporating the suggested changes, counsel for Wife again sent the proposed CPO to counsel for Husband for signature. Paragraph 5B of the proposed CPO read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\"><em>Military Benefits. </em>[Wife] shall receive Fifty Percent (50%) of a fraction of [Husband\u2019s] military retirement benefits. The fraction shall have as its numerator 197 and shall have as its denominator [Husband\u2019s] total months of creditable service for purposes of retired pay. [Wife\u2019s] share shall be credited with fifty percent (50%) of the same fraction of any future cost-of-living increases with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">For purposes of this Order, \u201cmilitary retirement benefits\u201d means <em>retired pay actually paid </em>to which [Husband] would be entitled based on length of active duty or reserve military service and all payments paid or payable under the provisions of <em>Chapter 36 or Chapter 61 </em>of Title 10 of the United States Code, <em>before </em>statutory, regulatory, or elective deductions are applied. It also includes all amounts taken by [Husband] in lieu of retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">(Some emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Husband did not sign and return the proposed CPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">On August 24, 2005, Wife mailed the proposed CPO to Husband for signature a third time. In a cover letter accompanying the proposed CPO, counsel for Wife warned counsel for Husband that Wife would file a petition for contempt if Husband did not sign the proposed CP O. Again, Husband did not sign the CPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">On September 28, 2005, Wife filed a petition for contempt. She alleged that Husband was in default of the divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>judgment because he failed, <em>inter alia, </em>to sign the proposed CPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">On November 15, 2005, Wife\u2019s petition for contempt came on for a hearing before a master. Both parties were represented by counsel. The master first addressed allegations contained in the petition that are not relevant to the present appeal. Regarding the proposed CPO, Husband informed the master that he sought to change the words \u201cmilitary retirement benefits\u201d in Paragraph 5B of the proposed CPO to \u201cdisposable military retired pay.\u201d The master deferred argument on issues relating to the CPO to permit the parties to obtain expert witnesses. The master stated that, in the event he found Husband\u2019s proposed changes to the CPO would harm Wife\u2019s rights as established in the judgment for divorce, Husband would be held in contempt and ordered to pay attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Two weeks after the hearing, Husband, through counsel, mailed to Wife\u2019s counsel a letter requesting that the word \u201cbefore\u201d in Paragraph 5B of the proposed CPO be changed to \u201cafter.\u201d In effect, such a change would allow Wife\u2019s 50 percent of the marital share of Husband\u2019s military retirement pay to be calculated after statutory, regulatory, or elective deductions were taken from Husband\u2019s payments. In other words, Wife\u2019s share would be calculated from the amount of retirement pay that Husband actually receives, rather than from the gross amount before statutory, regulatory, or elective deductions are applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">On January 10, 2006, the parties held a hearing before the master to address the allegations contained in Wife\u2019s petition for contempt relating to the proposed CPO. Husband was not represented by counsel at that hearing. Wife\u2019s expert witness, Wendy Widmann, was qualified as an expert in the area of \u201cQualified Domestic Relations Orders including those orders dealing with the division of military benefits under Maryland law.\u201d She testified that Husband\u2019s proposal to change \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cafter\u201d in Paragraph 5B of the proposed CPO would reduce Wife\u2019s portion of Husband\u2019s military retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>benefits by limiting her share of retirement benefits to Husband\u2019s disposable retired pay. She testified that such a limitation was not supported by the judgment for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Wife testified at the hearing about the counsel and expert witness fees she incurred in filing the contempt petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Husband also testified at the hearing. He testified that, if the language of the proposed CPO were changed from \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cafter,\u201d he would not take any action to reduce Wife\u2019s one-half share of his retirement benefits. He further argued that the judgment of divorce did not require him to cooperate in signing Wife\u2019s proposed CPO, and that his failure to sign the order did not render him in contempt of court. Husband did not present an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Following the close of Husband\u2019s case, the master set forth his findings. He stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">The Court finds that [Husband], in his testimony and presentation to the Court on today\u2019s date, agrees that it was always his intent that his wife receive \u2014 or his former wife receive her portion of his military retirement benefit based on the <em>[Bangs </em>] formula. That being the numerator being one hundred and ninety seven months over the denominator being the total number of months earned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">The Court finds the difference between military retirement benefits and disposable retired pay is significant. That disposable retired pay allows the military service member to take certain exclusions that in fact would reduce the base amount of his retirement that [Wife] would be eligible for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">The master noted that in two cases, <em>Dexter v. Dexter, </em>105 Md.App. 678, 661 A.2d 171, <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 27, 668 A.2d 36 (1995), and <em>Potts v. Potts, </em>142 Md.App. 448, 790 A.2d 703, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 181, 798 A.2d 553 (2002), this Court recognized that, absent an agreement by the parties, a service member should not be allowed to reduce his potential retirement benefits by electing a disability portion or by electing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>other exclusions. The master found that changing the word \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cafter\u201d would permit Husband \u201cto take certain exclusions including elected deductions that would in fact reduce the base amount of his retirement and would impact [Wife\u2019s] property rights.\u201d He recommended that the court find Husband in contempt for his failure to authorize Wife\u2019s proposed CPO. He also recommended that the court set the purge amount at $2,333.00, which includes $2,083.00 in Wife\u2019s expert witness fees and $250.00 in Wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On January 18, 2006, Husband filed exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations. He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the recommendations provide Wife with relief that was not granted in the parties\u2019 judgment of divorce. He further asserted that the master\u2019s recommendation that he pay Wife\u2019s expert witness fees is \u201cpunitive.\u201d Wife filed a response to Husband\u2019s exceptions, arguing that Husband failed to act in good faith in negotiating the terms of the CPO and that the evidence and testimony adduced at trial supported the master\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On February 14, 2006, Husband filed a request for a hearing on the exceptions, and the court scheduled a hearing for March 14, 2006. On February 27, 2006, Wife filed a motion to strike Husband\u2019s request for a hearing, arguing that Husband\u2019s request was untimely pursuant to Maryland Rule 9-208(i)(l). That same day, the court continued the hearing on Husband\u2019s exceptions until April 13, 2006. Two weeks later, the court set the matter for a hearing on May 4, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On April 3, 2006, Wife filed a second request to continue the hearing on Husband\u2019s exceptions. The court granted the request and continued the hearing until May 23, 2006, but a hearing was never conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">On May 11, 2006, the master filed a written report setting forth his recommendations. That same day, the court entered three orders. In the first order, the court struck Husband\u2019s petition for a hearing on the ground that the petition was not timely filed. In the second order, entitled \u201cConstituted Pension Order,\u201d the court directed Husband to pay Wife her 50 percent marital share of Husband\u2019s military retirement bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>fits before any statutory, regulatory, or elective deductions were applied. The court signed a third order in which it found Husband in contempt of court for failure to authorize Wife\u2019s proposed CPO, ordered Husband to sign the CPO, and ordered that Husband could purge himself of contempt by paying $2,333.00 to Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Husband noted a timely appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Husband raises a number of arguments in support of his contention that the court erred in finding him in contempt for failing to sign Wife\u2019s proposed CPO. He argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court erred in accepting the master\u2019s recommendations because the master relied solely on misleading expert testimony, improperly excluded exhibits demonstrating his good faith efforts to cooperate in drafting a CPO, and failed to advise him of his right to counsel at the January 10, 2006 hearing. Husband further argues that the court abused its discretion by finding him in contempt because no statute or court order required him to sign Wife\u2019s proposed CPO. He also contends that the court erred in failing to rule on his exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations. He argues, moreover, that the court erred in setting the purge amount. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">We begin by briefly summarizing Maryland law relating to civil contempt proceedings. \u201cA civil contempt proceeding is intended to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to a suit and to compel obedience to orders and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>decrees primarily made to benefit such parties.\u201d <em>State v. Roll and Scholl, </em>267 Md. 714, 728, 298 A.2d 867 (1973); <em>accord Bahena v. Foster, </em>164 Md.App. 275, 286, 883 A.2d 218 (2005). \u201c[CJivil contempt proceedings are generally remedial in nature and are intended to coerce future compliance,\u201d and \u201ca penalty in a civil contempt must provide for purging.\u201d <em>Bahena, </em>164 Md.App. at 286, 883 A.2d 218 (internal quotation marks omitted). Civil contempt \u201cneed be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The failure to obey a court order may precipitate the initiation of contempt proceedings. <em>See id. </em>\u201c[OJne may not be held in contempt of a court order,\u201d however, \u201cunless the failure to comply with the court order was or is willful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 883 A.2d 218. \u201cThe order must be sufficiently definite, certain, and specific in its terms so that the party may understand precisely what conduct the order requires.\u201d <em>Droney v. Droney, </em>102 Md.App. 672, 684, 651 A.2d 415 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The decision to hold a party in contempt is vested in the trial court. <em>See Bienenfeld v. Bennett-White, </em>91 Md.App. 488, 514, 605 A.2d 172, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 625, 612 A.2d 256 (1992). \u201cThis Court will only reverse such a decision upon a showing that a finding of fact upon which the contempt was imposed was clearly erroneous or that the court abused its discretion in finding particular behavior to be contemptuous.\u201d <em>Droney, </em>102 Md.App. at 683-84, 651 A.2d 415; <em>see also Bienenfeld, </em>91 Md.App. at 514, 605 A.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Husband\u2019s primary challenge on appeal relates to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the master\u2019s recommendations. He argues that the court erred in accepting the master\u2019s recommendations because the master relied solely on misleading expert testimony, improperly excluded exhibits, and failed to advise him of his right to counsel at the January 10, 2006 hearing. We find no merit in any of those complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Husband takes issue with the testimony offered by Wife\u2019s expert, Ms. Widmann, concerning 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408. That section, entitled \u201cPayment of retired or retainer pay in compliance with court order,\u201d addresses the payment of child support and alimony from a retired service member\u2019s retirement pay. Regarding \u00a7 1408, Ms. Widmann testified: \u201c[T]he statute says that [] an order that does not limit the amounts paid to disposable retired pay is an acceptable order to the military. It says that in the statute specifically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Husband claims that Ms. Widmann\u2019s statement is \u201cfalse or at least misleading\u201d in light of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(e)(5), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\"><em>A court order which itself or because of previously served court orders provides for the payment of an amount which exceeds the amount of disposable retired pay available for payment </em>because of the limit set forth in paragraph (1), or which, because of previously served court orders or legal process previously served under section 459 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659), provides for payment of an amount that exceeds the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (1) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4), <em>shall not be considered to be irregular on its face solely for that reason. </em>However, such order shall be considered to be fully satisfied for purposes of this section by the payment to the spouse or former spouse of the maximum amount of disposable retired pay permitted under paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4).[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">We do not agree with Husband that Ms. Widmann\u2019s statement regarding \u00a7 1408 was false or misleading. Ms. Wid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>mann testified that an order that \u201cdoes not limit the amounts paid to disposable retired pay is an acceptable order[.]\u201d That statement does not contradict section (e)(5), which provides that an order directing the payment of an amount exceeding disposable retired pay \u201cshall not be considered to be irregular on its face solely for that reason.\u201d Wife agrees that \u201cthe military, pursuant to statute and regulation, will not pay a former spouse directly more than 50% of disposable retired pay pursuant to Court Order.\u201d The regulations, however, do not prohibit a military member from directly making payments that exceed 50 percent of disposable retired pay. <em>See </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(e)(6) (\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a member of liability for the payment of alimony, child support, or other payments required by a court order on the grounds that payments made out of disposable retired pay under this section have been made in the maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>mum amount permitted under paragraph (1) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Husband also takes issue with Ms. Widmann\u2019s contention that the CPO proposed by Wife contains all language required by federal regulation. He argues that the order violates federal regulation because it does not \u201cprovide specifically for payment of a fixed amount expressed in U.S. dollars or payment as a percentage or a fraction of disposable retired pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">At the hearing, Ms. Widmann testified that \u201cit is infrequent that an award [of military retirement benefits to a former spouse] is stated as a fixed dollar amount.\u201d She stated: \u201cThe more common method of expressing the former spouse\u2019s award is in the percentage of the member\u2019s disposable retired pay.\u201d When asked how the amount of Wife\u2019s award was stated in the proposed CPO, Ms. Widmann responded, \u201cIt\u2019s divided as a percentage ... because it\u2019s one half a fraction, the numerator being one ninety seven over the denominator being the total months served. So its essentially a percentage award.\u201d Husband has not convinced us that Ms. Widmann\u2019s testimony was false or that the proposed CPO fails to contain all the language required by federal regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">As for Husband\u2019s claim that the court erred in accepting the master\u2019s report and recommendations because the master relied \u201csolely on expert testimony,\u201d nothing in the record supports Husband\u2019s assertion. The master heard testimony not only from Wife\u2019s expert, Ms. Widmann, but also from Husband and Wife. The master\u2019s report and recommendations do not indicate that he relied on expert testimony only and failed to consider other testimony and evidence offered by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Husband also argues that the court erred in accepting the master\u2019s recommendations because the master erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>refused to admit two defense exhibits into evidence. He contends that the exhibits show that he acted in good faith and cooperated with the drafting of a CPO. Both exhibits, which were letters from Husband\u2019s counsel to Wife\u2019s counsel, set forth Husband\u2019s requested changes to Wife\u2019s proposed CPO. The first letter, dated July 1, 2005, detailed several specific changes to the proposed CPO. The second letter, dated November 29, 2005, requested only the change of the word \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cafter\u201d in Paragraph 5B of the proposed CPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Counsel for Wife objected to the admission of the July 1, 2005 letter on the ground that it was not relevant. The master sustained the objection, but asked Husband to testify about the information contained in the letter. Husband testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">[F]rom the first time my attorney has \u2014 was notified by [Wife] about the \u2014 trying to draft a constituted military pension order, there\u2019s been numerous communications back and forth between attorneys---- The attorneys have worked diligently trying to come up with language that both parties would accept.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Regarding the November 29, 2005 letter, the master heard extensive evidence on Husband\u2019s request to change the word \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cafter\u201d in Paragraph 5B of the proposed CPO. The master received into evidence Defense Exhibit 2, a letter dated November 30, 2005, that was substantially similar to the November 29, 2005 letter. Both letters were addressed from Husband\u2019s counsel to Wife\u2019s counsel, and both letters set forth Husband\u2019s request to change the word \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cafter.\u201d Wife\u2019s expert witness, Ms. Widmann, testified that, in the November 30, 2005 letter, counsel for Husband requested \u201cto change the word before to the word after[.]\u201d And Husband testified that he \u201cagreed to give on every single thing requested in the pension order with the exception of one word.\u201d Because the master heard evidence on the contents of the July 1, 2005 and November 29, 2005 letters, Husband has not persuaded us that the master\u2019s refusal to admit the two exhibits into evidence, prejudiced him and thereby created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>error requiring reversal of the order of contempt. <em>See Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 91, 854 A.2d 1180 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Husband further challenges the court\u2019s acceptance of the master\u2019s recommendations on the ground that the master did not advise him of his right to counsel. He argues that the master deprived him of due process in violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights by allowing him to act as his own attorney at the January 10, 2006 hearing without notifying him of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We have mentioned that Husband was represented by counsel at the first hearing before the master, but not the second.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Before Husband testified at the second hearing, the master stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">I\u2019m running the Court, you\u2019re not so listen to me. You actually are right now a lawyer. So I need you to come up here. Now, this is highly unorthodox, but we\u2019re going to actually have \u2014 swear you in as a lawyer and you can tell the truth. Swear him in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Thereafter, Husband was sworn in and proceeded to argue and testify on his own behalf. He argues on appeal that no provision of the Maryland Constitution or the Maryland Rules allowed the master to swear him in as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Wife responds that Husband was informed of his right to counsel in the petition for contempt.\u00ae She contends that Husband \u201chad every opportunity to avail himself of an attorney\u2019s representation if he so desired.\u201d She correctly asserts, moreover, that Maryland Rule 15-206(e)(l), which addresses waiver of the right to counsel, applies only to a hearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>a judge where incarceration is sought and does not apply to the January 10, 2006 hearing before the master.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">We agree with Wife. The master swore in Husband so that he could provide testimony under oath. The master did not, however, deprive Husband of due process by allowing him to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The petition for contempt informed Husband of his right to counsel, and, in fact, it encouraged Husband to seek legal representation \u201cat once.\u201d Husband evidently was aware of the right, for he was represented by counsel at the November 15, 2005 hearing before the master. He therefore cannot successfully complain that either he had no notice of his right to counsel or that the master erred by allowing him to proceed without counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Husband also takes issue with the court\u2019s contempt finding because, he argues, the specific and unambiguous language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the judgment for absolute divorce did not compel him to consent to a CPO or to cooperate in the drafting of a CPO. He argues that Wife used contempt proceedings to force him to consent to an order that was not required by the divorce decree. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that, where cooperation is necessary to the performance of a condition [in a contract], a duty to cooperate will be implied[.]\u201d <em>Dexter, </em>105 Md.App. 678, 684, 661 A.2d 171 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Dexter, </em>the parties entered into an agreement upon their divorce regarding military retirement benefits that was incorporated into their divorce decree. The agreement entitled the Wife to \u201c \u2018forty-seven and a half percent (47.5%) of the [Husband\u2019s] military pension ... on a monthly basis \u201cas, if, and when\u201d it is paid by the Department of the Army to the [Husband].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 661 A.2d 171. Shortly after Husband was placed on retirement, he voluntarily waived his rights to Army retirement benefits in order to qualify for greater benefits through the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 680, 661 A.2d 171. The statute providing for VA benefits prohibits division of the benefits to a former spouse; thus, in waiving the Army benefits, the Husband effectively deprived the Wife of any benefits. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ruled that, under the parties\u2019 agreement, the Husband could not pursue the VA benefits and at the same time deprive the Wife of the benefits she bargained for under the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 683, 661 A.2d 171. We affirmed the trial court and held that each party had an obligation to take reasonable steps to bring the agreement to fruition. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 661 A.2d 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In the present case, the consent judgment of divorce specifically provides that Wife shall receive an expressly stated percentage portion of Husband\u2019s military retirement benefits \u201con an if, as, and when received basis.\u201d Pursuant to the consent judgment, the Husband has \u201c \u2018an obligation to act in good faith and to deal fairly with the other party ... and an obligation to cooperate when necessary to the performance of a condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, 661 A.2d 171 (quoting <em>P.V. Proper</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>ties, Inc. v. Rock Creek Village Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>77 Md.App. 77, 86-87, 549 A.2d 403 (1988)). There is no merit to Husband\u2019s argument that he was not required to cooperate with the drafting and signing of a CPO that accurately reflects the consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Husband next argues that the court erred in finding him in contempt because it did not rule on his exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations. He argues that the exceptions set forth errors by the master and the court\u2019s orders do not reflect its consideration of the exceptions or its independent determination of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The court order granting Wife\u2019s motion to strike Husband\u2019s petition for a hearing reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">THIS MATTER, having come before the Court by Motion, and all matters having been considered, it is ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">ORDERED that the [Wife\u2019s] Motion to Strike the [Husband\u2019s] Petition for a Hearing on [Husband\u2019s] Exceptions to Recommendations of Master is hereby granted; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-9\">ORDERED that the Court finds that [Husband\u2019s] Request for Hearing was not timely filed and that an Order based on the Report and Recommendations of the Master shall be signed concurrently herewith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">\u201cExceptions to the recommendations of a master warrant an independent consideration by the trial court.\u201d <em>Kierein v. Kierein, </em>115 Md.App. 448, 453, 693 A.2d 1157 (1997). The court must \u201cexercise its independent judgment, consider the allegations^] and decide each such question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 693 A.2d 1157 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe trial court may consider additional testimony or independently consider the report and recommendations of the master. The trial court \u2018should defer to the fact-finding of the master where the fact-finding is supported by credible evidence, and is not, therefore, clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 693 A.2d 1157 (quoting <em>Wenger v. Wenger, </em>42 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>596, 602, 402 A.2d 94 (1979)). The court, however, need not \u201cgive a litany <em>of </em>its reasons for accepting and adopting the fact finding, conclusions, and recommendations of the master.\u201d <em>Kierein, </em>115 Md.App. at 455-56, 693 A.2d 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Moreover, \u201c[tjrial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it properly.\u201d <em>Aventis Pasteur, Inc. v.

Wagner, </em>109 Md.App. 1, 50, 674 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 334, 681 A.2d 69 (1996). A judge is not required to \u201cset out in intimate detail each and every step in his or her thought process.\u201d <em>Kirsner v. Edelmann, </em>65 Md.App. 185, 196 n. 9, 499 A.2d 1313 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We find no merit in Husband\u2019s assertion that the court failed to exercise its independent judgment or to consider Husband\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">As we have mentioned, Wife presented expert testimony at the January 10, 2006 hearing that Husband\u2019s proposed changes to the CPO would negatively affect her property rights, as set forth in the consent judgment. Husband, for his part, presented no expert testimony to the contrary. The master therefore based his report and recommendations on Wife\u2019s undisputed expert testimony. Because the report and recommendations were supported by credible evidence, the court\u2019s deference to those findings was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Kierein, </em>115 Md.App. at 453, 693 A.2d 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The court stated in the May 11, 2007 order granting Wife\u2019s request to strike Husband\u2019s untimely request for a hearing on the exceptions that it had considered \u201call matters.\u201d In so doing, the court was not required to \u201cset out in intimate detail each and every step\u201d of its thought process. <em>Kirsner, </em>65 Md.App. at 196, n. 9, 499 A.2d 1313. We therefore reject as meritless Husband\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s orders do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>reflect its consideration of the exceptions or its independent determination of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Finally, Husband challenges the court\u2019s finding of contempt by arguing that the court erred in imposing the purge amount. He contends that the court failed to comply with Maryland Rule 15-207(d)(2) by not specifying in a written order the sanction for the contempt. Rule 15-207(d)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">When a court or jury makes a finding of contempt, the court shall issue a written order that specifies the sanction imposed for the contempt. In the case of a civil contempt, the order shall specify how the contempt may be purged. In the case of a criminal contempt, if the sanction is incarceration, the order shall specify a determinate term and any condition under which the sanction may be suspended, modified, revoked, or terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Wife responds that, at the November 15, 2005 hearing, the parties agreed to postpone the proceedings related to the military retirement payments to allow both parties to obtain expert witnesses. She states that the parties postponed the proceedings \u201cwith the express stipulation\u201d that, if the expert testimony showed that Husband\u2019s proposed changes were unreasonable or would harm Wife\u2019s rights as established under the judgment for absolute divorce, then Husband would be held in contempt and ordered to pay a purge amount measured by Wife\u2019s expert witness\u2019s fees and counsel\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">The transcript of the hearing reveals that the master indeed informed Husband that he would be required to pay Wife\u2019s counsel fees if he were found in contempt. In the presence of Husband\u2019s counsel, the master stated to Wife\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">Well, in the future the issue is over the QDRO, so what you need to do ... is you have your client identify it, and offer it as an exhibit. Then we\u2019ll have [Husband\u2019s attorney] tell us what [is] wrong with it. Now, if what she says is wrong with it is legitimate and reasonable, then we\u2019re not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>going to mark the QDRO down as a contemptible issue. We\u2019re going to straighten it out and get it signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">If [attorney for Husband\u2019s] issue is unreasonable, then we\u2019re going to talk about lawyer fees. And we\u2019re going to talk about lawyer fees \u2014 I\u2019m going to try to figure out who refused to approve it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The court continued: \u201c[H]ere\u2019s the bottom line, if his position is determined to be unreasonable, he\u2019s going to pay those lawyer fees.\u201d The master thus informed Husband that if his reasoning for refusing to sign the proposed CPO was unjustified, then the court would find him in contempt and require him to purge the contempt by paying Wife\u2019s counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Husband\u2019s argument that the court erred by failing to specify in a 'written order the sanction for contempt is also without merit. At the January 10, 2006 hearing, Wife testified about the attorney\u2019s fees that she incurred in bringing the contempt petition. Thereafter, on May 11, 2006, the court issued an order that specifically states Husband \u201cmay purge himself of contempt by paying the sum of $2,333.00 on or before July 10, 2006[,]\u201d which included $2,083.00 in expert witness fees and $250.00 in additional attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Husband next contends that the court abused its discretion by ordering him to sign the CPO proposed by Wife, because it both modified the parties\u2019 judgment of absolute divorce and was contrary to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408. He presents no argument in his brief to support those assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">We do not agree with Husband that the court\u2019s CPO modified the parties\u2019 judgment of absolute divorce. The divorce judgment states specifically that Wife shall receive a portion of Husband\u2019s military retirement benefits \u201con an if, as, and when received basis.\u201d The May 11, 2006 CPO issued by the court ensures that Wife will receive the benefits she bargained for under the consent judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Husband, moreover, has not explained how-he believes the CPO violates 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408. Wife\u2019s expert witness testified that the CPO is consistent with 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408, and Husband has presented no argument to the contrary, either at trial or on appeal. We stated in <em>Sodergren v. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory </em>that \u201c[i]t is not our function to seek out the law in support of a party\u2019s appellate contentions.\u201d 138 Md.App. 686, 707, 773 A.2d 592 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We decline \u201cto attempt to fashion coherent legal theories to support appellant\u2019s sweeping claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Lastly, Husband contends that the court erred by not holding a hearing on his exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations. He argues that Wife\u2019s motion to strike Husband\u2019s request for a hearing on the exceptions was untimely filed and the court therefore erred in granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Wife responds that Husband\u2019s request for a hearing on the exceptions was itself not timely filed. She contends that Maryland Rule 9-208(i) permitted the court to rule on Husband\u2019s exceptions without conducting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Maryland Rule 9-208(i) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">Hearing on exceptions. (1) Generally. The court may decide exceptions without a hearing, unless a request for a hearing is filed with the exceptions or by an opposing party <em>within ten days after service of the exceptions. </em>The exceptions shall be decided on the evidence presented to the master unless: (A) the excepting party sets forth with particularity the additional evidence to be offered and the reasons why the evidence was not offered before the master, and (B) the court determines that the additional evidence should be considered. If additional evidence is to be considered, the court may remand the matter to the master to hear and consider the additional evidence or conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>(2) When hearing to be held. A hearing on exceptions, if timely requested, shall be held within 60 days after the filing of the exceptions unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. If a transcript cannot be completed in time for the scheduled hearing and the parties cannot agree to an extension of time or to a statement of facts, the court may use the electronic recording in lieu of the transcript at the hearing or continue the hearing until the transcript is completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We agree with Wife that Husband\u2019s request for a hearing was not timely filed pursuant to Rule 9-208(i)(l). On January 18, 2006, Husband filed exceptions to the master\u2019s report and recommendations without a request for a hearing. He did not request a hearing within ten days after the exceptions were filed; it was not until 27 days after he filed his exceptions that he requested a hearing. Moreover, Wife\u2019s response to the exceptions, which was filed on February 3, 2006, also did not include a request for a hearing. As neither party requested a hearing on the exceptions \u201cwithin ten days after service of the exceptions,\u201d the court did not err in ruling on the exceptions without conducting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Husband\u2019s argument that Wife\u2019s motion to strike the request for a hearing was not timely filed does not persuade us. Regardless of the untimeliness of Husband\u2019s motion to strike the request for a hearing, Husband\u2019s request was itself untimely. The court, therefore, could properly deny the request for a hearing pursuant to Rule 9-208(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\">. In her brief, Wife points out that throughout the proceedings the parties, the master and the court improperly referred to the CPO as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\u201cQDRO\u201d). A QDRO is a domestic-relations order that creates or recognizes the existence of an alternative payee\u2019s right to receive all or a portion of the payments to a pension-plan participant. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 414(p) (2002, 2007 Supp.).
