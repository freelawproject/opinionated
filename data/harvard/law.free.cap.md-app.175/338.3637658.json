She maintains, however, invoking the provisions of Section 20-603(a)(2)(ii), that she notified MAIF of a claim for damages within thirty days after her attorney first received notice that Allstate Insurance Company had disclaimed coverage on a policy and thus removed or withdrew liability insurance coverage for her claim against an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>MAIF, for purposes of this appeal, admits that Mrs. McNeill notified it within thirty days after she learned that Allstate had <em>denied </em>coverage to the uninsured motorist. But, relying exclusively on the decision in <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund v. Holland, </em>241 Md. 294, 216 A.2d 525 (1966), MAIF asserts that Allstate never <em>\u201cdisclaimed\u201d </em>coverage as that term is used in Section 20-603(a)(2)(ii)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, argues MAIF, Allstate merely notified Mrs. McNeill that it provided \u201cno coverage\u201d of the uninsured motorist for the subject accident. MAIF asserts that within the meaning of Section 20-603, an insurer does not \u201cdisclaim\u201d coverage if it simply advises a claimant that there never was coverage in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">On July 17, 2002, Irish McNeill was a passenger on a bus when a vehicle driven by Damon Dodd (\u201cDodd\u201d) struck the bus. As a result of the accident, Mrs. McNeill and her husband filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The complaint alleged that Mrs. McNeill suffered bodily injuries as a result of the accident, which was solely caused by the negligence of Dodd and that the McNeills, jointly, suffered injuries due to loss of consortium due to Mrs. McNeill\u2019s injuries. The complaint further alleged that the vehicle operated by Dodd was owned by Katherine Curran and Michael Curran and that Dodd was operating the vehicle at the time of the accident as \u201ctheir agent, servant, and employee ... and within the course of [his] employment----\u201d Katherine Curran, Michael Curran, and Dodd were the only named defendants in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The vehicle driven by Dodd was insured by Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d) at the time the vehicle collided with the bus. Allstate retained Jessica F. Ferrill, Esq., to represent its insureds, Michael and Katherine Curran, in the lawsuit filed by the McNeills. After the Currans were served, Ms. Ferrill promptly filed an answer on behalf of both of her clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Almost exactly one year after the accident, on July 14, 2003, Allstate sent a letter to Dodd that read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">Allstate Insurance Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH_\">Claim Number: 7082922803 MCM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar9\">Date of Loss: July 17, 2002</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU2\">Our Insured: MICH[AE]L N CURRAN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARl\">Dear Mr. Dodd:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">With respect to the accident in which you were involved or for which you may be legally liable, occurring on July 17, 2002 at FRANKLIN ST, BALTIMORE, the Allstate Insurance Company hereby disclaims and denies any and all liability or obligation to you or others under its policy numbered 098193039 and issued to MICH[AE]L N CUR-RAN.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">This disclaimer is made because of your failure to qualify under Part 1 of the policy entitled \u201cInsured Person,\u201d which states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">\u201cWhile using your insured auto: a) you, b) any resident, and c) any other person using it with your permission.\u201d Because you were using the <em>named insured\u2019s vehicle without her permission, </em>there is no coverage for this loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmHf\">The Allstate Insurance Company will take no further action with respect to any claim which you may have against it or \u25a0with respect to any claim or suit against you which has arisen or which may arise out of said accident and hereby withdraws from the matter entirely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">In early January 2004, counsel for the McNeills was told by Ms. Ferrill that Dodd, at the time of the accident, \u201cwas a nonpermissive user\u201d of the automobile and thus was not covered by Allstate\u2019s policy for the claims made by the McNeills. Counsel for the McNeills, on January 27, 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>notified MAIF by fax that the McNeills intended to make a claim against it for injuries received in the July 17, 2002, accident. Counsel further advised MAIF in the fax that his clients had \u201cjust become aware of the fact\u201d that Dodd was uninsured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Not long after MAIF received notification of the McNeills\u2019 claim, Katherine and Michael Curran filed a motion for summary judgment in the circuit court action filed by the McNeills. The motion was supported by Katherine Curran\u2019s affidavit in which she swore that she was the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident in which Mrs. McNeill was injured; that she had \u201cnever met Damon Dodd\u201d; that \u201cDamon Dodd was never an agent, servant, and/or employee ... [of hers] at any time\u201d; that she \u201cnever gave Dodd a set of keys to said vehicle at any time\u201d; and that \u201cDodd did not ask, request, or obtain [her] permission to operate the vehicle at the time of the accident at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On June 7, 2004, counsel for Irish McNeill and her husband consented to the grant of the summary judgment motion and three days later the Circuit Court for Baltimore City docketed an order granting summary judgment in favor of Katherine and Michael Curran.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Counsel for the McNeills on July 8, 2004, wrote a letter to the executive director of MAIF notifying him that Irish McNeill \u201cwill be having her trial [in which Dodd was the sole remaining defendant] in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on July 20, 2004____\u201d The letter further advised that the uninsured driver, Dodd, \u201chad been in prison but was released ... on or about April 15, 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The tort case against Dodd was called for trial on July 20, 2004. Dodd was not in attendance, nor did a representative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>MAIF appear. The court proceeded to hear evidence as to damages and later that day entered a judgment in favor of Mrs. McNeill and against Dodd in the amount of $10,480.90.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">After the judgment was entered in her favor, Mrs. McNeill, by counsel, filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, naming MAIF as a defendant. She demanded that MAIF pay the $10,480.90 judgment and alleged in her petition that, in accordance with Section 20-603(a)(2)(ii) of the Insurance Article, she notified MAIF of her claim within thirty days after having received notice that Allstate had disclaimed coverage. MAIF filed an answer to the petition in which it alleged that Mrs. McNeill\u2019s petition was barred by Section 20-603 inasmuch as she failed to notify it of her claim within 180 days of the accident, and because the exceptions to the 180-day notice requirement set forth in Section 2-603(a) of the Insurance Article were all inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the court ruled that Mrs. McNeill\u2019s notice to MAIF was untimely because Allstate \u201cnever disclaimed on a policy\u201d and thus the exception set forth in Section 20-603(a)(2)(ii) was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The question to be resolved in this appeal is whether Allstate \u201cdisclaimed on a policy\u201d as that term is used in Section 20-603(a)(ii) when it wrote to Dodd and informed him that it was denying him coverage for the July 17, 2002, accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">In <em>Unsatisfied Fund v. Holland, </em>241 Md. at 295, 216 A.2d 525, the Court of Appeals was called upon to interpret a statute that, in all respects here relevant, was worded identically to Section 20-603.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code Art. 66/6, \u00a7 154(a) (Cum.Supp.1965) (repealed 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The accident that was the focus of the <em>Holland </em>opinion occurred on September 4,1960. <em>Holland, </em>241 Md. at 295, 216 A.2d 525. Boice, the motorist who was alleged to have been negligent in that accident, was insured by the Olympic Insurance Company (\u201cOlympic\u201d) up until June 4, 1960, at which time Olympic canceled Boice\u2019s policy. <em>Id. </em>Three months later, on September 4, Boice was involved in an accident with one Mary Holland. Holland did not notify the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund (\u201cUCJF\u201d) of her intention to make a claim within ninety days of the accident. She did, however, give notice to the UCJF within thirty days of her counsel\u2019s receipt of a letter from Olympic telling him that Boice\u2019s policy was not in effect as of the date of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 216 A.2d 525. The issue decided in <em>Holland </em>was whether the letter of November 25, 1960, from Boice\u2019s one-time insurer to the attorney for Holland should be construed to mean that Olympic had \u201cdisclaimed liability under a policy\u201d as that term was used in the statute. If so, then Holland\u2019s counsel gave \u201cnotice\u201d to the UCJF within thirty days, as the statute required. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 216 A.2d 525. The trial judge found in favor of Holland and ruled that Olympic had \u201cdisclaimed on a policy of insurance\u201d within the meaning of the statute when it sent the November 25, 1960, letter. The Court of Appeals reversed because \u201cto disclaim coverage\u201d presumes that a policy is in effect under which coverage is claimed, and Olympic\u2019s policy was not in effect at any time pertinent. <em>Id. </em>at 298-303, 216 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The statute at issue in <em>Holland </em>and in this case was modeled after a law enacted by the New Jersey legislature in 1952. <em>See Wheeler v. Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund, </em>259 Md. 232, 234, 269 A.2d 593 (1970). Except for differences in the identity of the party to be notified and the time allowed for notification, New Jersey\u2019s statute and Maryland\u2019s were worded identically. <em>See Holland, supra, </em>241 Md. at 298-99, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>216 A.2d 525; <em>see also </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39:6-66 to-91 (West 1961). Also, when <em>Holland </em>was decided, New York had a statute worded similarly to the Maryland and New Jersey statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 299, 216 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The <em>Holland </em>Court\u2019s resolution of the statutory construction problem presented was based almost exclusively on the reasoning in <em>Parrot v. Chiselko, 74 </em>N.J.Super. 138, 180 A.2d 710 (1962), which was written by Judge Foley of the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The <em>Parrot </em>case was factually on \u201call fours\u201d with <em>Holland. </em>The claimant in <em>Parrot </em>did not notify the New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund of his intent to make a claim against it within ninety days of the accident. He did, however, advise the Fund of such an intent within thirty days of being notified by an insurance company that the defendant\u2019s insurance policy had not become effective until two days after the subject accident and that, as a consequence, there was no coverage. <em>Holland, </em>241 Md. at 299, 216 A.2d 525. The Court in <em>Holland </em>then analyzed and quoted liberally from the <em>Parrot </em>case as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Judge Foley then called attention to N.Y. Insurance Law \u00a7 608(c) covering situations where \u201cthe insurer or insurers * * * have disclaimed liability or denied coverage * * * \u201d and <em>Application of Broderick, </em>31 Misc.2d 350, 221 N.Y.S.2d 122, 123 (1961)[,] wherein this language was construed. Judge Foley continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">\u201cIn the Broderick case plaintiff was involved in an accident on February 22, 1961. On February 27 his attorney sent a claim letter to the driver (and owner) of the car which struck him. On March 7, 1961[,] the driver replied informing plaintiff that his insurance policy was not in force at the time of the accident because of his failure to pay premiums, and a copy of the policy was enclosed which purported to cover the vehicle from December 8, 1960. On May 29, 1961[,] the insurer, in reply to plaintiffs attorney\u2019s letter of May 26, advised that the policy had been cancelled as of January 31, 1961. Within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ten days the indemnification corporation was sent a notice of intention to file claim, but the notice was rejected as untimely. The court in ruling on plaintiffs contention that his notice came within the statute said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">\u201cThis information (the insurer\u2019s letter to plaintiff of May 29) did not constitute a \u2018disclaimer or denial of coverage\u2019 within the meaning of subdivision (c) of section 608 <em>since the quoted words presuppose at least a contrary assertion that a policy is in effect under which coverage is claimed. No such assertion was here made.\u201d </em>221 N.Y.S.2d, at p. 124.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cThe court also noted that the result argued for by plaintiff would permit an injured person, after the other party admitted that he held no insurance, to contact a former insurer and thus extend the filing period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Also quoted with approval [in <em>Parrot </em>] at 714, was a statement of the New York Supreme Court in an earlier case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\"><em>\u201cTo deny coverage is to take the position that for some reason or other the policy does not encompass the particular accident. No such claim is made here. A disclaimer of liability usually arises where there is coverage, but because of some action on the part of the insured, the company refused to respond. </em>This refusal could be for lack of cooperation by the insured, fraud perpetrated by the insured on the company or serving late notice of the accident, just to mention a few. There is no disclaimer in the present case.\u201d <em>Uline v. Motor Vehicle Accident Indem. Corp., </em>28 Misc.2d 1002, 213 N.Y.S.2d 871 (1961). We might very well adopt as our own those portions of</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZh\">Judge Foley\u2019s concluding remarks which are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201cHaving in mind our duty to ascribe to the language of the statute its plain and unambiguous meaning and to give full effect to its every word, even though by so doing we deprive a claimant of its benefits, we find to be inescapable the conclusion that American\u2019s letter of April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>16, 1959[,] was not a disclaimer contemplated by N.J.S.A. 39:6 \u2014 65(b). Plainly, the statutory wording, <em>\u2018that an insurer had disclaimed on a policy of insurance so as to remove or withdraw liability </em>insurance, \u2019... <em>imports that if the \u2018disclaimer\u2019 were not made, a valid policy of insurance would subsist. One cannot withdraw or remove a thing which never existed. </em>Cf. <em>Wormack v. Howard, </em>33 N.J. 139, 162 A.2d 846 (1960). Thus the undisputed fact that American\u2019s policy did not become effective until two days after the accident inalterably deprives the letter of April 16 of any force whatever as a disclaimer within the purview of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cIn arriving at this conclusion we are conscious of the fact that she [the plaintiff] is one of a class of persons for which the act was designed to provide redress. And we are not unmindful that she refrained from filing a notice within the 90-day period because she relied on Chiselko\u2019s implied representation that he held collectible insurance, and understandably misinterpreted the written information Chiselko laid before her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cHowever, there is nothing in the act, express or implied, which charged the [UCJF] with the misrepresentation of one claiming to be insured, nor is any suggestion contained therein that noncomplianee with the notice provisions may be excused for this or any other reason. It would be entirely within the legislative authority to provide such an escape hatch if it chose to do so, and we must assume that the Legislature considered this possibility and rejected it in favor of the ringing mandate that compliance with the time provisions is a <em>condition precedent </em>to the right to an order for payment by the [UCJF].\u201d 180 A.2d at 714-15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 300-02, 216 A.2d 525 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The situations presented in <em>Holland </em>and in those New York and New Jersey cases upon which the <em>Holland </em>Court relied are distinguishable from the case <em>subjudice. </em>In <em>Holland, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>in all the cases cited in that case, the insurer, who was alleged to have \u201cdisclaimed coverage,\u201d had no policy that was in effect when the accident occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 216 A.2d 525. Here, Allstate\u2019s policy was in effect when Mrs. McNeill was injured, as demonstrated by the fact that Allstate provided a defense to the Currans in regard to the tort suit filed against them by the McNeills. Thus, if Mrs. McNeill\u2019s notice is held to come within the exception set forth in Section 2~603(a)(2)(ii), at least one of the dangers discussed in <em>Holland </em>presents no problem because here there is no danger that a claimant will attempt to surmount the time limits set forth in Section 20-603 by waiting more than six months after the accident and then contact a former insurer of the negligent driver and request that it \u201cdisclaim coverage\u201d under a policy that was not in effect when the claimant was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In our view, the most important words contained in the <em>Holland </em>decision were those it quoted with approval from <em>Parrot, </em>viz.: \u201c \u2018that an insurer has disclaimed on a policy of insurance so as to remove or withdraw liability insurance\u2019 imports that if the disclaimer were not made, a valid policy of insurance would subsist.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>241 Md. at 301, 216 A.2d 525. In the subject case, unlike the situation discussed in <em>Holland, </em>there would have been a valid policy of insurance subsisting if Allstate had not disclaimed coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We hold that to \u201cdisclaim coverage,\u201d within the meaning of Section 26 \u2014 603(a)(ii), the insurer must take the position that, although a valid policy is in effect at the time of the accident, the company is nevertheless withdrawing or withholding liability insurance coverage for the accident because, for some reason, the policy does not encompass the accident. That reason can be due to post-accident action or inaction on the part of the insured (e.g., non-cooperation with the insurer) or it can be due to a policy provision that excludes a driver from coverage due to his or her pre-accident behavior, such as driving an insured automobile involved in an accident while carrying persons or property for a fee (if such uses are excluded from liability coverage), or, as in this case, driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the insured\u2019s vehicle without the consent of the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In construing Article 20-603(a), we are mindful of the fact that the primary purpose of subtitle 6 of Article 20 was to allow qualified persons to file claims against MAIF in order \u201cto mitigate and ameliorate hardships caused by financially irresponsible and uninsured motorists where the claimants have no other source of compensation.\u201d <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund v. Hamilton, </em>256 Md. 56, 60, 259 A.2d 303 (1969). We are also mindful of our duty to construe that subtitle liberally in order to advance the aforementioned legislative intent. <em>D\u2019Ambrogi v. Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund, </em>269 Md. 198, 200, 305 A.2d 136 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In the case at hand, it would appear that even Dodd may not have known that he was not covered for the subject accident until Allstate advised him about one year post-accident of its position. But, in any event, the claimant in this case did not know and, as far as we can determine, had no way of knowing within 180 days of the accident that Dodd was uninsured. Thus, it would have been impossible for her to meet the 180-day deadline. If the trial court\u2019s denial of Ms. McNeill\u2019s claim is upheld, Mrs. McNeill, an innocent accident victim, will have no source of compensation for the injuries she received in the July 17, 2002, accident, and the benevolent purpose of the statute would be thwarted.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court erred in dismissing Mrs. McNeill\u2019s claim against MAIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. When the <em>Holland </em>case was decided, the proper entity to be sued by one trying to collect a judgment rendered against an uninsured motorist was the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board (\u201cUCJF\u201d). In 1972, MAIF was created and organized by Laws 1972, Ch. 73, and the provisions of Article 6616 dealing with the UCJF were repealed and reenacted as part of sections 243-243L of the Insurance Code. <em>See Shelton v.

The trial judge also rejected a contention made by MAIF that counsel for the McNeills first learned of Allstate\u2019s denial of coverage in July 2003.
