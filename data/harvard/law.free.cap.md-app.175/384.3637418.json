To recover for the injuries he suffered, Dixon filed a tort suit in October 2004 against the Department and M <em>&amp; </em>M Welding and Fabricators, Inc. (\u201cM &amp; M\u201d), a company doing work under contract with the Department.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The Department and M &amp; M filed motions for summary judgment. On August 29, 2005, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County dismissed the suit as to M &amp; M, with prejudice. However, the court denied appellee\u2019s motion. Then, in an order entered on June 29, 2006, the court granted the Department\u2019s motion in limine to exclude all evidence in support of appellant\u2019s claim, and also granted its renewed motion for summary judgment. The court determined that, under Maryland Code (1999, 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 10-308(c) of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cC.S.\u201d), appellant was only entitled to pursue his claim for compensation against the Sundry Claims Board (the \u201cSundry Board\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Appellant poses two questions on appeal, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">1. Is the Sundry Claims Board the exclusive remedy by which a prison inmate can seek compensation for serious personal injuries caused by the negligence of the prison staff and of a private contractor employed by the prison? [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">2. Did the Trial Court err when it granted the Defendant\u2019s Motion in Limine on the morning of trial, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>overruling two prior decisions of the same Court, both of which denied the Defendant the exact relief it sought in its Motion in Limine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">I.

FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">On August 19, 2004, appellant, through counsel, filed with the Sundry Board a form captioned \u201cClaim for Compensation,\u201d seeking to recover \u201cfor an injury resulting in [his] disability[.]\u201d Dixon indicated that, on May 4, 2004, he sustained injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d while he was on a prison work detail in the PreRelease Unit of the Maryland House of Correction. Appellant averred that he \u201cfell feet first into a ventilator shaft on the prison grounds.\u201d As a result, he \u201cshattered\u201d both ankles, broke the tibia'and fibula bones in both of his legs, and also broke several ribs. According to appellant, he was unable to work as a result of his injuries, which he characterized as \u201c[p]ermanent.\u201d At the time of the accident, appellant earned \u201c$.90\u201d per day as compensation for his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The Sundry Board acknowledged receipt of appellant\u2019s claim in a letter dated September 1, 2004. It also notified appellant that a hearing would be scheduled in regard to the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">On October 22, 2004, while appellant\u2019s claim was pending with the Sundry Board, appellant filed his \u201cComplaint\u201d in the circuit court against the Department and M &amp; M. He alleged that, at the time of his accident, M &amp; M was performing services for the Department \u201cunder contract.\u201d He asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>that M &amp; M \u201cwas conducting maintenance work on the large ventilator shafts, the openings for which were located in the area where [appellant] was working.\u201d Further, appellant alleged that his injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of individuals employed by the Department and M &amp; M, for which he sought damages of $500,000. In particular, appellant alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">15) When work had been completed at the end of the day on May 4th, 2004, [appellant] and another inmate were directed by an employee of the Department to pick up and move one of the large fans which had been used during that day to pump hot air out of the ventilation shaft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">16) [Appellant] and the other inmate lifted the fan and as [appellant] took the first step toward carrying the fan back to a truck as directed by employees of the House of Correction, he was caused to fall straight down into an open ventilation shaft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">18) Prior to being told to pick up and move the ventilation fans, neither [appellant] nor the other inmate was ever told, either by employees of the Department or by employees of M &amp; M that the ventilation shaft directly under the fan did not have the proper cover in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">19) As a result, [appellant] had no way of knowing that when he lifted the fan, he was, in effect, lifting the cover off of the ventilation shaft into which he ultimately fell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Both M &amp; M and the Department filed motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its memorandum of law, the Department argued that, because appellant \u201cwas injured while engaged in work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by DOC,\u201d and because appellant alleges \u201cpermanent injuries,\u201d his \u201cexclusive remedy against the ... Department ... is the compensation authorized by the Sundry Claims statutes and regulations.\u201d (Citation omitted.) The Department explained that appellant satisfied \u201cthe statutory criteria [under C.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u00a7 10-304] to be eligible to file a claim\u201d with the Sundry Board; therefore, under C.S. \u00a7 10-308(c), he was limited to seeking a' remedy from that Board. Appellee added that because the statute provided for an \u201cexclusive remedy for compensation,\u201d the circuit court had \u201cno jurisdiction\u201d to consider appellant\u2019s tort action against the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In his response, appellant acknowledged that he initially \u201cfiled a claim for medical reimbursement with the Board.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Dixon maintained that he \u201chas suffered and will continue to suffer pain, permanent impairment, loss of earning capacity and other non-economic damages.\u201d In his view, however, C.S. \u00a7 10-308 did not provide compensation for \u201cthe non-economic aspects of an injured inmate\u2019s claim.\u201d Although appellant conceded that C.S. \u00a7 10-308(e) provides an exclusive remedy \u201cfor claims which fall within the jurisdiction of the Board,\u201d he argued that there had \u201cbeen no determination\u201d by the Board that his claim fell within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The Board scheduled a hearing on appellant\u2019s claim for J\u00fane 17, 2005. However, neither appellant nor his lawyer appeared on that date. The circuit court\u2019s record includes a letter to the Sundry Board, dated July 15, 2005, in which appellant\u2019s counsel informed the Board that \u201c[i]t was [his] intention to dismiss this [administrative] claim prior to the hearing date.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel did not advise the Board of the pending tort suit, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">By order dated July 20, 2005, the Sundry Board \u201cdenied and dismissed\u201d appellant\u2019s claim for compensation. The order indicated that a hearing had been scheduled for June 17, 2005; that appellant and his counsel had been advised of the \u201cdate, time and location\u201d in a letter mailed on May 12, 2005; and neither appellant nor his counsel appeared for the scheduled hearing. Further, the order indicated that the Board had attempted to contact appellant\u2019s counsel, but \u201c[n]o return call was received; nor was there any other communication received from either [appellant] or his attorney.\u201d Therefore, the Board \u201cpresumed that [appellant] had abandoned his case,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>and concluded that the claim was \u201cmoot.\u201d To our knowledge, appellant did not challenge that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">On July 28, 2005, the Department filed a \u201cSupplemental Memorandum of Points and Authorities\u201d in support of its motion for summary judgment, advising of the Sundry Board\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s claim. It attached the administrative order as well as appellant\u2019s letter to the Board of July 15, 2005. In addition, the Department claimed that appellant\u2019s responses to the Department\u2019s requests for admissions \u201cshow[ed] that [appellant\u2019s] claim filed with the Sundry Claims Board satisfied the statutory jurisdictional requirements of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In particular, the Department referred the court to the Department\u2019s \u201cRequest for Admission No. 7,\u201d which appellant admitted. It stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>Request for Admission No. 7:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">On May 4, 2004 at the time [appellant] was injured, [appellant] was an inmate at a correctional facility of the Division of Correction engaged in work for which [appellant] was receiving wages of a stipulated sum of money at the rate of ninety cents ($0.90) a day paid by the Division of Correction correctional facility, that [appellant] sustained a permanent disability as a result of personal injuries arising out of and in the course of work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by the Division of Correction correctional facility, that [appellant\u2019s] injuries incapacitated [appellant] and that [appellant\u2019s] injuries were accidental.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Moreover, the Department reiterated that C.S. \u00a7 10-308(e) provided appellant\u2019s sole remedy to obtain compensation from the Department for his injuries. It posited: \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 10-308(c) was to create an exclusive monetary benefits program for such injured inmates.\u201d The Department further explained that the \u201cintended result\u201d of the statute \u201cwas to provide inmates with some limited work experience,\u201d while also \u201climiting] ... the State\u2019s financial compensatory exposure for inmates injured while so working.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>In a related contention, the Department argued that appellant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the PLA. Citing C.J. \u00a7 5 \u2014 1003(a)(1) and (b)(1), the Department asserted: \u201cA prisoner, before he or she files a civil action, must fully exhaust all administrative remedies for resolving their complaint or grievance ... and must attach to the complaint in the civil action proof that the remedies have been exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Moreover, the Department asserted: \u201cAdministrative remedies which must be exhausted under the PLA specifically include those available under the IGO procedure____\u201d The Department referred to C.S. \u00a7 10-206, asserting that \u201ca person confined to an institution of the Division of Correction who has a grievance or complaint against an official or employee of the Division or the Patuxent Institution may submit the grievance to the Inmate Grievance Office.\u201d According to the Department, \u201ca court <em>may not </em>consider an inmate\u2019s grievance that is within the jurisdiction of the IGO unless the inmate has exhausted the remedies provided in the subtitle governing the IGO.\u201d <em>See </em>C.S. \u00a7 10-210(a). (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In sum, the Department maintained that appellant \u201cfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies by voluntarily abandoning and dismissing his claim filed with the Sundry Claims Board.\u201d It also maintained that because the Complaint \u201cpurport[ed] to state a claim, by [appellant] as a prisoner, for damages allegedly resulting from the negligent acts of Division of Correction employees,\u201d appellant\u2019s claim fell \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the IGO, and, under the PLA, [appellant] was required to exhaust his remedy available in that forum, <em>including judicial review. </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original.) According to the Department, appellant\u2019s \u201cexplanation that he was not presented with or given information about a grievance procedure to pursue about his injuries does not constitute an exception to the PLA\u2019s exhaustion requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>In his opposition, appellant asserted: \u201cHe did not have to exhaust any administrative remedies prior to filing his Complaint in this Court.\u201d As to the Sundry Board, appellant disputed the Department\u2019s contention that, under C.S. \u00a7 10-308(c), filing a claim with the Board was his exclusive remedy. Although Dixon conceded that the statute had been amended to include \u201can exclusivity provision,\u201d he maintained that \u201cthe original intent of the legislation was to provide monetary benefits to those inmates who were working at a job other than their assigned task within a correctional facility!)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Moreover, citing C.S. \u00a7 10-305(a), Dixon argued that the administrative process was optional, not mandatory, because \u201cthe legislature has decreed that an injured inmate <em>may </em>file a claim for compensation against the State under this subtitle with the Board.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, argued appellant, \u201can injured inmate does not have to file a claim with the Sundry Claims Board.\u201d He insisted that, if an \u201cinjured inmate ... chooses not to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the Sundry Claims Board ... he is free to pursue other avenues of redress for his injuries.\u201d Appellant continued: \u201cIf every inmate were forced to file a claim with the Sundry Claims Board for any injury received while working in a correctional institution, an entire segment of the population would be disenfranchised from access to the Court system.\u201d To illustrate, noted Dixon, \u201can individual who is working and who is injured and who files a workers\u2019 compensation claim, still has the right to pursue, through the Courts, any third party who may have been involved in causing the injury.\u201d Thus, appellant claimed: \u201cAn inmate must have the right, even in light of the Sundry Claims Board statute, to elect to file suit in the Circuit Court for damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Further, appellant pointed out that he \u201cwas ordered by prison personnel to file a claim with the Sundry Claims Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>when he was injured.\u201d He maintained that because his \u201cclaim [with the Board] was dismissed prior to adjudication ... the exclusivity provision did not attach to him.\u201d He asked the court to \u201cdetermine his status as though his claim had never been filed,\u201d and to \u201cfind that [appellant was] free to pursue the ... case to its conclusion.\u201d Dixon stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">The exclusivity provision contained in Section 10-308(c) is tolled if, and only if, an injured inmate files a claim with the Board, thereby submitting himself to its jurisdiction and is awarded compensation. In short, if an injured inmate is paid by the Board, this case is over and he cannot go any further in pursuit of any monetary damages. However, the converse of that proposition is also true. That is, if an inmate chooses not to file a claim with the Board, which is his right, under the statute, the exclusivity provision does not apply. If no claim is filed or if the claim is dismissed before compensation is paid, the Board is divested of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Referring to C.S. \u00a7 10 \u2014 308(b), appellant also argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">It seems clear that the legislature did not expect that there would be a large number of claims filed with the Sundry Claims Board. In subsection (b) the legislature chose not to even fund the Board. In that rare occasion when an award of compensation is determined to be appropriate, then and only then, does the[ ] Governor need to include money in the next year\u2019s budget to pay the claim. Obviously, an onslaught of compensable claims was not contemplated when this statute was enacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In addition, appellant maintained that \u201cthe Department\u2019s reliance upon the PLA is misplaced,\u201d because it \u201cshould not be construed to require an inmate such as Mr. Dixon, who is injured by the negligence of employees of the Department, to follow or to exhaust any administrative remedies prior to filing his Circuit Court complaint for damages.\u201d According to appellant, because he \u201cwas not complaining about anything having to do with his conditions of confinement,\u201d as that term is defined in C.J. \u00a7 5-1001(d) of the PLA, that statute was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>In support of his contention that the IGO grievance procedure did not apply to his negligence claims, appellant posited that the IGO \u201cwas not created, nor is it in existence, to address an inmate\u2019s bodily injuries caused by the negligence of the Department of Corrections.\u201d Instead, argued appellant, the IGO was \u201cdesigned to redress internal grievances against officials or employees of the DOC.\u201d Dixon added: \u201cIt is only when an inmate is alleging deprivation of some constitution[al] or legal right that he must follow and exhaust the administrative procedures which are laid out in the PLA and in the enabling legislation for the Inmate Grievance Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The court held a motions hearing on August 29, 2005 (Harris, J.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel proffered that appellant did not have a cause of action against M &amp; M. Dixon\u2019s lawyer explained that he had determined that \u201c[t]here was absolutely no responsibility on [M &amp; M\u2019s] part to prepare the site where this accident occurred or to clear up the site where the accident occurred.\u201d Counsel for M <em>&amp; </em>M added: \u201cI just want to make sure the dismissal is with prejudice.\u201d Thereafter, the court granted the \u201cverbal dismissal motion ... with prejudice as to\u201d M &amp; M.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The court then heard argument on the Department\u2019s motion. By agreement of the parties, the court granted the Department\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to damages, limiting appellant\u2019s potential recovery to the amount set forth in the statutory cap. But, the court denied the Department\u2019s motion in all other respects. In particular, it agreed with appellant that the language in C.S. \u00a7 10-305(a) indicated that filing a claim with the Board was permissive, and thus was not appellant\u2019s exclusive remedy. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">Very simply stated, the Sundry Claims is optional, it is not mandatory. I think that is a pretty easy procedure. The one [issue] that caused me a little difficulty in the beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>was whether or not [appellant] had exhausted his administrative remedies, particularly the Inmate Grievance Office. [I]t would make no sense to me that someone other than an inmate would have to go through that procedure. And again, I stated the example of someone who is injured shortly before they have completed their sentence and they are released with a full three year statute of limitations at their option and available to them, would have to at some point ... go back and go though the Inmate Grievance Office to pursue their claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">So I don\u2019t think that is applicable in this particular case. So, they are the reasons that I am going to deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">On September 8, 2005, the Department filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration,\u201d challenging the court\u2019s ruling that filing a claim with the Board was merely an \u201coptional remedy.\u201d It reiterated that, under C.S. \u00a7 10-808, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the matter, and urged the court to grant its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Appellee submitted numerous documents pertaining to the legislative history of the \u201cexclusive remedy provision\u201d set forth in C.S. \u00a7 10-308(c), which was added by amendment in 1993.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Department argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">From the legislative history ... it is clear that the purpose of the 1993 exclusive remedy amendment was to make the Sundry Claims Board the exclusive remedy for an individual seeking compensation against the State for injuries suffered on the job while a prisoner in the Division of Correction, Patuxent Institution or the Baltimore City Detention Center. From the legislative history, there is no basis to support [appellant\u2019s] interpretation of the statutory language that [appellant] had the choice of filing a tort claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>against the State in court instead of having only the Board as a remedy against the State. Prior to the 1993 amendment, there was no law prohibiting an injured inmate from filing both a tort claim and a claim with the Board and from receiving compensation from both remedies. The purpose of the 1993 exclusive remedy legislation was to make the Board the exclusive remedy against the State and to foreclose the remedy of a tort claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Moreover, the Department took issue with the court\u2019s \u201cdecision that there was no sense in requiring exhaustion of the IGO because [appellant] was no longer an inmate.\u201d The Department pointed out that, under C.S. \u00a7 10-305(b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appellant was \u201cnot yet foreclosed from refiling a claim with the Board even though he is now no longer a Division of Correction prisoner, as he has under that statute until as late as May 3, 2006 to refil[e].\u201d But, it also noted that, \u201cwhile still an inmate for ten months after his injuries, [appellant] never filed any grievance with the IGO alleging his injuries were caused by the negligence of state correctional employees, and the time for filing such a grievance expired after 30 days from the date of the Mary [sic] 4, 2004 injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkP\">On September 22, 2005, appellant\u2019s counsel filed correspondence with the court in response to the Department\u2019s \u201cMotion for Reconsideration.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He argued that the legislation discussed by the Department did not apply to appellant because, \u201cas a technical point, there has never been an allegation in this case that [appellant] was incapacitated in the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>work within the prison itself[.]\u201d Dixon\u2019s lawyer also addressed the various documents appended to the Department\u2019s motion. With respect to the Fiscal Note, he asserted that \u201cthe aim\u201d of the legislation \u201cwas to save the State money by disallowing claims which had previously been filed under the Tort Claims Act and to shepherd all claims to the miserly Sundry Claims Board.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Dixon\u2019s counsel reiterated that C.S. \u00a7 10-305 \u201ccontains the permissive language \u2018may[.]\u2019 \u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">With all of the input that [appellee\u2019s counsel] cites, the legislature did not see fit to make the filing of a claim with the Sundry Claims Board mandatory. If it has [sic] chosen to do so, it would have been evident from the fact that the word \u201cmay\u201d would have been changed to the word \u201cshall.\u201d This did not occur and we can only surmise that it was the legislative intent to allow alternative forms of redress for prisoner injuries which were caused by the negligence of the Department. The exclusivity provision only applied to inmates who actually took their claim all the way through to compensation. Once paid, they were barred from pursuing any other remedies. We all agree, that had Mr. Dixon actually received compensation from the Sundry Claims Board, the suit that is currently pending in your Court would be barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">With respect to the IGO, appellant\u2019s counsel repeated that appellant \u201chad no complaint about his conditions of confinement.\u201d Therefore, he maintained that the procedure for filing a complaint with the IGO was not applicable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">On September 23, 2005, the court entered an order denying the Department\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Trial was scheduled for June 27, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On June 7, 2006, the Department filed a \u201cMotion in Limine of Defendant Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.\u201d Referring to the arguments more fully expounded in its previous memoranda, the Department asked the court to preclude appellant from offering any evidence in support of his claim on the grounds that: (1) filing a claim with the Board was appellant\u2019s \u201cexclusive monetary remedy\u201d and (2) appellant had \u201cfailed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him through the Inmate Grievance Office[.]\u201d Specifically, the Department asked the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">to exclude: (1) all evidence and testimony on behalf of [appellant\u2019s] claims that [appellant\u2019s] injuries were the result of [the Department\u2019s] and its employees\u2019 negligence on May 4, 2004, or in the alternative, to exclude (2) all evidence and testimony concerning or related to [appellant\u2019s] claimed permanent disability, ongoing physical limitations and ongoing pain and suffering, and to instruct the parties, counsel and witnesses during the trial of this action not to mention, refer to, question, attempt to convey or suggest to the jury in any manner that [appellant] has incurred any permanent disability, ongoing physical limitation or ongoing pain and suffering as the result of his injuries incurred on May 4, 2004.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In his response, appellant argued that the Department\u2019s requested relief was \u201cbarred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>\u201d because \u201cthe precise issue raised in the Motion in Limine has been raised previously and has been adjudicated....\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Accordingly, he asked the court to deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">On June 27, 2006, the parties convened for a hearing on the Department\u2019s motion in limine. In its oral ruling, the court (Femia, J.) looked to the exclusive remedy language in C.S. \u00a7 10-308, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">[W]hat is the compensation authorized under this Subtitle?! ] An injured inmate may file a claim for compensation. That\u2019s the only compensation authorized in this Subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>I read it as saying \u201cThe compensation authorized in [C.S.] 10-305 is the exclusive remedy against the State\u201d ... that\u2019s a very narrow finding, but that\u2019s the finding I\u2019m going to make in granting the motion in limine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In light of the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, the Department orally renewed its motion for summary judgment. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">I ... will grant [appellee\u2019s] motion for summary [judgment] ... on the grounds that by my [ruling on the] motion in limine I have denied [appellant] the ability to proceed with evidence in this case. He therefore has nothing to proceed with as a matter of law. I rule in favor of ... the State of Maryland.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">III. DISCUSSION<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Appellant contends that \u201cfiling a claim with the Sundry Claims Board was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of a civil suit\u201d in circuit court. According to Dixon, the circuit court\u2019s initial ruling, to the effect that filing a claim with the Board is \u201cpermissive\u201d and not mandatory, \u201cwas correct in all respects.\u201d As a result, argues Dixon, he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing his action in circuit court. Dixon also asserts that, upon investigation, his attorney claims to have \u201clearned that the Sundry Claims Board would not provide monetary compensation to [appellant] for the horrific injuries which he had received in May, 2004.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For that reason, he initiated the tort action in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Moreover, appellant insists that C.S. \u00a7 10-308(c) is inapplicable, because \u201c[t]he requirements contained in the Sundry Claims Board legislation\u201d were not met. He explains that the Board pays benefits \u201cto an inmate who \u2018sustained a permanent partial disability or permanent total disability ... [t]hat incapacitated the individual or materially reduced the individual[\u2019]s earning power in that type of work,\u2019 \u201d but in this case \u201c[t]here is no allegation that Mr. Dixon was incapacitated or that his earning power in the type of work that he was doing when he was injured was materially reduced.\u201d (Citation omitted.) To the contrary, argues appellant, \u201chis allegations are that the negligence of the individuals involved left him with serious personal injuries which may or may not, at the time the suit was filed, have been determined to be permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Looking to \u201cthe clear and unambiguous exclusive remedy language in the statute,\u201d the Department rejects Dixon\u2019s contention that filing a claim with the Board was merely optional. Indeed, it posits that there is no merit to Dixon\u2019s position that \u201cCS \u00a7 10-305(a)(l) permits him to choose to pursue a tort action instead of a claim with the Board.\u201d Thus, appellee insists that the circuit court correctly determined that \u201ccompensation under the Board\u2019s statute was Dixon\u2019s exclusive remedy against the State.\u201d It reasons: \u201cBecause a claim to the Board for the compensation authorized by the Board\u2019s statutes was Dixon\u2019s \u2018exclusive remedy against the State for a claim that falls within the jurisdiction of the Board\u2019 and because Dixon voluntarily abandoned the claim that he had initially filed with the Board, and instead pursued a tort action against the Department, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to the Department.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In addition, the Department refutes Dixon\u2019s \u201cunsupported statement\u201d that \u201cthe tort action was filed after Dixon\u2019s attorney learned that the Board would not provide monetary compensation to Dixon for his injuries.\u201d It points out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>appellant filed his tort action in October 2004, and the Board did not deny and dismiss Dixon\u2019s claim until July 20, 2005. Citing COMAR 12.05.01.06, appellee continues: \u201cAt the July 27, 2006 circuit court hearing, Dixon\u2019s attorney acknowledged the existence of the Board\u2019s schedule of compensation benefits in the Board\u2019s regulations.\u201d Moreover, the Department asserts: \u201cStatutory provisions for State funding and payment of compensation approved by the Board is set forth in CS \u00a7 10-308(b).\u201d Thus, argues the Department, \u201cthe claim that Dixon filed with the Board in August, 2004 was compensable by the Board, making the claim Dixon\u2019s exclusive remedy against the Department.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We agree with the circuit court that the administrative remedy set forth in C.S. \u00a7 10-308(c) constituted appellant\u2019s <em>exclusive </em>remedy. In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by the principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">It is well settled that the interpretation of a statute is a judicial function. <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v.

It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">(c) <em>Exclusive remedy. </em>\u2014 The compensation authorized under this subtitle <em>is the exclusive remedy against the State for a claim that falls within the jurisdiction of the Board.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABv\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Appellant insists here, as he did below, that filing a claim with the Board \u201cwas permissive and not mandatory.\u201d He relies on the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in C.S. \u00a7 10-305(a)(l), which provides: \u201cAn injured inmate <em>may </em>file a claim for compensation against the State under this subtitle with the Board.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s position, the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d does not suggest that appellant had the option of choosing between various channels of relief. As we see it, the language in issue is meant to recognize that an inmate has a choice, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the first instance, as to whether to file a claim; the claim itself is not mandatory or compulsory.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In deciding the plain meaning of a statutory term or phrase, such as the word \u201cmay,\u201d we are permitted to consult the dictionary. <em>Rouse-Fairwood Limited P\u2019ship v.

Comptroller of Treasury, </em>97 Md.App. 305, 316, 629 A.2d 1283, <em>cert. denied, </em>333 Md. 201, 634 A.2d 62 (1993). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1000 (8th ed.2004) defines \u201cmay\u201d as follows: \u201c1. To be permitted to ... 2. To be a possibility[.]\u201d Alternatively, the term is defined: \u201cLoosely, is required to; shall; must[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the editors note: \u201cIn dozens of cases, courts have held <em>may </em>to be synonymous with <em>shall </em>or <em>must, </em>usu. in an effort to effectuate legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Our view of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the context of this statute is strengthened by C.S. \u00a7 10-309(a)(l), which provides: \u201cA claimant aggrieved by a final determination of the Board <em>may </em>file a petition for judicial review in the circuit court ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) As noted, we are to construe statutes as a whole. C.S. \u00a7 10-309 obviously uses the word \u201cmay\u201d to indicate that a losing party is entitled to pursue further review, but such review clearly is not compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Thus, we agree with the Department that the statutory language is unambiguous. When read together, C.S. \u00a7 10-305(a) and C.S. \u00a7 10-308(c) indicate that an inmate who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sustains a personal injury arising out of or in the course of working in a correctional institution, who otherwise meets the statutory criteria, has the right, if he or she chooses to exercise it, to pursue a claim for compensation against the State. But, if he or she chooses to pursue such a claim, the Board is the exclusive avenue to obtain compensation; the statute precludes an inmate from filing a tort action against the State to recover compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Because the text of the statute is unambiguous, we need not look beyond the plain language of the statute to discern the intent of the Legislature. <em>See Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 182, 887 A.2d 1078 (2005) (\u201c \u2018Where the statutory language is free from ... ambiguity, courts will neither look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent nor add to or delete words from the statute.\u2019 \u201d) (Citations omitted.) But, even if we were to determine, <em>arguendo, </em>that the statute is ambiguous, a review of the legislative history of the 1993 amendment, which added the exclusivity provision, would support our position that the Board was appellant\u2019s sole avenue for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In 1993, the exclusive remedy provision now found in C.S. \u00a7 10-308(c) was added to Art. 41, \u00a7 4-701, the former codification of the Sundry Board statute. <em>See </em>Chapter 133 of the Acts of 1993, effective October 1, 1993. Until then, a DOC inmate seeking to recover for personal injuries arising out of and in the course of work performed while incarcerated could file a claim against the State under the Maryland Tort Claims Act <em>or </em>by way of the Board. Put another way, prior to the 1993 amendment, the statute did not provide that compensation available through the Board was an inmate\u2019s exclusive remedy against the State. As the Department points out, \u201cthe 1993 legislation was enacted to make the compensation under the Board\u2019s statute the exclusive remedy against the State for compensating an inmate ... for personal injuries incurred while working in a correctional institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Under the heading \u201cSummary of Bill,\u201d the \u201cBill Analysis\u201d in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee for House Bill (\u201cH.B.\u201d) 163, the enacting legislation, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>This bill provides that a claim against the Sundry Claims Board is the exclusive remedy against the State for a prisoner who is injured while working in a correctional institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">This bill repeals the requirement that a prisoner must have been injured while engaged in extra-hazardous work in order to receive benefits approved by the Sundry Claims Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">The bill clarifies that any personal injury for which benefits may be approved by the Sundry Claims Board must arise out of and in the course of work for which wages or a stipulated sum are payable by one or more of the institutions under the supervision of the Division of Correction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The \u201cFiscal Note\u201d to H.B. 163 explained, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">Currently, inmates can seek to [sic] relief for these injuries from either the Board or under the Maryland Tort Claims Act. Awards granted under the Act are paid by the State Treasurer from the State\u2019s Self Insurance Trust Fund. The limit on awards under the Code of Maryland Regulations applicable to the Board is significantly less than that permitted under the Maryland Tort Claims Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The question, then, is whether appellant met the criteria of C.S. \u00a7 10-304, which governs the Board\u2019s \u201cAdministration of benefits.\u201d As noted, it provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The Board shall administer benefits as provided under this subtitle to an individual who, while an inmate in ... a correctional facility in the Division of Correction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">(1) was engaged in work <em>for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by a correctional facility; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">(2) <em>sustained a permanent partial disability or permanent total disability:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">(i) as a result of a <em>personal injury arising out of an in the course of work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by a correctional facility; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>(ii) that <em>incapacitated the individual or materially reduced the individual's earning power in that type of work.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANq\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We are readily satisfied that appellant\u2019s injury fell within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">1) Dixon was engaged in work while he was a DOC inmate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">2) he sustained an injury that arose out of and in the course of his work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">3) he was paid a wage by the DOC for his work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">4) he sustained a permanent disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">5) the injury would have incapacitated or materially reduced Dixon\u2019s earning power in that type of work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">In reaching our conclusion, we look to appellant\u2019s signed \u201cClaim for Compensation,\u201d dated August 13, 2004, which was an exhibit below. There, appellant alleged that he was injured on May 4, 2004, due to an accident \u201carising out of and in the course of [his] employment\u201d at DOC. Notably, the claim form tracked the language of \u00a7 10-304(2), providing separate sections for a claimant to complete <em>\u201cIF TOTALLY DISABLED BY THE ACCIDENT\u201d </em>or <em>\u201cIF PARTIALLY DISABLED BY THE ACCIDENT.\u201d </em>Appellant completed the former section, indicating that his injuries were \u201c[p]ermanent.\u201d In response to the question, \u201c[B]y how much have your weekly earnings been reduced by this injury,\u201d appellant responded: \u201cI cannot work.\u201d In addition, the claim form indicated that appellant had been engaged in work while an inmate at the House of Corrections, for which he received a wage of \u201c$.90\u201d per day. These averments satisfied the statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Moreover, the Department submitted a copy of its request for admission to appellant; his admission to appellee\u2019s Question No. 7 demonstrated that Dixon satisfied the Board\u2019s criteria. As noted, Dixon admitted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">On May 4, 2004 at the time [appellant] was injured, [appellant] was an inmate at a correctional facility of the Division of Correction engaged in work for which [appellant] was receiving wages or a stipulated sum of money at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>rate of ninety cents ($0.90) a day by the Division of Correction correctional facility, that [appellant] sustained a permanent disability as a result of personal injuries arising out of and in the course of work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by the Division of Correction correctional facility, that [appellant\u2019s] injuries incapacitated [appellant], and that [appellant\u2019s] injuries were accidental.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">It follows that because appellant did not pursue his claim with the Board, he did not exhaust his administrative remedies. It is a longstanding principle of administrative law that one must ordinarily exhaust statutorily prescribed administrative remedies before resorting to the courts. <em>See Moose v. Fraternal Order of Police, </em>369 Md. 476, 486, 800 A.2d 790 (2002); <em>Montgomery County v. Broadcast Equities, Inc., </em>360 Md. 438, 452, 758 A.2d 995 (2000); <em>Finucan v. Md.

Under common law exhaustion principles and the statutory mandate, appellant was required to pursue his claim with the Board.

The Department suggests that, even if C.S. \u00a7 10-308 does not apply, appellant was required to comply with the PLA and the IGO. Appellant disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In <em>Massey v. Galley, </em>392 Md. 634, 643, 898 A.2d 951 (2006), the Court of Appeals summarized the legislative history of the PLA, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">The Prisoner Litigation Act was enacted by Ch. 495 of the Acts of 1997. According to the first words of the Title to Ch. 495, the purpose of the Act was to impose certain requirements upon \u201ca prisoner who files a civil action relating to the <em>conditions of confinement. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added). The Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s file on House Bill 926 of the 1997 legislative session, which became Ch. 95, indicates that the bill as originally introduced was patterned after federal legislation concerning prisoner actions in the federal courts ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>As noted, C.J. \u00a7 5-1001(d) defines \u201cConditions of confinement\u201d as \u201cany circumstance, situation or event that involves a prisoner\u2019s custody, transportation, incarceration, or supervision.\u201d <em>See Evans v.

In his Complaint, appellant sued \"M &amp; M Welding &amp; Fabrication, Inc.\u201d At a motions hearing, counsel for M &amp; M indicated that the name is \"M &amp; M Welding and Fabricators, Inc.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">. Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s question, which seems to refer to a claim against M &amp; M, appellant\u2019s brief does not address any claim against the contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b412-22\">. We need not quote C.S. \u00a7 10-307, which pertains to the investigation and disposition of claims filed with the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">. M &amp; M\u2019s motion is not germane to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">. Further, the Department contended that, even if appellant prevailed in circuit court, he \"would be entitled to a judgment against the Department not exceeding $200,000, due to the current statutory cap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>... on damages in tort cases such as this.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Accordingly, the Department asserted that it was entitled to partial summary judgment \"by limiting any judgment\u201d against the Department \u201cto an amount not exceeding $200,000.00.\u201d The amount of potential recovery is not an issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">. By that time, appellant had been released from prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">. The documents included a \"Fiscal Note\"; a \"Fiscal Note Revised\u201d; a \"Position on Proposed Legislation\u201d; a letter of March 23, 1993, from then State Treasurer Lucille Maurer to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee; a letter of January 26, 1993, from the Board to the House Judiciary Committee; a \"Bill Analysis\u201d for House Bill 163; a \"Floor Report\u201d; the vote records of the House of Delegates and the Senate; and the \"1993 Legislative History For HB 0163.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b425-6\">. As noted, under C.S. \u00a7 10-305(b), an inmate had until the later of \"12 months after being released from the correctional facility,\u201d or \"24 months after the date of injury\u201d to file a claim with the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">. Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 12.07.01.06A provides that a grievance with the IGO \u201cshall be filed within 30 days from the date of the occurrence being grieved, or within 30 days after the grievant knew or should have known of the occurrence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">. In the meantime, on September 13, 2005, the Department filed an \"Answer to Complaint.\u201d It asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider appellant\u2019s complaint and that appellant had failed to state a claim entitling him to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">. Appellant also suggested that several documents from the bill file came \u201cdirectly\u201d from the Department, and were therefore \"self serving.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\">. Appellant's counsel did not refer to the PLA in his letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">. The court entered a \u201cCivil Hearing Sheet\u201d (signed as an order of the court) on June 29, 2006, granting the Department's motion in limine and its renewed motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">. On appeal, the parties generally advance the same arguments presented below. Therefore, we need not restate all of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b428-11\">. Appellant does not cite to a statute or regulation for the proposition that the Board does not provide monetary compensation. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the Department points out that, under the heading \"Compensation,\u201d COMAR 12.05.01.06 sets forth certain guidelines for awards of benefits by the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">. According to the Department, the court \"narrowly based its January 27, 2006 decision granting the Department\u2019s motion in limine and granting the Department summary judgment on the exclusive remedy provision in the Board\u2019s statue [sic], without ruling on the issue of whether Dixon also failed to exhaust the administrative remedies of the Inmate Grievance Office as is required by CS \u00a7 10-210(a) and the Prisoner Litigation Act[.]\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\">, The Revisor\u2019s Note for the statutory provision states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">In subsection (a)(1) of this section, the reference that an inmate \u201cmay\u201d file a claim is substituted for the former reference that the inmate \"shall have the right to\" file a claim for consistency with regard to discretionary language throughout this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">Laws of Maryland 1999, Chapter 54, Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 10-305.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">. Dixon asserts in his brief that \"[t]here [was] no allegation that Mr. Dixon was incapacitated or that his earning power in the type of work that he was doing when he was injured was materially reduced.\u201d The record reflects otherwise, as we have shown. Under the principle of judicial estoppel, appellant might perhaps be foreclosed from disputing the factual assertions he made at the outset of this matter. <em>See, e.g., Eagan v. Calhoun, </em>347 Md. 72, 87-88, 698 A.2d 1097 (1997)(\u201cMaryland has long recognized the doctrine of estoppel by admission, derived from the rule laid down by the English Court of Exchequer in <em>Cave v. Mills, </em>7 H. &amp; W. 927 that '[a] man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold, to claim at one time and deny at another.\u2019 \") <em>See Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 171, 913 A.2d 10 (2006)(\"Before judicial estoppel may be applied, three circumstances must exist: (1) one of the parties takes a factual position that is inconsistent with a position it took in previous litigation, (2) the previous inconsistent position was accepted by a court, and (3) the party who is maintaining the inconsistent positions must have intentionally misled the court in order to gain an unfair advantage.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\">. We have concluded that the court correctly ruled that appellant\u2019s sole means of obtaining compensation was by way of a claim filed with the Board. But, the court did not specifically rule that appellant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. As we see it, the two are interrelated; if the Board was the sole avenue of relief, then appellant had to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\"Appellate courts ordinarily review the grant of summary judgment 'only on the grounds relied upon by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rickman v.
