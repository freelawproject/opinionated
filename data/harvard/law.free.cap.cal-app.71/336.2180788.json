On the day following, Saturday, March 31, 1923, the amended pleading, not then having been filed, the clerk of said court, at plaintiff\u2019s request, entered judgment by default against said defendants. On April 11, 1923, defendants served notice of motion to set aside said default judgment, and pursuant to an order shortening time, said motion was heard on April 13, 1923, and, on May 8, 1923, was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">It appears from the affidavit presented in support of defendants\u2019 motion to vacate said default judgment that said amended pleading was mailed in San Francisco on March 30, 1923, by defendants\u2019 attorney to the county clerk of Contra Costa County, at Martinez, and it is averred in said affidavit that the distance from San Francisco to Martinez is thirty-five miles and that between the places there is a regular communication by mail. The exact time said amended pleading arrived in Martinez is not shown, but it positively appears that, notwithstanding the entry of said default judgment on Saturday, March 31, 1923, said amended pleading was filed by the county clerk on Monday, April 2, 1923, and that the same thereafter continued to remain a part of the files in the action. Such fact is established by the duly authenticated amendment to the record brought up on a motion for diminution thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention on this appeal is that the order appealed from was based upon a defective affidavit of merits in that said affidavit was made by the attorney for defendants, and not by the defendants themselves; that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>reason was given therein why said affidavit was not made by one of the parties; that it contained no averment that said attorney was familiar with the facts, and that the statement made therein that \u201cthe defendants have a good and sufficient defense on the merits to said action\u201d was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We think that appellant\u2019s contention cannot be sustained, for the reason that it clearly appears from the record that on Monday, April 2, 1923, within two days after the default judgment had been entered, said amended pleading, duly verified by one of the defendants, and setting forth the defense to the cause of action alleged in the complaint, \"was filed in the office of the county clerk, and constituted a part of the record and files in the case when the motion to vacate the default was served and presented. Therefore, no affidavit of merits was necessary. <em>(Savage </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>170 Cal. 472 [150 Pac. 353]; <em>Melde </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>129 Cal. 308 [61 Pac. 932]; <em>Fulweiler </em>v. <em>Mining Co., </em>83 Cal. 126 [23 Pac. 65]; <em>San Diego Realty Co. </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>7 Cal. App. 264 [94 Pac. 374].)  The fact, if it be a fact, that a copy of said amended answer was not served upon appellant nor produced in court on April 11, 1923, at the time of the hearing of said motion, does not alter the situation. Respondents\u2019 notice of motion stated that said motion would be made on said notice \u201cand on the entire record- in the action, the minutes of the clerk, the files, and records and pleadings.\u201d As above pointed out, on April 2, 1923, said amended answer became and thereafter continued to be a part of the records and files in the action, with which appellant was charged with notice, and was available as an affidavit showing a meritorious defense. <em>(Reher </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>166 Cal. 525 [Ann. Cas. 1915C, 737, 137 Pac. 263]; <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Smith, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Appellant\u2019s second point is that the facts averred in said affidavit were not such as to show excusable neglect on the part of defendants. In <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>it was said: \u201cAs we have recently had occasion to say: \u2018The law governing this class of cases is so well settled and has been so often declared in the decision of this court that we may dispense with the citation of authorities. An application to be relieved from a default under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure is addressed to the sound dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>cretion of the trial court and the action of that court will not be set aside on appeal unless an abuse of discretion clearly appears. Any doubt that may exist should be resolved in favor of the application to the end of securing a trial upon the merits.\u2019 <em>(Jurgins </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>162 Cal. 747 [124 Pac. 426].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We are satisfied that the facts averred in the affidavit fully justified the court in vacating the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The order appealed from is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Tyler, P. J., and St. Sure, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
