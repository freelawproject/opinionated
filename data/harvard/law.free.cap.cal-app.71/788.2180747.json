He appeals from the judgment and from the order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Briefly, the evidence shows that as a messenger from a station of the Pacific Electric Railway Company located at the city of Sherman approached a bank with approximately four thousand dollars in cash in his possession, for the purpose of depositing the money in the bank, he was halted by two men named Hanna and Goslyn, respectively, who ordered the messenger to place the money in an automobile in which the two men had been riding\u2014at the same time telling the messenger that he was \u201ccovered\u201d with a pistol by a third man who was standing across the street from the place where the messenger was being robbed. The messenger complied with the order, and the \"two men, Hanna and Goslyn, escaped, but were shortly thereafter arrested and subsequently convicted of the crime of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">On behalf of the People, Goslyn testified to the details of the robbery as committed by him and Hanna with defendant Tates as the \u201clookout.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>A witness by the name of Moore testified, without objection thereto, that about fifteen days before the robbery occurred defendant had tried to induce Moore to assist defendant and a third man (who was not present at the conversation and with whom Moore was unacquainted) in the commission of the crime but that, while Moore told Yates in effect that he would assist in the contemplated \u201choldup,\u201d he was \u201cjust kidding, playing with him, and . . . didn\u2019t think he was going to do it, and (Moore) . . . didn\u2019t mean anything like that\u201d; that later defendant brought to see the witness the man to whom defendant had referred in their conversation regarding the proposed robbery, which man inquired particularly of Moore regarding the defendant and his occupation\u2014that is, whether or not defendant was a policeman; that on the evening of the day after the robbery had taken place he and defendant had a conversation including the following: \u201cHe (defendant) said, \u2018They made the holdup down in Sherman\u201d I said, \u2018Yes, who was it?\u2019 He said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, but I believe it was this fellow that came over here with me.\u2019 I said; \u2018Yes, how do you think so?\u2019 He said, \u2018Because I told those fellows how to do it, and since the day we came over here I haven\u2019t seen that fellow, so I thought that this thing was over.\u2019 He said, \u2018I didn\u2019t think that this fellow was going to do it, so I thought I would call it off.\u2019 He said, \u2018I did not see this fellow any more and I didn\u2019t hear anything about this thing, and this fellow, he got somebody else, I guess,\u2019 he told me, \u2018and went and done it himself, and he didn\u2019t want to get me with him because maybe he had another best friend than I was,\u2019 and he says, \u2018and wanted to give him the part instead of me.\u2019 I asked him, \u2018Are you sure you wasn\u2019t with him?\u2019 and he said, \u2018No.\u2019 Then I had to go, and I told him, \u2018I will be right back.\u2019 He said, \u2018I will be right back, too.\u2019 So I told him, \u2018All right.\u2019 He went out and come back in about a half an hour and he brought a newspaper, and then he told me, \u2018Come here, Tom.\u2019 So I stopped and I asked him what, and he says\u2014he looked around and he says, \u2018I don\u2019t like to talk to you right here.\u2019 I asked him why, and he said, \u2018Oh, I feel nervous. Let\u2019s go around, the back there.\u2019 I told him, \u2018All right. \u2019 We went in the corner where the cars were parked. I told him, \u2018But we can\u2019t see the paper here. What is it?\u2019 So I light the dash-light off of a car and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>read the paper for me where it says about the holdup, and then it says on the paper about a fellow with a, wearing a mustache, black suit on and black hat on, and then the way the paper said I told him, \u2018That is you, Yates,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yes, that is me; it can\u2019t be anybody else.\u2019 Then I looked at him and I says, \u2018No, it ain\u2019t\u2019 And he says, \u2018Why? What makes you think so?\u2019 I told him, \u2018Because the paper says the fellow with a black mustache and you haven\u2019t got it.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, but I shaved it off.\u2019 Oh, I laughed, and then he started to get nervous and shaking there, and I told him, \u2018What was the matter?\u2019 And he says, \u2018Nothing, Tom; I just feel this way because if this fellow pulled off this thing, the one I talked to, he might want to get me into it too.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why, you didn\u2019t make the holdup with him?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, but I planned it to him, told him how to make it,\u2019 he says. So I told him, \u2018That don\u2019t make any difference, I guess,\u2019 but he said, \u2018Yes, it does, \u2019 and I told him, \u2018Yes, and what do you want to do now?\u2019 Then he thinked it over and he told me, \u2018I guess the best thing I could do was to get out of town, to be safe.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Yes, you can do that, too, if you don\u2019t feel safe enough here.\u2019 Then he told me, then he thinked it over again, and he said he had a friend in Sherman, and I told him this way, I told him, \u2018No, if I would be you I wouldn\u2019t go away if I wasn\u2019t with him when they done the holdup, if it is that way you say you haven\u2019t seen him for fifteen days, I wouldn\u2019t go away. \u2019 He said, \u2018Oh, yes, Tom. I got scared. I know I planned this thing and they will get me in it.\u2019 ... So I told him\u2014then he ask^d me\u2014then he told me he would like to get out' of town anyway. So I told him, \u2018Where do you want to go to?\u2019 He said, \u2018I would like to go to Riverside,\u2019 and I told him, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you catch the stage?\u2019 He said, \u2018No time for the stage now. \u2019 \u2018 The stage runs until 7:20 or 8:30, \u2019 he told me, \u2018and the last stage has done passed,\u2019 and he got no time to catch it, \u2018and then I haven\u2019t got no money.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I told him, \u2018If you want a dollar, I can lend you a dollar. \u2019 \u201d That thereafter on that evening the witness lent defendant one dollar; procured an automobile and induced one Tona to take defendant to the city of Riverside, where defendant had said that a brother of his was living.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Tona testified that on that night he took defendant to Riverside, where they arrived at about 2 o\u2019clock A. M. the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>next day, and that defendant there produced one dollar with which they bought five gallons of gasoline for use in the automobile in which they had ridden from Los Angeles to Riverside.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">A witness named Moreno testified that he accompanied defendant and Tona on the trip to Riverside, and that on one or two occasions on the way there, when it became necessary to make some repairs on the automobile, \u201che (defendant) got out a couple\u2014when we were going out, he got out in a couple of places and hide (hid) over in the trees while we were fixing the machine.\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">There was also testimony to the effect that on the day when the robbery took place defendant lived in and was familiar with the city of Sherman and with the practice and method adopted by the Pacific Electric Railway Company and its messenger in depositing funds in the manner which was employed or attempted to be employed on the occasion in question, and that defendant had means of knowledge of the amount of cash likely to be in the possession of such messenger at such times.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Defendant testified that on the day following the robbery he left the city of Sherman and rode on a public bus to the city of Riverside; that on the next day he rode in an automobile with his nephew to Yuma, Arizona, where he boarded a train for El Paso, Texas, which was the place of his residence and where he arrived on the fourth day following the robbery, and at which last-named place he remained until he was extradited and brought back to Los Angeles some two or three months after the robbery occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Appellant\u2019s first specification of error is that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a new trial to defendant on the ground of lack of sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict against him. It is urged that Goslyn was an admitted accomplice and that under the provisions of section 1111 of the Penal Code, before defendant could be convicted of the crime with which he was charged, it was necessary that Goslyn\u2019s testimony be corroborated by other evidence which tended to connect defendant with the commission of the offense. In connection therewith, appellant contends that Moore, Tona, and Moreno were likewise accomplices, and hence disqualified from furnishing the necessary corroboration of Goslyn's testimony. The record discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>no evidence from which it may he deduced that any one of the corroborating witnesses was an accomplice within the meaning of the statute.  The most that may be inferred is that defendant suggested to the witness Moore the feasibility of committing the crime and intimated that he would like to have him join with defendant and a third man in its perpetration; hut the evidence further shows that, while Moore listened to defendant\u2019s proposal and told him that he would assist in the commission of the robbery, Moore was \u201cjust kidding, playing with him, . . . and didn\u2019t mean anything like that.\u201d At any rate, whatever may have been Moore\u2019s real intentions, whether he was willing or unwilling to become a partner in the criminal enterprise, is of little consequence in view of the lack of evidence that as a matter of fact he ever actually did anything in furtherance thereof. He may have suspected that defendant was considering the advisability of committing the crime and that he would like to have Moore join with him in its commission; but if Moore neither actually participated in its commission nor conspired to commit it, he cannot be said to have been an accomplice.  Regarding the' testimony given by the witnesses Tona and Moreno, the evidence shows that the only knowledge possessed by either of them was that, for some reason of which each of them was ignorant, defendant wished to leave Los Angeles and go to the city of Riverside. So far as the record shows, at the time to which their testimony relates neither of them had any knowledge whatsoever regarding defendant\u2019s connection with the robbery, or even that a robbery had been committed. It necessarily follows that appellant\u2019s contention in that connection cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Appellant also complains that, while the judge of the trial court correctly instructed the jury generally as to the law affecting the admissibility of, and the weight to be accorded to, the evidence given by accomplices, no instruction was given in the language of the statute by which an accomplice is defined as \u201cone who is liable to prosecution for the identical offense charged against the defendant on trial in the cause in which the testimony of the accomplice is given.\u201d (Sec. 1111, Pen. Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In the first place, it appears that no such instruction was requested by defendant. He must have known that corroboration of the testimony given by Goslyn was essential to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>successful prosecution of the case against him. Hence, if he thought it proper or advisable for the protection of defendant\u2019s rights in the premises that an instruction couched in the language of the statute should be given to the jury, it was his duty to offer such instruction to the court for the consideration of the jury. Goslyn was an admitted accomplice. On the trial it was not even suggested that either of the other witnesses was an accomplice. In the circumstances of the case there was no compelling reason for such an instruction to be given. However, the court did instruct the jury that the defendant could not be convicted on the testimony of an accomplice, unless such testimony was corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense. Judged by the evidence, there was no accomplice other than Goslyn, and the jury was properly instructed with reference to the weight which should be attached to his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant in admitting a certain newspaper in evidence over defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The newspaper in question was a copy of the one referred to in the testimony of Moore to which reference has been had. The only part thereof to which the attention of the jury was directed was that it was a \u201cSports Pink\u201d; that it contained a large-type heading, \u201cShoot P. E. Bandits,\u201d and a paragraph as follows: \u201cIn a statement to police Hanna, who was wounded in his right arm, said a third bandit had participated in the holdup, and described him simply as wearing a black mustache.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">At the time the newspaper was admitted in evidence the judge instructed the jury, \u201cthat newspaper is being admitted in evidence simply for the purpose of connecting up the testimony of this witness as to the conversation had with the defendant which he has related, but as to any statements contained in that article they are not to be considered as statements of fact in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">The jury was thus plainly told that the newspaper was limited in its effect as evidence to \u00a3 1 connecting- up \u2019 \u2019 the testimony of the witness Moore with a conversation which such witness testified he had had with defendant. While, for obvious reasons, the value of such testimony was slight, it is possible that it did have a tendency to corroborate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>testimony given by the witness regarding his conversation with defendant. With the limitation placed by the trial judge upon the purpose and effect of the evidence, we are unable to perceive that defendant was prejudicially affected by its reception in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">\"Appellant\u2019s next specification of error is that the court erroneously refused to permit defendant to cross-examine the witness Goslyn, who testified in behalf of the prosecution. An examination of the transcript to which appellant refers discloses the fact that the witness was being asked regarding a \u201cgun\u201d which defendant was supposed to have had on his person at the time the robbery occurred, and that the witness had stated that he did not know whether defendant had a \u201cgun\u201d or not. Defendant then asked the witness: \u201cQ. What kind of gun?\u201d to which question an objection interposed by the district attorney thereto was sustained by the court. Taking into consideration the fact that immediately before the quoted question was asked the witness had disclaimed any knowledge regarding any \u201cgun\u201d which defendant .was supposed to have had, it is difficult to understand how it would have been possible for the witness to answer the question submitted to him. While preceding the question heretofore set forth the witness had testified in substance that at the time the robbery took place he knew that \u201cthe defendant\u201d had a \u201cgun\u201d in his pocket, it is clear from subsequent testimony given by the witness that his testimony with reference to a \u201cgun\u201d did not relate to defendant Yates, but did refer to defendant Hanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Another specification of error in the ruling of the trial court relates to the sustaining of an objection to a question asked on cross-examination, the basis of the ruling being that the question had heretofore been asked and answered. The record shows that the trial judge was correct in his conclusion in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">It is finally further contended by appellant that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a new trial to defendant for the reason that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, because of the fact, as claimed by appellant, that the only evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt' was that contained in the testimony of the witnesses Moore, Tona, and Moreno regarding defendant\u2019s flight, and that such circumstance is not evidence of guilt, but merely tends to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>guilt. But even though solely for the sake of the argument it be admitted that appellant is correct in his statement of the legal principle, and that it is not subject to any limitation or exception (which in fact we are not prepared to do), in view of defendant's manner and his many admissions, including his statement that he had planned the crime; also, the additional facts testified to by other witnesses; that defendant was in the vicinity of the scene of the crime at the time it was committed; that he was without funds; and that he left his place of abode so precipitately and under such suspicious circumstances immediately after the robbery occurred, without any apparently satisfactory reason being shown to the jury therefor\u2014we are constrained to hold that appellant\u2019s point that the verdict is not sufficiently supported by the evidence is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">It follows that the judgment and the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial should be affirmed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Curtis, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on April 23, 1925.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
