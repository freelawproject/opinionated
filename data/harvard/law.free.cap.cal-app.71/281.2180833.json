An appeal was taken from the judgment of conviction and the order denying a motion for a new trial, in which all errors alleged to have been committed prior thereto were reviewed, and on February 2, 1920, said judgment and order were duly affirmed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Northcott, </em>45 Cal. App. 706 [189 Pac. 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The petitioner now alleges in this application that the trial court, in receiving the verdict, failed to follow the procedure prescribed by section 1164 of the Penal Code, and that, therefore, the judgment is void. Assuming such allegation to be true, and that the requirements of said section were not complied with, such omission did not divest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the court of jurisdiction. It amounted to nothing more than \u00e1n error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction, which error should have been presented for review upon the appeal from the judgment. <em> </em>A writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>may not be invoked to inquire into mere errors committed in the exercise of jurisdiction. <em>(Ex parte Philbrook, </em>47 Cal. App. 678 [191 Pac. 77].)  Furthermore, a judgment of conviction, after affirmance on appeal, cannot be collaterally attacked on <em>habeas corpus, </em>for grounds which were review able on that appeal even though they were not mentioned in the decision thereof. <em>(Matter of Application of Smith, 161 </em>Cal. 208 [118 Pac. 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Secondly, the petition alleges that said judgment of conviction is void because the magistrate before whom the preliminary examination was conducted held the petitioner for trial without reasonable or \"probable cause. The point is without merit. It appears that petitioner is now being held as a prisoner in the state prison pursuant to a commitment issued by the superior court, based upon the judgment of conviction obtained therein.  Said judgment is not related to, nor is it dependent upon, the order of the committing magistrate holding the defendant to answer for trial, its foundation being in the evidence adduced at the trial and the verdict of the jury, and not in the proceedings occurring before the committing magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Lastly, it is alleged that the indeterminate sentence law (see. 1168, Pen. Code), under which petitioner was sentenced, is repugnant to the \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d clauses of the federal and state constitutions (Const. U. S., Amend. 14, sec. 1; Const. Cal., art. I, sec. 13), because it deprives petitioner of \u201cthe benefits and privileges which are conferred by section 1588 of the Penal Code. ...\u201d That code section granted to prisoners confined in the state prison a statutory right to credits for good behavior. The supreme court in the case of <em>In re Lee, </em>177 Cal. 690 [171 Pac. 958], held that the indeterminate sentence law was constitutional, and in so holding declared that its provisions repealed by implication the provisions of said section 1588, and substituted \u201cthe discretion of the board of prison directors for an absolute statutory right, thus making what had b\u00e9en before a right now a matter of grace.\u201d <em>(In re Mann, </em>192 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Cal. 165 [219 Pac. 71].) The case of <em>In re Lee, supra, </em>further established the proposition that the deprival of the right theretofore conferred upon prisoners by said section 1588 operated uniformly against all prisoners who are sentenced under said indeterminate sentence law; and that being so, it is obvious said law does not contravene the constitutional inhibition relied upon by petitioner. \u201cIt has been repeatedly held that a law is general which applied to all of a class\u2014the classification being a proper one\u2014and the requirement of uniformity is satisfied if it applies to all of the class alike.\u2019\u2019 (5 Cal. Jur., p. 819.) Illustrative of the legality of such laws may be cited statutes which by their terms apply only to that class of prisoners serving life sentences. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>153 Cal. 59 [94 Pac. 248] ; <em>Finley </em>v. <em>California, </em>222 U. S. 28 [56 L. Ed. 75, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 11, see, also, Rose\u2019s U. S. Notes].) The mere fact that said indeterminate sentence law does not apply to persons who are convicted of offenses which were committed prior to the enactment of said law <em>(In re Lee, supra), </em>and also to persons convicted of crimes the punishment for which the statute fixes no minimum or maximum penalty <em>(In re Sama, </em>189 Cal. 153 [207 Pac. 893]), does not affect the situation, for the simple reason that the character of those cases constitutes a different class.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The application for the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Tyler, P. J., and St. Sure, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
