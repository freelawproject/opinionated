It is further averred that defendants did not actually acquire the title by deed until March 19,1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in Ms argument, says that the single point involved in the appeal is whether or not he (appellant), in order to have specific performance of the contract, was obliged to make a tender of the balance of the purchase money on or before February <em>24, </em>1920, in view of the fact that the vendors (appellees) did not have title to the property on that day. The contract of sale, in express terms, provided for performance of the agreement by the day named, and that time was to be the essence of the contract, unless extended by mutual consent in writing endorsed thereon. It could not avail the plaintiff, in asserting his rights under the contract, to excuse his failure to comply with its terms by setting up that the defendants could not comply. The allegation that defendants could not convey title to him at the designated time was a mere conclusion, which may not have been warranted by the facts; the way to ascertain whether they could do so was to make a tender on or before the day named, and, this not having been done, the court could not decree specific performance: Doughty v. Cooney, 266 Pa. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the learned chancellor of the court below is affirmed at the cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
