Before Solly, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">The record disclosed the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-8\">January 8, 1919, Henry Tetlow, of Jeffersonville, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, died in his 81st year, leaving a will, executed November 8,1917, in which his widow, Elizabeth Jarman Tetlow, was made executrix and sole beneficiary. Testator was survived by two grandchildren, who are contestants in this case. January 15,1919, the will was admitted to probate by the register of wills of Montgomery County. January 24, 1919, Henry Tetlow, 2d, and Grace Tetlow Sauveur, grandchildren, appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery County, and subsequently filed a petition for an issue devisavit vel non, alleging testamentary incapacity and undue influence; October 4, 1919, Elizabeth Jarman Tetlow, individually, and as executrix, filed an answer denying these allegations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-9\">The facts relied on by contestants to impel the granting of an issue, as shown by the evidence submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the court below, briefly summarized and chronologically arranged, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">1887. Contestants\u2019 parents were married; and decedent, from the birth of his two grandchildren until 1917, from time to time, expressed his intention to provide for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">1899. Decedent sold his business to his son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">1901. Decedent\u2019s first wife died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">1904. Decedent, at the age of 64, married proponent, a young woman, after the execution of an antenuptial agreement, in which she released her marital rights in his estate; the same year decedent drew a will giving the greater part of Ms estate to his grandchildren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-9\">1907. Decedent executed a codicil giving his Jefferson-ville farm and $25,000 to proponent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-10\">1911. Decedent\u2019s son, contestants\u2019 father, died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-11\">1914. Henry Tetlow, 2d, states he then noticed that decedent\u2019s mind had become sluggish; as evidence of which contestant cites that his grandfather suggested a change in the formula of a certain perfume, manufactured by the Tetlow Company, which would eliminate necessary ingredients.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-12\">1916. Decedent had neuritis, seemed forgetful of names and faces and lost his accustomed ability to remember and relate anecdotes. Henry Tetlow, 2d, testified decedent agreed to finance the enlargement and extension of the Tetlow factory; later he refused to do so because, according to the testimony, he didn\u2019t remember anything about the proposition; a few days later, according to another part of contestant\u2019s evidence, decedent said: \u201cNo, I am not going to do anything like that. Don\u2019t you know 1 can\u2019t do it? Why I cannot do that. I haven\u2019t got the money to do that.\u201d This, as alleged, was in reply to his grandson\u2019s statement that the extensions would cost $50,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-13\">1917. Decedent was much affected, in May, by the departure of his grandson to camp, and wept at the parting. Yarious witnesses testified decedent acted peculiarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>on October 16th, at the wedding of Ms grandson, in that he kept his overcoat and hat on, and congratulated his grandson without removing either. Contestants say-decedent was forgetful, and seemed to think it was the occasion of his son\u2019s and not his grandson\u2019s wedding; that he did not remember old acquaintances and employees. About November 15, 1917, decedent went to the Battle Creek Sanatorium, Michigan, where an intensive examination was made by a physician, who reported he was affected by arteriosclerosis and constipation, although Tetlow did not seem to think there was anything the matter with him at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\">1918. In April (some five months after date of will) decedent, in the opinion of his granddaughter, showed signs of failing mentality; and, according to other witnesses, gave further signs of mental weakness in May, June and July, suffering at times from hallucinations (not, however, relating to his children, property, affairs or other matters affecting testamentary capacity), and losing his sense of cleanliness in clothing and habits; which conditions, contestants allege, continued until his death in 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">Three experts on insanity (who, however, had not examined decedent during his life, and who, so far as the record shows, did not have explained to them the legal requirements as to testamentary capacity), in answer to hypothetical questions, embodying the facts testified to by contestants\u2019 witnesses, and disregarding any question of veracity, expressed the view that decedent was incapable of making a will on November 8,1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">As against the opinions just noted, evidence was produced, by contestants themselves, of an actual examination of decedent, by another physician, immediately after the execution of the will, which examination revealed no traces of insanity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\">The proponent produced two doctors, who had an opportunity to observe the actual condition of decedent at or about the time of the execution of his will; these wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>nesses said that, to their trained eyes, he exhibited no signs of weakened mentality until the spring of 1918, several months after the date in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-4\">According to the testimony of proponent\u2019s witnesses, the will was drawn at the written request of decedent, and, previous to its execution, he had discussed the subject with his friend and financial adviser, John H. Mason, president of the Commercial Trust Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">B. Gordon Bromley, Esq., decedent\u2019s attorney, drew the will, as directed in the following letter: \u201cI would like you to make a new will for me. I desire to leave all I have both real and personal, to my wife, Eliza Tetlow, and make her the sole executrix. I will be in Philadelphia, on Thursday, November 8th, and will call on you at that time.\u201d Pursuant to this letter, the writer thereof came to Bromley\u2019s office, accompanied by proponent, who, for many years before her husband\u2019s death always accompanied him wherever he went. The lawyer took decedent into another room and read the will to him; then it was duly executed by decedent and attested by Mr. Bromley, and a Mr. Hay, another member of the Philadelphia bar. Mrs. Tetlow was not present during the execution of the will; both of the attesting witnesses said testator seemed perfectly normal mentally at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">John H. Mason, previously referred to, knew decedent in a business way, as well as socially, and met him frequently during 1917. Mr. Mason testified that during this year decedent was sound and keen in his business judgment; he made his own investigations before buying securities, was interesting in conversation, well informed, and appreciative of humor; that decedent consulted him in the fall of 1917 about the feasibility of avoiding unnecessary trouble by leaving all his property to his wife; that he, the witness, was sure decedent was in every way possessed of mental capacity to execute the will on November 8, 1917. The testimony of more than twenty-five witnesses, who knew, and had opportunities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to observe, decedent at or about the time he executed the will, was uniformly corroborative of Mr. Mason\u2019s testimony. Proponent was a loving devoted wife, and decedent\u2019s constant companion; there was no testimony tending to show undue influence on her part in the making of the will.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsQZ\">February 28, 1921:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\">The court refused the issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">Grace Tetlow Sauveur and Henry Tetlow, 2d, grandchildren of testator, appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-7\"><em>G.

While methods for settling disputes of fact, founded on substantial testimony, as to either alleged lack of testamentary capacity on the part of a testator or undue influence operating upon him at the time he made his will, are recognized, yet the law \u2014 having given to man the right to dispose of his worldly belongings, so that the distribution thereof, after his death, will accord with such written directions as he may leave behind, provided these are in due form, and not violative of legal requirements, and the author thereof acted at the time of their making with testamentary capacity and without undue influence \u2014 takes practical means to prevent twelve men in the jury box from improperly setting aside the duly expressed wishes of a decedent, in a suit by those who, wanting to get possession of his estate, have the stimulus of desired gain, with the great advantage in the legal struggle of the persuasiveness on the jury of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>actual presence in court, as against the physical absence of the testator. To protect adequately the legal right of the deceased to dispose of Ms own property, the law, as administered, \u2014 most wisely, in view of the known tendency of jurors, already mentioned, \u2014 places large powers in the hands of the judges who preside, as chancellors, at the trial of such cases; and like powers are in effect conferred on judges of the orphans\u2019 court to whom applications for issues d. v. n. are made.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">It is the established law of Pennsylvania that, in cases of the character of the one now before us, the judge is vested with power to decide whether or not he shall submit oral evidence to the jury, even though it be conflicting. It is his right and duty, after weighing the whole evidence impartially, to refuse to present it to the jury unless he either feels the ends of justice call for a verdict against the will, or is so uncertain on this point that he could conscionably sustain a finding either way on one or more of the controlling issues involved. If, after so weighing the whole body of the evidence, the trial judge feels sure that Ms professional and official conscience would not permit him to sustain a verdict against the validity of the will, either because the contestants\u2019 proofs lack probative force or are legally inadequate, or because those that are reasonably worthy of credence raise no material conflict on any governing point, or the \u201cprima facie case\u201d which they present has been \u201cso overcome by opposing proof as to leave no substantial dispute\u201d (Sharpless\u2019s Est., 134 Pa. 250, 259; Fleming\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 399, 406), it is his bounden duty to instruct the jury peremptorily against the contestants: Phillips\u2019s Est., 244 Pa. 35; Fleming\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 399, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">When, however, the contestants\u2019 evidence, \u201clooked at separately,\u201d would support a verdict against the will, and the proponent\u2019s evidence, viewed in the same way, would command a contrary verdict, the issues involved should be submitted to the jury (Sharpless\u2019s Est., 134 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Pa. 250, 259, 261; Robinson v. Robinson, 203 Pa. 400, 434), unless the court is convinced that the proofs on one side are so strong that they overcome the opposing prima facie case and leave no substantial dispute; or, again, if, on a thorough consideration of the testimony, there be found a tangible basis of doubt as to whether or not the contestants have in fact sustained the material parts of the case alleged by them, and the court, for that reason, is not certain it would disturb a finding against the will, the issues involved should be submitted to the jury for determination; and unless \u2014 on a duly raised reexamination, after verdict, and applying the tests applicable to this class of cases \u2014 the evidence proves insufficient to support the finding of the jury, that conclusion should stand, even though its effect be to set aside the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">While this court may not heretofore have taken occasion to thus state the law, in so many words, yet where it is claimed that a case, of the character of the one which we are now considering, was improperly kept from the jury, or that a finding therein, against the will, was reversed without due cause, manifold adjudications on like matters, which appear in our reports, show that, when the action of the trial court was based on a consideration of the evidence, the propriety of such action is to be judged, or tested, by the answer to the following inquiry : In view of the relevant rules of law applicable to the particular case, is it conceivable a judicial mind,\u2014 desiring only to arrive at the truth and do exact justice,\u2014 could, on due consideration of the evidence as a whole, reasonably have reached the conclusion of the court below? When the answer to this question is in the affirmative, the judgment appealed from will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Under the most excellent system which has developed in Pennsylvania, \u201cthe right [of either party] to an issue depends upon whether there is a substantial dispute upon a material matter of fact,\u201d and that point the court must determine from a review of all the proofs adduced: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Fleming\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 399, 401, 407; Phillips\u2019s Est., 244 Pa. 35, 41, 42. Moreover, even where an issue has been granted, and it comes to trial, the judge, when circumstances so warrant, may interfere to prevent the jury from unjustifiably setting aside a will; and, with this thought in mind, we have said repeatedly that in all such issues \u201cthe evidence is addressed to [the judge], sitting as a chancellor, quite as much as to the jury\u201d (Caughey v. Bridenbaugh, 208 Pa. 414, 415; Phillips\u2019s Est., supra, 42, and cases there cited). This system constitutes no retraction of, or infringement upon, the institution of the common law jury; it represents merely a correct use of that institution, with limitations appropriate to the circumstances under which it is employed\u2014 that employment not being in a common law action, but in a special\u2019proceeding, having, as fully recognized by our cases, its historical roots in the ancient ecclesiastical courts, \u201cto which the right of trial by jury did not extend\u201d : Fleming\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 399, 408, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The case in hand presents allegations of undue influence and mental incapacity. To sustain the charge of undue influence, contestants had to show that testator\u2019s mind was under its control \u201cat the time and in the very act of making his will\u201d (Kustus v. Hager, 269 Pa. 103); and, as to the alleged lack of ability to make the will, a person may be advanced in years and beset with the marked peculiarities of memory and conduct which so often ac company old age, yet if he appreciates, in a general way, who his relations are and what property he possesses, and indicates an intelligent understanding of the disposition he desires to make of it, he has testamentary capacity: Thompson v. Kyner, 65 Pa. 368, 378, 380; Kustus v. Hager, supra. Here the case against the will is most weak (without regard to the proofs on the other side), and, when the strong evidence presented by proponent is considered, the proofs relied on by contestants are insufficient to sustain a finding in their favor, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>on the ground of undue influence or lack of testamentary' capacity. Therefore, the court below did not err when it refused to grant an issue d. v. n..</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The assignments are overruled, and the decree is affirmed, at cost of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
