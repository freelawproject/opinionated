The latter point was not raised by the answer and hence will not be consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ered <em>here; </em>and the former, which is the rule as to alleged after-discovered evidence following a jury trial, furnishes no ground for reversing the court below for opening a judgment by default, especially where, as here, the supplemental affidavit of defense sets forth in detail the material facts which had been omitted from the original affidavit. Indeed, it would be an extreme case where we would reverse for granting a new trial because of such objections as those made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">The order of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
