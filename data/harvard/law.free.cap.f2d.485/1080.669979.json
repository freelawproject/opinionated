ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1145-33\">This petition is one of two<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> bringing under review an order promulgated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission in a proceeding initiated by D.C. Transit System, Inc. (Transit) for authority to increase its fares for public transportation by bus in the District of Columbia and its suburbs. That order, No. 773, granted increases, but in amounts lower than those sought; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> others, Nos. 781 and 781a, denied reconsideration of the earlier order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After examination of the admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>istrative record in light of petitioner\u2019s several contentions, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s action, to the extent that it is properly before us for review herein, was well within its regulatory domain. We accordingly affirm Order No. 773 in the aspects reviewed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">On September 1, 1967, Transit filed with the Commission new tariffs contemplating a number of changes in its fare schedules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On September 15, the Commission announced that public hearings would be held on Transit\u2019s application,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on September 29, suspended operation of the proposed fares pending completion of the proceeding thereon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After extensive investigation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Commission, on January 26, 1968, issued Order No. 773 granting Transit a partial increase.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">In that order, the Commission found that Transit\u2019s existing fares were \u201cunjust and unreasonable\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because they would \u201cnot produce sufficient revenues to enable the carrier to meet its operating expenses and earn a reasonable return.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commission further found that the fares sought by Transit were \u201cunjust and unreasonable in that they would produce net operating revenues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>excess of a fair return,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but that somewhat smaller increases, which the Commission allowed, would produce just and reasonable results.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By the two orders responsive to subsequent applications for reconsideration, the Commission maintained that position without change.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">Petitioner first contends that the Commission failed to adequately assess the hardship imposed upon the busriding public by the fare raises which it allowed. During the hearings, petitioner introduced exhibits showing that an elevation of fares would adversely affect Transit\u2019s patrons, particularly those on low and fixed incomes, and that many were unable to afford other means of transportation. Indeed, evidence was hardly essential to a triggering of the Commission\u2019s responsibility to minimize the impact of higher fares. In its ratemaking function \u2014 which no longer obtains as to Transit<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 the Commission labored under a mandate to \u201cgive due consideration, among other factors, to the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation service by such carriers at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We ourselves have underscored the Commission\u2019s duty to \u201csee to it that the fare-payers pay no more than is necessary to ensure the continued adequacy of the company\u2019s service and provide a return to the shareholders that is reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As is well known, any appreciable increase in the cost of public transportation renders the service less useful to the community.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is obvious, too, that such an increase lays its heaviest burden on the poor, and may even price some marginal riders out of the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">We do not, however, discern on the Commission\u2019s part any indifference toward this problem. Rather, the indications of record are that the Commission was advertent to the consequences of fare raises and did its best to ameliorate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-14\"> In dealing with Transit\u2019s application for leave to elevate its fares, the Commission was called upon to bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>anee the interests of both the company and the public.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Much of the evidence taken during the Commission\u2019s extensive hearings explored Transit\u2019s operating costs, and Order No. 773 reflects the Commission\u2019s careful analysis and scrutiny of expense data.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The factor contributing mainly to the raises which the Commission allowed was an inescapable increase of $1.5 million to Transit\u2019s labor costs during the future annual period.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">As a utility\u2019s expense of providing service to the public unavoidably inflates, the price charged for the service must also rise. This is the more so in the labor-concentrated transit industry, wherein fewer expense decreases through technological advances are feasible. And, of course, any raise in Transit\u2019s fares was bound to promote difficulties for some. To ease the financial burden of the fare increases in question, the Commission permitted Transit to scale down its bus-purchase program,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and thereby to extend the depreciation life of its existing rolling stock,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the rate of return the Commission allowed cannot be deemed immodest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We perceive no ground for disturbing the Commission\u2019s order in this respect.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">Petitioner further contends that the Commission erred in including Transit\u2019s retained earnings as part of the base upon which its computation of return on equity was made.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We think that position cannot be sustained. Transit\u2019s net earnings after taxes were stockholder property <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u2014 property which its management was free to reinvest in the company. Earnings reinvested in the business enterprise become equity capital no less than other capital contributions do, and are entitled to considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>tion in the calculation of fair return to the same extent that any other capital investment is.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Reinvested earnings, like other components of investors\u2019 equity, are risked in the business, and in the same degree warrant compensation for the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">There is nothing to suggest that Transit\u2019s earnings were unnecessarily reinvested in order to secure higher fares that could not be justified otherwise. On the contrary, Transit\u2019s recent financial history has consistently connoted instability, for which its low capitalization was largely responsible.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, Transit\u2019s equity fund was overwhelmingly its retained earnings \u2014 as the Commission found, stockholder equity in Transit on May 31, 1967, was $500,000 in initially-contributed capital and $2,-261,544.04 in reinvested earnings<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>- \u2014 so that there was every reason for the Commission to encourage a buildup of equity through retentions of earnings. An important inducement to accumulate earnings as reinvested capital is the expectation that a return on all equity will be given consideration in the determination of just and reasonable fares.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To have removed the incentive to reinvest Transit\u2019s earnings in the business would have jeopardized one of its prime sources of new capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\"> Petitioner also argues that the Commission gave improper consideration to Transit\u2019s high debt-equity ratio in determining the rate of return it allowed. The reasoning is that that ratio, as primarily a management decision, is set in the interest of maximum return on investment, and should not be allowed to support a claim of inadequate return. We find this argument unacceptable. We have heretofore held that the ratio of Transit\u2019s debt to its equity is a factor to be taken into account in ascertaining a fair return.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The uneontradicted evidence in the record before us is that Transit can obtain debt capital at far less cost than equity capital.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> By the same token, a smaller rate of return may be required for an enterprise having a high debt-equity ratio than for one for which the ratio is substantially lower.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> To the extent that a utility\u2019s operations and service are adequately and efficiently maintained at a lower aggregate cost, the ratepayer reaps a benefit.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>There is no basis in this record upon which we could conclude that the Commission\u2019s treatment of Transit\u2019s debt-equity ratio contributed to the fare increases it awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Petitioner\u2019s final contention is that the Commission erred in viewing, on the question of fair return to Transit, the latter\u2019s position as a component of a corporate conglomerate.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In Order No. 773, the Commission called attention to two prior administrative rulings <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> that that position affected the risk factor for which Transit was compensated in the computation of its rate of return.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We do not examine the merits of this facet of petitioner\u2019s presentation for the point is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> which defines our jurisdiction to review Commission action, authorizes persons affected by final Commission orders to seek reconsideration by the Commission, requires that the applicant for reconsideration \u201cstat[e] specifically the errors claimed as grounds for such reconsideration,\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and specifies that \u201c[n]o person shall in any court urge or rely on any ground not so set forth in such application.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Only recently we held that failure to submit a question to the Commission for administrative reconsideration forecloses judicial review of that question<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Petitioner did not .include among the specifications of error in her application to the Commission for reconsideration any issue as to the propriety of recognizing the risk factor in Transit\u2019s case for what it really was. It follows that the issue cannot now be litigated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">To the extent reviewed in this opinion, Order No. 773 is</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1145-19\">.

The most prominent changes Transit sought were increases in the basic District of Columbia fares to 30 cents cash and four tokens for $1.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">. D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 735), (WMATC Sept. 15, 1967) (unreported). Transit originally sought fare increases in early June, 1967, which closely followed upon March 15, 1967, fare increases. See D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 684) (WMATC March 13, 1967) (unreported), aff\u2019d, Payne v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm\u2019n, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 415 F.2d 901 (1968). Operating results under the March 15 fares were thus available for only two and one-half months, a period the Commission deemed too limited a basis for a reliable assessment of Transit\u2019s experience with those fares. The Commission accordingly required Transit to supplement the record with evidence of experience over a more extended period. D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 773), <em>supra </em>note 2, 72 P.U.R.3d at 121. When the hearings on the September 1 filing opened on October 12, 1967, Transit provided the Commission with statistical data reflecting its revenues and expenses for the preceding twelve-month historical period, the greater portion of which followed inauguration of the March 15 fares. D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 684), <em>supra, </em>at 46-47. An evaluation of the evidence relating to experience since March 15 revealed that the Commission had set fares at a level which, in harmony with the Commission\u2019s predictions, generated revenues of $36 million and, after all obligations were met, a return of about $600,000. <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-12\">On May 26, 1967, prior to the refiled fare-increase application, Transit sought authority to use reconditioned buses in lieu of new bus purchases required by previous order of the Commission. D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 362) (WMATC May 27, 1964) (unreported). The earlier application was consolidated with the fare-increase application. D.C. Transit Sys., Inc.

Transit Sys., Inc. v.

During the hearings, one expert testified that Transit would have to pay about 32 percent to attract equity capital but only about 7 percent to obtain debt capital. Another testified that Transit\u2019s costs of equity capital would be about 15 percent while the cost of debt capital would be 7.5 percent. D.C. Transit Sys., Inc.

One of the factors which may be taken into consideration in calculating rate of return to a public utility, however, is the degree of risk to which its capital is put. Greater risks to the utility, <em>i. e., </em>financial instability, may result from a high debt-equity ratio ; therefore, the rate of return may be proportionately higher. See D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm\u2019n, <em>supra </em>note 4, 151 U.S.App.D.C. at 228 n. 33, 466 F.2d at 399 n. 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1149-20\">. Admittedly, there are factors which may also make a high debt-equity ratio unbeneficial to riders, among which are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>inhibition to reinvest and improve service because the return to equity is low, and the degeneration of a utility\u2019s financial condition to a point of instability.

(Order No. 684), <em>supra </em>note 5, at 14, the Commission accepted testimony that, because of its position in the Trans-Caribbean holding system, Transit was a smaller business risk than other transit companies, and that resultantly it had readier access to capital markets. By that analysis, of course \u2014 which Transit has consistently opposed \u2014 Transit\u2019s cost of debt capital was lowered and its entitlement to compensation for the risk factor in its rate of return was lessened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">. <em>Supra </em>note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">. \u201cAny person affected by any final order or decision of the Commission may, within thirty days after the publication thereof, file with the Commission an application in writing requesting a reconsideration of the matters involved, and stating specifically the errors claimed as grounds for such reconsideration.
