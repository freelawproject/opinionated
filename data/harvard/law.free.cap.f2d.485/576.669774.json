He urges as the sole ground of error that the Government\u2019s unobjected-to cross-examination of and introduction of testimony in rebuttal to evidence of a key defense witness constituted plain error. We reject this contention and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">At the trial on the merits, the Government sought to prove that the defendant sold heroin to a government informer, named LaFoy Thomas, in a transaction observed at a distance by several federal agents. The defense contended that the money received by Scott from Thomas was merely the repayment of an old debt. To bolster this theory, the defense produced a seemingly unimpeachable young social worker, Miss Saundra Kay Davis, who had been with defendant-Scott on the night in question and who testified that she did not observe the defendant give anything to Thomas in return for the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-22\">During direct examination, Miss Davis was asked: \u201cHave you ever been involved in any kind of narcotics in your life or anything like that?\u201d She replied in the negative. On cross-examination, the Government counsel asked: \u201cHave you ever been present on any occasions when narcotics were sold?\u201d Again she replied in the negative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>whereupon the Government called informer-Thomas back to the stand to testify that he had once purchased drugs from one Bernie Murray in her presence. In surrebuttal, Miss Davis denied the occurrence of such an event and testified that she had been at work at the Boys\u2019 Club during the time of this alleged sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We deem it of the utmost importance that, throughout this exchange of testimony, defense counsel never objected to the line of questioning in cross-examination or to the evidence in rebuttal, nor did he seek a recess or continuance in order to secure work records of the Boys\u2019 Club which, according to Miss Davis\u2019 testimony on surrebuttal, would have corroborated her statements. Defendant now comes before this court on appeal urging that the Government\u2019s attack on Miss Davis\u2019 credibility is plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Whatever may be the merits of defendant\u2019s criticisms of the Government\u2019s rebuttal under normal standards of relevancy and prejudice, where a cross-examiner receiving an answer from a witness on a collateral matter may not seek to rebut such testimony,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the test of \u201cplain error\u201d under F.R. Crim.P. Rule 52(b) is a far more stringent one. It has been distinctly spelled out in Black v. United States, 309 F.2d 331, 342 (8th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 934, 83 S.Ct. 880, 9 L.Ed.2d 765 (1963), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">This Court has \u201crepeatedly held that the plain error rule should be applied with caution and should be invoked only to avoid a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 8 Cir., 291 F.2d 150, 156.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">We are satisfied that the circumstances of this case do not present an appropriate occasion to invoke this singular doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The record shows that defendant did not seek to exclude the evidence by objection or motion. He recalled witness-Davis to deny the informer\u2019s statement and by this means again focused on the conflict in testimony between the informer, sought to be proved incredible, and an apparently disinterested witness, Ms. Davis. The jury passed on the credibility issue and made a finding adverse to the defendant. Post-trial, he moved for a new trial on the grounds that the conviction rested on perjured testimony, and introduced affidavits containing Ms. Davis\u2019 employment records which purported to show her at work at the approximate time the informer allegedly purchased drugs from Bernie Murray in her presence. The judge denied the motion. This theory was renewed in defendant\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. On appeal, Scott urges that we consider the motion as one made under Criminal Rule 33 for a new trial in the interests of justice and that we hold that the trial court committed plain error in his ruling denying a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">From the record, we think it quite ap-. parent that defendant sought acquittal, and, later, sought to overturn the conviction on credibility grounds. These matters were addressed properly to the jury and the trial court. Determinations of credibility rest with the trier of fact and not with the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Accordingly, we find no \u201cplain error\u201d in this case. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\">.
