He attacks his state court conviction and sentence for second degree murder on two grounds: (1) illegal search and seizure of a weapon introduced at his trial; (2) denial of his constitutional right to full and adequate cross-examination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-22\">The evidence fully supported the district court\u2019s finding of probable cause to arrest the defendant. The district court also correctly held that the search and seizure of the weapon which occurred at about the same time as defendant\u2019s arrest was therefore lawful, being incidental to the arrest. <em>See </em>United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950); Lovelace v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 357 F.2d 306, 310; Holt v. Simpson, 7 Cir. 1965, 340 F.2d 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">Appellant\u2019s second ground relates to unsuccessful attempts to cross-examine prosecution witnesses concerning an alleged statement of appellant made at or near the time of his arrest. Our review of the circumstances does not convince us that the matter complained of rises to constitutional proportions even if the state trial court erroneously restricted cross-examination. <em>See </em>Summerville v. Cook, 5 Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
