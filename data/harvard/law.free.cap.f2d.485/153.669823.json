The parties, despite able counsel, have managed to balance the affirmative and negative factors in almost perfect equipoise.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-27\">Husky Oil Company appeals from a judgment holding it liable for interest in the amount of $115,000, plus interest on that sum, due on two promissory notes given by Husky to International Minerals and Chemical Corporation (IMC) in 1967 and 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The facts as found by the district court are as follows: IMC is a New York corporation engaged in the discovery, extraction and sale of various minerals and chemicals for industrial and consumer use. Husky is a Delaware corporation whose business is the production, refining and marketing of oil, gas and oil products. In 1956, Husky acquired ownership of leaseholds in Idaho containing extensive bodies of phosphate ore.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On October 20, 1961, IMC and Husky entered into an agreement under which Husky would receive a $3,000,000 interest-free loan from IMC, to be repaid December 15, 1966 unless the agreement was terminated earlier. In return, IMC would be allowed to explore the phosphate leaseholds in order to determine whether a profitable mining operation was feasible. If the operation appeared profitable, the agreement permitted submission and acceptance of a joint venture program. If IMC did not submit a joint venture program by May 1, 1966, or if any such program was not approved by Husky, the agreement would terminate on December 15, 1966. In this event, Husky was obligated to repay the loan either in cash, whereupon IMC would also receive a 25% interest in the leaseholds, or by conveying the leaseholds to IMC, in which case IMC would pay Husky 50% of the appraised value of the leaseholds in excess of $3,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The agreement was modified in June, 1962 whereby Husky borrowed $3,000,000 from the First National Bank of Chicago against a note due December 15, 1966. The bank loan was guaranteed by IMC and IMC agreed to pay 4%% interest on the note. The proceeds of this loan were used to repay the loan from IMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The agreement was again amended in February, 1966, extending the term of the agreement until December 15, 1967, to allow IMC further time to explore the possibility of a joint venture. In December, 1966, Husky agreed to extend the maturity of the bank loan from December 15, 1966 until December 15, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">In December of 1966, representatives of Husky and IMC also met in Los Angeles to discuss, among other things, the termination of the agreement. The district court found that they agreed that if'the leaseholds had not been sold prior to September 30, 1967, Husky would reimburse IMC for interest on the $3,000,000 loan after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">On November 14, 1967, pursuant to the amended agreement, Husky requested IMC to prepay Husky\u2019s $3,000,000 note to the First National Bank by December 1, 1967. IMC did prepay the principal and accrued interest on December 1, and the First National Bank delivered Husky\u2019s noninterest bearing $3,000,000 note to IMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Representatives of IMC and Husky met in Chicago on November 28, 1967. The question of Husky\u2019s reimbursing IMC for interest on the $3,000,000 loan was discussed at this meeting. On December 18, 1967, Husky sent IMC a check for $37,972.60 for interest on the loan from September 30, 1967 through December 15, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Prior to December 15, 1967, Husky requested that the due date on its $3,000,000 loan be extended from December 15, 1967 to December 29, 1967. IMC agreed on the condition that 6% interest be paid for the extension period. Husky sent IMC a check for $6,904.10 in payment for this interest on December 29, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">Prior to the December 29, 1967 due date, Husky informed IMC that it elected to repay the $3,000,000 loan by conveyance of the phosphate leaseholds. Husky sought, however, to convey the leaseholds in installments oyer a three-year period (1967-69) so that it would not realize the entire gain during 1967, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>thus distorting its per share earnings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Donald Jensen, General Attorney and Assistant Secretary of Husky, drafted a proposed agreement and read the proposal over the phone to an IMC representative. IMC later called Jensen back and told him that IMC wanted the interest increased from 6% to 7% per annum. The agreement in final form embodied the proposed change.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">After reciting the terms of the earlier 1961 agreement, the Termination Agreement dated December 29, 1967, stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cOn or before and effective as of December 29, 1967, Husky will convey an undivided 25% of the phosphate leaseholds, as described in attachment 1 of the referenced October 20, 1961, agreement (the \u2018Leases\u2019), to International with warranty of good and merchantable title and will also deliver to International its promissory note in the amount of $2,250,000.00 bearing interest at 7% with a due date of June 30, 1968. Upon delivery of such assignment and note, International shall surrender to Husky its promissory note of December 1, 1967, in the original amount of $3,000,000.00. If either party is successful in arranging a sale of the Leases at an amount in excess of $3,000,000.00 and upon terms and conditions mutually acceptable to both International and Husky prior to June 30, 1968, the proceeds of such a sale shall be allocated first to the payment of the Husky note plus interest, then International shall receive the next $750,000.00, and thereafter, Husky shall receive 75% of the remainder and International shall receive 25%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">* \u2022&gt;:- * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cIf a mutually acceptable sale has not been obtained on or before June 30, 1968, Husky shall convey to International a good and merchantable title to an additional undivided 40% interest in and to the Leases; and deliver to International its promissory note in the amount of $1,050,000.00 bearing interest at 7 %; and International shall surrender Husky\u2019s prior note of December 29, 1967, in the amount of $2,250,000.00. If either party is successful in arranging a sale of the Leases at an amount in excess of $3,000.000.00 and upon terms and conditions mutually accepted to both International and Husky prior to January 10, 1969, the proceeds of such a sale shall be allocated first to the payment of the Husky note plus interest, then International shall receive the next $1,950,000.00, and thereafter, Husky shall receive 35% of the remainder and International shall receive 65%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">\u201cIf a mutually accepted sale has not been obtained on or before January 10, 1969, Husky shall thereupon convey to International all of Husky\u2019s remaining undivided interest in and to the Leases; and, upon such conveyance, International shall surrender Husky\u2019s note of June 30, 1968, in the amount of $1,050,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">The December 29, 1967 agreement also expressly provided for the handling of \u25a0 interest in the event of one contingency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">\u201cAt \u00e1hy time subsequent to January 15, 1968,'\u00e1nd during the term of this agreement, International is granted the unconditional right and option, upon 90 days\u2019 advance written notice, to demand a conveyance from Husky of all of Husky\u2019s then remaining undivided interest in and to the Leases. If such a demand is made by International and a conveyance tendered by Husky prior to June 30, 1968, International shall, on June 30, 1968, (i) credit Husky\u2019s Note account in the amount of $1,200,000.00 plus interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>accrued on such amount, and (ii) on January 10, 1969, International shall issue an additional credit to Husky in the amount of $1,050,000.00 plus interest. Upon such credits being issued, International shall surrender to Husky on January 10, 1969, its promissory note dated December 29, 1967, in the principal amount of $2,250,000.-00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In January, 1968, Husky sent to IMC its promissory note for $2,250,000, bearing interest at 7% per annum \u201cuntil the principal hereof shall have become due and payable,\u201d and interest at 8% thereafter, due June 30, 1968. Husky also sent assignments of a 25% interest in the phosphate leaseholds. IMC had no prior notice of the form of the note or of the provisions it would contain. On May 8, 1968, IMC returned Husky\u2019s $3,000,000 promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">On June 28, 1968, Husky sent to IMC its promissory note for $1,050,000 plus 7% interest as before, due January 10, 1969. Assignments of an additional 40% interest in the leaseholds were also sent. On July 1, 1968, IMC returned Husky\u2019s promissory note for $2,250,000. On July 19, IMC demanded payment of the interest due on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">On December 31, 1968, Husky conveyed to IMC its remaining 35% interest in the leaseholds. In January, 1969 IMC returned Husky\u2019s promissory note in the amount of $1,050,000. No purchaser had been found for the leaseholds between the effective date of the Termination Agreement (December 29, 1967) and December 31,1968. No interest was paid by Husky on either the $2,250,000 or $1,-050,000 promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">On the basis of these facts, the district court held that Husky\u2019s obligation to pay 7% interest on each of its promissory notes until maturity was not dependent upon whether a mutually acceptable sale of the phosphate leaseholds was made prior to the maturity date of the notes and that IMC did not intend to renounce its claim for interest when it surrendered the two notes. Husky argues that these findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous and insists that it was only obligated to pay interest under the Termination Agreement if a purchaser for the leaseholds was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The two notes upon which the district court entered judgment for interest amounting to $115,000, plus interest thereon, or a total of $116,881.31, each contained a promise by Husky to pay IMC the respective principal amount \u201cwith interest at 7% until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable (whether at the stated maturity or by required prepayment, notice of prepayment, declaration <em>or otherwise), </em>and thereafter at the rate of 8% per annum until paid\u201d and in two places on each note reference was made to the payment of interest, <em>\u201cif any\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">The first clause indicates an obligation by Husky to pay 7% interest under any and every circumstance and the \u201cif any\u201d language implies a possible circumstance where no interest would be payable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">However, each note also provided that it was issued \u201cpursuant to an agreement dated December 29, 1967, between the Company [Husky] and International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corporatiop and is subject to all of the terms and conditions thereof\u201d and therefore the agreement must be examined as well as the notes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The December 29, 1967 agreement stated that the two notes in question would bear interest at 7 %; that if a sale of the leasehold interests to an outside buyer was accomplished, \u201cthe proceeds of such a sale shall be allocated first to the payment of the Husky note <em>plus interest;\u201d </em>that \u201c[i]f a mutually acceptable sale has not been obtained . International [IMC] shall <em>surrender </em>Husky\u2019s . . . note . . .\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Husky contended that although the notes bore interest at 7% prior to maturity, that amount of interest was only payable if a sale to an outside buyer was accomplished since the agreement speaks of the payment of the note \u201cplus interest\u201d whereas in the absence of a sale the note was to be \u201csurrendered\u201d without any reference being made to interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">However, the provision in the agreement referring to the contingency of IMC demanding an advance conveyance of \u201cHusky\u2019s then remaining undivided interest in and to the Leases\u201d also referred to the \u201csurrendering\u201d of each of the two notes. In that provision, the language preceding \u201csurrender\u201d required IMC to \u201ccredit Husky\u2019s Note account in the amount of $1,200,000.00 plus interest accrued on such amount,\u201d and to \u201cissue an additional credit to Husky in the amount of $1,050,000.00 plus interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In other words, the agreement made it clear that (1) interest was due and payable to IMC if the leaseholds were sold to an outside buyer and that (2) interest was not due and payable if IMC accelerated the conveyance of all of Husky\u2019s interest in the leaseholds from January 10, 1969 (the latest agreement date for final conveyance) up to June 30, 1968 (the latest date of conveyance under the acceleration clause).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither of these two contingencies occurred: the leaseholds were not sold to an outside buyer and IMC did not accelerate the conveyance of the final interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">What did happen was the contingency covered by the use of the words \u201csurrender Husky\u2019s note.\u201d It is true that this contingency did not expressly state that interest would be due and payable as in the case of the outside purchaser, where the words \u201cplus interest\u201d were used. It is also true that this contingency did not expressly state that interest would not be due and payable as in the case of the acceleration clause, where the words IMC \u201cshall . . . credit Husky\u2019s Note account in the [principal] amount . plus interest\u201d were employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">The use of the word \u201csurrender\u201d in the acceleration provision after the express language requiring the crediting by IMC of interest otherwise due and payable by Husky, indicated that the parties use of the word \u201csurrender\u201d in the case of the contingency which did in fact occur \u2014 the three-installment conveyance of the leaseholds to IMC \u2014 did not automatically imply that no interest was due and payable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">The word \u201csurrender\u201d was also used in the agreement in reference to the $3,000,000 note dated December 1, 1967, upon which Husky had paid interest in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Inasmuch as \u201csurrender\u201d was used several times in the Termination Agreement without any fixed meaning relating to the payment or non-payment of interest, it can not take on an application that no interest was intended when used in regard to the two notes at issue. For this reason, cases which define \u201csurrender\u201d in other contexts are not applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The keystone of contract interpretation is the ascertainment of the intention of the parties derived from the language they used. The meaning of the words which the parties employed is found by focusing on the words themselves and then drawing back and testing that meaning in the context of the entire contract, the circumstances surrounding its execution, and the manner in which the parties interpreted it by performance. We have heretofore construed Illinois law as permitting the consideration of extrinsic evidence in contract interpretation and such consideration does not require a threshold determination that the contract is ambiguous. Ortman v. Stanray Corp., 437 F.2d 231 (7th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In that case Chief Judge Swygert said at 235:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cAdmitting evidence of prior negotiations and agreements for the purpose of discovering the meaning of the terms used in the integration does not violate the parol evidence rule. \u2018Such testimony does not vary or contradict the written words; it determines that which cannot be varied or contradicted.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">On October 20, 1961, Husky and IMC agreed that IMC would make an interest-free loan to Husky of $3,000,000 for a five-year period from December 15, 1961 to December 15, 1966. The consideration<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for this sizeable interest-free loan<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was the granting by Husky to IMC of the exclusive right to examine and explore, at IMC\u2019s expense, for a five-year period certain phosphate-bearing leaseholds in Idaho then owned by Husky. As a result of this exploration, IMC \u201cmay furnish a Joint Venture Program\u201d which Husky would have the right \u201cto approve or disapprove.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">If IMC failed to submit a joint venture program by May 1, 1966 or if IMC submitted a program which Husky failed to approve, then Husky \u201cshall repay the Loan on December 15, 1966 either in cash or property.\u201d If Husky elected to repay the loan in cash, IMC would also receive a 25% interest in the phosphate leaseholds. Husky could elect to repay the loan in property by conveying the leaseholds to IMC, in which event IMC was obligated to pay Husky 50'% of the appraised value of the leaseholds in excess of $3,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">On February 25, 1966, the October 20, 1961 agreement was amended in several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>respects, one of which was to extend the date when Husky was to repay the loan from December 15, 1966 to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">\u201c[T]he earlier of (a) the 360th day following the earlier of the date on which International [IMC] (i) has furnished a Joint Venture Program to Husky pursuant to IV 2 or (ii) given written notice to Husky of the abandonment of the Joint Venture Program and termination of this agreement or (b) December 15, 1967.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au-\">Representatives of IMC and Husky met in Los Angeles, California, on December 20, 1966, as a result of which each party sent to the other party a proposed letter agreement setting forth that party\u2019s interpretation of certain agreements reached orally at that meeting. Neither recipient party accepted the other party\u2019s proposed draft. Significantly, however, both drafts contained this identical language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201c. . . Husky agrees that September 30, 1966 shall be deemed to be the date on which IMC gave Husky notice of abandonment of the joint venture program . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Accepting both parties\u2019 ascertainment of the date of the abandonment of the joint venture program, the date for repayment of the IMC loan under the October 20, 1961 agreement as amended on February 25, 1966, would have been September 25, 1967. Assuming the existence of these facts and no others, several presumptions would follow if Husky failed to pay the interest-free loan on September 25, 1967. In the first place, the <em>quid pro quo </em>\u2014 that is, the interest-free loan in consideration for a period of exploration equated in length of time by reference to the period of the loan, as clearly intended in the October 21, 1961 agreement as amended \u2014 would end on September 25, 1967, inasmuch as IMC\u2019s right to explore with a view to entering a joint venture had ended 360 days earlier. After September 25, 1967, IMC would receive no consideration for continuing the $3,000,000 loan at no interest. At that time the presumption would follow that interest is intended when there is neither presumption of a gift nor other consideration. I Willis-ton, Contracts \u00a7 36A, at 106 (3rd ed. 1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">\u201cSo if money is paid by one person at the request of another, the request, unless the circumstances are such that the inference of a requested gift is possible, implies an offer to repay the money with interest at the legal rate if the requested payment is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">\u201cThe contracts implied in fact arising from offers of the sort mentioned in this section are closely connected in the history of the law with quasi contracts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">Under Illinois statutory <em>law</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>another presumption would arise as set forth in 23 Illinois Law and Practice, Interest \u00a7 22 at 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-16\">\u201cBy statute, interest may be allowed on a written instrument stipulating for the payment of money, after it becomes due, <em>although there is no provision in the instrument for the payment of interest; </em>but in order to entitle a party to interest on moneys which become due on any instrument in writing, the relationship of debtor and creditor must exist between the parties . . . .\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">These were some of the circumstances prior to and contemporaneous with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>making of the December 29, 1967 agreement which was the basis for the two notes at issue. If no agreement had been executed at that time, interest would have commenced to run on the $3,000,000 after ,, September 25, 1967. Instead, however, the parties executed the agreement and these surrounding circumstances point in the direction that interest was intended to be paid on the underlying notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Husky stated in its brief that \u201c[o]ne of the best guides to interpreting a contract is to examine the conduct of the parties during performance of the contract,\u201d citing Prince v. Packer Mfg. Co., 419 F.2d 34, 37 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">During the existence of the $3,000,000 loan, it was financed from June 29, 1962 to December 1, 1967, through The First National Bank of Chicago.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The parties began to dispute over the payment of interest on the loan at the end of 1966 or the beginning of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Glenn Nielson was Husky\u2019s chief executive officer and its principal negotiator with IMC during the period from 1961 to 1969. In Nielson\u2019s memorandum of a meeting with IMC people held on November 28,1967, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201cDuring the conversation it developed that International [IMC] was still paying the interest on the three million dollars, although I had understood we were to pay it from September.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Accordingly, Husky paid interest on December 18, 1967 in the amount of $37,972.60 for the period from September 30 through December 15, 1967,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and paid $6,904.10 additional interest on December 29, 1967 for the period through December 29, 1967,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or a total of $44,876.70.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">In regard to the negotiations leading up to the December 29, 1967 agreement, Allen Spafford of IMC testified that shortly before that agreement (App. at 137):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">\u201cI also told Jensen that we expected interest on the unpaid balance of the obligation during the term of the agreement. I went on and explained the reasons for both of these conditions. I told him that we were essentially handicapping our business by letting them have this involvement in the property for the next 13 months \u2014which is what his proposal was, as I remember \u2014 and that we would be much better off if we had the property free and clear to permit more straightforward negotiations with potential buyers of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">\u201cI said that to have this Husky entanglement was essentially a hardship for IMC, but that we would accept it on these two conditions, provided that we could get rid of the Husky entanglement on a- short term notice to Husky and, secondly, that we would get paid interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-17\">\u201cAnd I explained that it was the opportunity to receive that interest that was very important and that it was a very important motive that was permitting me to go along with this essential hardship for the company, for IMC.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">The district judge could and impliedly did credit this testimony when he found that it was not the intention of the parties that Husky\u2019s obligation to pay interest on the two notes in issue be qualified in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s proper consideration of all of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the December 29, 1967 agreement and the resulting finding and conclusion that \u201cit was the parties intention expressed in the provisions of the Termination Agreement and the terms of the promissory notes given pursuant thereto that Husky\u2019s obligation to pay interest at the rate of 7 % until maturity upon the principal of its promissory notes was not dependent upon whether or not a mutually acceptable sale had been made pri- or to the maturity of the notes,\u201d was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">.

It is not clear why the agreement called for crediting Husky\u2019s Note account with interest accrued in the event of an accelerated conveyance since this amounts to merely an accounting entry. However, it does lead to the conclusion that interest was considered to be accruing on the unconveyed portion. Why this accruing interest should not be owing at the end of the entire term of the agreement whereas it was considered owing at any point prior in time (including the circumstance where Husky procured a buyer) is not easy to comprehend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b221-17\">. This interpretation is strengthened by a second provision which referred to a demand for acceleration by IMC: \u201cIf the demand is made by International and the conveyance tendered by Husky after June 30, 1968, International shall surrender to Husky, on its due date, the Husky promissory note then outstanding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">.

Putting to one side the differences which different dates of sale would create, the basic alternatives covered in the agreement were (1) that IMC would find a buyer; (2) that Husky would find a buyer; or (3) that there would be no sale prior to the expiration of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">IMC\u2019s ultimate control of \u00a3he property was assured by the last section of the agreement which gave it an unrestricted right, upon 90 days\u2019 notice, to demand a conveyance from Husky of its then remaining interest in the leaseholds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following such a conveyance, Husky would have no further interest in the property or the proceeds of any sale by IMC unless Husky thereafter found an acceptable purchaser.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the plain language of the agreement, a conveyance by Husky pursuant to IMC\u2019s demand would have discharged Husky\u2019s entire obligation under the notes, for interest as well as principal, and entitled it to a surrender of any outstanding note.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the conveyance of property would have paid whichever note was then outstanding in full and required its surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">If a buyer had been procured by Husky, Husky would share in the proceeds of sale, provided that the purchase price was in excess of $3,000,000, plus interest on the note.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the event of such a sale, the agreement plainly stated that the note would be payable out of the proceeds of sale, and that such a cash payment would include interest as well as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As events developed, neither party found a buyer. That contingency was covered in the agreement by language, which, as I read it, simply provides that in exchange for a conveyance of property from Husky to IMC, IMC shall surrender the note then outstanding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no express reference to the payment of interest, in addition to the conveyance of property. I do not think the agreement can properly be read to imply either (a) that IMC\u2019s obligation to surrender the note was conditioned on the receipt of a cash payment equal to file amount of interest that had accrued; or (b) that a right to receive interest was intended to survive the surrender of the note. In short, I think the reference to a surrender of the note in exchange for the assignment of property was the equivalent of a statement that the assignment would constitute payment in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">What I view as the plain meaning of the agreement of December 29, 1967, is entirely consistent with the underlying transaction which gave rise to that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">It is true, of course, that the basic agreement entered into in 1961 created a somewhat unique debtor-creditor relationship. I believe, however, that this relationship can be better understood by emphasizing the fact that Husky was a seller and IMC a purchaser of a valuable asset. Quite obviously, in 1961, when they negotiated the basic agreement, the parties were convinced that the phosphate leases had a value of at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>$3,000,000, and probably more if properly developed. In essence, in 1961 Husky transferred control of those leases to IMC for a price of $3,000,000 plus an additional contingent benefit \u2014 sometimes described as a \u201ckicker\u201d or \u201cbonus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Pending receipt of its contingent bonus, Husky retained legal title to the property \u2014 no doubt for security purposes \u2014 but the significant indicia of ownership were all transferred to IMC when the original agreement was executed in 1961. IMC assumed the burdens of ownership, such as the obligation to pay real estate taxes, minimum royalties, minimal rentals, and all responsibility for such mandatory prospective or development work as might be necessary, and it acquired the same rights to use and develop the property as would an outright owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Depending on the results of IMC\u2019s exploration and development, the bonus for Husky would have been payable in different ways. For example, if IMC determined that it could successfully mine and work the phosphate, it might offer Husky a minority interest in a joint venture program<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but Husky was not required to participate. If Husky accepted such an offer, the minority interest in the joint venture would represent its bonus or, in effect, the payment of the balance of the original purchase price. If Husky rejected such an offer, and if the appraised value of the properties then exceeded $3,000,000, Husky was entitled to an amount equal to 50% of that excess. Of course, if the appraised value was less than $3,000,000, and if Husky did not elect to participate in a joint venture, Husky would receive no bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">If IMC did not submit a joint venture proposal to Husky, Husky had two options. It could reacquire control of 75% of the property for a price of $3,000,000;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> quite obviously it would not make that election unless it appraised the property as worth at least $4,000,000. Alternatively, it could simply assign title to the leaseholds to IMC. The former option was described in the agreement as a repayment of the loan in cash; the latter as a payment of the loan in property. In sum, if the property should be worth less than $3,000,000, there would be no justification for any bonus for Husky and the final closing of the transaction would simply involve the release of Husky\u2019s security interest in the property and its retention of the $3,000,000 payment which had been made by IMC in 1961; the original $3,000,000 \u201cinterest free loan\u201d would then constitute the entire purchase price and IMC would have unencumbered ownership of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">As events turned out, the parties decided that neither wanted to undertake development of the property. On December 29, 1967, Husky was unquestionably entitled to transfer the leaseholds to IMC in exchange for a surrender of the $3,000,000 note. No interest would then have been payable. Instead of exercising that right, however, Husky requested, and IMC agreed, to divide the assignment as well as the surrender of the note into three parts in order to avoid a distortion of its annual earnings and presumably to spread the tax consequences of the transaction over a three-year period. If the 1967 agreement is regarded as primarily designed to provide for the method of repaying an existing debt, it is quite reasonable to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>elude \u2014 -as the majority does \u2014 that an implied obligation to pay interest arose to compensate the lender for the delay in receiving payment of the principal. But if the 1967 agreement is viewed as prescribing the final steps to be taken in the wind-up of a somewhat complex sales transaction in which the original $3,000,000 payment represented the minimum purchase price for the transferred assets, no reasonable justification for an interest charge is apparent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The postponement of the final conveyance of Husky\u2019s legal title did not interfere in any way with IMC\u2019s right either to use the property or to sell it to a third party. IMC already possessed all significant indicia of ownership and had an unqualified right to demand a full conveyance on 90 days\u2019 notice. Moreover, as the agreement plainly stated, the postponement also gave IMC the benefit of having Husky cooperate in the attempt to procure a purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">I find it hard to believe that Husky would agree to pay the amount of interest claimed in order to obtain the benefit of spreading its capital gain over a three-year period; after all, the value of the use of the money needed to pay the tax is obviously only a fraction of the total purchase price.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the other hand, since the postponement really cost IMC nothing, I find it hard to credit its claim that the right to receive interest motivated its acceptance of Husky\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">In sum, I think the agreement which simply provides that the note shall be surrendered in exchange for an assignment of the leases means exactly what it says.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\">. More precisely, IMC could make sucli a demand any time later than 17 days after the execution of the agreement. The first sentence of section 7 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">\u201cAt any time subsequent to January 15, 1968, and during the term of this agreement, International is granted the unconditional right and option, upon 90 days\u2019 advance written notice, to demand a conveyance from Husky of all of Husky\u2019s then remaining undivided interest in and to the Leases.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-12\">. The last paragraph of the agreement stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">\u201cAt any time following such a conveyance by nusky to Intel-national of the full interest in the Leases, but prior to January 10, 1969, and so long as International continues to hold such full title, Husky may continue to attempt to obtain a buyer for sucli properties. If a sale is arranged during such period in accordance with Article 2 above solely through the efforts of Husky, the credits, payments and percentages provided in Articles 1. and 2. above shall apply. However, it is expressly understood and agreed that nothing in this Article 7. shall be construed to restrict in any way International\u2019s absolute ownership and control of the Leases following a conveyance under the terms of this Article 7.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-19\">. The portion of Article 7 not quoted in the above footnotes provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-20\">\u201cIf such a demand is made by International and a conveyance tendered by Husky prior to June 30, 1968, International shall, on June 30, 1968 (i) credit Husky\u2019s Note account in the amount of $1,200,000.00 plus interest accrued on such amount, and (ii) on January 10, 1969, International shall issue an additional credit to Husky in the amount of $1,050,000.00 plus interest. Upon such credits being issued, International shall surrender to Husky on January 10, 1969, its promissory note dated December 29, 1967, in the principal amount of $2,250,000.00,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u2018Tf the demand is made by International and the conveyance tendered by Husky after June 30, 1968, International shall surrender to Husky, on its due date, the Husky promissory note then outstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acs\">IMC places considerable emphasis on the fact that this provision indicated that the parties intended that interest would continue to accrue until the note was surrendered. But, of course, the accrual of interest on IMC\u2019s books was a matter of complete indifference to Husky unless Husky was required to pay that interest. And the only contingency under which any obligation to pay such interest is mentioned in the December 29, 1967 agreement is the unlikely event that the parties found a buyer at such a favorable price that the payment of interest would merely reduce the amount of a profit which Husky did not actually anticipate receiving. In other words, Husky merely agreed to have an amount of interest paid with a third party\u2019s cash \u2014 not with its own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\">. I recognize that the agreement refers to a mutually acceptable sale arranged \u201cby either party,\u201d and therefore would entitle Husky to share in the proceeds in the unlikely event that IMC procured the purchaser and did not exercise its right to acquire title on 90 days\u2019 notice. Presumably, however, the provisions of tlie agreement giving Husky an interest in the proceeds contemplated a sale which Husky helped to arrange.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-13\">. Paragraph 3 of the agreement reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">\u201cIf a mutually acceptable sale has not been obtained on or before January 10, 1969, Husky shall thereupon convey to International all of Husky\u2019s remaining undivided interest in and to the Leases; and, upon such conveyance, International shall surrender Husky\u2019s note of June 30, 1968, in the amount of $1,050,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">The preceding paragraph, dealing with the exchange that was required on June 30, 1968, if an acceptable sale had not yet been made, was identical except that the surrender of the then outstanding note was in exchange for property interests, including (a) a new note, and (b) a partial assignment of the leasehold interest. In neither paragraph 2 nor paragraph 3 was there any reference to the payment of interest in connection with a surrender of a note in exchange for property. Instead, the language was parallel to that used in paragraph 1 when admittedly the surrender of the original $3,000,000 note in exchange for a new note in a lesser amount and a partial assignment of the leases did not contemplate any interest payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">. Article V, (1) provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agr\">\u201cUpon the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement and the making of all required capital contributions International shall participate 60% and Husky shall participate 40% in the profits and losses of the Joint Venture and all additional capital contributions thereafter shall be made 60% by International and 40% by Husky.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"A1v\">. It was authorized \u201cto repay the Loan in cash . . . [and] concurrently with such repayment assign to International good and merchantable title to an undivided 25% interest in the leaseholds created by the Leases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">. Under the agreement, the only way in which IMC could recover its original $3,000,000 payment (other than by developing the property) was by way of a sale at a higher price, either to a third party or through a repurchase by Husky (see note 7, <em>supra). </em>Since it appears that the property could not be sold for more than the $3,000,000, it seems unrealistic to treat the purchaser\u2019s retention of the basic purchase price as justifying an interest payment to compensate for the use of that money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">. I recognize that the record indicates that tax consequences did not play any part in Husky\u2019s motivation and that Husky merely desired to avoid a distortion of its 1969 earnings. If that be the fact, it is particularly hard to understand why Husky would elect to pay $115,000 in interest to avoid the cost or the consequences of an explanatory footnote in its annual statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b228-20\">. I do not contend that the use of the term \u201csurrender\u201d necessarily implies that no interest was due and payable. I do contend that an obligation to surrender a note in exchange for a conveyance of property unaccompanied by any cash payment is inconsistent with a claim that an obligation to pay interest survived the surrender of the note or a claim that the note did not have to be surrendered in response to a tender of the property. As I read the entire 1967 agreement, every time the word \u201csurrender\u201d is used, it has exactly the same meaning. Only in the event of a sale to a third party is IMO\u2019s obligation to surrender the note conditioned on the payment of any cash whatsoever.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
