The Board\u2019s conclusion that Colonial violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act by coercively interrogating its employees and unlawfully changing its policy regarding employees\u2019 hours is fully supported by the record. Similarly, the \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) violations found by the Board based on the. discriminatory discharge of employees Jackson, Abbot and Franklin and the company\u2019s refusal to reinstate fifteen employees who participated in the unfair labor practice strike are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">No purpose would be served by a laborious restatement of the facts found by the Administrative Law Judge and adopted by the Board in its order. Colonial has earnestly contended that the Board improperly interpreted and overemphasized the importance of a speech given to its employees by the President of Colonial the day after the company learned of the employees\u2019 union activity. The Board held that although the speech did not amount to an unfair labor practice it could properly be considered as background in reviewing the significance of Colonial\u2019s subsequent acts. We agree. See, Hendrix Manufacturing Co. v. N.L.R.B., 321 F.2d 100, 103 (5th Cir. 1963); N.L.R.B. v. Builders Supply Co. of Houston, 410 F.2d 606, 608 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">On the basis of the extensive unfair labor practices revealed in this record, the Board correctly ordered Colonial to bargain with the employees\u2019 chosen representative. Colonial\u2019s conduct completely vitiated any hope of attaining a fair election. See N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). The Board\u2019s order is in all respects enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-17\">.
