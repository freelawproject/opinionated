See Townsend v. Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770. Its judgment is therefore vacated and the case is remanded for further consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-17\">. The matter was handled by a magistrate whose findings, conclusions and recommendation were adopted by the district court. The clerk of the district court has advised this court that all state court materials filed as exhibits in district court were transmitted to this court. The state trial record is not among these exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
