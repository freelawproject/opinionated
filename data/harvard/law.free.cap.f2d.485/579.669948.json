The first error specified is the denial of the motion of appellants for a judgment of acquittal because of an insufficiency of evidence and the lack of sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. There is no merit in this contention. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). The second contention is that since appellants offered an explanation of their possession of recently stolen property, the trial court erred in giving the instruction sanctioned in United States v. Barnes, 412 U.S. 837, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973). Since the Supreme Court also stated in <em>Barnes </em>that a defendant\u2019s explanation of possession would not automatically bar the giving of that instruction, <em>id. </em>at 845, 93 S.Ct. at 2362, 37 L.Ed.2d at 387 n. 9, appellants\u2019 second contention is unavailing. The third specification of error is spawned by the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>that the trial court required appellants to recall and requestion a government witness before proceeding to impeach him. Since the attempted impeachment was not curtailed, we hold that if error was committed, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
