Since there is no alternative claim that the dismissal pursuant to the Foreign Service Act was improper, we find no impropriety in the dismissal. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-27\">On November 1, 1959, plaintiff was appointed by the International Cooperation Administration (ICA) as Deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Mission Director for the United States Operations Mission for Vietnam. The Standard Form 50 (SF-50) effecting his appointment designated the position as \u201cExcepted Appointment (Indefinite).\u201d On November 4, 1961, plaintiff was transferred from ICA to the Agency for International Development (AID) when the former was abolished. Soon after his transfer, plaintiff requested that he be covered under the Civil Service Retirement System rather than the Social Security System. Accordingly, an SF-50 was issued on November 30, 1961 stating that plaintiff\u2019s appointment was changed to \u201cExcepted Appointment\u2014 Foreign Service Reserve (CORRECTION).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">On June 24, 1962, an SF-50 was issued reassigning plaintiff from Vietnam to the AID mission in Tunisia. Item 5 of the SF-50 stated: \u201cExcepted Appointment Foreign Service Reserve Limited (NTE December 23, 1964 COB).\u201d This was plaintiff\u2019s first \u201cNot to Exceed\u201d appointment. Thereafter, a series of SF-50\u2019s were issued, all in the \u201cNot to Exceed\u201d form, extending plaintiff\u2019s appointment to July 31, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Plaintiff was notified by letter dated April 21, 1970 that he would be terminated at the expiration of his then existing time-limited appointment (July 31, 1970) due to the lack of a suitable available reassignment. After a one month extension to August 30, 1970, plaintiff\u2019s termination was implemented by an SF-50 issued September 1, 1970 under the authority of section 638 of the Foreign Service Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Plaintiff, contending that he was a \u201cpreference eligible employee,\u201d filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission (the Commission) which was denied as untimely. Upon reconsideration, the Commission reopened the case and permitted the parties to file briefs on the issue of whether AID was required to separate Mr. Coster under the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act and the applicable regulations of the Commission (5 C.F.R. Part 752) or whether the Agency was authorized to separate him without regard to that statute and those regulations, under section 638 of the Foreign Service Act. The Commission also placed in issue the basic problem of whether plaintiff was entitled to appeal his separation from AID to the Commission pursuant to 5 U.C.S. \u00a7 7701 (1970). In a decision dated June 21, 1972, the Commission held that plaintiff was not protected by the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act and, consequently, that the removal action by AID was not subject to appeal to the Commission. Having exhausted his administrative remedies, plaintiff turns to this court for relief, seeking back wages allegedly due him as a result of his removal. The same issues raised before the Commission are presented in this action and are ripe for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The two statutes here in issue provide conflicting provisions concerning dismissal of an employee. The Veterans\u2019 Preference Act specifies procedural safeguards which are a prerequisite to dismissal of a preference eligible employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 638 of the Foreign Service Act, on the other hand, empowers the Secretary of State to terminate at any time the services of any reserve officer without precondition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, with regard to dismissals, these statutes are inconsistent. Obviously this inconsistency is in issue only if <em>both </em>statutes are applicable to plaintiff\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The Foreign Service Act applies only to Foreign Service employees serving under a <em>limited appointment. </em>Plaintiff clearly held such a position. Although he originally received an \u201cindefinite appointment,\u201d this was changed in June 1962 and all of his subsequent appointments were of a limited nature couched in \u201cNot to Exceed\u201d terms. Thus, the Foreign Service Act was applicable to plaintiff. Accordingly, he was subject to termination at any time by the Secretary of State without prior notice and without a right of appeal to the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, on the other hand, applies to preference eligible employees, which are defined as <em>permanent </em>or <em>indefinite </em>preference eligibles who have completed a probationary period. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511 (1970). It is plaintiff\u2019s position that, although his appointment at the time of dismissal was a <em>limited </em>one, it was also <em>indefinite </em>for the purposes of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. In support of this position, plaintiff cites Born v. Allen, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 217, 291 F.2d 345 (1960), in which an appointment which was \u201climited to four years or need of employee\u2019s services, whichever is less,\u201d qualified as \u201cpermanent or indefinite\u201d within the meaning of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. This court has adhered to the <em>Born </em>reasoning in Ainsworth v. United States, 180 Ct.Cl. 166 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">There is no need in this case either to challenge or to affirm the <em>Born </em>and <em>Ainsworth </em>opinions because, even if plaintiff\u2019s appointment is considered limited <em>and </em>indefinite, there is other language in the Foreign Service Act which compels the conclusion that it supersedes the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, thus avoiding a conflict between the two laws. Such language is crucial to the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Section 638 of the Foreign Service Act begins with the following phrase: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this or any . other law * * *.\u201d This clearly demonstrates that the Act was intended to supersede all previous laws including the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. It is difficult to imagine any clearer statutory language that Congress could have employed to convey its intent that a particular statute should prevail over other possibly conflicting provisions. This court has recently held that language such as \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of this or any other law\u201d covers the waterfront regarding the operational scope of the statute. Guarriello v. United States, 475 F.2d 640, 642, 201 Ct.Cl. 129, 133 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Despite the foregoing, plaintiff relies heavily on the Supreme Court opinion in Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, 76 S.Ct. 861, 100 L.Ed. 1396 (1956), for the proposition that a statute alleged to cut across the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act is to be narrowly construed. In <em>Cole, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandate of the Summary Suspension Act of 1950, as construed, was not strong enough to overcome the procedural rights of a preference eligible employee under the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Although the situation in <em>Cole </em>was similar to that in the instant case, there was one critical distinguishing factor. The <em>Cole </em>Court concluded that no real conflict existed between the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act and the Summary Suspension Act as only the former statute actually applied to petitioner\u2019s situation. <em>Id. </em>at 557-558, 76 S.Ct. 861.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the present case, on the other hand, as has been explained above, plaintiff\u2019s discharge was clearly authorized by the Foreign Service Act, and thus a genuine conflict between it and the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act is presented. In such a case, the mandate of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause must be construed to make the Foreign Service Act prevail over the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act and any other apposite law.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>This court has also permitted another statute to \u201ccut across\u201d the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. In Kirschner v. United States, 172 Ct.Cl. 526 (1965), this court held that section 621(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act (together with the implementing delegations) gave the Administrator full discretion to decide which employees of ICA should be transferred to AID without regard to the provisions of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. As in the instant case, section 621(d) provided that the decision as to transferring personnel rested with the President (or his delegates) \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s position in this case is not new, but is consistent with previous case law construing the same type of language.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In light of the foregoing, we hold the Foreign Service Act is controlling over plaintiff\u2019s dismissal. The clear statutory language necessitates a finding that Congress intended that it should govern such situations notwithstanding any other provisions of any other law. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted; plaintiff\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment is denied; and the petition is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\">.
