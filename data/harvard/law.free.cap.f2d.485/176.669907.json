The District Court found that Dr. Zimmerer, a teacher at San Jacinto Junior College, in Texas, was entitled to procedural due process because, though non-tenured, she had \u201can expectancy of reemployment <em>under the policies and practices of the institution\u201d </em>(emphasis added). It found that the college Board of Regents had deprived her of procedural due process by refusing to renew her contract without sufficient notice of charges against her and without a sufficient hearing. Relief was granted in the form of the pay (and salary raise) that she would have received during the following year, plus attorney fees. Both sides have appealed. We are of the opinion that the District Judge correctly resolved the matter, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The record adequately supports the finding that Dr. Zimmerer was not accorded procedural due process, and we agree with that finding. The Board insists, however, that the Supreme Court decision in Perry v. Sinderman, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), which was handed down after the District Court\u2019s decision in the present case, requires that this case be reversed. The argument misconceives both <em>Perry </em>and the trial court decision in the case before us. In <em>Perry </em>the Supreme Court held that a merely subjective expectancy of reemployment by a non-tenured teacher was not such an interest that the threatened loss of it was protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. It is at least arguable whether the prior \u201cexpectancy of employment\u201d cases were ever wholly subjective. Certainly many of them embraced objective facts concerning prior actions and usages. <em>Perry </em>does not reject but rather requires analysis of such objective facts, discarding only the \u201cmere subjective expectancy\u201d of the teacher as the predicate for procedural due process. The Supreme Court recognized that the absence of an explicit written contractual provision did not always foreclose the possibility that the teacher had the necessary \u201cproperty\u201d interest in reemployment, arising from the employer\u2019s words and actions whose meaning would be found in the usage of the past. 408 U.S. at 601, 92 S.Ct. at 2699, 33 L.Ed.2d at 580.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">A teacher, like the respondent, who has held his position for a number of years, might be able to show from the circumstances of this service \u2014 and from other relevant facts \u2014 that he has a legitimate claim of entitlement to job tenure. Just as this Court has found there to be a \u201ccommon law of a particular industry or of a pai\u2019ticular plant\u201d that may supplement a collective-bargaining agreement, United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., 363 U.S. 574, 579, [80 S.Ct. 1347, 1351, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409, 1415], so there may be an unwritten \u201ccommon law\u201d in a particular university that certain employees shall have the equivalent of tenure. This is particularly likely in a college or university, like Odessa Junior College, that has no explicit tenure system even for senior members of its faculty, but that nonetheless may have created such a system in practice. See Byse &amp; Joughin, Tenure in American Higher Education 17-28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">408 U.S. at 602, 92 S.Ct. at 2700, 33 L.Ed.2d at 580. This concept of unwritten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cproperty\u201d interests is fleshed out by language in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), decided the same day. There the Court pointed out the necessity for giving meaning to the term \u201cproperty\u201d as used in the due process clause and noted that it had eschewed rigid or formalistic limitations on the protection of procedural due process. More specifically the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits. These interests \u2014 property interests \u2014 may take many forms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afl\">408 U.S. at 576, 92 S.Ct. at 2708, 33 L.Ed.2d at 560. And, after describing various situations in which one may have a protectible interest in a benefit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">Certain attributes of \u201cproperty\u201d interests protected by procedural due process emerge from these decisions. To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. . It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Dr. Zimmerer\u2019s cqse clearly falls within the \u201ccommon law of the institution.\u201d Indeed, that is substantially what the District Judge said by his statement that Dr. Zimmerer\u2019s had an expectancy of reemployment \u201cunder the policies and practices of the institution.\u201d If at that time the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had been available the findings of fact might have been more precisely targeted, but the statement quoted, appearing after a description of the objective facts of institutional policies and practices, is more of a precursor of the Supreme Court in <em>Perry </em>than inconsistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">Like the college in <em>Perry, </em>Dr. Zimmerer\u2019s college had no explicit tenure system even for its senior members. She had taught in the college for six years and had been department chairman for five. She was the senior member of the Psychology Department. Although faculty contracts were issued for only one year at the time, the Faculty Handbook contained a section entitled \u201cTenure\u201d which stated that \u201cTenure is expected to be stable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The term \u201ctenure\u201d in the handbook must be given some content and meaning short of formalized tenure, which did not exist at the college. The Board attempts no explanation of what the term means, nor does it claim that the presence of the provision in the handbook is an accident. Rather it says that Dr. Zimmerer\u2019s and the District Judge should not have placed so much reliance on what the handbook said. Also, under an established procedure, if the college decided that a teacher\u2019s contract was not to be annually renewed the teacher was placed on probation. This, the president explained, \u201cis a way of telling them that unless the corrections were made that were thought to be necessary that at the end of the year the contract would not be renewed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Thus the facts reexamined with the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance support the existence of a protectible property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">This leaves the question of whether the relief granted by the District Court was correct. We think that it was.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-16\">In <em>Perry </em>the Supreme Court stated: Proof of such a property interest would not, of course, entitle him to reinstatement. But such proof would obligate college officials to grant a hearing at his request, where he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>be informed of the grounds for his nonretention and challenge their sufficiency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">408 U.S. at 603, 92 S.Ct. at 2700, 33 L.Ed.2d at 580-581. In the present ease the District Court, in its hearing, not only inquired into the issue of whether Dr. Zimmerer had a property interest but also went to the merits of the controversy between Dr. Zimmerer and the college and concluded that there were \u201cvalid non-discriminatory, constitutionally sufficient reasons for the Board\u2019s actions.\u201d Thus the court had gone past the point of remanding to the Board, as contemplated by <em>Perry, </em>to enable that body to inquire into the merits of the dispute. <em>See also </em>Ferguson v. Thomas, 430 F.2d 852 (CA5, 1970). The District Court recognized that remand to the Board would be useless because three years had elapsed since the original incident, because, as the court found, the Board\u2019s reasons for its actions were sufficient [which finding, of course, left little doubt what the result of a remand would be] and because the parties themselves recognized that their feelings were so deeply entrenched that remand was fruitless. Having vindicated Dr. Zimmerer\u2019s interest in having a full and fair hearing on the substantive merits of her discharge, as the Board should have done originally, and having found that the Board had valid reasons for discharging her, the Court was then faced with the question of the appropriate relief due Dr. Zimmerer for the delay in affording due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Dr. Zimmer insists she is entitled to reinstatement at this time and until the Board gives her a hearing complying with due process, and back pay from the time of refusal to renew her contract. The Board suggests that under <em>Perry </em>the District Court could grant neither reinstatement (which it did not do) nor back pay but could order only a remand to the Board with directions to conduct a hearing complying with due process. We think neither extreme is required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In deciding upon remedy, the District Court considered the scope of Dr. Zimmerer\u2019s original protectible interest. In effect it found that the \u201cconstructive tenure\u201d she had was for one-year\u2019s employment and that this was what she lost. This finding was supported by the existence of the procedure, described above, of putting an unsatisfactory teacher on probation for one year and then not renewing her contract for the succeeding year. An argument can be made that during a year of probation she might have rehabilitated the situation. But in view of the finding that the Board\u2019s reasons for its actions were valid, and the finding that the controversy was intractable and recognized by the parties to be such, we cannot say that the court was wrong in considering as a practical consequence that the most that Dr. Zimmerer lost was one year\u2019s pay. Under other circumstances different relief may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">We have considered the argument that independently of the foregoing Dr. Zimmerer is entitled to a hearing at this time for the purpose of \u201cclearing her name,\u201d because the Board\u2019s action is a deprivation of her liberty. Board of Regents v. Roth, supra; see also Moore v. Knowles, 482 F.2d 1069 [No. 71-3523, CA5, Aug. 2, 1973, opinion on rehearing]. The District Court correctly found that there had been no deprivation of liberty in the <em>Roth </em>ease sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-10\">. Including a reference to a tenured teacher. <em>Perry </em>makes clear that the protectible tenure interest of the teacher is not limited to an arrangement formally incorporated into a written contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-11\">. If the court, rather than itself deciding the merits of the dispute, had remanded to the Board for it to discharge that function, the Board, as the initial body to consider potential remedies, would have had the duty to fashion relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
