I would caution you that it is your right and your duty to exercise the same independence of judgment in weighing the Judge\u2019s comments on the evidence as you are entitled to exercise in weighing the testimony of the witnesses and the arguments of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-20\">\u201cYou will keep in mind that you are the exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses and of all questions of facts submitted to you. Such authority as the trial Judge has to express his personal thoughts on any of these matters is confined to the sole purpose of aiding you in arriving at a verdict and may not be used and is not used in this ease to impose his will upon you or to compel a verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">The jury found Davis guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-21\">The conviction was affirmed on appeal. People v. Davis, 1968, 260 Cal.App.2d 211, 67 Cal.Rptr. 35, cert. denied, 1968, 393 U.S. 890, 89 S.Ct. 210, 21 L.Ed.2d 169. Citing People v. Brock, 1967, 66 Cal.2d 645, 58 Cal.Rptr. 321, 426 P.2d 889, a decision of the California Supreme Court disapproving an almost identical instruction, the state appellate court held that the trial judge\u2019s comment on Davis\u2019 guilt was error under California law, but that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-22\">After unsuccessfully petitioning the state courts for a .writ of habeas corpus, Davis turned to the federal courts. In the federal habeas corpus proceedings, the district court held that \u201c[jjudicial comment to the jury, reflecting the court\u2019s view that the defendant was guilty, is prima facie an unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>tional deprivation of the due process right of fundamental fairness.\u201d We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">In Gonsior v. Craven, 9 Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 20, we dealt with an almost .identical instruction, given in a California criminal case. We declined to hold that the instruction deprived the defendant-petitioner of due process of law. In the present case, we ordered a hearing in banc to consider whether <em>Gonsior </em>was correctly decided, or should be overruled. We conclude that <em>Gonsior </em>was correctly decided, is dispositive of this case, and should not be overruled. We do not favor \u201cconstitutionalizing,\u201d and thus imposing on the states, the result reached in United States v. Murdock, 1933, 290 U.S. 389, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\"><em>Murdock </em>is the only Supreme Court decision brought to our attention that involved a comparable instruction to that given by the judge in Davis\u2019 case. Here is the instruction in <em>Murdock:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-6\"><em>\u201cSo </em>far as the facts concerned in this case, gentlemen of the jury, I want to instruct you that whatever the Court may say as to the facts, is only the Court\u2019s view. You are at liberty to entirely disregard it. The Court feels from the evidence in this case that the Government has sustained the burden cast upon it by the law and has proved that this defendant is guilty in manner and form as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (290 U.S. at 393, 54 S.Ct. at 225)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">And here is the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-8\">\u201cIn the circumstances we think the trial judge erred in stating the opinion that the respondent was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A federal judge may analyze the evidence, comment upon it, and express his views with regard to the testimony of witnesses. He may advise the jury in respect of the facts, but the decision of issues of fact must be fairly left to the jury, Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 288, [50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854]; Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, [53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321], <em>Although the power of the judge to express an opinion as to the guilt of the defendant exists, it should be exercised cautiously and only in exceptional cases. </em>Such an expression of opinion was held not to warrant a reversal where upon the undisputed and admitted facts the defendant\u2019s voluntary conduct amounted to the commission of the crime defined by the statute. Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U.S. 135, [41 S.Ct. 53, 65 L.Ed. 185]. The present, however, is not such a case, unless the word \u2018willfully,\u2019 used in the sections upon which the indictment was founded, means no more than voluntarily.\u201d (290 U.S. at 394, 54 S.Ct. at 225 emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahv\">The Court then proceeded to hold that actual wrongful intent was an element of the crime, that as to this the evidence was in conflict, and that therefore there was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">The emphasized language and the citation,, without disapproval, of Horning v. District of Columbia, both indicate that, in exceptional cases, an instruction such as was given in Davis\u2019 case is not error at all. <em>A fortiori, </em>it is not an error of constitutional dimension under the Constitution o,f the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">We know of no decision of the Supreme Court since <em>Murdock </em>that elevates the <em>Murdock </em>rule to constitutional status. Certainly Parker v. Gladden, 1966, 385 U.S. 363, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420, does not. That case involved unauthorized tampering with the jury by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>bailiff, unknown to the court or the parties, which is quite different from what happened in <em>Murdock </em>and in Davis\u2019 case. In <em>Parker </em>there was no opportunity for the court to correct it. Moreover, as the Court pointed out in <em>Parker </em>(p. 364, 87 S.Ct. 468), the bailiff\u2019s statement amounted to testimony received by the jury, not in open court, not subject to confrontation or cross-examination or any other safeguards of a trial. Contrast that situation with what was done by the judge here. He expressed his opinion of the evidence, in open court, and accompanied it with a clear and direct statement that it was only an opinion and did not bind the jury and that the jury was free to disregard it and find the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">Nor can we read <em>Parker </em>as establishing the proposition that any error which can be said to go \u201cto the fundamental process of assessing and evaluating evidence\u201d is a violation of due process. This is a jump that we cannot make. For obvious reasons, it is not the job of a bailiff to provide the jury with evidence, or to decide what evidence a jury may or may not hear, or to aid them in evaluating the evidence. However, the latter is precisely a role of the trial judge; indeed, the Supreme Court has long held that this judicial function is part of the fundamental nature of a trial by jury as guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">In <em>Murdock, </em>the Court cites Patton v. United States, 1930, 281 U.S. 276, 288, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854. In <em>Patton, </em>at the cited page 288, 50 S.Ct. page 254, the Court defines a trial by jury as in-eluding three elements, the second of which is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-11\">\u201c(2) that the trial should be in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge having power to instruct them as to the law <em>and advise them in respect of the facts;\u201d </em>(emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">The Court in <em>Murdock </em>also cites Querica v. United States, 1933, 289 U.S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321. In that case, at p. 469, 53 S.Ct. at p. 699, the Court quotes Sir Matthew Hale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-13\">\u201c \u2018Herein he [the judge] is able, in matters of law emerging upon the evidence, to direct them [the jury]; and also, in matters of fact to give them a great light and assistance by his weighing the evidence before them, and observing where the question and knot of the business lies, and by showing them his opinion even in matters of fact; which is a great advantage and light to laymen.\u2019 Hale, History of the Common Law, 291, 292. Under the Federal Constitution the essential prerogatives of the trial judge as they were secured by the rules of the common law are maintained in the federal courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">The trial judge in Davis\u2019 case did just what Hale and the Supreme Court say that he may do. It would be incongruous to hold that error in performing this valuable function violates the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-15\">This is not to say that judicial mistakes by state judges can never rise to' the level of federal constitutional error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>That such instances can occur is illustrated by Braley v. Gladden, 9 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 858, but that case is no more in point here than Parker v. Gladden, <em>supra, Braley </em>arose from an Oregon prosecution for murder. Under Oregon law, to convict of murder in the first degree, a unanimous verdict was required. For lesser included offenses, a 10 to 2 verdict sufficed. The judge so informed the jury. To acquit a 10 to 2 verdict also sufficed. The judge, however, did not tell the jury that. Moreover, while the jury received forms for guilty verdicts, it received none for acquittal. This was done in the context of an instruction as to the sufficiency of a 10 to 2 verdict of conviction, reading: \u201cJust one verdict which requires your verdict to be unanimous out of all the verdicts I have submitted to you.\u201d (403 F.2d at 859-860.) We held that this performance deprived Braley of due process. One of the elements of due process in the context of a jury trial is a knowledge by the jury that it may acquit, and of how it may acquit. In <em>Braley, </em>we said that what happened \u201cconstituted, <em>in effect, </em>a severely adverse comment by the trial judge, an impermissibly grave insinuation of judicial attitude toward the issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Read in context, this is hardly a holding that <em>any </em>comment indicating a state judge\u2019s attitude toward the issue of guilt or innocence violates the Federal Constitution. In <em>Braley </em>the trial judge did nothing to counteract the \u201cinsinuation of judicial attitude\u201d that we found in what happened. In <em>Davis, </em>on the other hand, after making his comment, the trial judge made it clear to the jury that it was only a comment,</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">that it was up to the jury to come to its own conclusion, and that the jury was entirely at liberty to disregard the comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">United States ex rel. De Lucia v. McMann, 2 Cir., 1967, 373 F.2d 759, is likewise not in point. It involved the taking of an unauthorized view of the scene of the crimes by some members of the jury. As in <em>Parker, supra, </em>this was the reception of evidence by jurors ex parte and without any of the safeguards of a trial. The case is no more in point than is <em>Parker, </em>on which it expressly relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">We find no federal constitutional error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">Our holding makes it unnecessary to consider the state\u2019s further argument that the error, if of constitutional dimension, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">. There are several Circuit Court decisions that follow Murdoch; e.g., United Stales v. Woods, 2 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 334; United States v. England, 7 Cir., 1965, 347 F.2d 425; McBride v. United States, 10 Cir., 1963, 314 F.2d 75. Each held it to be error to give a comparable instruction; none purports to lay down a rule of constitutional law. Compare: United States v. Jacobo-Gil, 9 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 1213, 1216; United States v. Carlos, 9 Cir., 1973, 478 F.2d 377 in which we have held that certain comments are erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">. The proposed new constitutional rule cannot rationally be limited to cases such as this one; its logical consequence is a complete re-examination and limiting of the trial judge\u2019s role as advisor to the jury. For example, can it be seriously contended that a judicial comment to the effect that a defendant\u2019s credibility should be questioned because of his personal stake in the case does not \u201cgo to the fundamental process of assessing and evaluating evidence,\u201d or that it may not be the equivalent of a comment on the \u201cultimate question\u201d in certain cases? But such comments have regularly been approved by this Court. <em>E.g. </em>United States v. JacoboGil, 9 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 1213; United States v. Eskridge, 9 Cir., 1972, 456 F.2d 1202, 1205-1206; Louie v. United States, 9 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 1398, 1402; Papadakis v. United States, 9 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 945, 954. In short, it is by no means clear that <em>Gonsior </em>will be the only casualty if we were to overrule it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1205-17\">. Chambers v. Mississippi, 1973, 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, and Brooks v. Tennessee, 1972, 406 U.S. 605, 92 S.Ct. 1891, 32 L.Ed.2d 358, do illustrate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>fact that from time to time the Supreme Court \u201cconstitutionalizes\u201d a rule that some might think deals only with error rather than with violation of the constitution. Neither case, however, even remotely resembles the <em>Davis </em>case. In <em>Chambers </em>the court held that a state rule of evidence, as applied in that case improperly prevented a defendant who was charged with murder from showing that another man had confessed to the murder under circumstances which appeared to the Court to establish the credibility of the confession. In <em>Brooks </em>the trial court had applied a Tennessee rule under which a defendant, if he desired to take the witness stand, had to do so before any of his own witnesses could testify. The court held that this violated his fifth amendment privileges against self-incrimination. The difference between these two cases and the <em>Davis </em>case is obvious.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1206-10\">GOODWIN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ALL\">with whom Judges Merrill, Browning, Ely and Hufstedler concur (dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-11\">While I agree that it is unwise unnecessarily to give constitutional status to rules of procedure which have commended themelves to one or more federal courts, I believe the judge\u2019s comment in this case was at least as much of a threat to the fairness of the trial as were the judicial errors and omissions which were found to be constitutionally fatal in such cases as Parker v.
