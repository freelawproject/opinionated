Defendant Westland Development Co., Inc., NSL, a New Mexico corporation (Westland), successor in interest to the Town of Atrisco, answered and counterclaimed, praying cancellation of appellant\u2019s deed. Cross motions for summary judgment were filed and argued, the court finding appellant\u2019s motion without merit, appellee\u2019s motion well taken, and holding appellant\u2019s deed to be null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">The land in question was originally a part of the Atrisco Land Grant. This property has been involved in extensive litigation. Armijo et al. v. Town of Atrisco, 56 N.M. 2, 239 P.2d 535 (1952); Armijo et al. v. Town of Atrisco, 62 N.M. 440, 312 P.2d 91 (1957). The particular phase of the matter now before us involves a plan for distribution of 10,000 acres of the land of the grant. The approval of the plan by the District Court for the County of Bernalillo in March of 1953 was appealed and in the Supreme Court reversed, Armijo v. Town of Atrisco, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-23\">The Supreme Court, after reviewing previous litigation as well as the case before it held that the means for distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>bution of the lands approved by the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201cnot only amount to a violation of the statute law of this state prohibiting lotteries . . . but as well amount to a dissipation of the assets of the corporation, contrary to law . In fine the plan of disposition proposed discloses a pronounced absence of primary and elemental concepts of due process and equal protection of the laws, in violation of constitutional guarantees existing in favor of owners of the beneficial interest in the common lands of the Grant.\u201d 312 P. 2d at 101.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The Court thereupon held that \u201cthe judgment [below] will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Upon remand the state court vacated all previous orders respecting the distribution of the lands involved, held that the described \u201cseventy deeds\u201d (among them the appellant\u2019s) were \u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d and stated that \u201cif necessary\u201d the Board of Trustees of the Town of Atrisco was to institute appropriate proceedings to cancel the deeds. We do not overlook the fact that no appeal was taken from the entry of this judgment, dated August 19, 1957, but in view of the land titles involved will rule on the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Some fifteen years later, on July 18, 1972, Cecilia Gabaldon whose deed to the land in question had been held void in the order of August 19, 1957, filed in the federal court a bill to quiet title, complaining that she held a deed to the property involved and that appellee herein made a claim thereto. It was the appellee\u2019s answer that her deed was void, citing the state court proceedings outlined above, and counterclaiming for cancellation of her deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">Appellant asserts that the statute of limitations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has run on West-land\u2019s counterclaim for the cancellation of her deed, citing Pugh v. Heating &amp; Plumbing Finance Corporation, 49 N.M. 234, 161 P.2d 714 (1945), a case involving the enforcement of a judgment lien. But here Westland\u2019s cause of action is not an action on a judgment, being, rather, an action to cancel a void deed. This deed was void from the date of its execution, not merely from the date of the <em>Armijo </em>judgment, and, as such, can furnish no basis for a favorable decree in a quiet title suit, wherein appellant must prevail, if at all, on the strength of her own title. Komadina v. Edmonson, 81 N.M. 467, 468 P.2d 632 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">We are not ruling upon which of the above statutes is applicable, if, indeed, either or any other <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applies. Here the appellee sets up the invalidity of appellant\u2019s deed as a defense to her bill to quiet title. Under N.M.S.A. \u00a7 23-1-15 (1953), captioned \u201cSet-offs or counterclaims not barred . . . \u201d, a cause of action that, if asserted offensively, would be barred by limitations, may nevertheless be raised as a defense, if \u201cthe same was not barred at the time the cause of action sued for accrued or originated.\u201d Appellant\u2019s cause of action accrued either in 1955 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or 1956 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at neither of which times would Westland\u2019s action to cancel the deed have been barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Appellee is thus not barred by limitations from obtaining the relief sought and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">But the principal thrust of appellant\u2019s argument, both in the court below and here is that the State district court for Bernalillo County, in holding appellant\u2019s' deed (and others) void, is that the court went beyond the mandate' issued it. On this point Judge Bratton, below, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cThe District Court\u2019s assessment of the import of the mandate to it from the Supreme Court was correct. The illegality of the distribution plan, as violative of statutes prohibiting lotteries, as well as the unlawful dissipation of the assets of a corporation, made it beyond the power of the District Court to approve and the Supreme Court held that Order of Approval to be void. Consequently all actions pursuant thereto, including the issuance of deeds thereunder, were void and of no effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cSince plaintiff\u2019s claims to the land arise only under her deed issued pursuant to the plan, and it is void, it necessarily follows that she may not, as a matter of law, prevail on the merits in this action. Defendant is entitled to have the cloud upon its title removed by cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s void deed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> There is little one can add to the cogency of the ruling so made. The mandate was for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views of the Supreme Court. Such \u201cfurther proceedings\u201d were, of course, to implement at the local level the ruling of the higher court and were manifestly consistent therewith. Moreover, we accept the interpretation of the New Mexico law by the Federal District Court in the State that the deed was absolutely void since we are not convinced that it is clearly erroneous. Teague v. Grand River Dam Authority, 425 F.2d 130 (10th Cir. 1970); Parsons v. Amerada Hess Corp., 422 F.2d 610 (10th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">We find no error. Under the view we have taken of the case we find no need to explore the legal effect of the series of state court proceedings taken subsequent to the <em>Armijo </em>ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">.
