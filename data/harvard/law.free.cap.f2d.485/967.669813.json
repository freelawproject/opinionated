These contracts, all negotiated, were filed with the Commission as rate schedules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They contain various and differing terms and conditions of service, and called for deliveries at a fixed price for the duration of the contract. The contracts had various termination dates, ranging from January 3, 1972, to April 17, 1976.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">On November 1, 1971, Alabama Power .tendered for filing under \u00a7 205(d) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(d), a new tariff schedule applicable to all \u201celectric service provided by Alabama Power Company to municipal distribution systems . . . and rural distribution cooperative . . . . \u201d (R. at 915). In addition to a substantial rate increase over the contract levels, the new tariff embodied a variety of terms and conditions \u2014 including automatic tax and fuel cost adjustment provisions \u2014 that differed significantly from those of the negotiated contracts. Most important, it placed all wholesale sales on a uniform basis, at a single rate and under identical conditions of service. In place of the individual contracts, all sales were to be made pursuant to service agreements (short form contracts) that incorporated by reference the terms and conditions of the new tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-19\">Under the terms of the filing, Alabama Power proposed that the new tariff schedule \u201cbecame effective January 3, 1972, or the earliest date thereafter <em>in accordance with existing contracts </em>with [the affected] customers.\u201d (R. at 916, emphasis supplied). The tariff was to be applied to all new service contracted for after the proposed effective date. As to service under existing contracts, however, the new tariff was to become applicable only \u201cas of the date of contractual termination [of service] at [each existing] delivery point.\u201d (R. at 917). Hence once outstanding agreements expired, all future service would be rendered under the terms of the proposed tariff. The conversion of municipal and distribution cooperative sales from an individual basis to a single standardized tariff, would become complete in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-20\">On November 15, 1971, the FPC issued a Notice of Proposed Changes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Rates and Charges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioners filed timely intervention petitions, protests, and motions to reject the Alabama Power filing, objecting that the tendered filing: (1) violated \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act; (2) was premature and in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 35.3 and 35.13 of the FPC\u2019s Regulations; and (3) violated the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">By order issued December 30, 1971,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Power Commission denied Petitioners\u2019 motions to reject the rate filing, granted the petitions to intervene, scheduled hearings to determine whether the proposed rate was just and reasonable, and suspended the effective date of the rate schedule until February 2, 1972.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Applications for reconsideration were denied on February 11, 1972.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">A. <em>Matters Relating to Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">I. <em>Issues Under Economic Stabilization Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Petitioners raise various contentions that the proposed rate increase was so grossly excessive, and the automatic adjustment provisions so patently contrary to the intent of the Stabilization Act, that the Commission should treat the entire filing as a substantive nullity,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that the FPC\u2019s refusal to suspend the rate schedule for five months violated the Price Commission\u2019s regulations, \u00a7 300.16(i)(3).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These are issues arising under the Economic Stabilization Act, and \u2014 to the extent these are currently viable \u2014 they are cognizable in the district courts (and, on appeal, the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals) and not before this court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Municipal Intervenors Group v. FPC, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 373, 473 F.2d 84 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-18\">2. <em>Issues Under Federal Power Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"A91\">Petitioners\u2019 other contentions, however, arise not under the Economic Stabilization Act but wholly under the Federal Power Act and FPC regulations promulgated thereunder. As to these matters, section 313 of the Federal Power Act mandates: Upon filing of the administrative record, in a pertinent court of appeals, it has exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto affirm, modify, or set aside\u201d the Commission\u2019s order on such grounds. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825Z(b); City of Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, 357 U.S. 320, 335-341, 78 S.Ct. 1209, 2 L.Ed.2d 345 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-19\">In <em>Municipal Intervenors Group </em>we stated: \u201cThe circumstance that utilities are subject to two types of regulatory control raises the possibility of two types of judicial review.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While both aspects of the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction are reflected in the order sought to be reviewed, the issues on appeal arising under the Federal Power Act may be cleanly severed from those that require consideration of the Eeo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>nomic Stabilization Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We believe that an entirely harmonious accommodation of the two pertinent Congressional enactments can be achieved by dual review of the Commission\u2019s order in both this court and the District Court, each tribunal acting within the sphere of its statutorily defined exclusive jurisdiction. Finding that the exercise of our jurisdiction under section 313 would not constitute an embarrassment to the separate jurisdiction of the District Court of the Economic Stabilization Act, we consider the issues properly cognizable under section 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">B. <em>Propriety of the Filing Under Section 205(d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Petitioners first contend that Alabama Power\u2019s filing represents a unilateral attempt to supplant its contractual service obligations and to impose a rate increase not consented to by its customers and in contravention of its agreements with them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Were this the case, the filing could not be accepted under section 205(d),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Alabama Power\u2019s only recourse would be to request that the FPC institute proceedings under section 206(a) of the Act,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to show that the existing contract rate was so unremunerative as to be affirmatively unlawful. FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348, 76 S.Ct. 368, 100 L.Ed. 388 (1956). <em>See </em>United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Co., 350 U.S. 332, 76 S.Ct. 373, 100 L.Ed. 373 (1956) (Natural Gas Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">However, we agree with the FPC\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Sierra </em>and <em>Mobile </em>precedents are inapplicable to the instant case. <em>Sierra </em>held that section 205(d) did not permit a supplier to depart from a contract obligation to deliver power at a firm price, absent a contractual novation or an exercise of the Commission\u2019s special powers under section 206(a) \u201cto prescribe a change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>contract rates whenever it determines such rates to be unlawful.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">In the present case, there is no attempt by Alabama Power to avoid its contract obligations, or to displace or supersede the established rates mid-way during the contracts. Alabama Power\u2019s tendered rate schedule was expressly made subject to all outstanding contracts; and the operative date of the rate increases and tariff changes embodied therein is in each instance deferred to the expiration of the existing service contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Petitioners also invoke Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, 364 U.S. 137, 80 S.Ct. 1392, 4 L.Ed.2d 1623 (1960). In <em>Sunray, </em>the Supreme Court stressed the statutory requirement of the Natural Gas Act that, in the absence of abandonment proceedings under section 7(b), a natural gas company holding a certificate of public interest and convenience must continue to provide service to its customers, even though its contractual obligations have terminated.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Referring to this post-contractual period, the Court observed, 364 U.S. at 155, 80 S.Ct. at 1403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-6\">The obligation that [the supplier] will be under after the contract term will not be one imposed by the contract but by the Act. [The supplier] will be free then, as it was not free during the contract term under the contract here in question, to make rate changes under \u00a7 4 [the Natural Gas Act counterpart to \u00a7 205 of the Power Act] without [the purchaser\u2019s] consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APG\">Petitioners read this language to imply that, during the term of the contract, the supplier is wholly disabled from tendering any tariff under section 205, even though the filing will operatively affect rates only during the post-contractual period. This construction, we feel, distorts the Court\u2019s intention, and attempts to draw from its language implications as to an issue neither before the Court nor addressed by it. <em>Sunray </em>speaks to the type of filing appropriate to initiate rate changes that are to take effect during the post-contractual period, and intimates no view as to exactly when such a prospective filing may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">We agree with the FPC\u2019s conclusion that the Federal Power Act does not present any impediment to Alabama Power\u2019s filing under section 205(d) of a tariff operative to affect rates for pertinent service only subsequent to expiration of existing service contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">C. <em>Conformity to FPC Regulations </em>Section 35.3(a) of the Commission\u2019s Regulations, 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.3(a), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-12\">All rate schedules or any part thereof shall be tendered for filing with the Commission and posted not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days prior to . the date on which the filing party proposes to make any change in electric service and/or rate, charge, classification, practice, rule, regulation or contract effective as a change in rate schedule, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, or unless a different period of time is permitted by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">Subsection (b), 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.3(b), goes on to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-15\">Rate schedules predicated on the construction of new facilities may be tendered for filing and posted no more than 90 days prior to the date set by the parties for the contract to go into effect. The Commission, upon request and for good cause shown, may permit a rate schedule or part thereof to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>tendered for filing and posted more than 90 days before it is to become effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">Petitioners, reading \u00a7 35.3(a) in conjunction with the last sentence of \u00a7'35.-3(b), argue that Alabama Power\u2019s filing, which includes changes that would not take effect until 1976, could not be accepted in the absence of special findings by the FPC of good cause requiring waiver of the \u201c30-90 day\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Subsection (b), which contains an express \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement, is addressed to the particularized context of a rate schedule change \u201cpredicated on the construction of new facilities.\u201d That is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Section 35.3(a) permits an exception to the 30-90 rule not merely in cases covered by \u00a7 35.3(b), but whenever \u201ca different period of time is permitted by the Commission.\u201d This reserves to the FPC discretion to accept non-construction-related filing more than 90 days in advance of their effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">Whether or not the FPC\u2019s discretion has been soundly exercised will, of course, depend on the circumstances of the case as reviewed by the Commission. But we see no reason why a flexible housekeeping measure, designed for the agency\u2019s efficiency in internal management, should be cast into a rigid procedural formalism diverting focus from the real issues presented in the filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">In the matter before us, the basis for relaxing the 90 day rule suffices to justify the FPC\u2019s action. Were the 90 day rule applied with full rigor to Alabama Power\u2019s 46 contracts with Petitioners, the result would be a plethora of individual filings stretching from 1971 through 1976, each with individual supporting documentation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Differences in timing and the parties would complicate consolidation of proceedings, even though, in the Commission\u2019s view, the dominant issue was common to all. Such redundancy is wasteful not only of the time and resources of FPC members and staff,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but also of the resources of the parties \u2014 costs that must in the last analysis be borne by the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">The single, consolidated proceeding envisioned in Alabama Power\u2019s filing mitigates these difficulties. The FPC\u2019s rules give ample latitude for the agency to develop and implement innovative methods for the effective dispatch of its functions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We find no abuse of the Commission\u2019s discretion in accepting the filing for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">D. <em>The Matter of Prematurity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">Having held that the FPC\u2019s filing rules interpose no procedural obstacle to the consideration of the tendered filing, we next consider whether its action on the filing was proper. Administrative procedures fail of their fundamental purpose if the goal of expedition is bought at the sacrifice of reasoned decision-making and substantial fairness to the parties concerned. In this context, we consider Petitioners\u2019 claim that a present determination of reasonableness- \u2014 based on a 1970 test year (R. at 962, 1783, 1919) \u2014 provides no assurance that the rate so approved will be equally reasonable when applied to customers with late-expiring contracts, say in 1976. In general, rate regulation determinations are based on projections from historical experience to a future effective period, and remain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>effect indefinitely, until either the supplier seeks to alter them or the Commission finds them contrary to law under \u00a7 206(a). But the question is whether it is reasonable to proceed at the outset by using a recent period to chart schedules to become effective six years hence, and whether the legislative scheme does not contemplate that the proponent of any rate must shoulder a realistic burden of demonstrating its lawfulness, not in some theoretical sense but as it practically affects the parties at the time it is sought to be imposed. Finally, we approach the issue cognizant that, once a tariff has passed the Commission\u2019s scrutiny under \u00a7 205 of the Act and is made applicable to a particular customer, the likelihood of obtaining a rate reduction or alteration in terms or conditions of service by a proceeding under \u00a7 206(a) is indeed remote. Not only would the customer bear the heavy burden of showing the tariff had become unlawful in the period since its approval, but the cost and uncertainty of such proceedings make recourse to them problematical.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Bearing in mind the novelty of the question and the fact that none of the Commission\u2019s rules appear to offer firm guidance, we invited the parties to address this larger question of prematurity during oral argument and to file post-argument submissions detailing the steps that must be taken to convert to tariff-based service as each customer\u2019s contract expires. From the memoranda, it appears that: \u201cWhen a customer upon expiration of a fixed rate contract is converted to a filed tariff, a service agreement and amended list of purchasers is [sic] to be filed with the Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Alabama Power has further assured the court that it intends to file such documentation with the FPC as each of its individual service contracts with Petitioners expires.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-14\">Both the index of purchasers and the service agreement are part of the tariff itself.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Additionally, they plainly constitute \u201crate schedules,\u201d a term encompassing \u201call classifications, rules, regulations or contracts which in any manner affect or relate to service, rates, and charges,\u201d as defined in the Commission\u2019s Regulations, 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.2(b)(3). In view of \u00a7 205(e) of the Act, we think it inescapable that the filing of \u201cany such new [rate] schedule\u201d gives the Commission authority to inquire into the lawfulness of the rate schedule, to suspend its effectiveness pending such investigation, and, in the case of rate increases, to order the supplier to establish a refund account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-16\">The effect of filing \u2014 at the time of conversion from contractual to tariff schedule service \u2014 of the necessary amendments to Alabama Power\u2019s index of purchasers and the new service agreements will be to afford each affected customer a renewed opportunity to seek FPC review under \u00a7 205(e), as contemplated in the Act. In such event, the Commission need not conduct a full-scale proceeding de novo. The FPC could refer back to the proceedings on Alabama Power\u2019s general tariff instituted pursuant to the Commission\u2019s order of December 30, 1971, and to its determinations therein. Nevertheless, opportunity must be given the customers having late-expiring contracts to call on the utility to show that the assumptions underlying the FPC\u2019s earlier determination of the tariff\u2019s lawfulness have been validated by experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-17\"> The details of procedural mechanics are best left to the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>in the first instance. In broad outline, however, it appears that FPC review of the Alabama Power filing will proceed as follows: The \u00a7 205(e) proceedings that began in early 1972 will include all of Alabama Power\u2019s wholesale municipal customers. As to those among the Petitioners whose contracts have already expired, whatever finding the Commission makes as to the lawfulness of the tariff will, of course, be immediately binding. As to those whose contracts remain in effect, such determination will be prospective in nature, and the contract rates and service conditions will remain in effect. When each of these latter contracts expires, Alabama Power will file with the Commission the documentation necessary to bring the affected customer within the terms of,the general tariff. At this time, if the Commission has reason to believe that the assumptions underlying its earlier determination are not operative \u2014 possibly due to a change in conditions, or more likely a projection of conditions that did not materialize \u2014 the Commission may order the \u00a7 205(e) proceedings to be reopened; require from Alabama Power whatever additional data is necessary to demonstrate the continuing validity of the tariff rate; if necessary suspend extension of the rate schedule to additional customers ; and take whatever further steps may be necessary to assure that the rates and conditions of service remain lawful.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">The procedures outlined above do no more than to require continuing agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>supervision of the tariff as its scope is enlarged to include all of Alabama Power\u2019s wholesale municipal customers, thus assuring that the regulatory premises upon which approval was based retain their validity as the tariff is applied in practice. They permit maximum benefit to be drawn from the initial, consolidated proceeding. And they represent, in our view, the minimum necessary to assure protection of the statutory rights of those customers with late-expiring contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Subject to these procedures, all of which arise in direct consequence of the sequence of filings detailed in the Commission\u2019s memoranda, we find no error in the FPC\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions to reject the filing. The Commission\u2019s order to this effect is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">.

Alabama Power contends that its contracts with the City of Opelika, the Utilities Board of the City of Foley, and the City of Evergreen give it the right to effect unilateral rate increases in the context of the instant proceedings. The Commission did not address itself to these clauses, or whether the pertinent conditions have been satisfied. These questions are within the Commission\u2019s primary jurisdiction and cannot properly be considered by this court in the absence of prior FPC consideration. <em>See </em>Portsmouth Gas Co. v. FPC, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 99, 247 F.2d 90 (1957). For purposes of this review proceeding, we treat these three contracts as firm price obligations that cannot be altered without mutual consent of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">. Section 205(d), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(d), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Unless the Commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made by any public utility in any such rate, charge, classification, or service, or in any rule, regulation, or contract relating thereto, except after thirty days\u2019 notice to the Commission and to the public. Such notice shall be given by filing with the Commission and keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating plainly the change or changes to be made in the schedule or schedules then in force and the time when the change or changes will go into effect. The Commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect without requiring the thirty days\u2019 notice herein provided for by an order specifying the changes so to be made and the time when they shall take effect and the manner in which they shall be filed and published.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">.

The Federal Power Act contains no counterpart to sections 7 (b) and 7 (c) of the Natural Gas Act. We need not consider what obligation the Federal Power Act may impose upon a supplier of electrie power to continue making interstate wholesale sales after termination of its individual contracts. <em>Cf. </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a (b). Certainly such a supplier of electric power is not subject to constraints greater than those applied to natural gas suppliers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">.

The continuing availability of \u00a7 205(e) review when transition from contractual to tariff-based service becomes effective disposes of Petitioners\u2019 two remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Rule 35.13 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations contemplates the filing of various financial and operating data including, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201ca statement comparing sales and services and revenues therefrom . . . under both the rate schedule proposed to be superseded or supplemented and the proposed changed rate schedule, each applied to the transactions for the 12 months immediately preceding and to the 12 months immediately succeeding the date on which the new rate schedule is to become effective,\u201d and \u201can analysis of system costs for a test period of twelve consecutive months . . . and an allocation of such costs to the services rendered.\u201d (18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 35.13(b)(1), (4) (iii)). The Rule goes on expressly to provide, 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.13(b) (4) (iii):</p>\n<p id=\"AEp\">Pursuant to application of the filing public utility made at the time of filing of a rate schedule, the Secretary [of the FPC] may allow deviations from the data herein required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">Moreover, these, as well as other filing requirements (see note 23, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text) are subject to :</p>\n<p id=\"AaQ\">the general principle that \u201c[i]t is always within the discretion of a court or an administrative agency to relax or modify its procedural rules adopted from the orderly transaction of business before it when in a given case the ends of justice require it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Serv., 397 U.S. 532, 539, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 25 L.Ed.2d 547 (1970), quoting N.L.R.B. v. Monsanto Cliem. Co., 205 F.2d 763, 764 (8th Cir., 1953). It would be premature for us presently to consider the extent to which either this express exception or the agency\u2019s inherent discretion may apply to the documentary support required by Rule 35.13(b). The Commission plainly has ample authority to require sufficient updated financial data to permit an informed judgment as to whether the \u00a7 205(e) proceedings should be reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">Likewise, the FPC\u2019s continuing supervisory role includes authority to suspend implementation of future conversions (and the service agreements by which these are to be effected) for as long as five months to permit review, in accordance with \u00a7 205(e). Whether or not such suspensions will be necessary is a matter to be determined in light of the conditions prevailing at the time and, in any event, is a question that lies within the discretion of the Commission. Municipal Light Boards v. FPC, <em>supra, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. at 302-305, 450 F.2d at 1349-1352. Certainly there was no abuse of that discretion when the FPC rejected Petitioners\u2019 request that a prospective order be entered automatically suspending the effectiveness of each future conversion. (Our remarks here are addressed solely to the requirements of the Federal Power Act and import no view as to what the Economic Stabilization Act or the Price Commission\u2019s regulations may require.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
