On February 18, 1972, the three girls were accompanied to the principal\u2019s office by Mrs. Curtis Powell, a home economics teacher, where they volunteered to Mr. Waller that they had \u201cspiked\u201d the punch at a recent extracurricular home economics class function. They related to him, through Mrs. Powell that on the day of the spiking incident, someone (it is not clear who) suggested that the punch be spiked. The three girls obtained permission to leave the campus and traveled to a tavern in Oklahoma where Jo Wall purchased two 12-ounce bottles of a flavored malt beverage, \u201cRight Time.\u201d The three students then purchased six 10-ounce containers of a soft drink and combined the total eighty-four ounces of liquid in a milk carton, and returned with the mixture to school. To the liquid was then added enough water to total one and one-half gallons of punch, which was served at the gathering.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>A disciplinary regulation of the Mena Special School District provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">\u201c3. Suspension</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">-\u00bb * * -x- -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cb. Valid cause for suspension from school on first offense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cPupils found to be guilty of any of the following shall be suspended from school on the first offense for the balance of the semester and such suspension will be noted on the permanent record of the student along with reason for suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">* * * * -x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201c(4) The use of intoxicating beverages or possession of same or at a school sponsored activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Pursuant to this regulation, Principal Waller suspended the three girls from classes and extracurricular activity for one week, and told them that ultimate disposition would be in the hands of the School Board. He added, however, that he and Mrs. Powell would intercede for them and ask for leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Without adequate notice to the students and with no notice to their parents, a special meeting of the School Board was held the night of February 18 to consider the matter. The only people in attendance were the members of the Board, Mr. Inlow, Mr. Waller and Mrs. Powell. Mrs. Powell relayed the girls\u2019 statements to the Board and she, along with Mr. Waller, recommended leniency. Shortly after these recommendations were made, a telephone call was received by Mr. Inlow. The caller was Mrs. Powell\u2019s husband, also a teacher at the school. He informed Mr. Inlow that he (Powell) had been told that Jo Wall had been involved in an altercation with another student after a basketball game that evening. Mr. Inlow then informed the Board of the substance of his conversation with Powell, leaving out the name of the student involved. With this, Mrs. Powell and Principal Waller withdrew their recommendations and \u201cwashed their hands\u201d of the matter. The Board voted to suspend all three students for the balance of the semester.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-16\">The School Board considered the matter for a second time on March 2, 1972. Present at this meeting were the members of the Board, Mr. Inlow, the appellants, their parents and counsel for the appellants and appellees. Neither Mr. Waller nor Mrs. Powell, the only two who had testified at the February 18 meeting, was present, although they were in their respective offices in the building during this time. The Board presented a written statement, which it described as a statement of facts found by it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The students related their story to the Board and offered their apologies. The Board voted to uphold the suspension, and the hearing ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-17\">Thereafter, two of the students\u2014 Strickland and Crain \u2014 commenced an action in United States District Court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. They alleged that they had been deprived of the right to attend school without benefit of due process. They asked that they be reinstated, that the defendants be enjoined from imposing sanctions, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>rule with respect to intoxicants be declared invalid and void. After an evidentiary hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the District Court urged the appellees to reinstate the students, but refused to order the Board to take such action, apparently on the grounds that the students had not made an adequate showing of irreparable injury and had failed to convince the court that they were likely to prevail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The students subsequently amended their complaint, adding a prayer for damages. The matter was then tried to a jury. The defendants moved for a directed verdict, apparently at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. This motion was denied. After the jury failed to reach a verdict, the court declared a mistrial. The court subsequently granted the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment in accordance with their motions for a directed verdict and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The students contend on appeal that the trial court erred: in denying them equitable relief; in failing to declare the rule with respect to the possession or use of intoxicating beverages invalid; in erroneously instructing the jury with respect to good faith as a defense; and in refusing to grant the students a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The law with respect to the rights of students is still developing. We think it is clear, however, that the following general principles are reasonably well established. The responsibility for public education is primarily the concern of the states. The exercise of this responsibility, however, must be consistent with federal constitutional requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> School boards have the right to adopt reasonable rules and regulations governing the conduct of high school students<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and regulations proscribing the possession or consumption of intoxicating beverages by students at school functions are reasonable. Students cannot, however, be given lengthy suspensions for violating valid rules without being accorded substantive and procedural due process. If they are given such a suspension without the benefit of due process, they may bring a \u00a7 1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the school district, the school board and those administrators involved in the decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They may also bring an action for damages against the individual members of the board and the administrators of the school system who participated in the decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Good faith is a defense in damage actions, but not in actions for equitable relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With these general principles in mind, we turn to the issues raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">We believe that the regulation which prohibits the possession or consumption of intoxicants by Mena High School students at school or at a school function is reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>We hold that the suspensions for the balance of the semester imposed by the Board were severe enough to require that due process be afforded the affected students. They resulted in the girls effectively losing nearly a full year\u2019s credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We think it clear that the students were denied procedural due process at the February 18 meeting of the Board. Their parents were not notified of the meeting, and were not given an opportunity to appear at it. We recognize that the March 2 meeting may have cured the procedural defects because it was held promptly after the suspension, and because the students and their parents were given notice of the time and place of the meeting and were given an opportunity to present evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But we need not decide whether, in fact, the meeting did so because the students were denied substantive due process at both meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">To justify the suspension, it was necessary for the Board to establish that the students possessed or used an \u201cintoxicating\u201d beverage at a school-sponsored activity. No evidence was presented at either meeting to establish the alcoholic content of the liquid brought to the campus. Moreover, the Board made no finding that the liquid was intoxicating. The only evidence as to' the nature of the drink was that supplied by the girls, and it is clear that they did not know whether the beverage was intoxicating or not. The District Court recognized this void in its March 7 findings of fact. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cI have had grave questions throughout this trial as to whether this concoction from which these students got such a terrific charge was ever an intoxicating beverage. * * * [T]he term \u2018intoxicating beverage\u2019 as used in the manual is not defined but the term \u2018intoxicating liquid\u2019 is certainly well defined under the Arkansas laws and it provides that it must be a content in excess of 3.2 or 5 percent by weight and I am afraid the School Board is or has made a mistake here but I do not see any constitutional thing within the jurisdiction of this Court that requires any intervention by the Court at this time on the temporary application. If it ever reaches the matter of proof on the intoxicating angle I don\u2019t think you will ever be able to prove that thing there\u2014 in spite of the fact that these little girls giggled around and got themselves kicked out of school on such a silly thing \u2014 I don\u2019t think you will ever be able to prove that that stuff is intoxicating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">For reasons not apparent from the record before us, the court failed to discuss this absence of evidence in its final opinion and made no finding that the School Board had determined that the beverage brought to the school by the girls was intoxicating.. Under these circumstances, we have no alternative but to find that the students were denied substantive due process and that they were entitled to have their records cleared and to be reinstated. As reinstatement is no longer possible, the students are entitled to have their records cleared and to be relieved of any punishments that may be of a continuing nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Lest we be misunderstood, we make it clear that the School District can prohibit the use and possession of any <em>alcoholic beverages </em>if it desires, or it may continue its present policy and bar intoxicating beverages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We turn then to the question of whether the trial court properly directed a verdict against the students as to their claim for damages as against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The directed verdict was appropriate as to the School District because under the doctrine of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), a school district is immune from damages in a \u00a7 1983 action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">It was appropriate as to Superintendent Inlow and Principal Waller because there is no evidence in the record to support a claim against them. Neither had a vote in the suspension proceedings and neither recommended that the girls be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">It was inappropriate as to the individual School Board members because the record shows clearly that the plaintiffs established that they had been suspended without regard to substantive due process and the defense of good faith was not established as a matter of law. Moreover, the court took an erroneous view of the law. It instructed the jury that the plaintiffs had to prove that the defendants acted with malice toward the plaintiffs. No such specific intent need be proved to recover compensatory damages. It need only be established that the defendants did not, in the light of all the circumstances, act in good faith. The test is an objective, rather than a subjective, one.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The appellants must accordingly be given a new trial on the issue of damages with respect to the defendant School Board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">We remand to the District Court for action consistent with this opinion. An attorney\u2019s fee in the sum of $500.00 is awarded to counsel for the appellants. Costs will be taxed against all appellees except S. L. Inlow, Duddy Waller, and Mena Special School District.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\">. The practical effect of the suspension was to cause the girls to fail their entire sophomore year. It will be possible for them to graduate with their class, but they must complete three academic years in two by taking an increased course load during their final two years in school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-13\">. <em>\"FACTS FOUND BY SCHOOL BOARD</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0X\">\u201c1.

The Arkansas School Boards Association has joined as amicus curiae in support of the appellees\u2019 petition. After an examination of the panel\u2019s opinion in this case and of the above-mentioned petitions I voted to grant a rehearing en banc. Although a majority of the active judges of this court voted to deny appellees\u2019 petition, I feel compelled to respectfully dissent from the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">My principal disagreement with the panel's opinion involves its use of substantive due process as the basis for reversal. I fully recognize that a public high school student has a very strong interest in his or her education. I also recognize that the student\u2019s interest in public education enjoys very important procedural and substantive federal constitutional protection from certain types of unwarranted state action. I cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>agree, however, with the panel\u2019s conclusion that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment empowers this or any other federal court to review every public school disciplinary action on the basis of sufficiency of the evidence. Instead, I am firmly convinced that the substantive reach of the due process clause on the public school campus is limited to the protection of specifically identifiable federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">This is not a case where the school board has invaded federally protected areas of speech, association, religion, or equality of race or sex. Nor is this a ease where the procedure accorded the students was inadequate, unreasonable, or unfair. Instead, as the panel itself concludes, this is a case where the school board had established a reasonable rule, the students had notice of the rule, the students by their own admission had violated the rule, and, after full procedural protection was afforded, the rule was enforced. Under such circumstances I fail to perceive any federal constitutional question in appellants\u2019 attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">I am, of course, aware that \u201csubstantive due process\u201d has in the past been used without regard to any specific constitutional safeguard to attack a wide variety of state action. <em>E. g., </em>Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905); Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, 35 S.Ct. 240, 59 L.Ed. 441 (1915). But I thought the federal judiciary had long since rejected such a freewheeling, use of \u201csubstantive due process\u201d because it inevitably had led to an unwarranted invasion of the duties and responsibilities of state and local governments. <em>E. g., </em>Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 10 L.Ed.2d 93 (1963). None of the cases cited by the panel supports such an unfettered reading of the due process clause; instead, all of the cases involved attacks either on the procedure accorded or on an alleged invasion of some specifically protected right such as free speech. I fear that the panel\u2019s opinion now places every federal court, at least in this circuit, in the position of serving as a board of appeal for every disciplined public school student who feels that his punishment was too severe or that the school board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. I feel that this function is one that is the sole responsibility of the state and local governments, which in this case have long provided an appropriate judicial remedy. <em>E. g., </em>Douglas v. Campbell, 89 Ark. 254, 116 S.W. 211 (1909).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
