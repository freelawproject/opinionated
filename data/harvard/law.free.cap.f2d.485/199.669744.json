On January 7, 1972, a Minnesota State District Judge ordered, pursuant to Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 609.165,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that he be \u201cdischarged from probation, restored to all civil rights and to full citizenship with full right to vote and hold office the same as if said conviction had not taken place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Under \u00a7 1202(a)(1), the government need not prove specific intent to violate the law or knowledge on the part of the defendant that he is violating the law. It must prove that the defendant knowingly possessed the firearm. United States v. Wiley, 478 F.2d 415 (8th Cir. 1973); United States v. Crow, 439 F.2d 1193 (9th Cir. 1971), vacated on other grounds, 404 U.S. 1009, 92 S.Ct. 687, 30 L.Ed.2d 657 (1972). The government has met that burden here. Moreover, this Court upheld the eonstitutionality of this statute in United States v. Mancino, 474 F.2d 1240 (8th Cir. 1973), and in United States v. Synnes, 438 F.2d 764 (8th Cir. 1971), vacated on other grounds, 404 U.S. 1009, 92 S.Ct. 687, 30 L.Ed.2d 657 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\"> The Act exempts from its provisions \u201c * * * any person who has been pardoned by the President of the United States or the chief executive of a State and has expressly been authorized by the President of such chief executive, as the ease may be, to receive, possess or transport in commerce a firearm.\u201d 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1203(2) (1968). The defendant is not such a person. He belongs to a general class of convicted felons whose civil rights have been restored by a statute that is silent with respect to the right of such persons to possess firearms. If the Congress desires to extend the exemption to persons in this class, it can do so; but we find no evidence of such intent in the language in the legislative history of the Act. See, Stevens v. United States, 440 F.2d 144 (6th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>may seem confusing and harsh, but the classification established by Congress is, in our view, a reasonable one and cannot be overturned by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-16\">. \u201c(a) Any person who\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-17\">\u201c(1) has been convicted by a court of the United States or of a State or any political subdivision thereof of a felony, H* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-29\">\u201cand who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce, after the date of enactment of this Act, any firearm shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-30\">18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a) (1) (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">. <em>\u201cSubdivision 1. </em>When a person has been deprived of his civil rights by reason of conviction of a crime and is thereafter discharged, such discharge shall restore him to all his civil rights and to full citizenship, with full right to vote and hold office, the same as if such conviction had not taken place, and the order of discharge shall so provide.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\"><em>\u201cSubd. 2. </em>The discharge may be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">\u201c(1) By order of the court following stay of sentence or stay of execution of sentence ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">\u201c(2) By order of the adult corrections commission or youth conservation commission prior to expiration of sentence; or \u201c (3) Upon expiration of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\"><em>\u201cSubd.

Any person, convicted of crime in any court of this state, who has served the sentence imposed by the court and has been discharged of the sentence either by order of court or by operation of law, may petition the board of pardons for the granting of a pardon extraordinary. If the board of pardons shall determine that such person has been convicted of no criminal good character and reputation, the board may, in its discretion, grant to such person a pardon extraordinary. Such pardon extraordinary, when granted, shall have the effect of restoring such person to all civil rights, and shall have the effect of setting aside the conviction and nullifying the same acts other than the act upon which such conviction was founded and is of and of purging such person thereof and such person shall never thereafter be required to disclose the conviction at any time or place other than in a judicial proceeding thereafter instituted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-16\">.
