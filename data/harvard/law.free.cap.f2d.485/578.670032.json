Twenty-three such forms admittedly signed by Washington during the time covered by the indictment were received in evidence, each representing a separate firearm purchase from the same dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">Despite his signature on the forms and testimony that the forms had been read to him and explained to him by the dealer, Washington defended at his non-jury trial on the claimed basis of his failure to understand the forms, and his inability to read and write more than his name and address. The court found him guilty under eight counts, one count being dismissed by the prosecution during the trial. Washington was sentenced to five years confinement on a single count, with probation to follow as to the convictions upon the additional seven counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-18\">Insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the court\u2019s guilty finding \u2014 specifically the charge that the admittedly false statements on the forms were made knowingly and with intent to deceive \u2014 -is the sole issue raised on appeal. We reach the view that the circumstances presented by the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, were sufficient to support an inference beyond a reasonable doubt by the trier of fact, in this instance the court, that the statutory requirement was met; viz, that the false statements as to a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>felony conviction were made knowingly and with intent to deceive the dealer with respect to the lawfulness of the sale. Cf. United States v. Garcia, 5 Cir. 1973, 479 F.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
