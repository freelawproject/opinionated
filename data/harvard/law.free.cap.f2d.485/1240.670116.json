No. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-14\">The Board found that respondent violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1), by threatening employees that if a union were selected it would close its plant and move and by coercively interrogating employees about union activities. The Board also found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) &amp; (1) of the Act by discriminatorily discharging employee Ove Shoup and by laying off employee Hattie Massengill because of their union activities. The Board\u2019s order requires the company to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found, from interfering with, restraining or coercing its employees in exercise of their Section 7, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157, rights and directs the company to offer Shoup reinstatement and to make both employees whole for lost earnings. It also requires the posting of notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-15\">A review of the record convinces us that the findings of fact of the Board are supported by substantial evidence on the record, considered as a whole, and it is hereby ordered that the order of the Board be, and it hereby is, enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
