Citizens Casualty. Co. of N.Y., 431 F.2d 409, Parti (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b639-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court of the United States dated June 25, 1973 vacating our judgment and remanding this cause to this court, we have made an \u201cindependent constitutional judgment on the facts of the case as to whether the material is constitutionally protected\u201d, Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 190, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 1679, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964). Furthermore, we have tested the materials under both the standard for obscenity set out in A Book Named John Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966), and the standard recently enunciated in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). <em>See </em>United States v. Thevis, 484 F.2d 1149 (5th Cir. 1973). The statute involved, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461, has been the subject of authoritative judicial construction which renders its application constitutionally proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">The materials for which Cote was prosecuted were magazines entitled. \u201cUps and Downs No. 4\u201d, \u201cDuplex\u201d and \u201cGemini\u201d; a reel of movie film entitled: \u201cTri-sex\u201d; and advertising materials thereabout.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have tested each and all of these materials in the manner set out in <em>Thevis, supra,. </em>If the test results of each of these articles were put into tabular form as was done in <em>Thevis, </em>every answer to every question would be yes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-18\">Therefore, the convictions of Robert E. Cote upon his pleas of guilty are again Affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\">. The following excerpt from Defendant\u2019s brief in this court describes the materials involved :</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">That the picture books, films and advertisements charged in the indictment in the case at bar depict nude females in sexually suggestive poses and body movements is not in dispute. That there are occasionally a man and woman or two women in a picture (but without explicit sexual activity) is conceded. That the pictures and films are vulgar and monotonous is beyond argument. That no serious social message is communicated or intended by the pictures and films is evident. That no great dramatic, talent or graphic artistry is demonstrated in the pictures and films is readily determinable upon a casual viewing. Tawdry? Very probably. Dull? Certainly. Sexually provocative? Perhaps to some; undoubtedly pathetic or laughable to others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-20\">. Defendant contends that only hard-core pornography, which he defines as portrayal of explicit sexual acts in which the genitals are exposed, may be punished as criminally obscene. He urges that we follow the \u201cactual performance\u201d of the Supreme Court \u201cas distinguished from its <em>rhetoric.\" </em>With the announcement of <em>Miller </em>and the companion cases of the same date, the Court\u2019s \u201cperformance\u201d has taken a significant new turn. See Thevis, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-21\">. Cote received concurrent two-year sentences upon each count.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
