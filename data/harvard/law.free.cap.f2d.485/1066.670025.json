The report on the examination confirmed his \u201clife long addiction\u201d but concluded that \u201che is not adequately motivated to participate <em>in our treatment program </em>and is not likely to be rehabilitated <em>by it </em>at this time.\u201d The letter transmitting the report to the District Court stated similarly that appellant \u201cis not likely to be rehabilitated through treatment <em>in this program in this institution!\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-21\">At sentencing, appellant explained that \u201cthe program [at Danbury] just wasn\u2019t geared for my condition.\u201d The judge, confronted by the report and the Government\u2019s unopposed information alleging earlier narcotic convictions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> however, expressed the feeling that his \u201chands are tied . . ..By passing up that program,\u201d the judge said, \u201cyou are putting yourself right in a box and I can\u2019t get you out of it . . . I am compelled to impose the minimum mandatory sentence of ten years on each count . . ,.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant was then sentenced to two concurrent ten-year terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-25\">On this appeal, appellant originally contended that he was impermissibly prosecuted for possession of narcotics for his own use. He also contended that by reason of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>1970,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which prior to sentencing repealed the sections heretofore mentioned, the judge was free to impose a suspended sentence. As appellant now concedes, the first argument is foreclosed by our decision in United States v. Moore,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the second by the Supreme Court\u2019s in Bradley v. United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We accordingly affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">Appellant also urges, however, that contrary to the trial judge\u2019s belief, the unfavorable evaluation report by Danbury did not bar consideration of alternative treatment dispositions under NARA. The Government concurs in that position, and so do we. The report concluded only that it was unlikely that appellant would achieve rehabilitation through the program at Danbury. It reflected little or nothing as to the rehabilitative possibilities of programs elsewhere. The judge left the latter matter unexplored, and thereby \u2014 and unfortunately \u2014 marred what the record reveals as a conscientious effort to help appellant solve his drug problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\"> The judge was not limited to a choice between treatment at Danbury or no treatment at all. NARA expressly calls for a judicial determination as to whether a convicted defendant found to be an addict is \u201clikely to be rehabilitated through treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the determination is in the affirmative, and facilities and personnel therefor are available, a commitment \u201cfor treatment under\u201d NARA is required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cTreatment,\u201d as defined by NARA, encompasses a wide range of rehabilitative programs and services which by no means are localized at Danbury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-15\">We have declared \u201cthat the interest of justice calls for thoroughgoing review of NARA possibilities . . <em>..\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have approved \u201ca remand following a sentence when there is a possibility that there was a failure to give NARA dispositions full consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To the end that adequate consideration may now be forthcoming, we must take that course here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-17\">The judgment of conviction appealed from is affirmed. The sentences imposed thereon are vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court for reconsideration thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-18\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1131-14\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a74704 (a) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1131-15\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1131-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4251 et seq.
