We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-20\">Appellant-opposer bases opposition on the prior use and registration of seven hyphenated trademarks beginning with \u201cALO-,\u201d the phonetic equivalent of \u201cAloe\u201d and obviously intended to carry the same connotation, namely, ALO-OINTMENT, ALO-RELIEF, ALODERM, ALO-BODY, ALO-FACE, ALO-HANDS, and ALO-PLUS for creams, ointments, and lotions variously identified. ALO-DERM is registered on the principal register and all the others on the supplemental register. There is no contest as to priority in appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-21\">In arriving at its decision, the board relied on two prior decisions in American Aloe Corp. v. Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc., 420 F.2d 1248 (7th Cir. 1970), and Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc. v. Milsan, Inc., 165 USPQ 37 (5th Cir. 1970), to which appellant, but not appellee, was a party. In the board\u2019s view, appellant had had a \u201cfair opportunity procedurally, substantively and evidentially to pursue his claim the first time\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the prior cases and was thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>\u201cestopped to assert here that it has any rights in either \u2018ALOE\u2019, per se, or its equivalent.\u201d The board found that in these cases the Fifth and Seventh Circuit Courts of Appeals</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-4\">* * * have determined that the term \u201cALO\u201d was not subject to exclusive appropriation by opposer. Each held that the term \u201cALOE\u201d and its phonetic equivalent \u201cALO\u201d are either generic or merely descriptive of creams and lotions which include as an ingredient a gel which is derived from a plant of the same name. Each case has been denied certiorari on writ [sic, petition?] to the United States Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">It appears to have been the board\u2019s view that since the descriptiveness of \u201cALOE\u201d and \u201cALO\u201d had been judicially decided and because the question of likelihood of confusion in trade is a question of law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the case could appropriately be disposed of on a motion for summary judgment. As we read the board opinion, it seems to us that summary judgment of dismissal of the opposition was also granted because appellant-opposer had not even offered facts to support a conclusion that \u201cALOE\u201d or \u201cALO\u201d are not merely descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">Descriptiveness of \u201cALOE\u201d and \u201cALO\u201d is not the only issue in this ease. The primary issue in this opposition is likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d) as between applicant\u2019s and one or more of appellant\u2019s marks when used on the goods for which they are registered or sought to be registered. \u201cALOE\u201d or \u201cALO\u201d constitute only parts of the marks and decision, as the board recognized, must be based on consideration of the marks as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">While it is true that the ultimate issue of likelihood of confusion, etc., is \u201cone of law,\u201d there are many factual questions other than the descriptiveness of a part of the marks which opposer is entitled to have considered and on which it should be given an opportunity to present evidence. Appellant\u2019s brief has not, unfortunately, pointed out what those questions of fact are because it has concentrated on pointing out that appellant wants an opportunity to produce evidence of \u201csecondary meaning\u201d of its several trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-10\">With respect to a trademark registered on the principal register, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1057(b) makes it unnecessary to prove secondary meaning. \u201cALODERM\u201d is so registered. The other marks being registered on the supplemental register, appellant may well wish to establish secondary meaning as to them because they are not entitled to the benefits of \u00a7 1057(b). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1094. However, we deem that to be but a minor reason for not granting summary judgment. Relevant to the likelihood of confusion issue are many factual matters on which appellant might want to present evidence such as whether or not it has promoted its trademarks as a \u201cfamily of marks,\u201d their impact in the market place, the channels of trade in which the goods move, possible actual confusion, the impact of the marks on the purchasing public, and the like. These matters are not questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-11\">Believing, as we do, that appellant has a right to present evidence on such factual matters, we consider it was error to grant summary judgment. The decision of the board is therefore <em>reversed </em>and the case <em>remanded </em>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1305-13\">.
