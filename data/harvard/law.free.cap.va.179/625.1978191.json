Holt, who was killed in an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment by Stone and Webster Engineering Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">The facts are undisputed. The parents of the deceased employee were at the time of the accident, which-occurred on June 15, 1941, fifty-eight years old. Neither had earned .a living for the past several years. The father had been an invalid for eleven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">About two weeks prior to the accident the couple took up their residence at Phenix, Virginia, where they boarded with Mrs. Holt\u2019s sister. Prior to this they had lived at Hopewell with their two sons, Tyler and Cameron. Each of these sons received a small income, out of which he paid his mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the sum of $6.00 a week for board, lodging and laundry. All of this was consumed in the cost of the sons\u2019 maintenance, leaving no profit to the household. Beyond this these sons contributed nothing towards the support of their parents. Three married children, who made their homes separate and apart from the parents, likewise made no contribution toward their support.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">At the time of the accident the son, Frank, was receiving a substantial income of approximately $55.00 a week. While his parents were living at Hopewell he was their sole means of support, paying the house rent, bills for fuel, electric light, water, groceries, and the parents\u2019 bills for clothing, hospitalization, physicians and medicine. Due to illness of the father the last three items were considerable. These expenses were paid by Frank not only when he lived at Hopewell with his parents, but even when he made his home elsewhere, as was the situation at the time of his death, when he was living at Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">When the parents moved to Phenix the mother assisted her sister in the household duties in part payment of her board. Just what this amounted to is not shown in the evidence. Beyond this Frank paid the board of both his father and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In his income tax returns Frank was allowed an exemption on the ground that he was the sole support of his parents. Before his local Selective Service Board he claimed and was allowed a deferred classification on the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The only apparent conflict in the evidence arises in this manner: Ten days after the accident the parents signed a statement prepared by an adjuster for the insurance carrier. In it they stated that Frank was their sole support, that none of the other children contributed thereto, and that \u201cDuring the time we were living together, Tyler paid an average of $6.00 per week board, Cameron paid $6.00 per week, and Frank paid $8.00 to $10.00 a week. That constituted the total amount we had to five on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Manifestly, this referred to the situation which obtained when Frank made his home with his parents at Hopewell. He, of course, paid no \u201cboard\u201d as such after he moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>to Norfolk, where he was living \u201cat the time of the accident,\u201d as of which time, under the terms of section 40 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> questions of dependency in cases of this character must be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Moreover,, at the hearing both parents testified, and it is not contradicted, that they told the insurance adjuster at the time the statement was taken that Frank made other contributions to their maintenance and support in addition to the stated weeldy sum of $8.00 to $10.00, that the adjuster replied that \u201che was not interested in that,\u201d and that he was concerned only with the \u201camounts the boys paid in board.\u201d The father further testified that Frank\u2019s total contributions for his parents\u2019 maintenance and support, including the household bills paid, averaged between $25.00 and $30.00 a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">After the parents had thus testified in regard to the statement and had given their explanation of the apparent discrepancies between it and their testimony at the hearing, it was stipulated and agreed, in the presence of the Commissioner, that \u201cFrank M. Holt was the sole support of his father and mother prior to his death, with the exception of $6.oo per week paid by Tyler and Cameron Holt each, on account of board, * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">This stipulation, we think, settled the matter in favor of the claimant parents. Since the uncontradicted evidence is that the amounts paid by Tyler and Cameron for board were consumed in their maintenance, leaving no profit for contribution toward the support of the parents, it follows that the parents\u2019 support came from Frank alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In our opinion the Industrial Commission should have made an award to the claimant parents on the basis that they were wholly dependent upon their son, Frank.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">It is argued in the brief that we are precluded from a review of the Commission\u2019s award by section 61 of the Act,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>which provides that it \u201cshall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"> When there is a conflict in the evidence, the finding of fact by the Industrial Commission is final and conclusive upon this court. But an award which is unsupported by evidence is illegal and should be set aside. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>150 Va. 260, 263, 142 S.
