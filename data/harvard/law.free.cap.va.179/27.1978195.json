Copies of certain city ordinances, the record in another case tried and decided by the same court, and the testimony of several witnesses are printed with the records. There is some controversy as to when, how and by whom these papers were lodged with the clerk of this court, but there is no controversy as to the fact that none of them were included in a bill or certificate of exceptions duly authenticated by the trial judge. Hence, they cannot be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">It may be inferred from the pleadings\u2014if not inferred, it is conceded\u2014that each defendant is engaged in the bottling business. Section 199 of the Tax Code provides that persons, firms or corporations engaged in such business shall be deemed manufacturers and not merchants. Section 188 of the same code provides that a manufacturer, taxable on capital by the State, may sell to wholesalers and retailers without payment of a license tax of any kind to the State, or to any city, town or county for such privilege. This immunity from payment of a license tax does not apply in the event the manufacturer sells to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The validity of the license taxes in question depends upon the language used in the pertinent city ordinances and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>character of the business conducted by the taxpayers. Neither can be ascertained from the true record.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">It follows, therefore, that the writ of error in each case was improvidently awarded, and will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>Writs dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
