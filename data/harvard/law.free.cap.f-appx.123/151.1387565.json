Noble argues that his failure to receive a timely notification of the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his request for a writ of certiorari cost him the opportunity to bring a timely appeal and that, because of the defendants\u2019 refusal to provide him with an affidavit indicating that the notice was not received in the prison mail room, any attempt to appeal at this point will be met with \u201cgreat opposition,\u201d and requiring him to do so \u201cwould be fundamentally unfair and a substantial injustice\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">Mere negligence on the part of a prison official does not give rise to a due process claim. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-36,106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). Furthermore, to the extent that Noble is asserting a denial-of-access-to-the-eourts claim, a plaintiff must show an actual injury. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Although Noble argues that the defendants\u2019 failure to provide an affidavit attesting that they had no record of receiving the supreme court\u2019s notice will cause him difficulty in any attempt to appeal his claim, has not shown that he was actually injured by this because he has not yet filed such an appeal. <em>See Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 349-52. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Noble\u2019s claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Noble requests that this court compel the defendants to provide him with the affidavit. However, the remedy sought by Noble is in the nature of mandamus relief, which is not available to federal courts to direct state officials in the performance of their duties and functions. <em>See Moye v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1275-76 (5th Cir.1973); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Noble also argues that throughout his pursuit of the affidavit, he has been met with retaliation by \u201cthis administration.\u201d However, he does not address the magistrate judge\u2019s determination, which was adopted by the district court, that his retaliation claim was untimely. Because Noble does not identify any error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim as untimely, he has abandoned it. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Noble\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS his appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Noble\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and this court\u2019s dismissal constitute two \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Noble is WARNED that if he accumulates, three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
