To the extent that Collin\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenged errors that occurred at his sentencing his motion was properly brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Ojo v. INS, </em>106 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.1997). Collins argues that there is a question as to whether, in sentencing him, the district court had jurisdiction to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>pose his federal sentence to run consecutively to his California sentence given that, at the time he was sentenced by the district court, Texas had lodged a detainer against him. Collins has failed to show \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Thus, COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">To the extent that Collins asserted a claim regarding the execution of his federal sentence, that claim should have been brought as one under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Because at the time that Collins filed his June 2004 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion he was incarcerated in the Northern District of Texas, we construe Collins\u2019s motion, to the extent that it challenges the execution of his sentence, as one under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992). A prisoner proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is not required to obtain a COA to proceed on appeal. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Collins argues that, because his federal judgment stated that his federal sentence was to run consecutively to his California sentence, he is illegally or unconstitutionally currently incarcerated by the State of Texas. Collins\u2019s claim regarding the execution of his sentence fails because whether he is incarcerated first for the Texas convictions or for his federal convictions is a matter of comity between the state and federal governments \u201cand not a personal right of the prisoner.\u201d <em>Cf. Floyd v. Henderson, </em>456 F.2d 1117, 1119 (5th Cir. 1972). Consequently, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Collin\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to the extent that it challenged the execution of his sentence. <em>See United States v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 687 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
