Kelly then filed a tort suit against Red Fox and Diamond Offshore Drilling (\u201cDiamond\u201d) in which LWCC intervened. Red Fox was dismissed from the suit on account of its status in bankruptcy proceedings. Thereafter, LWCC filed a motion to dismiss its intervention upon determining that Red Fox had contractually waived its right of subrogation as to Diamond. Following the dismissal of LWCC, Kelly and Diamond settled for $25,000, and the court issued a full and final release and dismissed the suit. LWCC subsequently terminated all benefits to Kelly because he had failed to obtain LWCC\u2019s prior written approval for the third-party settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Kelly challenged this termination of benefits, and the administrative law judge granted Red Fox and LWCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the Benefits Review Board affirmed, finding that Kelly had failed to obtain written approval from either Red Fox or LWCC for his settlement with Diamond as required by 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(g)(1). In addition, the BRB found that LWCC was not involved in the settlement negotiations to such an extent as to render the requirements of \u00a7 933(g)(1) inoperative, and that Red Fox\u2019s waiver of its subrogation rights in its contract with Diamond did not obviate LWCC\u2019s \u00a7 933(g)(1) protections. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Our review of a decision by the BRB is limited in scope to \u201cconsidering errors of law and making certain that the BRB adhered to its statutory standard of review of factual determinations, that is, whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and [are] consistent with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A person entitled to compensation under the LHWCA may both recover compensation from his or her employer, and pursue a separate negligence action against a third party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the person obtains damages from a third party, the employer is entitled to a lien on the recovery or an offset against such recovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the event that the person reaches a <em>settlement </em>with a third party for an amount less than the person would otherwise be entitled under the LHWCA, \u201cwritten approval of the settlement [must be] obtained from the employer and the employer\u2019s carrier, before the settlement is executed, and by the person entitled to compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If such written approval is not obtained, \u201call rights to compensation and medical benefits under [the LHWCA] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>shall be terminated, regardless of whether the employer or the employer\u2019s insurer has made payments or acknowledged entitlements to benefits under [the LHWCA].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In his first point of error, Kelly contends that the BRB erroneously determined that LWCC\u2019s awareness of and discussions about the settlement with Diamond did not render the \u00a7 933(g) bar inapplicable. Specifically, Kelly contends that the settlement was discussed with counsel for LWCC prior to its finalization, and that counsel for LWCC was knowledgeable of the settlement throughout the negotiation process. However, Kelly does not argue \u2014 nor does the record suggest \u2014 that LWCC or Red Fox directly participated in the settlement negotiations or approved the final agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Our court has consistently found that failure to obtain written approval of a settlement with a third party places an absolute bar on the receipt of further compensation from an employer or the employer\u2019s carrier under the LHWCA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This approach was questioned but not disavowed by the Supreme Court in <em>Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the Court refused to decide whether participation by an employer or its carrier in a third party settlement serves to fulfill or even eliminate the written notice requirement. The Court noted, however, that \u00a7 933(g)\u2019s forfeiture penalty creates \u201ca trap for the unwary,\u201d and presents the \u201cstark and troubling possibility that significant numbers of injured workers or their families may be stripped of their LHWCA benefits by this statute.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">In <em>I.T.O. Corp. of Baltimore v. Sellman, </em>the Fourth Circuit refused to impose a complete bar on future compensation in the absence of a written approval, finding that an employer\u2019s failure to provide written approval of a third party settlement agreement did not serve to terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to provide compensation under the LHWCA when the employer directly and fully participated in both the third party action and the settlement negotiations leading to the execution of what amounted to a \u201cjoint\u201d settlement agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the BRB has found that an employer\u2019s participation in a third party settlement agreement can serve to obviate the need for written approval of the agreement under \u00a7 933(g)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">We are compelled to abide by the precedent of this court. Regardless, even if free to do so, the facts of this case would not compel us to depart from our settled interpretation of \u00a7 933(g)(1). Kelly has presented no evidence that LWCC directly participated in the settlement negotiations with Diamond, or that LWCC approved of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the resulting agreement. Rather, Kelly alleges only that LWCC had knowledge of the settlement negotiations, and that LWCC discussed them with him on isolated occasions prior to their conclusion. Assuming that these allegations are true, they fail to offer a compelling reason for disregarding the clear and unambiguous written notice requirement of \u00a7 933(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In his second point of error, Kelly argues that \u00a7 933(g)(1) should not apply in the present case because Red Fox contractually waived its right to subrogation as to Diamond, and therefore was not prejudiced by the settlement. Our court has held, however, that \u00a7 933(g)(1) protects both the employer\u2019s right to reimbursement from any settlement fund created by the third party, <em>and, </em>a right to an off-set against compensation benefits for amounts received by way of a third party settlement. An employer that has waived its right to subrogation still has a significant interest in the outcome of any third party settlement agreement as the proceeds from such a settlement would be off-set against the employer\u2019s compensation liability. As a result, an employer\u2019s waiver of its right to subrogation does not serve to eliminate the written notice requirement of \u00a7 933(g)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Kelly\u2019s second point is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In his third point of error, Kelly claims that LWCC violated his due process right to attempt to re-open his claim in the district court based on the issues raised in connection with severance of benefits when it failed to timely copy him with the written notice of suspension of benefits that was sent to the Department of Labor pursuant to statutory requirements.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Kelly has failed to demonstrate how this action by LWCC, a private insurance carrier, deprived him of a protected property interest without due process of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition, Kelly\u2019s fourth point or error, that the ALJ failed to consider his claim under equitable jurisdiction, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Finding no error in the judgment of the BRB, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
