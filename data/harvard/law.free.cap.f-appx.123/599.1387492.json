Adams (hereafter \u201cAdams\u201d) filed suit against John E. Potter, the Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service (\u201cthe Postmaster General\u201d), in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana alleging in a one-page complaint that her employer, the U.S. Postal Service, abolished her job as an operator and failed to grant her a modified position because of her race, color, gender, and in retaliation for previous complaints made by her to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Postmaster General answered, denying the charges of Adams\u2019s complaint and further asserting the defenses of failure to exhaust administrative remedies and lack of jurisdiction. The parties agreed in writing to permit the magistrate judge to resolve the controversy. The Postmaster General moved for summary judgment and the magistrate judge granted the same. Adams timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-23\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the record excerpts, and relevant portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated by the magistrate judge in her \u201cOrder and Reasons\u201d filed under date of May 27, 2004, we affirm the final judgment entered on that same day which dismissed all of Adams\u2019s claims against the Postmaster General with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
