This is Keele\u2019s fourth such complaint. The district court dismissed Keele\u2019s complaint with prejudice pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to comply with a court order that he provide additional evidence and facts establishing his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">Keele argues on appeal that he did not comply with the court order because he was unaware it had been issued until he received a copy of the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that his complaint be dismissed. We will not consider this argument since Keele failed to raise it in the district court. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">The record shows that Keele\u2019s refusal to comply with the magistrate judge\u2019s order to provide additional evidence and and facts in support of his claims was deliberate and contumacious. Further, the district court specifically found that a sanction less than dismissal with prejudice would have had no effect on Keele. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Keele\u2019s complaint with prejudice under Rule 41(b). <em>See Berry v. CIGNA/RSI-CIGNA, </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1191 (5th Cir.1992); <em>McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
