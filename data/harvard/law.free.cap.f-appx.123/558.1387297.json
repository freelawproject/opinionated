(\u201cMintz Levin\u201d) in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Mintz Levin now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50 (Fed. R.Civ.P.) motion for judgment as a matter of law on Gallina\u2019s retaliation claim. Gallina cross-appeals the district court\u2019s grant of Mintz Levin\u2019s Rule 50 motion dismissing her claim for punitive damages, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of her claim for front pay. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Mintz Levin is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and has offices located throughout the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gallina worked as an associate in the Business and Finance section of Mintz Levin\u2019s office in Reston, Virginia. Although based in the Reston office, Gallina worked with attorneys from various offices during the course of her employment. Gallina was employed at Mintz Levin from October 14, 1999, until she was terminated on March 23, 2001, for alleged poor performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Gallina\u2019s problems at Mintz Levin began in November 1999, when Mark Wishner, then acting as managing partner of the Reston office, discovered that she has a small child. Wishner became disconcerted about why Gallina had not informed him of her child when she interviewed with the firm. Thereafter, Gallina felt that Wishner began to treat her differently than male associates. For example, Wishner was more collegial and cordial with male associates than he was with Gallina. Wishner used unusually harsh language toward Gallina <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cf \u2014 king idiot\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on at least one occasion he called her a \u201cstupid bitch.\u201d J.A. 554. Wishner also spoke with Gallina \u201cabout the commitment differential between men and women, how women lawyers have more demands place[d] on them, and [how] it\u2019s very hard for them to balance when they have a family.\u201d J.A. 554. Additionally, Wishner told Gallina what she regarded as a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d about his prior experience with a female associate who, upon her return from maternity leave, inquired about achieving partnership. J.A. 554. Wishner was \u201cbeside himself\u2019 that the female associate would make such an inquiry, and the story left Gallina with the impression that \u201cpregnant women don\u2019t make partner.\u201d J.A. 555, 635.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">In February 2000, while on a trip to the Boston office, Gallina complained about Wishner\u2019s behavior toward her to Cindy Deegan, who was the firm\u2019s Business and Finance practice administrator. Gallina told Deegan that Wishner was treating her differently because she is female. Deegan referred Gallina to Stan Twarog, a Mintz Levin partner who served as the Business and Finance section manager. Gallina then met with Twarog and repeated her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>belief that Wishner was treating her differently because she is female. Twarog expressed concern about Gallina\u2019s complaint, and he asked her not to file a formal complaint because he felt that the matter could be dealt with informally.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Being new to the firm and trying to be a \u201cteam player,\u201d Gallina trusted that Twarog would deal with the matter in an appropriate manner. J.A. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">By May the news of Gallina\u2019s complaints to Boston reached the Reston office. Scott Meza, a partner in the Reston office, told Gallina that she had \u201ccaused a problem\u201d for, and \u201cembarrassed,\u201d the Reston office by complaining about Wishner to the Boston office. J.A. 556-57. Meza told Gallina that \u201c[a]ny dirty laundry that there may be in Reston needs to be handled in Reston. You don\u2019t need to go to Boston.\u201d J.A. 557. During a meeting in July, Meza infornied Gallina that she was not perceived as being \u201cas committed\u201d as the other lawyers in the Reston office, and he stated that she needed to decide whether she wanted to be \u201ca successful mommy or a successful lawyer.\u201d J.A. 560. Also, Meza reiterated how Gallina had \u201cembarrassed us when [she] went to Boston.\u201d J.A. 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">After her July meeting with Meza, Gallina was upset and concerned with Meza\u2019s response to her complaints. Consequently, Gallina met with Christina Gadiano, a female attorney in the Reston office. At this meeting, Gallina discussed her concerns about the treatment she had received and stated her belief that it was because she is female. Gadiano related that during her own pregnancy while at the firm, she had heard Wishner\u2019s \u201cpregnant women don\u2019t make partner\u201d story. Gadiano also stated that Wishner had made a sarcastic remark to her that \u201cwe just had to get you out of here, pregnant and all\u201d before making future hiring decisions. J.A. 522. Gadiano suggested that Gallina speak to Susan Weller, another female attorney that had children. Taking Gadiano\u2019s advice, Gallina met with Weller shortly thereafter and expressed her concerns about Wishner\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">In September, Gallina took her complaints of gender discrimination to Joan Howland, the Director of Human Resources for the Boston office. Gallina sought an interim performance evaluation from reviewers in Boston because she believed that some of her Reston evaluations were biased. Later, in October, Howland denied Gallina\u2019s request for the interim performance evaluation and advised her to \u201ckeep [her] head down and do [her] work.\u201d J.A. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">In November, David Barmak, a partner practicing employment law, succeeded Wishner as the managing partner of the Reston office. Shortly afterward, Barmak met with Howland to discuss Gallina\u2019s \u201csituation.\u201d J.A. 872. On January 12, 2001, Barmak withheld Gallina\u2019s annual pay increase pending the results of her performance evaluations. The performance evaluations were completed in mid-January. In an e-mail on March 19, Barmak notified Gallina that the performance evaluations had been assembled. On these performance evaluations, all four reviewers from the Reston office gave Gallina negative reviews, while both reviewers from other offices gave her positive reviews. Notably, two of the negative evaluations from the Reston office came from Wishner and Meza. Four days later, on March 23, Barmak terminated Gallina\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Gallina thereafter brought this action against Mintz Levin alleging claims under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Title VII for gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. Additionally, Gallina asserted a claim under the Equal Pay Act. Gallina sought compensatory damages, back pay, front pay, punitive damages, and reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Before trial, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Mintz Levin on Gallina\u2019s Title VII claims of gender discrimination and sexual harassment, and her claim under the Equal Pay Act. The case then proceeded to trial on Gallina\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim. At the close of the evidence, Mintz Levin moved pursuant to Rule 50 for judgment as a matter of law. The district court denied the motion as to the retaliation claim, finding that credibility issues made this the \u201cquintessential ... jury case.\u201d J.A. 941. The district court granted the motion as to Gallina\u2019s claim for punitive damages, noting that she failed to satisfy her burden of showing that Mintz Levin had not acted in good faith. The jury thereafter returned a verdict in Gallina\u2019s favor, awarding her $190,000 in compensatory damages and $330,000 in back pay. Mintz Levin then renewed its Rule 50 motion on the retaliation claim, which the district court denied. The district court also denied Gallina\u2019s reinstatement and front pay claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Mintz Levin now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50 motion on the retaliation claim. On cross-appeal, Gallina challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of her punitive damages claim and its denial of her front pay claim. We address these arguments in turn below.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Mintz Levin first argues that the district court erred in denying its Rule 50 motion on Gallina\u2019s retaliation claim. We review this ruling <em>de novo. Bryant v. Aiken Reg\u2019l Med. Ctrs., Inc., </em>333 F.3d 536, 543 (4th Cir.2003). Under Rule 50(b), our inquiry is whether a jury, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Gallina, \u201ccould have properly reached the conclusion reached by this jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). If reasonable minds could differ about the result in this case, we must affirm. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Gallina can prove unlawful retaliation by showing (1) that she engaged in a protected activity, (2) that Mintz Levin took an adverse employment action against her, and (3) that a causal connection links the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Id. </em>Once Gallina makes this showing, Mintz Levin could defend itself by producing \u201cevidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for taking the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The jury must then decide whether the adverse action was actually taken for the proffered reason, or whether that reason was merely pretext for retaliation. <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the district court\u2019s judgment, \u201cwe examine the full trial record to determine whether sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict on the ultimate question of the alleged retaliatory discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Gallina presented sufficient evidence at trial to establish that she engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>in a protected activity. Through Title VII, Congress has forbidden employers to ret\u00e1bate against employees for engaging in protected activities such as opposing gender discrimination in the workplace. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). \u201cEmployees are thus guaranteed the right to complain to their superiors about suspected violations of Title VII.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>333 F.3d at 543-44. Gallina made such complaints. The jury heard evidence that Gallina complained to at least four superiors at Mintz Levin about her concerns of gender discrimination, lodging most of her complaints after assurances by a partner that the matter would be dealt with informally.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Further, although Mintz Levin contends that Gallina lacked a good faith, reasonable belief that the conduct she complained of violated Title VII, <em>see Peters v. Jenney, </em>327 F.3d 307, 320-21 (4th Cir.2003), Gallina\u2019s repeated complaints and expressions of concern in response to this conduct demonstrate that she actually believed she was being subjected to gender discrimination. Additionally, Wishner\u2019s alleged course of conduct toward Gallina, viewed as a whole and in the light most favorable to Gallina, was sufficiently serious to show that Gallina\u2019s belief of illegal discrimination was reasonable. <em>See Conner v. Schrader-Bridgeport Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>227 F.3d 179, 192 n. 16 (4th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u201c[ajctionable discrimination includes conduct \u2018because of the victim\u2019s gender, which is broader than conduct of a \u2018sexual nature\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Mintz Levin does not dispute that it took adverse employment actions against Gallina. Indeed, Mintz Levin deferred Gallina\u2019s pay increase and ultimately terminated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Gallina also presented evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Mintz Levin\u2019s pay deferral and firing were the result of her complaints about gender discrimination. After Gallina complained about Wishner\u2019s conduct toward her to Deegan and Twarog in Boston, Twarog asked Gallina not to file a formal complaint and assured her that the matter would be dealt with appropriately. Subsequently, Meza explained on two occasions how Gallina had embarrassed the Reston office by complaining about Wishner to the Boston office \u2014 where Gallina had complained about gender discrimination. Further, Meza requested that Gallina bring future complaints to him. Despite these apparent efforts to stifle her attempts to complain of gender discrimination, Gallina continued to complain to Gadiano, Weller, and Howland. Within two months of Barmak\u2019s becoming the managing partner of the Reston office, he met with Howland to discuss Gallina\u2019s \u201csituation\u201d and deferred her pay increase. Then, only two month\u2019s after the pay deferral, Barmak fired Gallina. The jury could have reasonably inferred from this evidence that Gallina\u2019s pay deferral and firing were manifestations of Mintz Levin\u2019s retaliation against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The reasonableness of this inference is buttressed by Gallina\u2019s evidence that Mintz Levin had no other valid reason for deferring her pay or terminating her. Gallina presented evidence that on her performance evaluations all four reviewers from the Reston office (including Wishner and Meza) gave her negative reviews, while both reviewers from other offices gave her positive reviews. This evidence supports the inference that, but for the bias <em>of the Reston office, </em>Gallina\u2019s work was acceptable to Mintz Levin, and the firm fired Gallina because of her continued complaints of gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">We therefore hold that there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on Gallina\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">We now turn to Gallina\u2019s cross-appeal. Gallina argues that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>court erroneously granted judgment as a matter of law to Mintz Levin on her claim for punitive damages. Our inquiry requires that we determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Gallina, would have permitted a reasonable jury to return a verdict in her favor on punitive damages. <em>Anderson v. G.D.C., Inc., </em>281 F.3d 452, 457 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">A Title VII plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages if her employer engaged in intentional retaliation \u201cwith malice or with reckless indifference to [her] federally protected rights.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(l). This standard does not require \u201ca showing of egregious or outrageous discrimination,\u201d but rather proof that the employer retaliated \u201cin the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law.\u201d <em>Kolstad v. American Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>527 U.S. 526, 535-36, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, \u201cin the punitive damages context, an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the employer\u2019s good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545 (internal quotations omitted). Thus, the questions we must answer are: (1) whether Gallina presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Mintz Levin, in the course of its unlawful retaliation, perceived the risk of violating Title VII and (2) whether Mintz Levin presented sufficient evidence such that a reasonable jury could only conclude that it engaged in good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">We hold that Gallina presented evidence that is sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Mintz Levin perceived the risk of violating federal law through its retaliation. A reasonable jury could have found that members of a prominent law firm, and especially a law firm with an employment law section in the relevant office, perceived the risk of violating federal law in retaliating against an employee. <em>See Lowery v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>206 F.3d 431, 443 (4th Cir.2000) (stating that an employer perceived the risk of violating federal law where that employer required every manager \u201cto attend a week-long training seminar that included education on the federal anti-discrimination laws\u201d); <em>Anderson, </em>281 F.3d at 460 (finding that an employer perceived the risk of violating federal law where that employer merely knew of an anti-discrimination poster in the workplace). Notably, Barmak was an employment lawyer and was aware of Gallina\u2019s complaints of gender discrimination, so he undoubtedly could have perceived the risk of violating federal law. Barmak even admitted that if a member of a protected class raises complaints, employers should explore the possibility that Title VII issues have arisen. J.A. 884. Thus, a reasonable jury could have found sufficient evidence that Mintz Levin perceived the risk of violating federal law through its retaliation against Gallina.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>We also hold that Mintz Levin did not proffer sufficient evidence such that a reasonable juror could only conclude that the firm engaged in good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII. Although Mintz Levin proffered evidence of the existence of a \u201cSexual Harassment Prevention Training\u201d manual and a contact person to deal with sexual discrimination issues, there was no evidence that Mintz Levin had any <em>specific </em>policy regarding retaliation. The only evidence of any policy was a reference in the \u201cSexual Harassment Prevention Training\u201d manual, but there was no evidence that anyone at the firm was aware of that policy, nor that it was implemented or enforced. Particularly condemning is the fact that, assuming any policy existed to deal with gender discrimination and retaliation, the policy completely failed Gallina because her complaints of gender discrimination caused her ultimate termination. After considering the conflicting evidence presented, we are not persuaded that a reasonable juror could only conclude that Mintz Levin engaged in good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII. Accordingly, the district court erred by disallowing Gallina\u2019s punitive damages claim to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for consideration of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">. Mintz Levin also argues on appeal that the district court erred with respect to certain jury instructions and trial evidentiary rulings. We have carefully considered these arguments and find them to be unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\">. In this appeal from rulings on Mintz Levin\u2019s Rule 50 motions, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Gallina, the non-movant. <em>Babcock v.

Uniroyal, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1413, 1424 (4th Cir.1991).

We agree with other circuits that have held that it is the employer\u2019s burden to establish that it has engaged in good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII. <em>See Zimmermann v.

In particular, the evidence on the severity and pervasiveness of Wishner\u2019s discriminatory conduct was too weak to support a jury finding that Gallina <em>reasonably </em>believed it to constitute a violation of Title VII. She also failed to prove that Mintz Levin\u2019s proffered reason for discharging her \u2014 that she was performing poorly \u2014 was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">To survive a Rule 50 motion, a plaintiff in a Title VII retaliation claim must present enough evidence that a reasonable juror could find (1) that the plaintiff engaged in a protected activity; (2) that the employer acted adversely to the plaintiff; and (3) that the protected activity was causally related to the adverse action. <em>Beall v. Abbott Labs., </em>130 F.3d 614, 619 (4th Cir. 1997). And although the employee need not successfully establish an underlying violation of Title VII to succeed on a retaliation claim, for an employee\u2019s complaints to constitute a \u201cprotected activity,\u201d the employee must have held a reasonable belief that the complained-of conduct violated Title VII. <em>Peters v. Jenney, </em>327 F.3d 307, 320-21 (4th Cir.2003). Thus, this \u201cprotected activity\u201d test contains both a subjective and an objective component.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">In this case, no reasonable juror could have concluded, based on the evidence presented at trial, (1) that Gallina <em>actually held a belief </em>that Wishner\u2019s conduct violated Title VII or (2) that such a belief would have been objectively reasonable. This alleged belief of discrimination must be assessed in light of the underlying Title VII claim. In this case, Gallina alleged that her complaints were in response to Wishner\u2019s treatment of her during the course of her employment. Her allegations most closely resemble a hostile work environment claim, the elements of which are (1) the conduct was done \u201cbased on the plaintiffs sex\u201d; (2) the conduct was unwelcome; (3) the conduct was sufficiently \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d so as to alter the terms and conditions of her employment; and (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>conduct was imputable to her employer. <em>Anderson v. G.D.C., Inc., </em>281 F.3d 452, 458 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The evidence presented at trial does not support a conclusion that Gallina held a good-faith, reasonable belief that Wishner\u2019s conduct was sufficiently \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d as effectively to alter the terms and conditions of her employment. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has noted that \u201c \u2018simple teasing,\u2019 offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the \u2018terms and conditions of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (internal citation omitted). More relevant to the case before us, the Supreme Court has said that a single, isolated incident is insufficient to support a finding that the plaintiff <em>reasonably believed </em>that the conduct was severe and pervasive. <em>Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 271, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Gallina bases her claim on a handful of isolated incidents: (1) Wishner routinely used foul language with respect to Gallina\u2019s work and threatened to fire her if she \u201cf \u2014 ked up\u201d assignments. (2) On a couple of occasions Wishner required Gallina to work on weekends even in the absence of a pressing due date. (3) Wishner required Gallina to remain in constant contact with him (\u201cwired\u201d) during her vacation. (4) Wishner commented about the commitment differential between men and women. (5) Wishner remarked on the audacity of a woman who returned from maternity leave and immediately asked about making partner. (6) On one occasion, Wisher called Gallina a \u201cf \u2014 king idiot\u201d and a \u201cstupid b\u2014 ch.\u201d And (7) on one occasion, Wishner asked Gallina to make coffee when she worked on a weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">With respect to the first three incidents (foul language, working weekends, and remaining \u201cwired\u201d), the record demonstrates that they were not discriminatory, as Wishner treated Gallina\u2019s male counterparts in the firm in the same manner. The next two incidents (the comment about the \u201ccommitment differential\u201d and the maternity leave story) are analogous to what the Supreme Court referred to as \u201csimple teasing\u201d or \u201coffhand comments\u201d in <em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 788. Gallina is thus left with only two legitimate instances of discriminatory conduct \u2014 the name-calling incident and the coffee-making incident. Those incidents, however, do not come close to being so \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d as effectively to change the terms and conditions of Gallina\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">It is noteworthy that the record contains evidence that, at the time, Gallina did not understand Wishner\u2019s conduct to be severe or persuasive, since she nominated Mintz Levin for the \u201c100 Best Companies for Working Moms\u201d list and recommended the firm to her boyfriend. If Wishner\u2019s conduct were as severe or pervasive as Gallina claimed at trial, it is doubtful that she would have nominated or recommended the firm. The record does show that Wishner was a very demanding supervisor and often used inappropriate language when communicating with his inferiors, but Gallina has failed to prove that Wishner regularly treated her more severely than he treated male attorneys. Accordingly, I would reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Mintz Levin\u2019s Rule 50 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">In addition, the evidence failed to show that Gallina\u2019s discharge was caused by her complaints about Wishner\u2019s behavior. Mintz Levin provided extensive evidence of Gallina\u2019s inadequate performance and failures as an attorney and contended that her poor performance was the reason that the firm discharged her. Gallina contends that the firm\u2019s proffered reasons for discharging her were pretextual. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>though Gallina presented some evidence that she performed well on occasion, she does not provide any response to the incidents in which she was clearly deficient. The firm pointed to four evaluations from attorneys in the Reston office (where Gallina worked) rating her work below-average. It described one transaction, on which she worked, where Gallina failed in her responsibility to file documents creating preferred stock shares, and another transaction where she failed to account for a stock split when preparing an employment agreement for the client. The latter mistake required the firm to rework the deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Because the evidence was insufficient to prove two of the three requirements for a Title VII retaliation claim, I would reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Mintz Levin\u2019s motion under Rule 50 and remand this case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
