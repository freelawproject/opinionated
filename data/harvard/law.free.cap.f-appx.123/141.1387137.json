He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. He also requests a \u201cspeedy hearing\u201d in this court. We find there has been no undue delay in the district court. We deny Doyle\u2019s motion for a speedy hearing as moot. Accordingly, while we grant Doyle\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis in this court, we deny his petition for mandamus relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
