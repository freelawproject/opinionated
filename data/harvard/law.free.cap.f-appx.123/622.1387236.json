As the district court determined, Gant\u2019s claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark>**</footnotemark> doctrine. <em>See Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 375 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Texas, </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994). Gant\u2019s conclusional assertion that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply to his case because any ruling in his favor would not affect any state court rulings is patently without merit; the face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of his complaint sought reversal of the state court rulings and the entry of judgment in his favor in the challenged state court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Because the appeal raises no nonfrivolous issues, it is DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir. 1983); 5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. We caution Gant that the filing or prosecution of frivolous appeals will subject him to sanctions. Gant should review all pending appeals to ensure that they are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
