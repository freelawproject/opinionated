See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b607-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b607-24\">Elise Guy Tchuenkam Kom, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirming, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-25\">We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s order and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Kom failed to estabhsh the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to estabhsh eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to estabhsh eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-26\">Next, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Korn\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Korn failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard necessary for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Furthermore, we conclude substantial evidence supports the determination that Kom did not establish it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cameroon, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004), and thus, that Kom\u2019s petition for protection under the CAT was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Accordingly, we deny Kom\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
