Her husband, William Burbano, has two children from his previous marriage to Laurie Burbano. One of these children, Anthony Burbano, spends most of his time with Laurie, his legal custodian, in her Waldorf, Maryland residence. One night, Anthony was involved in a car accident after finishing work in nearby LaPlata, Maryland. In this diversity action, we must determine whether Dolores\u2019s auto insurance policy covers this accident. We find that it does not. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to the insurance company that issued the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">William and Laurie Burbano had two children, Anthony and Kyle. After the couple separated in 1994, the youngsters stayed with their mother in the family home in Waldorf. In late 1994, William moved in with Dolores and her two children in Lusby.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">A separation agreement, executed by William and Laurie in February 1995, provided that Laurie would continue to have physical custody of Anthony and Kyle. The parents agreed to share legal custody, however, and they determined that the children would spend sixty-three days a year with their father. A divorce decree in 1996 recognized the award of primary physical custody to Laurie but, following the separation agreement, granted William joint legal custody with visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">For several years, Anthony and his younger brother Kyle visited their father\u2019s abode every other weekend. Anthony testified that he also spent a week each summer, and another week at Christmas or Easter, with William and Dolores. In March 2001, fourteen year-old Kyle moved in with his father. Anthony\u2019s visitation practices also changed at this point. Unlike his brother, however, Anthony began to spend less time with his father. At trial, Laurie stated that from March to October 2001 Anthony visited William and Dolores \u201ca minimum of once a month, a maximum of twice a month.\u201d After testifying that his stays diminished after March 2001, Anthony contradictorily claimed to have visited his father a \u201c[c]ouple times a month\u201d during this period. Anthony then added confusingly that these visits were \u201c[n]ot every other weekend.\u201d William, for his part, could recall \u201c[pjossibly on[e]\u201d overnight stay from March to October 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">On October 19, 2001, Anthony was involved in a car accident while driving a friend\u2019s vehicle. Another companion, Matthew Godwin, suffered serious injuries in the collision, which led to the amputation of his leg. The insurer of the car offered to pay $300,000 to Godwin. Laurie\u2019s auto insurance company also agreed to pay him $100,000. In this action, Godwin is seeking proceeds from a third policy \u2014 one that Dolores secured from Farmers New Century Insurance Company (\u201cFarmers\u201d) in September 2001. This policy covers, inter alia, any \u201cperson related to [Dolores and William] by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of [their] household.\u201d Godwin sued for a declaratory judgment in state court, seeking payment for his injuries from Farmers. Farmers removed to district court, which ordered Anthony rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ligned as a plaintiff.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> After discovery, the district court granted summary judgment to the insurance company. The district court found that Anthony was not a \u201cresident\u201d of Dolores and William\u2019s household at the time of the accident, as the policy required. Godwin could not therefore claim any payment from Farmers for the injuries he suffered while Anthony was driving. Godwin now seeks review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We review grants of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellant. While reviewing summary judgment in a diversity case, we must apply the law of the district court\u2019s forum state, as announced by its highest court. <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941); <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 79, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Where the state\u2019s highest court has yet to decide a legal question, we may look to its lower courts for instruction. <em>Private Mortgage Inv. Servs., Inc. v. Hotel &amp; Club Assocs., Inc., </em>296 F.3d 308, 312 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Appellant\u2019s first ground for appeal is that the district court misapplied Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The parties agree that, for insurance purposes, the residency of children like Anthony is an issue the Maryland Court of Appeals has yet to decide. The parties also agree that the court would likely adopt a totality of the circumstances test were it faced with this issue. The district court expressly concluded as much and considered several circumstances bearing on Anthony\u2019s residency. It noted that Anthony\u2019s visits to his father\u2019s abode had become sporadic by the time the accident occurred. The court also observed that Anthony had no exclusively assigned sleeping place in William and Dolores\u2019s house and the possessions he kept there had dwindled to a shelf of clothes and assorted recreational equipment. Further, William did not claim Anthony as a dependent on his 2001 tax return, and Anthony himself listed his mother\u2019s address on his driver\u2019s license and other official forms. The district court acknowledged that parents such as William who maintain \u201cclose relationships\u201d with their children after a divorce \u201care to be commended.\u201d But, applying the totality test to the foregoing facts, the district court found that Anthony was not a resident of his father\u2019s household at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Appellant does not claim that the district court relied on erroneous facts or inadvertently ignored evidence in reaching this finding. Nor does Godwin claim that any of the considerations informing this finding were legally irrelevant to the residency issue at hand. Instead, appellant asks us to reexamine the totality of the circumstances and overturn the conclusion that, based on these circumstances, Anthony was not residing in his father\u2019s household when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">To this end, appellant cites several cases which, applying the totality test to similar facts, find residency for insurance purposes where the district court found none. But in some of these cases, the policy holder and the party claiming coverage maintained closer ties than Anthony and his father. In <em>Countryside Casualty Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>pany v. McCormick, </em>722 S.W.2d 655 (Mo. Ct.App.1987), for instance, a child was deemed a resident of her non-custodial parent\u2019s household. But the court made this determination only after finding that the child visited the parent\u2019s house according to a regular schedule and that the child spent \u201cas much or more\u201d time there than at her custodial parent\u2019s house. <em>Id. </em>at 658. The child also maintained a bedroom in both abodes. <em>Id. </em>None of these circumstances is present here. Rather, Anthony spent the lion\u2019s share of his time at his mother\u2019s house, visited his father sporadically, and had no exclusively assigned living space in William and Dolores\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In other cases that appellant cites, the contract at issue varied from that which Dolores signed with Farmers. In <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company, </em>322 Md. 689, 589 A.2d 944 (1991), for instance, the court found that a woman was still a resident of the family home that she had departed after marital problems. But the woman was named as an operator on the policy document at issue and, as such, the court found an intention to secure joint coverage when the couple took out the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 952. Here, by contrast, Dolores recorded only herself and William when asked to list \u201cresidents &amp; dependents (licensed or not) and regular operators\u201d on the insurance application. Further, the court in <em>Forbes </em>took pains to emphasize that separation following marital difficulties is often temporary and warned that it would be \u201cunreasonable\u201d to conclude that departing spouse in every such instance \u201cautomatically becomes uninsured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 951. Here, by contrast, nobody pretends that Anthony was on a temporary sojourn from his father\u2019s household when the accident occurred. The child remained with his mother when his father left to establish a new homestead, and the filial ties only weakened thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">These cases, and others that apply the totality test to find residency where the district court found none, were distinguished by the district court on the facts. <em>See Snedegar v. Midwestern Indem. Co., </em>44 Ohio App.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 90, 95 (1998) (child stayed with father \u201cone to two days a week,\u201d permanently stored belongings there, and received correspondence and phone calls); <em>Coriasco v. Hutchcraft, </em>245 Ill.App.3d 969, 185 Ill.Dec. 769, 615 N.E.2d 64, 66 (1993) (child made \u201cregularly scheduled visits\u201d with non-custodial father); <em>Davis v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>76 N.C.App. 102, 331 S.E.2d 744, 745 (1985) (child visited non-custodial father for several overnight stays each week and stored extensive possessions with him). Appellant\u2019s continued reliance on these precedents, in the face of such distinction, is no more availing than it was below. And the case Godwin says the district court \u201coverlooked\u201d is not only distinguishable but also reaches the opposite conclusion on the residency issue. <em>See Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Carrera, </em>577 A.2d 980, 985-86 (R.I.1990) (denying coverage even though son \u201cgenerally used his mother\u2019s [mailing] address\u201d as his own). <em>Carrera </em>does not therefore alter the district court\u2019s residency analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Appellant\u2019s second ground for appeal is that, even if the district court did not err in anticipating Maryland law, it did disregard provisions of Dolores\u2019s policy in reaching its residency conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Appellant concedes that the policy\u2019s \u201cdefinitions\u201d and \u201cliability coverage\u201d sections do not speak to residency beyond their description of a covered \u201cfamily member\u201d as \u201ca resident\u201d of William and Dolores\u2019s household who is \u201crelated to [them] by blood, marriage or adoption.\u201d And appellant does not allege any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>textual basis for liability in the policy\u2019s coverage provisions. Instead, appellant argues that a section of the policy\u2019s \u201csurcharge, discount and rate classification disclosure plan\u201d for Maryland implies that the contract was meant to cover accidents such as this. Maryland law requires Farmers to disclose information on rate classifications and surcharges to reveal the company\u2019s method for calculating premiums. <em>See Md.Code Ann., Ins. </em>\u00a7 ll-214(a) (Michie 2003 Rep. Vol.) (requiring disclosure by auto insurers of \u201cthe policyholder\u2019s rate classifications\u201d and \u201ca summary\u201d of the insurer\u2019s state-approved \u201csurcharge plan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Godwin points in particular to a rate discount for \u201cyouthful drivers\u201d that is listed in the premium disclosure documentation. This discount requires, inter alia, that the \u201cyouth must be living at home unless attending and residing at a college or university,\u201d with two exceptions for independently insured youths, neither of which is applicable here. The disclosure documentation goes on to note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axv\">[a] youthful driver attending school away from home is considered a member of the insured\u2019s household unless the youth has established permanent residence elsewhere. A youthful driver attending school over 250 miles from home, without custody of the automobile, shall be considered a member of the insured\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Godwin asserts that the preceding rate provisions \u201c[manifest] the intention to include in the broad definition of an \u2018insured,\u2019 drivers who are ages 16-24 and not living at home.\u201d Stripped of its vagueness, this argument reduces to a claim that, because a rate discount is available to \u201cyouthful drivers\u201d who are \u201caway from home,\u201d disputes regarding the residency of youthful drivers should generally be resolved in favor of coverage. Quite apart from whether rate information can vary a policy\u2019s coverage in such a manner, appellant\u2019s argument simply misstates the gist of the premium discount at issue. To qualify for this discount, the \u201cyouthful driver\u201d who is not independently insured must be \u201cattending and residing at a college or university\u201d or \u201cliving at home.\u201d The latter possibility is foreclosed by our discussion of residency above. And God-win never pretends that the 17 year-old Anthony was \u201cattending and residing at a college or university\u201d at the time of the accident. We agree with appellant that a \u201ccontract should not be interpreted in a manner that disregards a meaningful part of the agreement.\u201d But a party must at least fall within the \u201cmeaningful part[\u2019s]\u201d explicit terms before invoking it in the course of a dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Godwin\u2019s argument from the text of the policy is no more meritorious than his argument from Maryland law. Like the state law argument, therefore, the textual contention cannot result in recovery here.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\"> Because Farmers is not a Maryland corporation and both Godwin and Anthony are Maryland citizens, this realignment created complete diversity of citizenship, supporting subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
