The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss because the defendants were absolutely immune from suit. Moore asserts eonclusorily that the defendants discriminated against him in applying policies and procedures to him retroactively and complains that the district court did not examine \u201cserious constitutional issue[s]\u201d contained in his complaint. He does not identify those issues. Moore\u2019s brief does not touch upon the district court\u2019s reason for granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-23\">\u201cAn appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument on the issues that are raised, in order that [this court] may know <em>what action of the district court </em>is being complained of.\u201d <em>Al-Ra\u2019id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 31 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cThere is no exemption for <em>pro se </em>litigants, though we construe their briefs liberally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Moore has briefed no argument with respect to the district court\u2019s determination that the defendants are absolutely immune, he has waived any such argument. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-24\">Moore\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and it is DISMISSED as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Moore is warned that any future frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
