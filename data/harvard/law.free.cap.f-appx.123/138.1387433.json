The Board denied the motion because it was untimely and she failed to show her counsel\u2019s conduct was prejudicial. The Board further noted Oladokun did not challenge the central issue resulting in the denial of her application for suspension of deportation. Because Oladokun\u2019s brief filed in this court does not challenge the dispositive issues with respect to the denial of her motion to reopen, she has abandoned these issues. <em>See United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999). Accordingly, this court will not review the issues. The petition for review is denied. We also deny the motion for summary affirmance. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
