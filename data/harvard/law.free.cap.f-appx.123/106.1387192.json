The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Greene that failure to timely file specific, written objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Greene failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. Greene\u2019s filed objections were entirely general and conelusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-19\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review' of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845^46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Am, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Greene has waived appellate review by failing to file objections with any specificity after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
