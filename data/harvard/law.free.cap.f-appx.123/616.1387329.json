Ighekpe argues in this court only that the fact that he overstayed his visa should not affect his eligibility for an adjustment of status. Ighekpe has abandoned the issue of removability by failing to challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that Ighekpe overstayed his visa. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-24\">Ighekpe argues that the IJ erred in finding that he is inadmissible to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he made a false claim of United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>States citizenship. The IJ\u2019s factual finding on this issue, which finding was based on a credibility determination, is supported by substantial evidence and will be upheld. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Thus, the IJ properly determined that Ighekpe is inadmissible to the United States and, therefore, ineligible for an adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1255(a), 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I). Moreover, the IJ did not abuse its discretion in finding that there is no waiver of inadmissibility applicable to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Finally, Ighekpe asserts that the IJ erroneously denied his bond request. We lack jurisdiction to consider the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of bond. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Ighekpe\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
