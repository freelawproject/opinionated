Among other violations, the Board found that TKC coercively interrogated an employee about his union status and then fired him for his activities in support of that union. Because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings, we enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">TKC was the general contractor responsible for installing the foundations of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge which spans the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia. At the peak of the project, TKC employed approximately 150 people. One of those employees was Marcus Lumpkin, a crane operator, who was hired on January 11, 2002 after responding to an ad he saw on the Internet. Lumpkin says that when he was hired, the company recruiter told him that the job would last five or six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Shortly after Lumpkin started working for TKC, the International Union of Operating Engineers (\u201cthe Union\u201d) began an organizing campaign. As part of their effort, Union organizers handed out literature at the entrance to the job site. In early February, Lumpkin spoke with Union representatives and agreed to occasionally pass out handbills before work. He placed a union sticker on his hard hat and one on his car bumper.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">On February 7, 2002, Lumpkin had a conversation with John Mayer, a TKC area manager, about Lumpkin\u2019s intentions to join the Union. According to Lumpkin, Mayer asked him if he was a member of the Union. When Lumpkin responded that he hoped to be, Mayer rudely asked\u2014 with profanity \u2014 why anyone would want to do such a thing. Mayer does not recall this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">One week later, on February 14, 2002, Mayer laid off Lumpkin, explaining that he was no longer needed. TKC claims that Lumpkin was fired because the company had recently dismantled a crane, and thus had more crane operators than it needed. However, Lumpkin testified that immediately after he was fired, Mayer again asked him if he had joined the Union. After hearing that Lumpkin had not yet done so, Mayer apparently replied, \u2018Well tell them to get you a job,\u201d and walked away. Mayer denies having said this.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">Lumpkin further testified that on the following day, February 15, he went to Mayer to ask about a discrepancy in his paycheck. According to Lumpkin, Mayer asked if any of his \u201cboys\u201d had found Lumpkin a job yet. When Lumpkin said no, Mayer replied, Well, tell them to stay the hell away from my gate.\u201d Mayer again denies these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">Upset over Lumpkin\u2019s layoff, the Union distributed petitions protesting TKC\u2019s decision to fire him. To spotlight its complaints over TKC\u2019s labor practices, the Union organized a strike and a picket line outside the project\u2019s entrance gates on April 18, 2002. Two crane operators\u2014 Daniel McVicker and William Cunningham \u2014 participated in the protest and did not report to work that day. TKC issued written warnings to Cunningham and McVicker for their unexcused absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">Following these events, the Union filed charges with the NLRB, accusing TKC of committing unfair labor practices. A two-day hearing on the issue was held before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>an Administrative Law Judge from April 28-29, 2003. On October 17, 2003, the Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings and determined that TKC had violated the National Labor Relations Act in three separate ways. First, the Board found that TKC violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act by coercively interrogating Lumpkin on February 7. Second, it found TKC to have violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (a)(1) of the Act by laying off Lumpkin because of his activities in support of the Union and by impermissibly implying as much to him. And finally, the Board found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act by issuing disciplinary warnings to McVicker and Cunningham for engaging in protected activity. TKC now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Board\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive \u201cif supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C \u00a7 160(e) (2000). <em>See also Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 487-88, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). In short, we must decide \u201cwhether on this record it would have been possible for a reasonable jury to reach the Board\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Serv. Inc., v. NLRB, </em>522 U.S. 359, 366, 118 S.Ct. 818, 139 L.Ed.2d 797 (1998). The same deferential standard of review applies to the Board\u2019s determinations of mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Sam\u2019s Club v. NLRB, </em>173 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Such deference is particularly appropriate when reviewing determinations of credibility. Because \u201cthe balancing of the credibility of witnesses is at the heart of the fact-finding process, ... it is normally not the role of reviewing courts to second-guess a fact-finder\u2019s determinations about who was the more truthful witness.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Transpersonnel, Inc., </em>349 F.3d 175, 184 (4th Cir.2003). Thus, \u201cabsent exceptional circumstances, the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings when adopted by the Board are to be accepted by the reviewing court.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>717 F.2d 141, 145 (4th Cir.1983) (internal quotation and punctuation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">In this case, an ALJ heard testimony from all witnesses, and authored a thorough opinion defending his conclusions. This opinion was subsequently adopted by the Board. <em>TKC, </em>340 N.L.R.B. 102 (2003). As to the February 7, 2004 encounter between Lumpkin and Mayer, the ALJ found Lumpkin\u2019s \u201cdemeanor\u201d and \u201cdetailed\u201d testimony to be more believable than Mayer\u2019s denial. For similar reasons, the ALJ credited Lumpkin\u2019s version of events on February 14, 2002, the day he was fired, finding him to be a \u201cmore credible witness than Mayer.\u201d Thus, in light of the hostile encounters between Lumpkin and Mayer and in accordance with the test outlined in <em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. 1083 (1980), the ALJ rejected TKC\u2019s claim that it fired Lumpkin simply because the company had no work for him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The ALJ also considered the claim that Lumpkin\u2019s co-workers, McVicker and Cunningham, were improperly punished after they missed work to protest Lumpkin\u2019s dismissal. The ALJ was persuaded that these two employees were in fact disciplined for engaging in protected activity. Applying, as we must, a deferential standard of review to this conclusion, we find no error in the ALJ\u2019s application of Supreme Court precedent to the facts of this case. <em>See NLRB v. Washington Aluminum Co., </em>370 U.S. 9, 16-17, 82 S.Ct. 1099, 8 L.Ed.2d 298 (1962) (governing permissible discipline of employees after a concerted work stoppage with no prior notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">We have reviewed the record, briefs, and applicable case law on this matter, and we have had the benefit of oral argument. Our careful review persuades us that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s October 17, 2003 order shall be <em>ENFORCED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
