Supp.App. C, amend. 599 (2002) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Amendment 599 does not apply to appellant\u2019s sentence. Appellant\u2019s additional arguments, which appear to be based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), were not presented to the district court and are therefore not properly before us. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>69 F.3d 1215, 1219 (1st Cir. 1995). In any event, we note that appellant did not receive a \u00a7 3C1.2 sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for reduction of sentence. However, in accordance with the government\u2019s request, we <em>remand </em>the case for the limited purpose of allowing the government to seek dismissal of the charge brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e), as contemplated in the plea agreement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
