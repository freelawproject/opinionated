He has also moved to expedite our ruling on that petition. Naser argues that his checking the \u201ccitizen or national\u201d box on two 1-9 Employment Eligibility Verification forms for the purpose of securing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>private employment was an insufficient basis on which to find him inadmissible. He further argues that the BIA\u2019s decision to utilize its summary affirmance procedures was inappropriate in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Naser had not borne his burden of showing that he was \u201cclearly and beyond doubt\u201d not inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, 78 </em>F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A). The issue whether Naser is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) is pretermitted in light of the determination that substantial evidence supported the finding that he was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). Finally, we reject Naser\u2019s argument that we must review the BIA\u2019s use of its streamlined review process. <em>See Garciar-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">PETITION AND MOTION TO EXPEDITE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
