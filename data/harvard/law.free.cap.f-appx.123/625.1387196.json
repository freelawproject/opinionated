Garniea asserts that the IJ erred by ruling that she had not demonstrated that the father of her son, Eduardo, had subjected him to \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d by failing to support him, financially or otherwise. The respondent contends that we lack subject-matter jurisdiction to review \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d determinations and, alternatively, that the IJ\u2019s ruling was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), we lack jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, but retain jurisdiction over purely legal and non-discretionary questions. <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir. 2003). We have never had occasion to determine whether \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d decisions are discretionary, but we have held that \u201cextreme hardship\u201d decisions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b are discretionary because the term extreme hardship is \u201c \u2018not self-explanatory, and reasonable men could easily differ as to their construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1013 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). The only circuit to address this issue directly held that \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d involves an objective, \u201cclinical\u201d standard for evaluating domestic violence and that \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d decisions are non-discretionary, factual determinations subject to judicial review. <em>See Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>345 F.3d 824, 833-35 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">We need not resolve the jurisdictional question in this case because Garnica is not entitled to relief. <em>See Hernandez-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell, </em>118 F.3d 1034, 1045-46 <em>&amp; </em>n. 16 (5th Cir.1997). If, on the one hand, the term \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d is expansive enough to encompass parental neglect, then the term is \u201c \u2018not self-explanatory, and reasonable men could easily differ as to their construction\u2019 \u201d <em>Moosa, </em>171 F.3d at 1013 (citation omitted), making \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d decisions discretionary determinations. As such, we would lack jurisdiction to consider Garnica\u2019s petition. <em>See id. </em>On the other hand, if, as determined in <em>Hernandez, </em>345 F.3d at 833-35, \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d is an objective measure of domestic violence, then the IJ did not err in denying Garnica\u2019s application because she failed to show that Eduardo was a victim of domestic violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>constituting extreme cruelty. Accordingly, Garnica\u2019s petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
