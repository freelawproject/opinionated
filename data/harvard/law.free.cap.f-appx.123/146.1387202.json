Fink appeals the district court\u2019s judgment denying her motion for summary judgment, granting the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, and affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying her applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income (SSI) benefits. Ida J. Rochester appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying Rochester\u2019s application for SSI benefits. The appeals have been consolidated. In reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s decisions to deny benefits, we must determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the decisions and whether the proper legal standards were used in evaluating the evidence. <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">Fink argues that the Commissioner violated 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(e)(1) and (0 by ordering a consultative examination (CE) without first recontacting the treating physicians for an explanation of any perceived discrepancies in the medical records. Both Fink and Rochester contend that the Commissioner also violated 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1519h by failing to appoint a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>treating physician to perform the CE. Fink and Rochester next challenge the proceedings at their respective administrative hearings, arguing that the administrative law judges (ALJs) violated 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1512(e) and 404.1527(d)(2) by fading to 1) recontact the treating physicians and 2) consider the necessary regulatory factors when declining to afford controlling weight to the treating physicians\u2019 opinions. Rochester also argues that the ALJ erred by failing to address the written statement of her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Because Fink and Rochester were afforded the opportunity to supplement their respective records with additional medical reports from their treating physicians, we hold that any procedural errors committed by the Commissioner were harmless and did not affect Fink\u2019s or Rochester\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 335 (5th Cir. 1988). Similarly, Fink\u2019s and Rochester\u2019s reliance upon <em>Newton v. Apfel </em>for purposes of their alleged ALJ procedural errors is misplaced since the records for both Fink and Rochester contained \u201cother medical opinion evidence based on personal examination\u201d in the form of the CE reports. <em>See </em>209 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, we hold that the ALJs did not commit error when declining to afford controlling weight to the treating physicians\u2019 opinions. Finally, we reject Rochester\u2019s argument regarding the ALJ\u2019s failure to address her sister\u2019s written statement as conclusional and lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The records reveal that the ALJs\u2019 decisions to deny benefits were supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Martinez v. Chater, </em>64 F.3d 172, 173 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
