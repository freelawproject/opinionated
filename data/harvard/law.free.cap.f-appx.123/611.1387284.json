The summary-judgment evidence reflected that Matthews\u2019s claim had accrued by late 1998, by which time Matthews\u2019s parole officer had informed him that the blue warrant had actually been revoked in May 1997, 10 months before Matthews was initially informed of the rev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ocation and released on bond. <em>See Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The limitations period expired two years after the claim accrued in late 1998. <em>Hitt v. Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2002). Matthews was not entitled to state-law tolling for \u201cfraudulent concealment,\u201d because he was aware of the facts necessary to know that the claim existed. <em>See Booker v. Real Homes, Inc., </em>103 S.W.3d 487, 493 (Tex.Ct.App.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Matthews\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, <em>see Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986); his motion to compel discovery, <em>see King v. Dogan, </em>31 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1994); and his motion for leave to amend his complaint. <em>See Ashe v. Corley, </em>992 F.2d 540, 542 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
