The order denied his motion to reopen and reconsider the Board\u2019s dismissal of his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) order denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Anja contends that he established eligibility for asylum. As the IJ and Board concluded that the asylum application was untimely, we find that consideration of Anja\u2019s asylum claim is barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). Additionally, we have reviewed the evidence of record and find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion to reopen and reconsider with respect to the relief of withholding of removal. <em>See Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Finally, we find that Anja\u2019s CAT claim, which was entirely undeveloped in his brief before this court, has been abandoned. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
