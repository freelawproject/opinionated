An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) reviewed Amick\u2019s claim, found that Amick had established a material change in condition since his prior black lung benefits claim, and awarded benefits. Because the ALJ found that the evidence did not establish the month of onset of total disability, the ALJ applied the default entitlement date provided for in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.503 (2002) and made benefits payable beginning with the month that the claim was filed. The Benefits Review Board (Board) affirmed, with one judge dissenting. Westmoreland Coal Company now petitions for review of the Board\u2019s order. Because the ALJ\u2019s factual findings regarding the credibility of the various doctors are not supported by substantial evidence, we vacate the Board\u2019s order and remand to the ALJ to reconsider the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">Amick worked in the coal mine industry for approximately thirty-five years. He had various jobs, including working as a truck driver, mechanic, electrician, dozer operator, timberman, cutting machine operator, and scoop operator. The last eleven years of his coal mine employment were with Westmoreland where he ran a supply motor, which involved loading and unloading roof bolts, timbers, and other supplies. Amick retired in 1983. Amick filed his first claim for benefits in 1980. That claim was denied in 1981 because the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>did not establish total disability due to pneumoconiosis. Amick filed his second claim on April 15,1983. This second claim was denied because Amick failed to appear at a hearing or respond to a show cause order. Amick filed this claim, his third, on March 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The record contains reports from nine doctors, all of whom agree that Amick is \u201ctotally disabled\u201d as defined by federal regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(1) (defining total disability as \u201cpulmonary or respiratory impairment\u201d preventing a miner from performing coal mine work). The medical reports conflict, however, as to the cause of Amick\u2019s disability. Amick\u2019s doctors \u2014 Drs. Koenig, Cohen, and Rasmussen \u2014 opine that his disability is due, at least in part, to his coal mine employment. The employer\u2019s doctors \u2014 Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, Castle, Daniel, Spagnolo, and Morgan \u2014 uniformly opine that Amick\u2019s disability is due to Amick\u2019s habit of smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes per day for nearly forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The ALJ discredited reports from several of the employer\u2019s doctors \u201c[b]ased on the failure of these physicians to discuss whether or not Claimant\u2019s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was related to his coal mine employment.\u201d (J.A. at 623.) The ALJ also noted that the employer\u2019s doctors \u201cwere discussing the presence of simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis as demonstrated on chest X-ray\u201d and not \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d (J.A. at 623.) Finally, the ALJ discredited Dr. Morgan\u2019s opinion because it was \u201ccontradictory to the Act.\u201d (J.A. at 624.) The ALJ credited Dr. Koenig\u2019s report because it gave a \u201cvery thorough and complete discussion of Claimant\u2019s pulmonary condition.\u201d (J.A. at 623. ) The ALJ also found Dr. Koenig\u2019s report to be the \u201cbest reasoned.\u201d (J.A. at 624. ) Based on this weighing of the medical reports, the ALJ determined that Amick had proven a material change in condition since his last claim for benefits, and on a review of all of the evidence, the ALJ awarded benefits. The Board affirmed, with one judge dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Westmoreland now petitions for review, arguing that the ALJ erred by (1) failing to make a factual finding that Amick\u2019s claim was timely; (2) applying certain amended regulations to Amick\u2019s claim, which was pending on the date the regulations became effective; (3) applying the wrong test to determine whether Amick established a material change in condition; (4) weighing the medical opinion evidence; and (5) applying the default entitlement date found in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.503.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">We consider first Westmoreland\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by failing to make a factual finding that Amick\u2019s claim was timely. Section 725.308 provides that \u201c[a] claim for benefits ... shall be filed within three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis which has been communicated to the miner....\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.308(a). Although Westmoreland argued that Amick\u2019s claim was untimely, the ALJ made no explicit findings regarding the timeliness of Amick\u2019s claim. On appeal before the Board, Westmoreland once again argued that Amick\u2019s claim was untimely. The Board reviewed the evidence and held that Amick\u2019s claim was timely because the time limitations do not apply to duplicate claims and because even assuming that the time limits apply, \u201cthis claim would not be time-barred because a review of the record before us fails to demonstrate that claimant received a <em>written </em>diagnosis of totally disabling pneumoconiosis.\u201d (J.A. at 632 (emphasis added).) The Board did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>mention the ALJ\u2019s failure to address the timeliness issue, but apparently considered the ALJ\u2019s decision on the merits to be a rejection of Westmoreland\u2019s timeliness arguments. Westmoreland now argues that the ALJ\u2019s failure to make explicit findings regarding the timeliness of Amick\u2019s claim requires remand. Alternatively, Westmoreland argues that the Board erred in requiring the communication with the miner to be written.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Section 921(c) of Title 33, as incorporated by 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 932 (West 2000), provides us with jurisdiction to entertain this petition. That section provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the Board may obtain a review of that order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred.... [T]he court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall have the power to give a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Board and enforcing same to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c)(2001). Although this statute does not set out the standard of review in this court, we are guided by the fact that the Board must affirm the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are \u201csupported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(b)(3); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.301 (2001). Thus, when reviewing a claim for benefits under the BLBA, \u201c[w]e undertake an independent review of the record, as in the place of the Board, to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were based on substantial evidence in the record. We review questions of law de novo.\u201d <em>Toler v. Eastern Associated Coal Co., </em>43 F.3d 109, 114 (4th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Turning to the Board\u2019s holdings, the Board first held that the time limitations in 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 932(f) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.308 do not apply to duplicate claims. (J.A. at 632.) Neither the statute nor the regulation, however, makes any distinction between initial and duplicate claims. The statute refers to \u201c[a]ny\u201d claim for benefits and the regulation refers to \u201c[a] claim\u201d for benefits. Based on this language, the Director, to whom we accord substantial deference in the interpretation of the regulations, <em>Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 680, 697, 111 S.Ct. 2524, 115 L.Ed.2d 604 (1991), advocates application of the time limitation to duplicate claims as well as initial claims, and we agree. In the context of duplicate claims, we agree with the Tenth Circuit that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">a final finding by an Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Program adjudicator [or other final adjudicator] that the claimant is not totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis repudiates any earlier medical determination to the contrary and renders prior medical advice to the contrary ineffective to trigger the running of the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-9\"><em>Wyoming Fuel Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Program, </em>90 F.3d 1502, 1507 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Perhaps anticipating that we would hold that the time limitations apply to duplicate claims, the Board held in the alternative that Amiek\u2019s claim was timely because there was no evidence of a <em>ivritten </em>diagnosis communicated to Amick more than three years before he filed his claim. Westmoreland argues that this holding is erroneous because there is no requirement that the miner receive a <em>written </em>communication of his diagnosis. We need not resolve this issue, however, because, as discussed below, Westmoreland does not cite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>to any evidence, written or otherwise to trigger the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Amick filed his claim in March 2000. Accordingly, his claim is untimely if Westmoreland can show that a diagnosis of total disability due to pneumoconiosis was communicated to him before March 1997. The evidence related to the timeliness issue is not in dispute, although the parties draw different inferences from that evidence. The Progress Notes from the Rainelle Medical Center show a diagnosis of \u201cBlack Lung 20%\u201d in 1995 and \u201c + CWP\u2014 35 yrs in mines\u201d in 1996, (J.A. at 30, 31), but the Progress Notes do not mention whether Amick was totally disabled or whether the diagnosis was communicated to Amick. At the hearing before the ALJ, on June 12, 2002, Westmoreland elicited testimony from Amick regarding diagnoses from Drs. Klamath and Salvador. According to Amick\u2019s testimony, Dr. Klamath told him he was totally disabled by Black Lung \u201cprobably two or three years ago,\u201d (J.A. at 594), and Dr. Salvador told him there was \u201csomething wrong with [his] lungs ... probably been four years ago.\u201d (J.A. at 595.) When asked whether Dr. Salvador told him that he was disabled, Amick testified, \u201cI just don\u2019t remember whether he told me at that time or not.\u201d (J.A. at 596.) Based on Amick\u2019s testimony in June 2002, the communication from Dr. Salvador would have taken place around June 1998, and the communication from Dr. Klamath would have taken place around 1999 or 2000. Because none of these dates is more than three years before Amick filed this claim for benefits, Westmoreland has not carried its burden to show that Amick\u2019s claim was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Ideally, the ALJ would have made explicit the factual finding that the communication from Dr. Klamath and/or Dr. Salvador occurred in 1998 at the earliest. Because we find, however, that this is the only permissible inference to be drawn from the undisputed evidence, we find that the ALJ\u2019s failure to make these factual findings is harmless error. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 190 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that appeals courts need not reverse agency action because of a harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">We turn next to Westmoreland\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred in applying certain amended regulations to Amick\u2019s claim. The Secretary revised Parts 718 and 725 of the black lung regulations in 2001. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Parts 718 and 725 (2004). The amended regulations became effective on January 19, 2001. With the exception of certain sections identified in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.2(c), the amended regulations apply to claims pending as of January 19, 2001. It is undisputed that the Secretary did not have the authority to promulgate retroactive rules. Accordingly, the only question is whether the challenged regulations are, in fact, retroactive. Westmoreland argues that all of the amendments are impermissibly retroactive as applied to claims pending as of January 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">As an initial matter, we note that the D.C. Circuit considered in some detail challenges to specific amended black lung regulations and found several of the amended regulations to be impermissibly retroactive. <em>See Nat. Mining Ass\u2019n v. Dept. of Labor, </em>292 F.3d 849 (D.C.Cir. 2002). The ALJ in this case, however, did not apply any of the regulations that the D.C. Circuit found to be impermissibly retroactive. (J.A. at 620 \u201cI will apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>sections of the newly revised version of Part 718 (i.e. subparts A, C, and D) and 725 that took effect on January 19, 2001 that the court did not find impermissibly retroactive to the facts of the instant matter.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">We stated the general framework for a retroactivity analysis in <em>Chambers v. Reno, </em>307 F.3d 284 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">A new statute does not produce a retroactive effect \u201cmerely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 269. The question instead is \u201cwhether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270. A statute would attach new legal consequences to prior events if its application \u201cwould impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3n\"><em>Chambers, </em>307 F.3d at 289. The only properly raised argument Westmoreland makes is that under amended 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.101(b), different quality standards applied to Dr. Rasmussen\u2019s examination of Amick on June 23, 2000, and Dr. Zaldivar\u2019s examination of Amick on January 24, 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16.) Westmoreland, however, fails to elaborate on how this regulation impaired its rights, increased its liability, or imposed new duties. Westmoreland does not mention any other specific regulation. We decline to review all of the amended regulations searching for some retroactive effect in the absence of any argument from Westmoreland regarding what new legal consequences the regulations impose. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing abandonment of issues under Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9) when Appellant fails properly to raise and discuss issues in his opening brief). Moreover, we note that the ALJ did not fault Westmoreland for failing to comply with any of the amended regulations. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in applying the amended regulations to Amick\u2019s claim that was pending on January 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Westmoreland next argues that the ALJ applied the wrong test to determine whether Amick established a material change in condition. Westmoreland argues that, when considering a duplicate claim, the ALJ must consider the old and new evidence together to determine whether a material change in condition occurred. Westmoreland\u2019s argument is entirely without merit. In this circuit, all that a miner must do to show a material change in condition is <em>\u201cprove, </em>under all of the probative medical evidence of his condition <em>after </em>the prior denial, at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him.\u201d <em>Lisa Lee Mines v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>86 F.3d 1358, 1362 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1090, 117 S.Ct. 763, 136 L.Ed.2d 711 (1997) (emphasis in original). We specifically rejected the Sixth Circuit\u2019s further requirement in <em>Sharondale Corp. v. Ross, </em>42 F.3d 993, 999 (6th Cir. 1994) of \u201cconsideration of the evidence behind the earlier denial to determine whether it \u2018differ[s] qualitatively from the new evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1363 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">Westmoreland argues that the ALJ erred in determining that Amick estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>lished the existence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the evidence because the ALJ erred in determining which physicians\u2019 opinions to credit. We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">The ALJ is charged with making factual findings, including evaluating the credibility of witnesses and weighing contradicting evidence.... Accordingly, we must affirm the Board if it properly determined that the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, keeping in mind that \u201ca reviewing body may not set aside an inference merely because it finds the opposite conclusion more reasonable or because it questions the factual basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\"><em>Doss v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>58 F.3d 654, 658-59 (4th Cir. 1995) (quoting <em>Smith v. Director, OWCP, </em>843 F.2d 1053,1057 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">To establish eligibility for benefits under 20 C.F.R. Part 718, a claimant must prove that (1) he has pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment; (3) he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition; and (4) pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability. Section 718.202(a) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">[a] finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis may be made as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">(1) A chest X-ray conducted and classified in accordance with \u00a7 718.102 may form the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">(2) A biopsy or autopsy conducted and reported in compliance with \u00a7 718.106 may be the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">(3) If the presumptions described in \u00a7\u00a7 718.304, 718.305 or \u00a7 718.306 are applicable, it shall be presumed that the miner is or was suffering from pneumoconiosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">(4) A determination of the existence of pneumoconiosis may also be made if a physician, exercising sound medical judgment, notwithstanding a negative X-ray, finds that the miner suffers or suffered from pneumoconiosis as defined in \u00a7 718.201. Any such finding shall be based on objective medical evidence such as blood-gas studies, electrocardiograms, pulmonary function studies, physical performance tests, physical examination, and medical and work histories. Such a finding shall be supported by a reasoned medical opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a) (2004). There were no autopsy or biopsy findings in this case, and none of the presumptions apply. Accordingly, the ALJ was left with the X-ray evidence and the medical opinion evidence. The ALJ concluded that the X-ray evidence was evenly balanced, and thus, did not establish pneumoconiosis. (J.A. at 622.) The ALJ then considered the medical opinion evidence, including the medical reports of Drs. Zaldivar, Spagnolo, Stewart, Castle, Daniel, Morgan, Koenig, Rasmussen, and Cohen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">Westmoreland first argues that the ALJ erred by discrediting Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, Castle, and Daniel based on the erroneous finding that they failed to address whether coal mine dust exposure contributed to Amick\u2019s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The ALJ held that \u201c[bjased on the failure of these physicians to discuss whether or not Claimant\u2019s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>related to his coal mine employment, I accord less weight to their conclusions regarding the presence of pneumoconiosis since chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is encompassed within the definition of pneumoconiosis for purposes of entitlement to Black Lung benefits.\u201d (J.A. at 623.) This finding is not supported by substantial evidence. A review of the record reveals that Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, and Castle each found that Amick\u2019s COPD was <em>not </em>related to his coal mine employment. <em>(See </em>J.A. at 248 (Zaldivar \u2014 \u201cThere is no evidence of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, <em>nor any dust disease of the lungs </em>in this case.\u201d) (emphasis added); J.A. at 282 <em>(Castle </em>\u2014 \u201cThese <em>findings are not in keeping with coal mine dust induced lung disease.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); J.A. at 352 (Stewart \u2014 \u201c[T]his disability impairment is secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from smoking as well as the asthmatic component. <em>It is not related in whole or in part secondary to coal dust exposure </em>or coal workers pneumoconiosis.\u201d (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The Board appears to have recognized that the ALJ\u2019s finding was factually incorrect because it noted that \u201c[fjurther review of the administrative law judge\u2019s Decision and Order ... shows that he was aware that these doctors discussed the cause of claimant\u2019s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that he fully set forth his reasons for finding that their conclusions that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was due to smoking, not coal mine employment, were unreasoned.\u201d (J.A. at 635.) It is true that \u201cfurther review\u201d of the ALJ\u2019s decision reveals passages in the \u201cMedical Evidence\u201d section where the ALJ noted that the doctors opined that Amick\u2019s COPD was not due to coal dust exposure, but the ALJ was merely describing the reports in this section and not weighing the evidence. When giving his reasons for discrediting the doctors\u2019 opinions, the ALJ specifically relied on the failure of the doctors to discuss the etiology of Amick\u2019s COPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The ALJ also discredited Dr. Spagnolo and several other physicians<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for failing to consider the medical literature cited by Dr. Koenig and for discussing only the presence of simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis as demonstrated on chest X-ray. According to the ALJ, \u201c[tjhey did not ... discuss legal pneumoconiosis, nor did they counter Dr. Koening\u2019s [sic] findings that the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease present was due, at least in part, to coal mine employment and coal dust exposure.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (J.A. at 623.) First, as the dissenting Board judge noted, if a physician provides a reasoned opinion based on his evaluation of the evidence, he need not also address the conclusions of other physicians. Second, as discussed above, the factual finding that Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, and Castle did not address legal pneumo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>coniosis is simply incorrect. Dr. Spagnolo also considered whether legal pneumoconiosis was present. <em>(See </em>J.A. at 319 (Spagnolo\u2014 \u201cMr. Amick does not have a chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary impairment arising out of coalmine [sic] employment and further <em>he does not have any chronic disease of the lung arising from his coal mine employment\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The Board attempted to bolster the ALJ\u2019s findings by concluding that the ALJ \u201cimplicitly\u201d found that Spagnolo, Zaldivar, and Castle erred by not considering the progressive nature of pneumoconiosis. (J.A. at 635-36.) The ALJ, however, did not give this as a reason for discrediting the doctors\u2019 opinions, and we must \u201cjudge the propriety of the [ALJ\u2019s] action solely by the grounds invoked by the [ALJ].\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery, </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 5. Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (sustaining SEC order upon review of the Commission\u2019s grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Westmoreland also argues that the ALJ erred in discrediting Dr. Morgan. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion with regard to Dr. Morgan suffers from the same flaw as its conclusions regarding the other physicians. The ALJ discredited Dr. Morgan\u2019s report as contradictory to the Act because \u201c[h]e stated the medical authorities and studies which he credits are against a finding that emphysema and airway obstruction are related to coal mine employment.\u201d (J.A. at 624.) As the Board recognized, Dr. Morgan\u2019s report was not contradictory to the Act because \u201cDr. Morgan did not state that an obstructive impairment could not arise out of coal mine employment,\u201d he merely stated that <em>Amide\u2019s </em>obstructive component did not arise out of coal mine employment. (J.A. at 636; <em>See </em>J.A. at 387 (Morgan\u2019s report \u2014 \u201c[C]oal miners develop airways obstruction and bronchitis. They also develop focal dust emphysema. The latter, however, is not the same condition as is eentriacinar emphysema which results from cigarette smoking.\u201d).) The Board tries to fix the ALJ\u2019s error by holding that the ALJ also discredited Dr. Morgan because he based his opinion on the lack of radiographic evidence of dust disease and the progressive nature of Amiek\u2019s disease. The ALJ\u2019s opinion shows that the ALJ was aware of the contents of Dr. Morgan\u2019s opinion, but the only reason given by the ALJ for discrediting him is that his opinion was contradictory to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Although the Board\u2019s conclusions about the credibility of the doctors might be supported by substantial evidence,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is the ALJ\u2019s factual findings that we must review. The reasons that the ALJ gave for discrediting the doctors\u2019 opinions are not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we vacate the ALJ\u2019s decision and remand for reconsideration of the medical opinion evidence. We note that on remand, the ALJ should be more explicit about the relative credentials of the doctors as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">Because we vacate the award of benefits, we need not address Westmoreland\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by awarding benefits payable beginning with the month in which Amick filed his claim, pursuant to the default entitlement date provided for in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.503.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the award of benefits and remand to the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>for reconsideration of the medical opinion evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.308(c), claims for benefits are presumed to be timely, and the employer bears the burden of production that a claim is untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>. </em>Westmoreland\u2019s only other explanation of how this regulation impaired its rights was raised for the first time in oral argument. Westmoreland argued that the application of revised 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.101(b) allowed the ALJ to discredit Dr. Spagnolo\u2019s opinion because Dr. Spagnolo believed pneumoconiosis to be a progressive disease only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-11\">. We note that after determining that the medical opinion evidence supported a finding of pneumoconiosis, the ALJ properly considered the medical opinion evidence together with the equivocal X-ray evidence to determine whether pneumoconiosis was present. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-5\">. The ALJ does not make clear which other physicians he includes with Dr. Spagnolo.
