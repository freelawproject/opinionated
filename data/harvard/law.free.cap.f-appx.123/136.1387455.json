The record reveals, however, that the Board found Wijaya\u2019s asylum application untimely. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Wijaya\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-23\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the denial of Wijaya\u2019s asylum claim, we can review denial of his request for withholding of removal, which is not subject to the one-year time limit on asylum claims. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430,104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that Wijaya has failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-24\">We deny Wijaya\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-17\"> Wijaya raises no claims concerning the Board\u2019s treatment of his Convention Against Torture claim with this court. Therefore, we deem the claim abandoned. <em>See United. States </em>v. <em>Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
