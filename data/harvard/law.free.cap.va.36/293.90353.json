The defendant appealed from that decree to this court; by which, on the 1st April 1828, the decree was affirmed, with some modifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">Immediately after the cause got back to the court of chancery, namely, on the 26th April 1828, upon a suggestion of the plaintiffs, that, since the decree of September 1817, and while the cause was pending in the court of appeals, a slave named <em>James, </em>one of the descendants of the woman <em>Kate, </em>had been given by the defendant <em>John Fox </em>to his son <em>Elijah Fox, </em>subject to the claim of the plaintiffs, and that slave had come to and was now in the possession of <em>Yeatmans Smith </em>(the now appellant),\u2014the court made a rule upon <em>Smith </em>to deliver the slave <em>James </em>to the marshal of the court to be by him delivered to the plaintiffs, unless he should shew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>cause to the contrary at the next term. This rule was served on <em>Smith: </em>but it appeared that no further proceedings were had on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7m\">The order for the account directed by the decree of was then pUf; \u00a1n(:o harKjs 0f a commissioner of the court to be executed. The commissioner made a report in February 1829, by which it appeared, that there was a large amount of profits of the slaves in question for which the defendant <em>Fox </em>was accountable, and that some of the slaves had been sold, among whom were the above mentioned slave <em>James </em>and another named <em>Henry, </em>and the proceeds of the sales, <em>exclusive of the proceeds of the sale of Henry, </em>amounted to 1326 dollars. And the cause coming on for hearing, on the report, in May 1829, the court decreed, that the defendant should pay one moiety of the sum due for profits, and one moiety of the 1326 dollars, proceeds of the sales of slaves <em>exclusive of Henry, </em>to the administrator of <em>Browne, </em>and the other moieties to the administrator of <em>Morton; </em>(that is, the court decreed, that <em>Fox </em>should pay those parties the proceeds of the sale of the slave <em>James, </em>but not those of the slave Henry); \u201c the plaintiffs waiving any decree against <em>Fox </em>for the value of the slave <em>Henry, </em>and reserving liberty to apply for further relief against <em>Fox </em>as to that slave.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">In June 1835, the circuit superiour court of <em>Spotsylvania, </em>(to which the execution of the decrees of the former court of chancery of <em>Fredericlcsburg </em>appertained),\u2014 on the motion of the administrators of <em>Browne </em>and <em>Morton, </em>the now appellees, suggesting that since the decree of September 1817, the two slaves <em>James </em>and <em>Henry, </em>descendants of the slave <em>Kate, </em>had been transferred from the possession of the defendant <em>John Fox </em>to his son <em>Flijah Fox, </em>and had since come to the possession of <em>Yeatmans Smith, </em>the now appellant,\u2014made a rule upon <em>Smith </em>to shew cause at the next term of the court, why he should not be ordered to deliver the slaves <em>James </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Henry </em>to the appellees, and to account for the profits thereof since they came to his hands, or submit to such other order in the premises as the court should think proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">The facts of the case appearing on this rule, collected from the answer of <em>Smith </em>thereto, and the evidence of witnesses, were as follows\u2014The slave <em>James </em>was taken by the sheriff and sold under an execution against <em>Elijah Fox, </em>in 1827, and was purchased at the sheriff's sale, by <em>Smith, </em>who had ever since and still held possession of him. As to the other slave <em>Henry, </em>he was conveyed by a deed of trust in January 1827, to a trustee, to secure a debt due to <em>Smith: </em>and afterwards, during the same year, this slave was in <em>Smith's </em>possession for one or two days, and <em>Smith </em>desired and intended to purchase him ; but it appeared he did not; for the slave was taken sick, declared he would not live with <em>Smith, </em>ran <em>off, </em>and returned to the farm of <em>Fox; </em>and then <em>Fox </em>sold him to one <em>Alsop, </em>and <em>Smith </em>had him carried from <em>Fox's </em>farm and delivered <em>to Alsop, who, by Fox\u2019s directions, </em>paid the purchase money to <em>Smith. Smith </em>had no actual notice of the decree of September 1817, whereby these slaves were declared to be the property of the appellees, or that they had any claim to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">The circuit superiour court was of opinion, that <em>Smith </em>was liable for the slaves <em>James </em>and <em>Henry, </em>as the purchaser thereof <em>pendente lite, </em>and therefore made the rule absolute, and directed <em>Smith to </em>deliver the slave <em>James </em>to the appellees, and to pay them 350 dollars the purchase money of the slave <em>Henry, </em>which he had received from <em>Alsop; </em>but the court refused to make <em>Smith </em>account for the profits of <em>James, </em>or for interest on the purchase money he had received <em>for Henry. From </em>which order, this court, upon the petition of <em>Smith, </em>allowed him an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-12\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-13\"><em>Moncure </em>and <em>Harrison, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A158\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Av1W\">The plaintiffs in equity, by proceeding to take a decree against <em>Fox </em>for the <em>value </em>of the slave <em>James, </em>abandoned their proceeding <em>in rem, </em>and could not afterwards proceed for the specific property against the pUrc}jaser <em>pendente lite, </em>as the title of the slave was changed by a decree for his value. As to <em>Henry, </em>he was sold by <em>Fox </em>to <em>Alsop; </em>and as <em>Smith </em>was in the transaction neither buyer nor seller, he is not liable to refund the proceeds, though the same may have been paid over to him in satisfaction of his claim against <em>Fox.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The order is to be reversed, and the rule discharged, -with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
