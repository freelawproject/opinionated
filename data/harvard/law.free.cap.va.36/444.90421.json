Whereupon the counsel for the tenants moved the court to instruct the jury, that unless they were satisfied, from the evidence, that all the heirs of <em>William Bartly </em>deceased were made demandants, they should find a verdict for the tenants. But the court, being of opinion that the tenants had, by joining the mise, admitted that the demandants were the heirs of <em>William Bartly </em>deceased, and could not prove the existence of other heirs than those named, in order to defeat the demandants, except on a plea in abatement, refused to give the instruction asked. To which opinion the tenants excepted. Verdict and <em>judgment were </em>rendered for the demandants; and the tenants obtained a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-5\"><em>B. R. Johnston, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgWK\">argued, that the matter to which the evidence applied, respected the title of the demandants and the extent of their interests in the land. If those before the court shewed title only to a part, they could recover only to that extent. In this case, no title was shewn to the interest of the heir who was not named ; and the judgment, to the extent of that interest, was therefore erroneous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-6\"><em>David Ml Comas, </em>for the defendants in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_r\">insisted, that the authorities fully sustained the proposition, that if one of the heirs were not named, it was matter in abatement only, and could not be taken advantage of at the trial.
