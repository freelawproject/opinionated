The <em>first </em>count alleged, that the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid, </em>by his promissory note in writing, was indebted to the plaintiff\u2019 <em>one of the legatees of Circle, </em>in the sum of 459 dollars, the balance due the plain tiff .as <em>such legatee </em>from the defendant <em>as executor as aforesaid; </em>and being so indebted, the defendant <em>as executor as aforesaid, </em>in consideration thereof, undertook and promised, by his said promissory note, to pay the said sum of money to the plaintiff, when the <em>defendant </em>should be thereto requested.\u2014The <em>second </em>count was like the <em>first, </em>except that it alleged, that the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid </em>(not <em>as </em>executor) promised to pay the money, when the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid </em>should be thereto requested.\u2014The <em>third, </em>count alleged, that the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid </em>was indebted to the plaintiff <em>as one of the legatees of Circle, </em>in the sum of 459 dollars, for so much money by the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid </em>had and received to the use of the plaintiff <em>as such legatee; </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>being so indebted, the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid </em>promised the plaintiff to pay-him the same.\u2014The <em>fourth </em>count alleged, that the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid, </em>by his promissory note in writing, acknowledged, that Qn a gna| settlement of all accounts between the plaintiff <em>one of the legatees of Circle, </em>and the defendant <em>executor of Circle, </em>there was a balance due the plaintiff of 459 dollars; and in consideration thereof the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid, </em>by his said promissory note, promised to pay the same to the plaintiff. The <em>fifth </em>count alleged, that the defendant and the plaintiff accounted together of and concerning divers sums of money due from the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid, </em>to the plaintiff <em>as one of the legatees of Circle; </em>and upon that account, the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid </em>was found indebted to the plaintiff the sum of 459 dollars; and being so found indebted, the defendant <em>executor as aforesaid, </em>in consideration thereof, promised to pay the same to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">The defendant demurred generally to the declaration, and pleaded <em>noh assumpsit. </em>The court overruled the demurrer. Upon the trial of the issue, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 459 dollars with interest &amp;c. for which the court gave him judgment against the defendant, to be levied <em>de bo?iis lestatoris. </em>The defendant applied, by petition to this court, for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\"><em>Stanard </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-6\"><em>Johnson </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> The instrument on which the action was founded, called a promissory note in the declaration, was copied, into the record, though it was not a part of it.

Upon this demurrer, the objection to the misjoinder of action may be made, together with any other objection, which is matter of substance, and goes to the whole of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">As to misjoinder. The writ is against <em>\u201cJ. D.Kayser </em>executor of <em>Circle.\u201d </em>The declaration complains of \u201c <em>J. D. Kay ser </em>executor of <em>Circle.\u201d </em>The <em>first </em>count alleges, \u201c that the said defendant executor as aforesaid\u201d by his promissory note &amp;c. was indebted &amp;c. to the plaintiff \u201cas legatee;\u201d and being so indebted, in consideration thereof, \u201c he the said defendant <em>as </em>executor as aforesaid promised &amp;c.\u201d This is distinctly the form of the declaration against an executor in his representative character. 1 Chitt. Plead. 205-6. 1 Wms. Saund. 111. 112. <em>Brigden </em>v. Parkes, 2 Bos. &amp; Pull. 424. <em>Hawkes &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>1 Cowp. 289.292. <em>Epes\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Dudley adm\u2019r, </em>5 Rand. 437. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Harrison\u2019s adm\u2019r, 2 </em>Leigh 532. No other form, indeed, could well be devised for distinguishing the action against the executor, from the action against the individual. It is necessary that some form should be adopted, which shall enable the court, where there is judgment by default, or on demurrer, to decide in what character the judgment should be rendered against the defendant. On this <em>first </em>count, the judgment can only be against the executor as <em>such, </em>for the <em>promise </em>is distinctly laid to have been made by him <em>as executor. </em>It must, therefore, be against the goods and chattels of the testator, and not against the executor personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The court does not find it necessary to inquire, whether the other counts are against the executor <em>as such, </em>or not: <em>quacunque via data, </em>the declaration is bad. Take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>it, that they are against him individually: then, as the <em>first </em>is not, there is a misjoinder. , Take it, that they are all against the executor <em>as such: </em>then, they are all of them demands against <em>the estate. </em>But the demand of a jegatee for hiS legacy, is not a demand against <em>the estate; </em>it is a demand against the <em>executor personally, </em>for part of the estate. And if, as was contended, an action at law will lie for a legacy, either upon an express or implied promise, it is perfectly clear, that it must be brought against the executor in his individual, and not in his representative, character; and the judgment must be <em>de bonis </em>propriis, not <em>de bonis testatoris. </em>This is clearly shewn by the cases decided in the time of lord <em>Mansfield; Atkins &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Cowp. 284. <em>Hawkes &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>Id. 289. See also <em>Rose &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Bowler\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>1 H. Black. 108. Taking all the counts, then, to be of the same character, they are all against the defendant in his representative character, and are, therefore, all of them bad.</p>\n<p id=\"Adh\">In this view of the case, the question mainly argued at the bar, need hot be decided: the court gives no opinion upon it. Yet I am myself well satisfied,-1. That an action at law against an executor for a legacy, does not lie without an express promise of the executor to pay. 2. That it does lie upon such promise, where there is a good consideration; for example, where there are assets to pay the legacy. 3. That if the promise of the executor be unqualified, it amounts to a waiver of the refunding bond which he might have required of the legatee, and removes a great difficulty in the proceeding at law. 4. That if the promise be on condition of a refunding bond being given by the legatee, then, on ordinary principles, there can be no recovery without proof of the performance of that condition. <em>5. </em>That no admission of assets, or mere acknowledgment of indebtedness, without an express promise, will sustain the action ; for, in those cases, the objection exists, if no other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>that the executor has a right to require a refunding bond from the legatee, which a court of law cannot compel him to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Judgment reversed; and judgment for the defendant upon the demurrer to the declaration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
