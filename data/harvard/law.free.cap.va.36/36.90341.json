That lieutenant <em>'Mansion </em>died about the beginning of the year 1798. And therefore, he was entitled for his services, either to half pay for and during his life, or to commutation of five years full pay in lieu thereof, with interest from the 22d April 1783, which the claimant alleged was the date of the end of the war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The auditor\u2019s answer to the petition shewed, that he did not reject the claim because he thought it unfounded either in fact or in law.

The latter, held that it terminated at the signature of the preliminary articles of peace in November 1782, but the former decided that the governor\u2019s proclamation of April 22d 1783 fixed the period of its termination. Although the decision on that point was much disapproved of by some of the judges of this court in <em>Lilly's </em>case, 1 Leigh 525. yet it was not overruled by them. That decision, whether right or wrong, has been subsequently acquiesced in, and must now be considered as settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">I have never been able to ascertain, with any <em>certainty, </em>by what law of this commonwealth the courts have allowed to the officers in the <em>state </em>service, who served to the end of the war, commutation of five years full pay with six per cent, interest from the date of the proclamation of peace, in lieu of half pay for life, which was allowed to them by the act of 1779. It was al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>lowed, by a resolution of congress of March 1783, to the officers on <em>continental </em>establishment, on the representation of the officers themselves; 11 Hen. Stat. at large, p. <em>557. </em>Judge <em>Green </em>intimates in <em>Markham's </em>case, 1 Leigh 524. that it was allowed here under a construction of the act of 1790, ch. 21.13 Hen. Stat. at large, p. 131. which enacts, \u201cthat the same <em>compensation. of half pay </em>should be extended to those officers of <em>the state line </em>who continued in actual service to the end of the war, <em>as was allowed to the officers of the continental line:'' </em>he says that the construction put upon this act was, that the same <em>commutation </em>which had been given by congress to the officers of the <em>continental </em>line, should be given to the officers of the <em>state </em>line. I think it probable that such is the source from which sprung the practice of giving our officers the <em>commutation. </em>I think it was a farfetched construction; but as the court of appeals has sanctioned it for more than forty years, that question ought now to be considered as settled. If therefore the representative of lieutenant <em>Marston </em>can prove that he served till the end of the war, the judgment of the court of <em>Henrico </em>giving him full pay for five years with interest as aforesaid, should be affirmed; otherwise not.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">The first piece of evidence introduced to prove that <em>Marston </em>served till the end of the war, is the certificate of col. <em>Dabney, </em>dated 30th April 1783, stating that he had served upwards of three years <em>in the service of this state. </em>It is shewn by a document in the cause, that he was a cadet in <em>Gibson's </em>regiment in 1778, and that his commission as first lieutenant bears date the 3d July 1779. It is alleged, that this regiment was in <em>continental service </em>at: the north till the spring of 1780, when it returned to <em>Virginia; </em>that he then entered <em>Dabney's </em>legion, in the service of the state; and as he served three years in that service, it is inferred that he served from the spring of 1780 to the spring of 1783, that is, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>end of <em>the war, in </em>that service. Unfortunately <em>for </em>this _ . argument, <em>Dabney*s </em>legion was not m existence m 1780, It was not formed till after November 1781, when an act passed directing the officers of the regiments and corps in the service of the state, to be reduced, and the corps consolidated into one or more. 10 Hen. Stat. at large, p. 440. <em>Dabney\u2019s </em>legion was formed under that law. It could not have been in that legion, then, that lieutenant <em>Marston </em>served three years, though he might have been and probably was an officer in it after its formation. He was probably an officer in that legion in February and April 1782, as he was at that time reported as <em>in service, </em>by the board of officers which sat in <em>Richmond </em>at those periods. But it does not follow that he was in service on the 22d April 1783. <em>Christopher Roane </em>and some others were also reported to <em>be </em>in service by that same board, who were deraigned on the 9th February 1783, and yet they did not serve to the end of the war. As lieutenant <em>Marston\u2019s </em>name is not associated with that of <em>Roane </em>and others at the time of that deraignment, nor yet returned as having served till April 1783, the probability is, that he was somehow <em>out of service </em>before <em>Roane.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The certificate of col. <em>Dabney </em>was obviously given to enable lieutenant <em>Marston </em>to obtain his land bounty, and it has served that purpose. It made no difference, whether the officer belonged to the <em>Virginia line on stale </em>establishment, or the same line on <em>continental </em>establishment ; he was entitled to the same quantity of land; 10 Hen. Stat. at large, p. 159-60. For <em>three years </em>service, either officer was to have an unconditional title to his land ; 11 Id. p. 83-4. Colonel <em>Dabney, </em>knowing that <em>Marston </em>had served part of his time in the <em>Virginia </em>line in the service of the continent, and part in the same line in <em>state </em>service, though he had not served a full three years in either service, but more than three in both taken together, might well certify (without criti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cally weighing his words) that he had served more than three years in the service of the state. It is not at all probable that he had in his mind the exact time when he entered or came out of the service. This certificate then does not prove, that <em>Marston </em>served to the end of the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The appellee then resorts to parol evidence. The affidavits of <em>Wilcox </em>and <em>Christian </em>may be thrown out of the case, as they are <em>ex parte. </em>But if admitted, they fail to prove the requisite fact. The former says, that lieutenant <em>Marston </em>was an officer in the regular service <em>11 during the </em>revolutionhe does not assert, that he served throughout the whole of the revolution : if he had only served two or three years, it would be truly said that he served <em>during </em>the revolution. Mr. <em>Christian </em>goes further, and says, that he served three years to the north, and then returned, and served to the end of the war. But he does not tell us what was, in his estimation, the end of the war in <em>Virginia; </em>whether it was the capture of <em>Cornwallis, </em>the signature of the preliminary articles of peace, the proclamation of the governor, or the definitive treaty of peace, which terminated it. This evidence is entirely too vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">But the principal reliance is on the evidence of major <em>Gibbs. </em>He says, that in 1780, lieutenant <em>Marston </em>was attached to a <em>Virginia state </em>regiment, commonly called <em>Dabney\u2019s legion, </em>and he served in that regiment until the close of the war in April 1783. In a former <em>ex parte </em>affidavit, he shews, that he knew the 22d April 1783 to be the period that the courts had fixed on as the termination of the war. Notwithstanding his particularity, however, his memory has failed; for <em>Dabney\u2019s </em>legion was not formed, as I before remarked, in 1780, nor until after the session of assembly of November 1781. And as to his serving in it until April 1783, that is contradicted by an official document filed since the rendition of this <em>judgment; </em>namely, the return of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>officers of the state legion, signed by <em>Charles Dabney, </em>lieutenant colonel commandant. This document is only a copy; but it is filed in the auditor\u2019s office as the groundwork of his official acts; and moreover, since the argument of this cause here, the original return has been found in the papers of the suit of <em>Innis </em>v. <em>Roane &amp; al. </em>and its verity will not now be questioned. That list shews that one of the officers retired on the 1st January 1783 ; others were deraigned on the 8th February ; and others, amongst whom was col. <em>Dabney, </em>served till the 23d April 1783. In that return, the name of lieutenant <em>Marston </em>is not to be found. If the administrator of captain <em>Thomas </em>Ewell.has obtained a judgment for commutation with interest, on the ground that he served <em>in'Dabney\u2019s </em>legion to the end of the war, although bis name is not on this list, it only shews, that that plaintiff has obtained more than he was entitled to, as I fear is the case with too many others. I have no hesitation in saying, that the judgment of the circuit superiour court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The next question is, whether the decision of the auditor is to be affirmed. He admits that the board of field officers who sat in 1782, reported lieutenant <em>Mars-ton </em>as entitled to half pay. That report has been adjudged to be authentic, by this court in <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case. He was then reported to be \u201c <em>in service.\u201d </em>Between that period and the termination of the war, he must have either resigned, or become a supernumerary by the subsequent reductions of the regiments, which are known to have taken place. I cannot presume that he resigned his commission at that late period. The commonwealth, indeed, does not allege it, and if she did, the burthen of proof would be on her. I think, then, we ought to conclude that he thereafter became a supernumerary.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Although this court decided twice, that a supernumerary was not entitled to half pay, unless he. served to the end of the war, being required to do so, yet a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>trary decision was given by the court in <em>Lilly's </em>case, and many subsequent judgments have been rendered in conformity with it, and much money has been drawn from our state treasury, and reimbursed by the federal treasury. It is, therefore, too late to inquire into the correctness of the decision in <em>Lilly's </em>case, in all cases where the officers became supernumerary <em>after the pussing of the act of </em>1779. Whether we can reexamine it in that class of cases where the officer became supernumerary <em>before </em>the passing of that act, will be determined in another case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The ground of the auditor\u2019s decision is, that the act of congress of July 1832 authorizes the' settlement of this claim by the secretary of the treasury of the <em>U. States. </em>I think it is true that the 3d section of the act of congress does provide for the settlement and adjustment of this claim; but does it justify the state courts in refusing to give judgment for it? The officers included in the act of May 1779, ch. 6. are entitled to their half pay, \u201c provided congress do not make some <em>tantamount </em>provision for them.\u201d The <em>tantamount </em>provision herein mentioned is an original provision to be made by congress, equivalent to the provision made by the state, not dependant on any provision made by the state, or any adjudication therein on the subject matter of the claim, and which would entirely release the state from making the provision desired to be made. The act of congress of 1832 directs the secretary to adjust and settle these claims, on the <em>\u201cprinciples of the half pay cases already decided in the supreme court of appeals\" </em>of this state. It may be, that the secretary may think this case does not come within those principles; or he may be unwilling to decide on the claim, unless it is declared to be sanctioned by those principles, either by our auditor of public accounts, or by our courts. If we reject the claim on that account, the party may lose his claim altogether, although we are satisfied that it is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>perfectly just claim. We ought therefore to act on this ^ <em>*7 *7 </em>claim according to the evidence, and the law of 1779, without reference to the act of congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">I am therefore of opinion, that the auditor\u2019s decision ought to be reversed, and that he be directed to issue a warrant on the treasury in favour of the appellee, for lieutenant <em>Marston\u2019s </em>half pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The other judges concurred in the opinion, that lieutenant <em>Marston </em>did not continue in actual service until the end of the war, and therefore was not entitled to commutation of five years full pay with interest from the end of the war; but that he was an officer of the <em>Virgitiia </em>line on the <em>state </em>establishment, who became supernumerary <em>after </em>the act of May 1779, ch. 6. and was therefore entitled, upon the authority of <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case (that being directly in point) to his half pay during his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Therefore, the court reversed the judgment of the circuit superiour court, and then reversed the decision of the auditor also, and directed that officer to issue a warrant in favour of the appellee, for his testator\u2019s half pay from the 14th April 1782 (that appearing to have been the date of \u201c the determination of his command or service\u201d) until the 1st January 1798, which was about the date of his .death as nearly as it could be ascertained.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> There was an error committed by the reporter, in the report of <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case, 1 Leigh 525, 6. It is there stated, that the circuit court of <em>Henrico </em>reversed the auditor\u2019s decision, and ordered him to issue a warrant in favour of <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>administrator, <em>for the amount of five years full </em>pay, <em>with interest from the </em>2 <em>2d April </em>1783; and that that judgment was affirmed. But, in fact, the circuit court gave judgment, <em>not </em>for the commutation, but for the <em>half pay </em>that accrued to <em>Lilly </em>during his life, without <em>interest; </em>and that was the judgment which this court affirmed. This court expressly decided, that no <em>interest </em>should be paid; see judge <em>Green\u2019s </em>opinion, in the same case, Id. 538. and in <em>Markham\u2019s </em>case, Id. 523, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
