While the injunction staying the proceedings at law was yet pending in the court of chancery, mrs. <em>Wood </em>executed a writing in the form of a letter addressed to <em>M'Craw, </em>dated in October 1806, in these words: <em>\u201c </em>My son <em>William Wood </em>is authorized <em>to collect or dispose of </em>a debt due me by <em>W. Sampson </em>and <em>W. Miller, </em>which debt was some years past injoined by them in the chancery court for the <em>Richmond </em>district. (Signed) <em>Lucy Wood.\u201d William Wood </em>then executed a writing, likewise in the form of a letter to <em>M'Craw, </em>dated in November 1806, in these words : \u201c Sir, on the 6th October 1806 I traded to mr. <em>T. M. Woodson </em>1200 dollars of the within debt with its interest till paid, for which I am bound. You will, therefore, on collection of <em>Sampson </em>and <em>Miller's </em>debt, pay the same to him or order. (Signed) <em>W. Wood.\u201d </em>And <em>Woodson, </em>in the same month of November 1806, made an assignment of his interest in the claim, by writing in these words: <em>\u201c </em>The claim I hold in this debt, I transfer to <em>J. F. Price, </em>without recourse to me and heirs. (Signed) <em>T. M. Wood-son.\u201d </em>Upon a copy of the above writings, <em>M'Craio </em>made the following indorsement, dated in January 1807\u2014\u201c The within are copies of originals filed in my office by J. <em>F. Price, </em>and which I will comply with when the money comes into my hands, should it ever get there. (Signed) <em>Sam. M'Craw.\u201d </em>After which, <em>Price </em>assigned the claim to <em>William Duval, </em>and he assigned it to his son <em>John Duval.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-4\">In November 1822, <em>John Duval </em>exhibited his bill in the court of chancery of <em>Richmond </em>against <em>William Duval, </em>the executors of <em>Price, Woodson, William Wood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>Lucy Wood, </em>and <em>M ' Craw, </em>setting forth the facts above stated, and alleging further, that <em>Sampson's </em>injunction had been dissolved; that the debt due from <em>Miller </em>and him (the subject of the several assignments above mentioned), or some part of it, had been received by some one of the defendants; and that, supposing <em>M'Craw </em>liable for the money, the plaintiff had brought an action against him at law, but had dismissed it, being advised that he could only be relieved in equity, since the assignments under which he claimed were only available in equity. Therefore, the bill prayed, that the defendants respectively should be compelled to account for and pay to the plaintiff, any money by them, or any of them, received of the debt so assigned to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\"><em>William Duval, </em>and the executors of <em>Price, </em>answered the bill. The defendants <em>Lucy Wood, William Wood, </em>and <em>M'Craw, </em>all died pending the suit, and without having put in answers; and the proceedings were revived against their administrators, respectively. <em>M'Craw's </em>administrator put in an answer, shewing that <em>M'Craw </em>died insolvent, and that he had no assets. As to the administrators of <em>Lucy Wood </em>and <em>William Wood, </em>the bill was taken <em>pro confesso. </em>The defendant <em>Woodson </em>also continued in default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">It appeared by the pleadings and proofs in the cause, that the assignment of the debt in question from <em>William Duval to </em>the plaintiff <em>John Duval, </em>was a gift from the father to the son; that the assignments from <em>Price </em>to <em>William Duval, </em>and from <em>Woodson </em>to <em>Price, </em>were both assignments for valuable consideration, though they were both <em>without recourse </em>to the assignors; that the assignment from <em>William Wood </em>to <em>Woodson </em>was also made for valuable consideration; but of the character of the transaction as between mrs. <em>Wood </em>and her son <em>William, </em>there was no other evidence than that afforded by her letter to <em>M'Craw </em>of October 1806. It was also proved, that <em>M'Craw, </em>professing to act as attorney for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>mrs. <em>Wood, </em>received from <em>Miller's </em>administrator, in July 1815, the sum of 1051 dollars in full of the debt due from <em>Miller </em>and <em>Sampson. </em>And it appeared, that <em>M'Craw </em>had taken the oath of insolvency, under the statute for relief of insolvent debtors, in March 1820. But <em>when </em>he became actually insolvent, nowise appeared.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-4\">The cause having been transferred to the circuit superiour court of <em>Henrico, </em>that court decreed, that the administrator of <em>Lucy Wood, </em>and the administrator of <em>William Wood, </em>out of the estates of those decedents in their hands, should pay the plaintiff 1051 dollars, the amount received by <em>M' Craw, </em>with interest from J uly 1815, the date when he received it. As it appeared, that any decree against <em>M'Craw's </em>administrator would be unavailing, none was given, but liberty was reserved to the plaintiff, or to the administrators of the <em>Woods </em>against whom the decree was made, whichever of them should satisfy the decree, to apply to the court for a decree against <em>M' Craw's </em>administrator. And the plaintiff asking no decree against <em>William Duval, </em>or the executors of <em>Price, </em>or <em>Woodson, </em>the suit was discontinued as to those defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">Upon the petition of mrs. <em>Wood's </em>administrator, this court allowed him an appeal from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-7\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b30-14\"> He decided the cause in the circuit superiour court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-8\">Parker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS8\">It may be doubted whether <em>Lucy Wood, </em>the appellant\u2019s intestate, would, under any circumstances, have been liable to the appellee for the debt which she authorized her son \u201c to collect or dispose of,\u201d since there is no evidence that it was to be done for her benefit, and the probability being, both from her own letter and that of her son to <em>M'Craw, </em>that it was a gift to her son. The bill does not charge that she assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>her claim for value; there is no proof that she did so; * her son speaks of <em>Ais being </em>bound, but says nothing of <em>Aer </em>liability over; and her letter to <em>M\u2019Craw </em>does not , t purport to be an assignment of the claim, but a mere annunciation to her attorney of the fact that she had authorized her son to collect or to dispose of it, in order, no doubt, to satisfy M\u2019 <em>Craw </em>of her son\u2019s right to call upon him for a settlement, unless he disposed of the debt to another. It would be difficult, I think, under these circumstances, to charge her even if the appellee had diligently pursued <em>M'Cravo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">But, without pressing this point, I am of opinion that, in the events which have happened, neither of the <em>Woods </em>can be charged. The letters addressed by them to <em>M\u2019Craio </em>are no more than orders on their agent or attorney, for money; imposing on the writers the ordinary responsibility of drawers of such paper, and no more. If the fund had been collected and in the hands of <em>M' Craw, </em>their accepted drafts would have imposed upon the holders the obligation, at least, to demand payment, and in case of refusal, to give notice to the \u2022drawers, in order to enable them to take the proper-steps for their security: the holders could not lie by for years, and then resort to the <em>Woods, </em>or either of them. The law is the same where the fund is to be collected. <em>M </em>\u2019 <em>Craw, </em>upon accepting the order, became liable to pay to the transferees as soon as he received the amount of the debt. The money was received in July 1815, and there is no evidence of <em>M\u2019 Craw's </em>insolvency until March 1820. In the meantime, the whole debt belonging to the appellee or to the holders of the orders, they might control <em>M'Craw </em>in the collection; and if they permitted him to receive it, he might instantly have been sued at law upon his acceptance, or the orders been returned, with notice to the drawers of his default. It was their duty to ascertain when the money came into his hands; and then to take the proper steps to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>force payment, or to return the orders, and enable the drawers to charge <em>M\u2019Craw. </em>Instead of this, it is not shewn that they took any efficient steps to recover the money from <em>M\u2019Craw, </em>or gave any notice of his default to either of the <em>Woods, </em>until the filing of this bill in November 1822; more than seven years after <em>M \u2019 Craw </em>had collected the debt. All this appears upon the face of the bill itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">I am therefore of opinion, that the decree of the circuit superiour court should be reversed, and the bill, as to both the <em>Woods, </em>dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b35-11\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Akxz\">As it does not appear that mrs. <em>Wood </em>received any consideration for her order on <em>M\u2019Craw </em>her attorney, in favour of her son <em>William Wood, </em>she was not responsible to the plaintiff, or to any of the intermediate assignees of the order. That <em>William Wood </em>was responsible, appears by the terms of his assignment of 1200 dollars with interest, which, he says, he had \u201ctraded\u201d to <em>Woodson, </em>\u201cand for which he was bound.\u201d <em>M\u2019 Craw </em>accepted the order in 1807, and collected the money in 1815. From that time we hear nothing of any demand upon him by any of the parties through whose hands the order had passed, nor of any notice to either of the <em>Woods </em>that <em>M\u2019Craw </em>had refused to pay, until 1822, when this suit was brought. Treating the case as an ordinary assignment of a debt, I perceive no ground for coming into a court of equity. After an acceptance of <em>M\u2019Craw, </em>and the receipt of the money by him, it was no longer a mere equitable assignment <em>as to him ; </em>he became a debtor at law; and it appears by the bill, that the plaintiff so considered him ; for he brought his suit at law, and dismissed it, because, as he says, he could not establish his claim in that forum, but more probably, I think, because <em>M\u2019Craw </em>had become insolvent. However that may be, the great delay in giving notice to mrs. <em>Wood, </em>if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Was bound, and to <em>William Wood, </em>who was bound, that <em>M\u2019Craw, </em>after the acceptance of the order and the receipt of the money, had refused to pay it, was, I think, such laches as exonerated them from any responsibility for the failure of <em>M\u2019Craw </em>to pay the order. The plaintiff is not entitled to recover in any forum. The decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed, both as to <em>Lucy Wood\u2019s </em>representative, and <em>William Wood\u2019s, </em>though the latter has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Tucker, <em>P. </em>concurred. Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
