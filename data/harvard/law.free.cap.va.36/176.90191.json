That while the execution yet remained in <em>Mallory's </em>hands, namely, on the 29th November 1828, <em>Scott </em>executed a deed of trust, whereby he conveyed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>slave which was the subject of this suit (among other property) to <em>Abner Adams, </em>in trust that he should sell the mortgaged subject, and out <em>of </em>the proceeds of sale pay sundry debts therein mentioned and secured, and' among others a debt due to <em>Pegram </em>the plaintiff in this action; that <em>Scott, </em>on the same day, executed another deed of trust, conveying other slaves to a trustee for the security of other debts, in which last mentioned deed of trust the deputy sheriff <em>Field </em>was personally interested as a <em>cestui que trust; </em>and that both the deeds of trust were duly recorded on the day of their date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">7.

That the <em>fieri facias </em>in the bands of the deputy <em>Mallory, </em>did not. bind the property of the debtor <em>Scott; </em>and therefore no title was acquired by <em>May, </em>the purchaser under the execution, which overreached the title acquired by <em>Pegram </em>by his purchase under the deed of trust. That an execution does not bind the property in the goods of the debtor against whom it is sued out, but from the time the writ is delivered to the sheriff <em>\u201cto be executed;\" 1 Rev. Code, ch. </em>134. \u00a7 13. p. 529. and the execution in question was not delivered to the deputy <em>Mallory, to be executed, </em>but the levy of if. was to be made on a future contingency, and then by the deputy <em>Field; </em>and until it. was handed to <em>Field </em>at a date subsequent to that at which <em>Pegram's </em>title accrued, it was not delivered <em>to be </em>executed, so as to bind the property. That the execution (having respect to the purpose of the delivery of it to <em>Mallory, </em>and the manner in which it was afterwards to be treated) was intended to bind the property of the debtor, and yet to be suspended as to the levy of it, until on a future event it should be transferred to the hands of <em>Field, </em>the other deputy; and this latter purpose defeated the intention as to the lien; for a delivery to an officer with instructions not to levy for a given time, or until a given event, could not immediately bind the debtor\u2019s property. The suspension of the levy, during its continuance, cancelled the lien. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>4 East 523. <em>Kellog </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>17 Johns.

He said\u2014I cannot concur in the opinion, that <em>May\u2019s </em>execution was delivered to the deputy <em>Mallory </em>\u201c to be executed,\u201d according to the 13th section of the statute concerning executions. The words of the statute are, that \u201c no writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>or other writ of execution, shall bind the property of the goods against which such writ is sued forth, but from the time such writ shall be delivered to the sheriff, under sheriff* coroner or other officer, <em>to he </em>executedto be executed, I presume, in pursuance of law, not according to the directions of the creditor. The section is copied from the english statute 29 Car. <em>2. </em>ch. 3. and any delay amounting to <em>laches </em>in the creditor loses the priority of the execution ; as in the case of <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>cited at the bar, where a sequestration out of chancery, having the force of a <em>fieri facias, </em>lost its priority by the delay to execute it, amounting to <em>laches </em>in the plaintiff. So, in the case of <em>Kellog </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>where the plaintiff having a prior <em>fieri facias, </em>directed the sheriff to levy it, but to do nothing until ordered, unless crowded by younger executions, but by no means to let the execution lose its preference. There, the <em>laches </em>was not so great as in the case before us, in which the execution was put into the hands of the deputy sheriff, to be executed <em>only in the </em>contingency of the debtor bringing his property to the town of <em>Petersburg, </em>which was the precinct or bailiwick of that deputy, but if he should not bring his property thither, and should not pay or secure the debt, the execution was to be delivered at the next county court of <em>Dinwiddie, </em>to another deputy, <em>Field, </em>to be executed on property within his precinct. The proceeding upon the execution after its delivery, was designedly suspended. Meanwhile, <em>Scott </em>the debtor mortgaged his property to secure a just debt,\u2014under which deed the plaintiff fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>acquired the title; the execution still remaining dormant i * in the hands of <em>Mallory. </em>I can see no difference between this case and the cases cited, unless a distinction is to be taken between a deed of trust, and a <em>bona fide </em>sale under it, which are recognized by law as one means of securing and satisfying a debt, and a <em>fieri facias, </em>which is another means of effecting the same object. Before the statute, the mischief was, that the creditor after taking his execution might permit it to lie in the office, and so be a secret lien on the debtor\u2019s property. Now, it had as well be in the office, as in the hands of the sheriff, if he, by the direction of the creditor, is not to execute it but on some contingency that may never happen. To bind the property of the debtor, an execution must be delivered to the sheriff to be executed in pursuance of law, so that he is bound to proceed, and responsible for not proceeding. If it is delivered to him, to hold, and abide the directions of the creditor, other liens may intervene, which ought not to be affected by the creditor\u2019s delay to execute his writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
