He never resigned his commission ; but he was not called into active service again, though he professed that he had held himself at all times ready to resume active service if he had been required. For this service, and readiness for further service, he applied to the auditor of public accounts, in 1833, for half pay for life, commencing from the time he became supernumerary, under the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>of .May 3779, eh. 6. 10 Hen.

Pending the appeal, <em>Tatum </em>died, and it was revived in the name of his executor.

He claims to be entitled to half pay under the act of May 1779, ch. 6. That was an act manifestly intended to hold out inducements to persons to enter and <em>to continue in </em>the service, which at that time it w\u00e1s absolutely necessary to offer, in consequence of the rapid depreciation of the paper money in circulation, and of the utter inadequacy of the pay then given. Its words are these: \u201c All general officers of the army, being citizens of this commonwealth, and all field officers, captains and subalterns, commanding, or who shall command, in the battalions of this commonwealth on continental establishment, or serving in the battalions raised for the immediate defence of this state, or for the defence of the <em>United States, </em>and all chaplains, physicians, surgeons, and surgeon\u2019s mates, being citizens of this common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>wealth, and not being in the service of <em>Georgia </em>or of <em>. </em>any other state, provided congress do not make some tantamount provision for them, who shall serve hence-<em>L </em>forward, or from the time of their being commissioned, until the end of the war; and all such officers who <em>have </em>or shall become supernumerary on the reduction of any of the said battalions, and shall again enter into the said service, if required so to do, in the same or any higher rank, and continue therein until the end of the war, shall be entitled to half pay during life, to commence from the determination of their command or service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyZR\">We are saved much trouble in settling the true construction of this act, by <em>Markham's </em>and <em>Lilly's </em>cases, decided in this court, and in my opinion properly decided. 1 Leigh 516. 525. The latter case, particularly, settles the point that a supernumerary officer, not entering again into service, (unless he was called on and refused so to do) is entitled under the act to half pay for life. ' It also decides, that lapse of time, similar to that occurring in this case, does not afford any presumptiou of payment or abandonment of the claim. Indeed, the circumstances here are stronger to account for the delay; because claims less questionable had been repelled, and the door shut against the claimants, by the resolutions of the legislature and the decisions of the court of appeals in <em>Innis </em>v. <em>Roane, </em>4 Call 379.</p>\n<p id=\"ASS\">If officers of the <em>state </em>line, becoming supernumerary <em>after </em>the act of 1779, and actually serving until February 1783, when the war was <em>substantially </em>at an end, were driven away and denied relief under that act, it could not be expected of <em>Tatum, </em>and others in the same predicament, to present and make continual claim of their title to half pay. Their laches, under such circumstances, is no evidence of payment or abandonment ; and I am not prepared to presume a fact, which I know not to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The first clause of that part of the act of 1779 already .... .. . , , cited, applies, m terms, as well to officers in the battalions of the commonwealth on <em>continental </em>establishment, being citizens, as to officers of the <em>state line proper. </em>It is impossible to make this plainer by argument. The words \u201c <em>such </em>officers,\u201d in the second clause, can refer to no other than the officers on continental establishment and in the immediate service of the state, mentioned before. Supernumeraries of that class and description, who <em>had, </em>as well as those who <em>thereafter should, </em>become such, were to be entitled to half pay during life.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Then, as it would seem to me, there is really but one question in this case about which ihere is a reasonable doubt, unless we are prepared to overturn the principles adjudged in <em>Lilly's </em>case, and to decry the many subsequent judgments rendered in this court in conformity with it; and that question is, whether the act of 1779 embraces supernumeraries <em>before, </em>as well as <em>after, </em>the date of the act? <em>Lilly's </em>case, it may be said, is not an <em>authority </em>upon this point, because <em>Lilly </em>became a supernumerary after May 1779; but it is apparent that the majority of the court recognized no such distinction, nor did the dissenting judge allude to it. On the contrary, all the concurring judges speak broadly of supernumeraries, <em>before, </em>as well as <em>after, </em>the date of the act; and the train of reasoning by which they justified their decision applies as strongly to the one class as the other. Thus judge <em>Carr </em>says-\u2014\u201cAt <em>the passage of this act, </em>the history and laws of the period tell us, there were a groat number of supernumeraries; men inferiour to none; men to whom the state was as deeply indebted for past service, and whose future services she deemed it as important to retain, as those of the officers in actual service : for <em>these men, </em>under the name of <em>supernumeraries, </em>in contradistinction to officers in <em>actual service, </em>the law meant to provide.\u201d And in another passage he quotes the words of the law thus\u2014\u201c All offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>cers who <em>are now </em>supernumerary, and shall again enter the service if required so to do\u201d\u2014considering these ex- \u25a0 pressions equivalent with those actually used, viz. \u201c All such officers who have or shall become supernumerary\u201d &amp;c. \u25a0 Judge <em>Green </em>leaves as little doubt of his interpretation of the meaning of the law; for in one passage of his opinion he says\u2014\u201c I thought, until very recently, that there were strong motives to influence the legislature in making a discrimination between those who served to the end of the war, and supernumeraries, (especially the great number becoming so by the reduction of fourteen regiments or battalions, in 1777, from ten to eight companies, and never again called into the service), and that such discrimination had been made;\u201d but he adds, \u201c Subsequent reflection has satisfied me I was mistaken.\u201d And judge <em>Coalter, </em>throughout his opinion, argues in favour of supernumeraries in general, both of the continental and state lines, without regard to the time of their becoming supernumerary.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\">The grounds upon which the court justified its opinion in <em>Lilly's </em>case were, the terms of the law; the motives for making it; the fact that supernumeraries were still officers, liable to be called on at a moment\u2019s warning; that having seen service, the legislature, in anticipation of future exigencies, wished to hold out an inducement to them to retain their commissions; and that thus holding them, they could not enter into inconsistent engagements, nor refuse to enter into active service (without being liable to military censure and punishment) \u201c if required so-to do.\u201d All these reasons and grounds apply with as much force to officers who were supernumerary at the date of the law, as to those becoming so afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">But let us attend to the occasion of making this law, and its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On the 24th November 1778, congress, adverting to the fact that from the alteration of the military estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>lishment, and other causes, many valuable officers <em>had </em>.... <em>been </em>and might be omitted in the new arrangement, as being supernumerary, who from their conduct and services were entitled to the honourable notice of congress, and to a suitable provision until they could return to civil life with <em>advantage,\u2014resolved </em>to give to all supernumerary officers one year\u2019s full pay, and earnestly recommended to the several states to which such officers belonged, to make such farther provision for them as their respective circumstances and merits might have entitled them to. Journals of congress, vol. 3. p. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is clear beyond question, that congress had reference to all supernumeraries, whether they <em>had leen </em>or <em>might be </em>omitted in the new arrangement; and it is as evident to my mind, that as the act of May 1779 was intended to comply with this recommendation of congress, it meant to include the class of supernumerary officers who <em>had leen </em>or might be omitted in the new arrangement. And what other construction can be given to the words of the last clause, concerning supernumeraries ? which seems to have been added as an amendment to the original bill (see 1 Leigh 53S). <em>\u201c </em>All such officers <em>who have </em>or shall become supernumerary on the reduction of any of the said battalions\u201d\u2014Can these words be construed to mean any thing but that officers who <em>had </em>become supernumerary already, on the reduction of the battalions, should be entitled to half pay for life, as well as those who should thereafter become supernumerary ; unless we transpose the words, or do violence to their grammatical construction? To me it seems perfectly clear, that no distinction between supernumeraries can be drawn, except the one affirmed in <em>Innis </em>v. <em>Roane, </em>and repudiated by this court in <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case and many subsequent ones. If supernumeraries, not again entering the service and continuing to the end of the war, are entitled to half pay, the appellant in this case is entitled for the same reasons; and the at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tempt to distinguish it from <em>Lilly's </em>case, is in effect to .. . it deny that case to be law.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag9y\">If there was any reason for believing that <em>Tatum </em>ever refused to enter the service, or had contracted inconsistent obligations, or had resigned and returned to civil life, the case would be very different. But there is no other reason to presume this, than the length of time which elapsed from the autumn of the year 1778 to the end of the war; which is little more than the time which elapsed in other cases, where <em>the </em>officers were allowed their half pay. Various reasons might be assigned for the failure to call these supernumeraries into active service, which I forbear to urge, because it is agreed that he remained a supernumerary officer to the end of the war, and it is not pretended that he was called on and refused. It is also agreed that he was in the <em>Virginia </em>line on continental establishment, which brings him within the words, <em>\u201c </em>officers commanding in the battalions of this commonwealth on continental establishment and that he was a citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>is not questioned. If so, as no tantamount provision has been made for him by congress, he is entitled to his half pay for life from <em>Virginia; </em>and the judgment denying it ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b86-7\">Brockenbrough, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKR-\">It appears, that <em>Henry Tatum </em>the testator of the appellant was a lieutenant in the <em>Virginia </em>line in continental service, and continued in service until the new arrangement of the army was made in the fall of 1778, when he retired as a supernumerary officer, and remained as such till the end of the war. But it is not stated to what particular regiment he belonged, nor is it stated whether the regiment of which-he was an officer, was in existence at the time of the passage of the act of May 1779. I think it is apparent, that that act promises half pay for life to the officers of those battalions or regiments <em>only, </em>which were <em>then </em>(that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>is, at the passage of the act) in existence; and that the promise does not extend to such battalions as had, previously thereto, either by consolidation or discharge, been dispensed with.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">1. I am very strongly inclined to the opinion, that, notwithstanding the words \u201cwho <em>have </em>become supernumerary,\u201d in the act of May 1779, there were, at that time, no supernumeraries in those continental battalions or regiments which were in existence or in service at that date. That there were supernumeraries as early as 1778, or perhaps earlier, in some of the <em>Virginia </em>continental battalions, is, I think, sufficiently proved. It is proved by the resolution of congress of the 24th November 1778, Journ. Cong. vol. 3. p. 133. which speaks of many valuable officers having been omitted in the <em>new arrangement, </em>as being supernumerary. But several of those <em>Virginia </em>continental battalions had been entirely dispensed with in March 1779, only two or three months before the act of May 1779. Hence it is probable, that the officers deraigned previously to March 1779, and by dispensing with several battalions at that time, were officers of those battalions, and not those of the battalions <em>retained. </em>If I am right in this, then the words before quoted, \u201c who have become supernumerary,\u201d will have their effect by being applied to the battalions in <em>state </em>service, none of which had been dispensed with previous to the passage of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">That four of the <em>Virginia </em>battalions on continental establishment had been dispensed with, or put out of service, by the resolution of congress of March 1779, seems apparent by a reference to the ordinances of the <em>Vi'rginia </em>convention, the acts of assembly, and the resolutions of congress. The <em>Virginia </em>battalions were originally fifteen in number. The two first were raised by virtue of the ordinance of July 1775; seven others by the ordinance of December .1775 ; and the remaining six by the act of October 1776. 9 Hen. Stat. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>large, p. 12. 76. 179. On the 9th March 1779, con\u00bb \u2022 \u2022 gress resolved, that the infantry of the <em>United States </em>for the next campaign be composed of <em>eighty </em>battalions; and the number of the <em>Virginia </em>battalions was reduced to <em>eleven. </em>Journ. Cong. vol. 3. p. 223. This shews that <em>four </em>of the <em>Virginia </em>battalions were put out of service. Which they were, who can tell at this day ? Can there be any <em>certainty </em>on this subject, without reference to the rolls of the army ? I think it very probable that the 8th and 9th battalions were put out of service at that time, or previously thereto; but I have found no evidence to shew which of the others were put out of service. As to the 9th, we have record evidence, that it was taken captive by the enemy at the battle of \u00a3?er<em>mantown, </em>and the legislature, by the act of October 1777, substituted the first <em>Virginia </em>regiment in its stead. 9 Hen. Stat. at large, p. 337. And as to the 8th, there is a certificate of lieutenant col. <em>Ciarle </em>of that regiment, that it was annexed to the-regiment in 1778 or 1779.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">I think it probable that these two battalions, and perhaps two others, were not existing \u201c battalions of this commonwealth on continental establishment,\u201d at the passage of the act of May session 1779, and if so, <em>their </em>officers are not included in the promise of half pay, because they were not officers \u201c <em>commanding </em>in the battalions of this commonwealth,\u201d nor could they be \u201c supernumerary on the reduction of any of the <em>said </em>battalions;\u201d that is, of the battalions then in service.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">It does not appear in the case now before us, and . most probably it never can be made to appear, that lieutenant <em>Tatum </em>had ever been an officer in either of the battalions <em>retained </em>under the resolution of congress of March 1779. Unless he was, he had no title to half pay under our act. Colonel <em>Bowman </em>was an officer of the 8th, which was merged, it seems, in some other, and <em>he </em>never was entitled to the half pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The view which I have taken was suggested by our brother <em>BrooTce, </em>who was himself a revolutionary officer, and who is satisfied that the <em>Virginia </em>continental officers who became supernumerary were never entitled to half pay from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">It is strongly confirmed by the following statement. I think I can confidently assert, that from the midst of our revolution until the year 1833 (a period of more than fifty years) it was not known by any branch of the government of Virginia, legislative, executive or judiciary, that the officers of the continental line had any claim, either legal or equitable, upon the state for the bounty of half pay for life; and if I may judge from the silence of the officers themselves for more than half a century, I should say, that they did not know it, or if they knew it, that they did not choose to assert it. I have examined the journals of the house of delegates for several years, and cannot find the suggestion of such a claim. In December 1781, <em>flagrante bello, </em>the officers of the <em>state </em>battalions and corps presented their memorial to the general assembly, claiming as supernumeraries their half pay for life, and the opinion of the committee (of which mr. <em>Henry </em>was chairman) was in favour of the claim; Journ. Oct. 1781, p. 37. The legislature, without however voting on the resolution asserting their right, did by law direct a return of the <em>state </em>officers, in which return the corps, the rank of each officer, the date of his commission, the number of men at first raised in each corps, the number of men after reduction, and the time of reduction, should be specified, and a discrimination made of such officers as were unworthy of half pay. 10 Hen. Stat. at large, p. 466. It was in obedience to this law, that the board of officers in the particular service of the state sat in <em>Richmond </em>in February and April 1782, and made the report of such of the state line as were entitled, in their judgment, to half pay. The officers of the navy too had presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>their memorial, and a board of officers was also called to decide on their claims to half pay, which sat in 1784. But we hear of no such memorial from the officers of the <em>Virginia </em>line on <em>continental </em>establishment. And this did not proceed from any unwillingness to assert their rights; for, in the same session of December 1781, a memorial from them was presented, setting forth the inconveniences they experienced from the depreciation of their pay, and that large arrearages were due them : and a committee, of which mr. <em>Henry </em>was chairman, reported a series of resolutions in their favour. Journ. p. <em>22. </em>30. If they had taken the same view of their rights under the act of 1779, that the officers on state establishment did, would they not, at that period, have presented their memorials also ? Would not mr. <em>Henry </em>have reported in their favour as well as in that of the state officers ? So, at the session of May 1783, the officers of the state line and of the state navy presented their'memorials, claiming, amongst other things, their half pay for life : they were before the committee of the whole house, and the chairman reported it as the opinion of the committee, that so much of their memorial as prayed that effectual measures might be taken to secure the said officers their half pay, or a compensation for it, was reasonable, and that adequate funds ought to be established for paying to such officers their half pay agreeable to law. Journ. May 1783, p. 78. 89. 90. Accordingly, during that same session, a bill passed authorizing the auditors to issue to such of the officers of the <em>state line and navy, </em>as were by law entitled to half pay, their warrants for the same; 10 Hen. Stat. at large, p. 266. Then also, the officers of the <em>continental line </em>exhibited no claim for half pay for life. The war was at an end ; the state officers were pressing their claim for half <em>pay; the act </em>of 1779 was as familiar to them as to the state officers; it was familiar to the two branches of the legislature, who passed those resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>lions and that act: why did not those officers then assert the claim ? why did not the legislature, from a sense of justice, then pass a law in their favour, as well as in favour of the state officers ? Why, but because neither the officers themselves, nor either branch of the legislature, had the least conception that they had any <em>right </em>to claim half pay for life from the state government? Nay further, the same officers, at the same session of May 1783, after the war was over, presented a memorial to the legislature, which is thus noticed in the journal, p. 15. \u201cA memorial of the officers of the <em>Virginia line in continental service, </em>on behalf of themselves and the soldiers of the said line, was presented to the house, and read, setting forth, that fully satisfied of the attention of the legislature to their past requisitions, they are induced to represent the inequality and insufficiency of the bounty of lands intended for them, as well as the particular distress of the soldiers, and their inability to survey the said lands ; that in the same confidence, they hope proper funds will be provided for the redemption of the certificates granted them for pay and depreciation; and praying that the assembly will adopt measures for their present relief, as well as to execute the former promises and intention of the legislature in their favour.\u201d The memorial was referred to the committee of propositions and grievances, and the resolutions of that committee were referred to the committee of the whole, and subsequently acted on by the legislature. The officers of <em>thestate </em>line followed suit, and presented their memorial for relief as to their land bounty, and deficiencies of pay and rations, and were in these respects placed on the same footing with the continentals. Now, here were the <em>continental </em>officers claiming their <em>rights </em>of bounty land, and retribution for depreciated pay, at the bands of a willing legislature, and yet not saying one word as to their <em>right </em>to <em>half pay, </em>which their brother officers of the <em>state </em>line were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>at that moment successfully pressing. Why this omiss*on&gt; but for their conviction that they had no such rightful claim against the state government ? After that period, a controversy arose between the officers of the <em>state </em>line and the different departments of the government, as to <em>their </em>right to half pay, unless they served to the end of the war. On the 22d December 1783, the two houses resolved, that the auditors be directed not to issue any more warrants for the half pay of the <em>state </em>line, until the further order of the general assembly. Whether that resolution was founded on a belief that the act of 1779 had been misconstrued by the legislature in l'/Sl and May 1783, or whether, as has been suggested, it was because funds had not been provided, and the credit of their warrants had depreciated for want of funds, I am not able to ascertain. Nor have I examined the proceedings of the legislature from that time to December 1790, when the legislature gave a construction to the act of 1779, different from that of the two former legislatures, and confined the half pay for life of the officers of the <em>stale </em>line, to those who continued in actual service to the end of the war, and to the supernumeraries who, being afterwards required, did again enter into actual service, and continue therein to the end of the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">After this legislative construction, the officers of the <em>state line </em>appealed to the courts, and the controversy was kept up in them from 1791 to 1797, with alternate success, when it was supposed to be finally settled. During that period too, we hear nothing of the claims of the supernumerary officers of the <em>Virgi?iia continental </em>line. The doors of the courts of justice were just as open to them during the whole period, as they were to the officers of the <em>slate </em>line, and yet we hear of no claim being set up by them, no pretence of right, till the year 1833. Had these officers exhibited their claims when the state officers did, the legislature might have adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the same rule with them that they did with the state officers: they might have called on a board of officers to discriminate between the worthy and the unworthy, and to have a complete list of those entitled; but as it is, they are deprived of the means of preventing imposition. I am, for these reasons, strongly impressed with the opinion, that none of the supernumeraries of the <em>continental </em>line previous to May 1779, are entitled to half pay. The supernumeraries produced by the further reduction of the <em>Virginia </em>battalions to <em>eight </em>in October 1780, were provided for by congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">2dly, I am of opinion, that although the commonwealth is not named in the statutes of limitations, yet where no claim whatever has been set up for a series of years, or, if set up, has been abandoned, it is the duty of the courts to reject a claim condemned by its antiquity. If a claim against the commonwealth, which depends for its justice as well on the evidence as the law, be not exhibited for half a century, why should not the <em>courts </em>guard the public treasury against such stale claims, as well as the fortunes of individuals against claims of a much shorter existence ? If fifty years are no protection against such claims, why should they not be kept alive for a century, or two centuries ? On this ground, I should be of opinion to reject this claim, and leave the claimant to seek for his dues, if he has any, from that branch of the government which represents the sovereignty of the commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">But, 3dly, if it should be thought that I am wrong in both of these opinions, then the question is, whether the construction of the act of 1779, given by this court in <em>Lilly's </em>case, be a correct one ? and if it be not, whether we are bound by it ? That act has been very differently construed by this court at different times. In the year 1792, the court, consisting of three judges <em>{Lyons, Carrington </em>and <em>Fleming) </em>decided, that only such of the officers who became supernumerary on the reduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>their battalions, as again <em>actually entered into the said ser- </em># <em>v'lce- </em>in same or a higher rank, having been required so to do, and <em>continued therein until the end of the war, J </em>were entitled to half pay. In 1797, the court, consisting also of three judges <em>{Lyons, Carrington </em>and <em>Roane) </em>gave the same decision. After these two concurring judgments were rendered, there was an acquiescence in them for more than thirty years. At length <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case came on in 1830, and three of the judges <em>{Coalter, Green </em>and <em>Carr) </em>against the opinion of judge <em>BrooTce, </em>overruled the two former decisions, and declared that supernumeraries, who continued such without being required to reenter the service, were entitled to half pay, and that they only forfeited it, if, on being required to reenter in the same or a higher grade, they refused so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Now, when for the first time a new class of cases is brought before us, (new in being exhibited by <em>continental </em>officers, and in reaching beyond the passage of the law, possibly almost to the commencement of the war) it behooves us to pause, and reconsider our judgments. I should not think of doing so, if the decisions had been uniform; but when the last is expressly opposed to the former ones; when the court was warned of the maxim <em>stare decisis, </em>and refused to listen to it, it cannot be deemed improper for the present court to inquire which of the two constructions is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">There is but one sentence in the law giving half pay, and that embraces both officers in command and supernumeraries. To me it seems clear, that both clauses of the sentence impose the <em>continuance </em>in the service <em>to the end of the war, </em>as an indispensable <em>condition </em>to the acquisition of half pay for life. It is not disputed, that such condition is imposed on the officers mentioned in the first clause; namely, \u201c all officers <em>commanding </em>or who <em>shall command, </em>all chaplains, physicians, surgeons, and surgeon\u2019s mates.\u201d The second clause I will quote: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u201c And all officers who have or shall become supernumerary on reduction of any of the said battalions, and shall again enter into the said service, if required so to do, in the same or any higher rank, and <em>continue therein until the end of the war, </em>shall be entitled to half pay for life.\u201d The condition of continuance in the service until the end of the war, is but once expressed in the whole sentence; and the identical words which are applied to supernumeraries in the last clause, are applied to officers commanding and chaplains &amp;c. in the first. Taking the grammatical construction, the nominatives <em>officers commanding\u2014chaplains\u2014officers supernumerary, </em>are connected together by the conjunction <em>and; </em>and the verb <em>continue </em>agrees with all of those nominatives, so connected together. If then the <em>officers commanding, </em>and the <em>chaplains See. </em>must <em>continue </em>until the end of the war, to entitle them to half pay, so must the <em>officers supernumerary </em>continue to the end of the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The half pay is not a reward for <em>past </em>service, but a remuneration or bounty for prospective services: services to be rendered, not for two, three or more years, or for any definite period, but to the <em>end of the war. </em>The legislature do not express any determination to fasten all officers, past, present and future, as pensioners for life on the public treasury; not all who heretofore may have done, or hereafter may do, real service for a time; but only such as shall do that service to the <em>end of the war.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">But it may have been asked of the draughtsman of the bill, Is it not absurd to speak of supernumeraries continuing in service to the end of the war ? Supernumeraries are those officers who are out of service by the reduction of their battalions; their services are not wanting for those battalions ; they have no right to render service in them after being deraigned, and cannot continue till the end of the war.\u2014To this the reply probably was, Although out of service when deraigned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>yet it may be the policy of the legislature to fill up those reduced battalions by new enlistments of soldiers s if they are so filled up, it may be good policy to call back into service the deraigned officers, or at least some of them (perhaps not all, for all are not skilled in war); and it may be a fit opportunity to separate the wheat from the chaff, the good officers from the indifferent ones, giving to the latter their full pay and bounty lands, and to the former, besides their full pay and bounty lands, the additional bounty of half pay for life, if, when they are called, they come, and continue to serve to the end of the war.\u2014Some such view was most probably taken of the subject, and hence the words in the act, which have been the subject of so much criticism\u2014 \u201c and shall again enter into the said service, <em>if required so to do.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">It is asked, why insert these words, \u201cif required so to do\u201d ? are they mere surplusage ? I think they are not mere surplusage. It cannot be surplusage to use words which convey the writer\u2019s idea accurately, although perhaps they would be <em>understood </em>were they omitted. The writer knew, that a supernumerary could not <em>voluntarily </em>enter again into the said service, in the same or a higher rank; he knew, that he must be called on or required so to enter. If he had said, \u201c and all supernumeraries who shall enter again into the said service, in the same or a higher rank, and shall continue therein to the end of the war, shall be entitled to half pay during life,\u201d he knew it might be <em>understood </em>that he meant, that all of them who should be called on or required to enter again, and only such, should be entitled; but why not as well <em>express </em>the idea at once, as leave it to be understood? This accounts for the expression, \u201c if required so to dowhich means nothing more than <em>when </em>required, or <em>on being </em>required. But the conjunction <em>if </em>imports a condition ; so does the word <em>when, </em>or the words <em>on being: </em>but the insertion of that condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>lion does not destroy or impair the other indispensable ... ,, .... . , condition oi continuing in the service to the end oi trie war. I do not see in what more appropriate language the legislature could have expressed the idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">I do not see the necessity of striking out those words; but if the construction adopted in <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case is to prevail, that supernumeraries are to have half pay, although they do not continue in service to the end of the war, because the government will not require them, then we must either expunge the significant words \u201cand continue therein till the end of the war;\u201d or, if we retain all the words of the clause, then we must add to the end of it an expression to this effect: \u201c but if the commonwealth shall not require the said officers again to enter the service as aforesaid, the said supernumeraries shall still be entitled to their half pay as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The principal stumbling block with chancellor <em>Wythe, </em>was the words <em>command or service; </em>and judge <em>Carr </em>seems to have adopted the same idea. It is successfully combated by judge <em>Broofce </em>in his opinion in <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case (p. 564.) and judge <em>Green </em>acceded to that proposition. The words <em>command or service </em>are to be taken dislributively, the former applying to officers who had a command, the latter to those of the staff who bad no command. The officers commanding, or who shall command, and the supernumeraries of the same character, shall have half pay from the determination of their <em>commands; </em>and chaplains, physicians, surgeons, and surgeon\u2019s mates, and supernumeraries of the same character, from the determination of their <em>services.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">From the language of this law, I can see no legal obligation on the government, either to fill up the old battalions by new enlistments, or to call on the old officers to command them if they were so filled up. If the government was not legally bound to require them to reenter the service,\u2014if it might dispense with their future services, I do not see how it can be inferred from\u2019 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>use of the words \u201c if required so to <em>do,\u201d </em>that the failure . , , . . to require them gave to the supernumeraries the same right to half pay, that the requisition, and a compliance with it to the end of the war, would have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">But it was said by judge <em>Carr, </em>if the supernumeraries not required to reenter the service, are not entitled to half pay, why mention them at all by that name ? if they again enter the service, they cease to be supernumeraries ; they are officers in service, and come within the first clause of the law. The answer to this is given by judge <em>Green. </em>\u201cA special provision,\u201d he says, \u201cwas necessary for supernumeraries, if they were intended to be provided for in any case whatever; since none such, whether then being, or thereafter becoming supernumerary, could claim under the former part of the provision, as they could not claim as having served (henceforth\u2019 (from the passing of the act) <em>\u2018 </em>or from the time of their being commissioned, until the end of the war.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">I cannot think with judge <em>Green, </em>that the expression \u201c if required so to do,\u201d pervades and qualifies the whole sentence. I do not see on what principle of sound construction, we can give that expression a different collocation in the sentence, from that which the legislature gave it. It obviously refers to its immediate antecedent \u201c shall again enter into the service,\u201d and not to the subsequent phrase \u201c and continue therein until the end of the war.\u201d After the supernumerary shall, according to the requisition of the government, enter again into the service in the same or any higher rank, then he shall be entitled to half pay for life, provided he (like the officer commanding) shall continue therein until the end of the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The words \u201cin the same or any higher rank,\u201d were inserted to save the honour of the officer. Holding his old commission, it would be degrading him to require him to reenter in an inferiour rank. Whilst the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ment enters into no obligation to cali upon him again, . \u201e . . ... . , . . , yet if it exercises the right to do so, this is a pledge that he shall not be in such inferiour rank. But I cannot see that this expression has any effect whatever on the condition on which the supernumerary is to have his half pay; namely, that <em>when </em>he enters, he is to serve to the end of the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b99-12\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AyeX\">concurred in the opinion of <em>Parker, </em>J. that the judgment ought to be reversed, and the claim of <em>Tatum </em>allowed.</p>\n<author id=\"b99-13\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AFPO\">concurred with <em>Brockenbrough, </em>J. on the first and last points of his opinion; but he expressed no opinion on the second point.</p>\n<author id=\"b99-14\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AiW\">My brethren being divided in opinion, it becomes my reluctant duty to express my sentiments, for the first time, upon the subject of these revolutionary claims. And 1 shall begin by saying, that notwithstanding the very strong views presented by my brother <em>Brockenbrough </em>in the opinion just delivered, and by my brother <em>Brooke </em>in conference, I still incline to the opinion, that the language of the act of May 1779 cannot be otherwise construed, than to place the <em>continental </em>officers on the same footing with the <em>state </em>line as to half pay, and to include not only those who became supernumerary afterwards, but those also who had become so before the act. If this be so, the case stands upon the same principles as <em>Lilly's </em>case; and congress having provided for the payment of all claims \u201cdepending on the principles of the half pay cases already decided\u201d in this court, and having thus adopted the decision in <em>Lilly's </em>case, whether right or wrong, 1 presume the claim of payment under this legislative grant would be availing at the treasury of the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The question here, however, is whether, admitting the identity of <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case with this, this court is bound to give judgment for the petitioner against the state of <em>Virginia </em>? This depends of course upon the questions, whether <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case is conclusively binding upon us ? and if not, whether it was rightly decided ? I espouse the negative of both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">I shall not find it necessary to examine, whether the rule <em>stare decisis </em>has any application to the question of a statute, partaking rather of the character of a contract, than of a general law. If such a distinction can be sustained, it would be the best apology for the utter disregard, in <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case, of two previous well considered adjudications; but the distinction would, at the same time, relieve the present court from every obligation to follow <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>case, on the score of authority merely. If, on the other hand, the distinction is without foundation, then <em>Lilhfs </em>case is without excuse for overruling the established judgments of this court. For my own part, though I heartily concur in the'propriety of giving to our adjudications as much uniformity as possible, yet I cannot think that a single decision ought to be i-egarded as a precedent binding upon a succeeding court, which is not satisfied with its reasons, but is convinced that the former determination is not law. For a single decision is rarely taken to express the law upon any subject whatsoever, nor does it become law until it has received the corroboration of repeated decisions. And this is peculiarly proper, where that single decision is to be made the entering wedge for the introduction of a most numerous class of cases, by which the revenues and resources of the commonwealth are to be sapped, and heavy burdens to be imposed upon the people. In such a case, it would seem but reasonable that a single decision, however entitled to respect, should not be conclusive upon the judicial mind, but that the question should be reexamined, if a succeeding court is not satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>with the judgment. And this is peculiarly proper, where the court has been divided as in <em>Lilly's </em>case ; in which the oldest judge (who was also peculiarly qualilied to pronounce upon this revolutionary transaction) dissented from the opinion of his three brethren, one of whom, until very recently before the judgment, coincided with him, and for reasons of great weight, as appears from his opinion. Had he retained his first opinion, the court would have been equally divided. Standing then by itself, I do not think <em>Lilly's </em>case entitled to the weight which is attributed, and justly attributed, to the established precedents of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">But <em>Lilly's </em>case is liable to a more serious objection. It has set at naught the previous resolutions in the case of <em>Innis </em>v. <em>Roane, </em>4 Call 379. which was twice before the court of appeals, at an interval of five years; argued and reargued by most able counsel; and decided unanimously in both cases by this court. If, then, adjudications under this statute are to be held as binding precedents, <em>Lilly's </em>case must be overruled, because it has disregarded binding precedents. If, on the other hand, it was competent to the court, in <em>Lilly's </em>case, to reconsider and reverse the former unanimous decisions on two occasions, it is equally competent to us to reconsider this question, and to pronounce between the <em>conflicting </em>decisions. The alternative, therefore, is either to follow a decision which appears to me erroneous in principle, and in conflict with prior resolutions, or to follow' the former repeated decisions in concordance with my own views, and to overrule <em>Lilly's </em>case, which is altogether at variance with them. I cannot hesitate which to choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">I have said, that I consider <em>Lilly's </em>case as having given an erroneous construction of the act of May 1779. I shall not enter into an investigation of that question, contenting myself with referring to the opinions of judge <em>Roane, </em>judge <em>Brooke </em>and judge <em>Green, </em>and to the argument of the attorney general in the case of <em>Innis </em>v. <em>Roane. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>I will merely add, that I cannot concur in tearing the ' ^ words \u201c if required so to do,\u201d from their place in the context, and placing them in another part of the sentence, so as to qualify other words than those with which they have been placed in apposition by the legislature itself. Taking the law as it stands upon the statute book, and considering the object of the legislature to diminish the charges of the army by disbanding the supernumerary officers, my mind entertains not a doubt, that, according to the true construction, no supernumerary was entitled to half pay, unless he was again called into active service, and so continued till the end of the war. I am therefore of opinion, that the judgment of the circuit superiour court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
