Held, the claim of the appellee creditor of decedent was, by the decree aforesaid of this court, determined to be a debt by simple contract only; and therefore, as against such creditor, the administrator has a right to retain the amount of his own simple contract demand against the testator.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b595-13\">The settlement of an administration account under an <em>ex parte </em>order of the court which granted administration, is <em>prima facie </em>evidence in favour of the administrator against creditors of decedent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-14\">This is the sequel of the case between the same parties, which was before this court in November 1827; reported 6 Rand. 49.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-15\">The controversy arose on a bill exhibited in the superiour court of chancery holden at Fredericksburg, by <em>Christian </em>and others, claiming, as heirs and distributees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of <em>John Fleet </em>deceased, against <em>Martin Shearman </em>in his lifetime, to set aside, as fraudulently procured, a deed execute&lt;^ by <em>Fleet </em>in his lifetime, conveying almost his whole estate to <em>Martin Shearman, </em>and a will of <em>Fleet </em>devising and bequeathing to the same <em>Martin Shearman </em>his whole estate, of which will (as it appeared in the progress of the cause, though it was not stated in the pleadings) the said <em>Shearman </em>had qualified as executor. <em>Martin Shearman </em>died pending the proceedings; and they were revived against <em>E. C. Shearman, </em>administrator with the will annexed, and also a devisee and legatee of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>and <em>Ellis </em>and <em>Tapscott </em>the other devisees and legatees. The deed and will of <em>Fleet </em>being found and declared to be fraudulent, the proper accounts were ordered; and among others, the account of <em>E. G. Shearman's </em>administration of <em>Martin Shearman's </em>estate; and upon that account being reported, the question arose, whether the debt due from <em>Martin Shearman </em>for the profits of <em>Fleet's </em>personal estate and the principal thereof used by him, which he had claimed and enjoyed under the deed and will that had been set aside as fraudulent, was to be considered as a debt due from <em>Martin Shearman </em>in his character of executor of <em>Fleet, </em>and therefore of superiour dignity to any proper debt of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>so as to exclude all credits claimed by <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>his administrator, for debts of <em>Martin </em>paid by him, and <em>to make the </em>administrator chargeable with a <em>devastavit </em>to that extent ? The chancellor held the affirmative, and made his decree against the administrator for the <em>devastavit, </em>accordingly. The decree was rendered in favour of <em>Thomas Armstrong </em>administrator of <em>Fleet, </em>who had qualified as such after the will of <em>Fleet </em>was set aside, and had been made a party defendant to the suit by a supplemental bill. And from that decree the first appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-4\">This court declared, \u201c that in the accounts of the administration of the appellant\u201d (E. <em>G.

The new report allowed <em>E. G. Shearman </em>the administrator a credit for the sum of 1457 dollars 20 cents, which he claimed as due to him on simple contract from his testator <em>Martin Shearman, </em>and which he insisted he had a right <em>to retain </em>as against the plaintiff\u2019s. In the \u201c special statement of the appellant\u2019s administration\u201d referred to in the decree of this court, this sum was also credited to him as so much which he had a right to retain; and in relation thereto, the said special statement contained the following remarks of the commissioner: \u201c The sum of 1457 dollars 20 cents is admitted in this account, which was excluded from the report\u201d (meaning the report on which the decree reversed by this court was founded) \u201c because of inferiour dignity to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and because 1000 dollars of that sum is for one third of the schooner <em>Lancaster, </em>one half of which is entered in the inventory and appraisement signed by the defendant <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>and in the account of sales, as of the estate of <em>Martin Shearman. </em>The defendant <em>Shearman </em>requires that it be specially stated, that <em>one third </em>of this schooner was conveyed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>him to <em>Martin Shearman, </em>(and he exhibited a deed to . ' that effect); that it was so conveyed, that he might take the oath required of him as surveyor of the port <em>1 J </em>1 of <em>Tappahannock, viz. \u2018 </em>that he did not own a vessel or Part of a vessel,\u2019 <em>&amp;c.; </em>that the said <em>Martin </em>was to have paid him, and did so, by his <em>will; </em>but that the property devised will be covered by his <em>debts; </em>and that unless this item is allowed him, as it increases the inventory and appraisement, it will be a double loss.\u201d In the progress of the cause after the same was remanded to the court of chancery, there were filed as exhibits, a copy of the enrolment offthe schooner <em>Lancaster, </em>and a copy of a deed made by <em>E. G. Shearman </em>to. <em>Martin Shearman, </em>purporting to convey an interest in the said <em>schooner; </em>both of which copies were certified by the collector of the port of <em>Tappahannock. </em>The enrolment was dated the 30th of November 1810, and set <em>forth, </em>that <em>E. G. Shearman </em>had made oath that himself and <em>Martin Shearman </em>were \u201c sole owners of the ship or vessel called the <em>Lancaster </em>of Fredericksburg.\u201d By the deed, <em>E. G. Shearman </em>bargained and sold to <em>Martin Shearman, </em>for the expressed consideration of one dollar, \u201c <em>one half </em>of the good schooner called the <em>Lancaster </em>of <em>Fredericksburg.'\" </em>This deed was dated the 28th of June 1811. There was also filed as an exhibit, an account of <em>E. G. Shearman </em>as administrator of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>settled by commissioners appointed for the purpose by an order of <em>Lancaster </em>county court made the 19th of November 1818, which was returned to and recorded in that court on the 15th of February 1819. In this account, among the debits of the year 1815, there was one in the following terms : \u201c To cash paid <em>E. G. Shearman's </em>account, $1457.20.\u201d The commissioner charged with reforming the administration account taken in the cause according to the decree of the court of appeals, having applied to the chancellor for instructions as to the effect of the account settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>under the order of <em>Lancaster </em>county court, the chancel- ^ lor directed that it should be taken as <em>prima facie </em>evidence; \u201cno part of the pleadings on the part of the plaintiffs having called for an account.\u201d The depositions of two witnesses examined on behalf of the plaintiffs (with a view, as it seemed, to shew that <em>E. Q. Shearman </em>never had any interest in the schooner <em>Lancaster) </em>were also filed in the cause; but they proved nothing more than that the deponents had <em>always understood </em>the schooner to be entirely the property of <em>Martin Shear-man; </em>one of the deponents adding, that <em>Martin </em>himself had told him she was his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">By the reformed report it appeared, that the plaintiffs objected before the commissioner to the charge of 1000 dollars (part of the 1457 dollars 20 cents) for one third of the schooner <em>Lancaster, </em>on three several grounds; <em>first, </em>that <em>E. G. Shearman\u2019s </em>assignment to <em>Martin Shearman </em>was merely colourable, to enable himself to take the oath of surveyor; <em>secondly, </em>that if the assignment was <em>hona fide, </em>it was paid for by the devise and profits of the real estate of <em>Martin Shearman; thirdly, </em>that at all events the claim was but a simple contract debt, and the defendant had no right to retain. But after the report was returned, the plaintiffs filed but one exception thereto; which was in the following words: \u201c The plaintiffs and the defendant <em>Armstrong except to </em>the allowance of the account due to <em>E. G. Shearman </em>(as appears by the report) of 1457 dollars 20 cents, because it is a debt of inferiour dignity to theirs, and the decree of the court of appeals does not direct that it shall be allowed, but by strong implicationforbids it,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-7\">2. The administrator claimed credits likewise for sundry small sums disbursed by him, chiefly for expenses in this suit. These credits were allowed in the \u201cspecial statement\u201d referred to in the decree of this court; but they were disallowed in the report on which the chan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>cellor\u2019s decree, reversed as aforesaid, was founded; and they were now again rejected by the commissioner in stating the reformed account. When that account was returned, the administrator excepted thereto, for the dis-allowance of the said credits; and also because the commission allowed him was inadequate,\u2014because sundry articles of personal property bequeathed by <em>Martin Shearman's </em>will were charged' to the administrator at the appraised value, instead of the price at which they were actually sold,\u2014and because interest was charged to the administrator upon the hires of slaves kept by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-5\">The commissioner assigned, at considerable length, his reasons for rejecting the claims which formed the subject of the defendant <em>Shearman's </em>exceptions; but as those exceptions were disposed of by the chancellor on a different ground, and the court of appeals declined entering into any detailed consideration of this part of the case, it is deemed unnecessary to set forth the evidence relating to these claims, or the reasons which influenced the commissioner to disallow them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-6\">The cause came on to be heard in May 1829, upon the reformed report, and the exceptions thereto; when the court of chancery, \u201c being of opinion that it would be inconsistent with the decree of the court of appeals to sustain the exceptions taken by the defendant,\u201d overruled the same, and <em>\u201c for </em>a like reason\u201d <em>sustained </em>the exception taken by the plaintiffs and the defendant <em>Armstrong </em>administrator of <em>Fleet, </em>\u201cthe effect whereof is to increase the balance reported to be due by the defendant <em>Shearman, </em>by the addition of the sum of 1457 dollars 20 cents.\u201d The court accordingly decreed that the defendant <em>E. G. Shearman </em>pay to the defendant <em>Armstrong </em>administrator of <em>Fleet, </em>to be disposed of by him as such administrator, the whole balance so increased, amounting to 4656 dollars 14 cents, with interest &amp;c. and to the plaintiffs their costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>From this decree, <em>Shearman </em>again appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-7\"><em>Leigh, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-8\"><em>Johnson, Stanard </em>and <em>Patton, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-11\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aox\">delivered the opinion of the court. We are of opinion that the question as to the dignity of the debt due from <em>Martin Shearman's </em>estate to <em>Fleet's </em>representatives was directly before this court upon the former appeal, and was directly decided. This is obvious from the opinions of the judges, to which we may refer as a guide in the interpretation of the decree. But it is, moreover, the direct result of the decree itself, since that allows a credit lo <em>E. G. Shearman </em>against the demand of the plaintiffs, of all proper debts of the testator <em>paid by </em>him. These words refer, it is true, to debts already paid; since, after suit even by a simple contract creditor, no voluntary payment to any other in the same degree is good. But of the debts already paid, a large portion were simple contracts, and were, by this decree, made good payments against the claim of <em>Fleet's </em>representatives. That claim must then have been held, and must now be held, to be a simple contract debt as between these contesting parties. If so, <em>E. G. Shearman </em>the administrator has a right to <em>retain </em>his simple contract demand against it, even though he should not be considered to have paid it already, by demanding and receiving credit for it before the commissioners of the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The only question, then, is as to the justice of his claim of 1457 dollars 20 cents, or rather of a part of it to the amount of 1000 dollars. We think the claim ought to be sustained. It was allowed by the commissioners of the county court, and the account settled by them is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the justice of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>thin. ' mand; that is, the demand must be allowed unless it . 1 be disproved. On looking into the record, we find no-to disprove it. There is indeed some difficulty raised, from <em>E. G. Shearman's </em>assertion of his having sold <em>one third </em>instead of <em>one half </em>of the schooner, and from <em>Martin Shearman, </em>as it is said, being credited in the inventory with only one half of the schooner, instead of the whole. As to the first, it is obviously a mistake of <em>E. G. Shearman </em>or the commissioner, since the deed referred to shews that he did convey one half, and not one third only. And as to the second; we do not learn what became of the schooner, and if <em>Martin Shearman </em>had parted with one half of his interest, and .claimed but one half at his death, this difficulty would cease. But be this as it may, the appellees have never called in question these matters. In the last report, the commissioner, pursuing the directions of chancellor <em>Green, </em>allowed the account on the evidence of the settlement before the commissioners of the county court. The appellees did not except on the ground that <em>E. G. Shearman </em>had no interest in the vessel, or that 1000 dollars was too high a value for it. They objected before the commissioner, 1. that the assignment was colourable; 2. that the interest was paid for in the devise ; 3. that their demand was of superiour dignity. And this last was the only exception filed to the report. They waived all question as to <em>E. G. Shearman's </em>interest, or the value of it. They cannot now call it in question. Had they done so before, every thing might have been explained; or perhaps every thing was explained, or admitted, because at that time the nature of the transaction was understood between the parties. There is indeed every reason to believe that <em>E. G. Shearman </em>had an interest in the vessel. What motive could there be for his false swearing that he had so in 1810, in order to the enrolment; or for making a deed to <em>Martin Shearman </em>for one half in 1811, to enable him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>self to take the office of surveyor? Why did he not, on the last occasion, make oath that he had no interest, instead of making a deed for that which he had not ? No reason can be imagined. We must then take it that he had. an interest; and the value of that interest was allowed 20 years ago by the commissioners of the county court, who probably best knew it. The plaintiffs\u2019 exception should, therefore, have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">With respect to the defendant <em>Shearman's </em>exceptions, we <em>do not </em>distinctly see that the commissioner erred in rejecting the items, and we are therefore of opinion that the exceptions were properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Decree of chancery court reversed with costs, and decree entered, reducing the amount decreed against the appellant, by the surn of 1457 dollars 20 cents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
