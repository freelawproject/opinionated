He was referred, and he applied, for information on the subject, to <em>Herbert Cluiborne, </em>a lawyer, who had been the adviser of <em>Bassett; </em>and <em>Claiborne </em>stated in writing, that the bonds had been executed by <em>Bassett </em>to <em>Scott, </em>for a claim of the latter as administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of <em>Robert Robinson </em>deceased; that he <em>Claiborne </em>\u201c was conversant with the whole transaction, and thought there could be no doubt but that the debt was a <em>bona fide </em>one, <em>due now to Scott alone;\" </em>that <em>Bassett </em>had entered into the arrangement in consequence of which he had executed the bonds, advisedly, and \u201c upon the most mature deliberation,\u201d and <em>Claiborne </em>himself, after both he and <em>Bassett </em>had paid much attention to the nature of the claim, had prepared the bonds, and the deed of trust (in which.he was the trustee) to secure the payment of them; and that, since the bonds and the deed were executed, <em>Bassett </em>had informed him, that he was endeavouring to make arrangements to raise a sufficient sum of money to pay off the bonds to <em>Scott.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\"><em>Fisher </em>still hesitated to purchase the bonds, till it should be ascertained from <em>Bassett </em>himself, that there would be no objection to the payment of them, when they should fall due.

Of this <em>Bassett </em>immediately informed <em>Fisher; </em>and added, that the consideration of the bonds he had given to <em>Scott </em>and <em>Scott </em>had assigned to <em>Fisher, </em>was the claim which <em>Scott </em>as the administrator of <em>Robinson's </em>estate had on <em>Philip Grymes's </em>estate, and that, therefore, the bonds would not be paid to any one but upon the special order of the court of chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">The general court, at November term 1828, made the following order: \u201cOn the motion of <em>James Lyons, </em>to commit the estate of <em>Robert Robinson </em>deceased to the sheriff of the county of <em>Middlesex: </em>This day came the said <em>James Lyons </em>by his attorney, and the court having maturely considered the evidence adduced in support of the said motion, it seems to the court from the said evidence, that the said <em>Robert Robinson </em>died out of this commonwealth, and had not at the time of his death any place of residence therein, and had not any lands or any other estate in the city of <em>Richmond; </em>and that, therefore, the letters of administration on the estate of the said <em>Robert Robinson, </em>which w'ere granted to <em>Robert G.

That <em>Fisher, </em>though he did not doubt the truth of this information, still refused to purchase the bonds, until he should ascertain from <em>Bassett </em>himself, whether or no he had any objection to the payment of them when they should fall due; upon which a messenger was sent to <em>Bassett </em>to inform him of <em>Fisher's </em>design to purchase the bonds; and the messenger made an <em>affidavit, </em>which was handed to <em>Fisher, </em>that <em>Bassett </em>said the bonds were really and <em>'bona fide </em>due, and he would pay them to the assignee of the same.

I do not consider a county or hustings court, in relation to the grant of administration, as standing on the same footing with (he ordinary in <em>England. </em>The county court is a court of record, and its judgments or sentences cannot be questioned, collaterally, in other actions, provided it has jurisdiction of the cause. 6 Bac. Abr. Sheriff. M. 2. p. 166. 3 Wils. 345. And this is to be understood as having reference to jurisdiction over the <em>subject matter: foe </em>though it may be that the <em>facts </em>do not give jurisdiction over the <em>particular </em>case, yet if the jurisdiction extends over that <em>class of cases, </em>the judgment cannot be questioned; for then, the question of jurisdiction enters into and becomes an essential part of the judgment of the court. Thus, if a county court were to give judgment of death against a white man, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sheriff' would have no lawful authority to execute him : or, it a court of chancery were to grant probate of a will, it would be <em>ipso facto </em>void, since that court has no jurisdiction in <em>any </em>case of probates. It is held void <em>ipso </em>facto, because <em>no inquiry </em>is necessary to ascertain its invalidity. But where the court has jurisdiction of cases <em>ejusdem generis, </em>its judgment, in any case, is not merely void ; because its invalidity cannot appear without an inquiry into the facts; an inquiry, which the court itself must be presumed to have made, and which will not therefore be permitted to be revived collaterally. Thus, in <em>Prigg </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>2 Salk. 674. in an action for false imprisonment, the officer justified under a <em>ca. sa. </em>on a judgment in the court of common pleas, upon a verdict for 5 shillings, for a cause of action arising in <em>Bristol: </em>the plaintiff replied an act of parliament erecting a court in <em>Bristol, </em>and declaring that if any person brought any such action in any court at <em>Westminster, </em>and it appeared upon trial to be under 40 shillings, no judgment should be entered upon it, and if entered it should be <em>void: </em>yet the court held it only <em>voidable, </em>and sustained the plea. So, if an action of debt were brought against a resident of <em>Hanover </em>in the county of <em>Henrico, </em>and judgment should be rendered against him, a sheriff could not refuse to levy a <em>ca. sa. </em>issued upon the judgment, nor would he be liable for false imprisonment; for the plaintiff in the action of false imprisonment would not be received, collaterally, to allege that the court had no jurisdiction. Were it otherwise, the whole system of jurisprudence would be subverted : the sheriff would be converted into an appellate tribunal; and instead of the defendant\u2019s being compelled to plead to the jurisdiction at an early stage of the cause, he would be permitted to put it in issue in another case, after the termination of the first. As, therefore, the defendant <em>might have </em>been a resident of <em>Henrico </em>instead of <em>Hanover, </em>and even if not, as he might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>nevertheless have been suable in <em>Henrico </em>if the cause . . . of action arose there, the judgment of the court is con-elusive upon the point of jurisdiction; and although, in point of fact, the defendant might have been a nonresident, and the cause of action might not have arisen in <em>Henrico, </em>yet the judgment is valid; for the court had general jurisdiction over matters of that description, and the question whether that general jurisdiction embraced the particular case, having been decided by its judgment, can never be again raised, except by a proceeding in error, upon a case properly appearing upon the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Such would clearly be the law, in lhe case of a <em>Us cont\u00e9stala, </em>where both parties appeared, and the defendant either submitted to the jurisdiction, or upon plea it was decided against him. How then is it, where there is a proceeding <em>cxparte, </em>and of course where the party interested, who denies the jurisdiction, was not before the court which assumed it? And here I conceive, as before, that as to all the world except the party interested, whose rights are invaded or are to be affected by the sentence, that sentence is conclusive. Thus, if administration be granted by the county court of <em>Henrico, </em>when the jurisdiction in fact belonged to <em>Hanover, </em>within which county was the mansion house of the intestate, yet no debtor of the estate could be received to plead <em>nc tinques </em>administrator, in bar of an action for the recovery of a debt due to the estate. The greatest confusion and mischief would ensue, if such were the law; for then, wherever delay was desired, every debtor would deny the jurisdiction, and arrest the recovery of a just debt, by embarrassing inquiries as to the decedent\u2019s domicil or the place of his death, or whether the greater part of his lands or estate lay in this or that county. I take it, therefore, to be perfectly clear, that <em>Bassett </em>or <em>Braxton </em>could not have controverted <em>Scott's </em>powers, and that payment to him, or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>irrevocable engagement with him, must, consequently, <em>. </em>cj w <em>X </em>t&gt;e sustained as good and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"AKX\">Before I pass to other points, let us see how far other persons claiming administration are bound by the irreguiar grant of a court not having jurisdiction in the very case. Thus, how far was the sheriff of <em>Middlesex </em>concluded by the grant of administration of the hustings court of <em>Richmond, </em>supposing it not to have had jurisdiction in this particular case ? And here observe, that the proceeding in the hustings court having been <em>ex parte </em>instead of <em>inter paries, </em>it could conclude the rights of no person claiming against it. The general court, moreover, having jurisdiction in <em>all </em>cases of administration, any person authorized to take it, whether next of kin, creditor or sheriff, might in that court move for and obtain administration as of right, unless it was excluded by some other court of <em>concurrent jurisdiction. </em>When, therefore, such motion is made, is it competent to arrest the proceeding by shewing that the hustings court had, without jurisdiction, granted administration to another ? I think not. It is admitted, that the order might be repealed by citation or rule upon the party in the hustings court. Of course, no one is concluded by it, and the only question is, by what proceeding it can be rendered inoperative. Now, I think, the principles of law, and the reason and convenience of the thing, all conspire to prove that the court of <em>general </em>jurisdiction, upon application <em>for </em>administration, is not concluded by a grant of administration by a court having no jurisdiction. For it is a universal rule, that no man\u2019s right of action (and such is an application for administration) can be barred or impeded by a proceeding to which he was not a party. And if the general court could not grant administration to the person really entitled to it, because the hustings court, without jurisdiction, had granted it to another, the party entitled would be barred and precluded of his rights by a sentence which he had no opportunity of contesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>It is objected, however, that thus there might be two ,... , . . , ~ . i-i' administrations. Admitted, ouch a state o\u00ed,things may well occur under our law; and this not only where one of the courts granting administration has no jurisdiction, but even where both have jurisdiction. Thus the county court, the circuit superiour court, and the general court, have concurrent jurisdiction. They may all sit on the same day, and each ma.y grant administration to a different creditor, upon application after the lapse of time in such case required by law. Suppose two such concurrent jurisdictions should grant two administrations. It may not be easy to decide how the difficulty of these conflicting rights would be avoided. But where one of the courts has jurisdiction, and the other has not, there can be no reason to doubt, that that which is granted by the court having jurisdiction is valid, and that which emanates from the court having no jurisdiction is, as to the former, a <em>nullity. </em>So, although the latter is first granted, yet upon application to the proper jurisdiction, that jurisdiction must treat as a nullity the intrusion of a tribunal having no jurisdiction. How can it do otherwise ? Shall it acquiesce in the invasion of its own authority and the rights of the applicant, by dismissing him from its forum, and turning him around to the tribunal which has done the wrong, for redress by way of citation ? and this too, when the proceeding had been <em>ex parted </em>Shall it consider itself <em>functus </em>officio, and barred of the right of acting on the subject, by the previous action of a body having no right to act ? I think not. It must, in the nature of things, determine its own jurisdiction. Every court must do so, though if it errs, its judgment will be corrected. And in determining its jurisdiction, if it be alleged that the subject has been concluded, and the powers of the courts of probate exhausted by a previous grant, it must of necessity inquire, whether the court making the grant had jurisdiction to make it; for, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>proceeding having been <em>ex </em>parte, the sentence is con- <em>, </em>elusive upon no one. I am therefore of opinion that the grant of administration by the general court was valid ; that that court had a right, and was of necessity obliged, to inquire whether the hustings court of <em>Richmond </em>had jurisdiction; and on ascertaining the negative, it was right in treating the grant of the hustings court as a nullity. From that time, but from that time only, it became null and void, and after payments to <em>Scott </em>would have been invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It is said, however, that debtors might be ignorant of the new grant of administration. It is not necessary now to decide, whether payments made to <em>Scott </em>without actual notice of the revocation of his powers, would have been good. Admitting they would not, and that the grant of the general court was notice to all the world, yet it is not more unreasonable to affect debtors with such notice, than to hold that every person entitled to administration is bound to take notice of an irregular administration. Thus, if A. dies at his mansion house in the county of <em>Wood, </em>and has a debtor in <em>Elizabeth City, </em>the jurisdiction is in <em>Wood </em>county court. Yet if administration be improperly granted in <em>Elizabeth City, </em>it is contended, that the subsequent grant by the proper court is void; that the party applying ought to have known the proceeding in <em>Elizabeth City, </em>and that he is bound by it. I cannot think so. It would be most strange, if a court <em>entitled to </em>act upon a subject should be ousted of its powers, by the unauthorized action of any one of a hundred other courts having no jurisdiction of the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">I had anxiously desired to avoid any remarks on this part of the subject, as there is a difference of opinion in the court respecting it. But it is impossible to avoid it, since the action of the court depends essentially on the question. I am happy in being sustained in my views by the decision of the learned judges of the ge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>neral court, cited in the argument; <em>Ex parte Barker, 2 </em>Leigh 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">On the merits of the case, I am clearly of opinion, that unless <em>Fisher </em>could shew that <em>Scott </em>had fairly become the purchaser of the debt due to <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>estate, or was in advance to that estate to the amount of the debt, the transaction was such a dealing with the assets as to render the transfer void. The sale of the bonds at so large a discount was itself <em>prima facie </em>a <em>devastavit, </em>and the burden of proof is upon <em>Scott </em>or <em>Fisher, </em>that the necessities of the <em>estate, </em>and not those of the administrator, required the sacrifice. <em>Fisher </em>must have known <em>Scott\u2019s </em>embarrassments. As <em>assignee, </em>he naturally looked to the circumstances of the assignor; and doing so, he must have known his difficulties. Here, then, is a dealer with an administrator\u2014conusant that the claim originally belonged to the intestate\u2019s estate\u2014 conusant of its conversion into the form of a <em>private </em>debt to the administrator, and without evidence of its transfer to him by those interested\u2014conusant of the administrator\u2019s great embarrassments\u2014who unites with him in a <em>devastavit </em>of the estate, by discounting paper belonging to it, at the ruinous rate of <em>twenty-five per cent., </em>without evidence, as far as yet appears, of the necessities of the estate requiring such a sacrifice. 1 forbear to comment on the other circumstances which ought to have satisfied <em>Fisher </em>that there was something amiss in the transaction, since it is not necessary. The conversion of the estate debt into a private debt, of which he was aware, was itself a <em>devastavit </em>in law, and the sale of it at a sacrifice was yet more obviously a <em>devastavit </em>in fact. He has enabled the administrator to commit it; and, upon well received doctrines, he must be the loser. Still, as it is <em>possible </em>that <em>Scott </em>may be in advance, and as <em>Fisher </em>will be entitled, in that event, to stand in his shoes, as far as the reimbursement of such advance, I am content to let the cause go back, to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>an opportunity for that inquiry. The decree must, in<em>\u00ed i. J </em>deed, be in any event reversed, since the injunction should only have been perpetuated as to <em>Fisher, </em>and the bonds and deed of trust should have been delivered over to the sheriff administrator of <em>Robinson, </em>for the benefit of the estate.</p>\n<author id=\"AZ4\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AQz\">I agree with the president of the court in the opinion he has just delivered, that the grant of administration to <em>Scott </em>by the hustings court of the city of <em>Richmond, </em>was not a <em>void, </em>but only a <em>voidable </em>act. The distinction between the acts of a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter under some circumstances, and those of one which, in no possible state of things, can take jurisdiction over the subject, is a sound and sufficiently intelligible one to guide our judgments in the present case. If, under any circumstances, the hustings court could grant administration to <em>Scott, </em>it had jurisdiction of the subject, and must judge of those circumstances. If it erred in determining that the facts, upon which its power to grant administration in the particular case depended, were sufficiently proved, it was an error to be corrected by some competent <em>authority; </em>but until so corrected, it conferred upon <em>Scott </em>all the powers of a rightful administrator. The analogy attempted to be drawn between the grant of an administration by the ordinary in <em>England, and </em>such grant by our courts of <em>record, </em>is too imperfect to justify us in encountering all the inconveniences and mischiefs which would result from considering the grant here merely void ; and it would be violating well established principles settled in other cases by the english courts themselves,\u2014as the counsel for the appellees have clearly shewn.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">I also agree in the opinion, that there was such a dealing with the assets of <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>estate between <em>Scott </em>and <em>Fisher, </em>as to render the transfer of the bonds by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the former to the latter, <em>prima facie </em>void. <em>Fisher </em>admits he knew that the claim of <em>Scott </em>on <em>Grymes\u2019s </em>estate origimated in his character of administrator of <em>Robinson. </em>He therefore knew, that there were equities existing in third persons, which ought to have been respected. If <em>Scott </em>was not in advance to the estate, or had not bought the claim from the distributees of <em>Robinson, </em>he could not deal with it, in the manner he did, as his own debt. Or, if the necessities of the estate did not require a sale of the bonds at so large a discount, it was a <em>devastavit </em>in <em>Scott </em>to sell to <em>Fisher. </em>When <em>Fisher </em>bought the bonds for so much less than their value, under the circumstances existing in this case, he took on himself the risk of shewing either that <em>Scott </em>was the real owner of them, or that the necessities of the estate justified the sacrifice. This he has not yet shewn; but I think he ought to have an opportunity of doing so, and that the court ought not to have perpetuated the injunction without ordering an account of <em>Scott's </em>administration of <em>Robinson's </em>estate. If any thing is due from that estate to <em>Scott, Fisher </em>is entitled to stand in his shoes; and if <em>Scott </em>has fairly made himself the individual proprietor of the bonds, all controversy is at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">I also think the court of chancery erred in directing the bonds of <em>Bassett </em>to be cancelled, and the deed of trust to be released. They should stand as securities for the benefit of <em>Fisher, </em>or of those entitled to <em>Robinson's </em>estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The only point in which, as at present advised, I am inclined to dissent from the president\u2019s opinion, is as to the effect he gives to the grant of administration by the general court to the sheriff of <em>Middlesex. </em>It seems to me, that this grant was itself a nullity; and that such is the necessary consequence of considering the first grant valid. By the grant to Scott, he was constituted the complete legal owner of the estate of <em>Robinson. </em>He was, for the purposes of administering it, as much the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>proprietor of the assets, as the intestate himself in his * . lifetime. No court, of equal powers over the subject matter, could transfer his rights to another, without repealing and annulling the original <em>grant; </em>and that grant could not be annulled but by citation in the same court, or by the action of an appellate tribunal, or in the several modes prescribed by our laws. When the general court undertook to determine, that the circumstances to give the hustings court jurisdiction did not exist, it exercised an appellate power over the acts of that court. It decided, that it had erred in its judgment as to a matter within its general jurisdiction over grants of administration ; and yet it did not and could not undertake to repeal or annul that grant. When the grant of administration was made to <em>Scott, </em>the jurisdiction of the court over the intestate\u2019s estate ceased. The statute only gives power to the court to grant letters testamentary or of administration, where there is no representative of the estate capable of exercising authority over if. The very object of the law is to constitute a legal owner of chattels left without such owner; and where there is already that legal proprietor, the foundation of the court\u2019s jurisdiction is as much taken away, as if the intestate himself was alive. The supreme court of the <em>U. States </em>has decided, in pursuance of these principles, that where probate of a will has been granted to an executor, no other court having general powers to grant administration, can, whilst the executor is capable of acting, transfer his powers to an administrator, but that the latter grant would be merely void, and every act done under it a nullity. <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>8 Cranch 1. The reasoning which led the court to such conclusion, seems to me to apply strongly to this case. Here, the estate was as fully represented as if there had been an executor; and I do not perceive how a court, without repealing and annulling the former grant, could undertake to transfer the estate to the sheriff of <em>Middlesex.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Yet, as this case will go back, I do not know that it is necessary for us now to decide, to whom, if <em>Fisher </em>fails in establishing his rights, the money due from <em>Bassett </em>ought to be decreed. The court below will no doubt admit or direct such parties to be made, as are interested in that question. The sureties of <em>Scott, </em>and the distributees of <em>Robinson, </em>have a deep interest in it; and it does not follow that the court will, under all circumstances that may hereafter appear, decree the payment to the sheriff of <em>Middlesex, </em>even if he has the legal right to receive it, much less to <em>Scott, </em>who has already shewn a disposition to deal improperly with the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">I should, therefore, be content to reverse the decree, for the reasons indicated by the president; with directions to admit all proper parties interested in the controversy, and to have an account taken of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>administration on <em>Robert Robinso?i\u2019s </em>estate, in order to a final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>expressed no opinion on the point on which the other two judges differed, probably thinking there was no necessity to decide it: but he concurred in the decree proposed by <em>Barker, J. </em>whereby</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The decree of the circuit superiour court was reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, with directions to make new parties, and to order an account to be taken of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>estate, in order to a final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
