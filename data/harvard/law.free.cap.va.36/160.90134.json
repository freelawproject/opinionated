He died in <em>Virginia; </em>and by his will, made ample provision of real and personal property for his wife, <em>Jane Thornton; </em>and she abided by the will, and therefore was entitled to no part of any personal estate of her husband left undisposed of by bis will; see <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>4 Leigh 162. Col. <em>Thornton's </em>claim for half pay or commutation in lieu thereof, being nowise disposed of by bis will, he was intestate in regard to it. <em>Winston, </em>his administrator with his will annexed, presented a petition to congress, praying an act for the payment to him of the commutation of five years full pay due to his testator for his services as an officer in the army of the revolution. The house of representatives passed a bill directing the payment thereof to him, according to the prayer of the petition; but the bill was laid on the table in the senate, in order that a controversy which had arisen between col. <em>Thornton's </em>widow on the one part, and his administrator and distributees on the other, as to the division of the money, might be adjusted, it was proposed by a friend of mrs. <em>Thornton, </em>that an amendment should be made to the bill, whereby one fourth of the money claimed by the administrator and allowed by the bill of the house of representatives, should be paid to her; the administrator, at first, positively refused to give his consent to any such amendment; but one of the distributees of col. <em>Thornton </em>being present, in order to obviate opposition to the bill, gave his consent to the proposed amendment; and then the administrator said, that that forced him to consent to it also. Whereupon, an amendment was prepared, and proposed in and adopted by the senate, whereby the administrator was directed to pay <em>one fourth </em>of the money allowed him by the bill for the commutation of five years full pay due to his testator, to mrs. <em>Thornton, </em>the widow of the testator, and to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the residue among the persons entitled thereto according to the laws of <em>Virginia. </em>And with this amendment the bill passed both houses, and was approved February 9th 1833.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\"><em>Winston, </em>the administrator, having received the money from the treasury of the <em>U. States </em>under this act of congress, exhibited his bill in the circuit superiour court of <em>Culpeper, </em>against <em>Walden </em>the executor of mrs. <em>Thornton </em>the widow, and the distributees, of col. <em>Thornton </em>the testator, shewing the act of congress, and stating, that the claim had been settled at the treasury, and the amount thereof paid to him; alleging that this money was, by law, assets of his testator\u2019s estate, subject, like all other assets, to debts, legacies and distribution, and that by the law of <em>Virginia, </em>the testator\u2019s widow, for whom ample provision was made by his will and who had accepted that provision, was therefore precluded from claiming any share; insisting, that the provision in the act of congress, whereby one fourth of the money, which belonged to col. <em>Thornton\u2019s </em>distributees (not being wanting for payment of debts), was taken away from them, and given to the widow who had no pretence of right to it, was null and void, and that the whole money ought, notwithstanding that provision, to be distributed among the distributees of the testator according to the statute of distributions of <em>Virginia, </em>whereby the widow was wholly excluded from any share: and praying, that the distributees and the executor of the widow might interplead and litigate among themselves, and that the court should determine, whether the fourth part of the money should be paid to the executor of the widow, or the whole should be distributed among the distributees, excluding her from any share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">The distributees, in their answers, insisted on their right to the whole of the money, which they said was a part of the testator\u2019s personal estate, being a debt due to him from' the government, which devolved by law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>them in exclusion of the testator\u2019s widow. The executor of the widow insisted, on the other hand, that, as the administrator had no means of obtaining this money ^ \u201c but by petition to congress, and an act of that body providing for the payment thereof to him, therefore, the act of congress allowing the claim was, in truth, a grant of the money to him, and that the administrator, taking under that grant, was bound to abide by the terms of it, and to pay one fourth of the money to the widow. And he stated and relied on the history of the act, and of the amendment thereof made in the senate, to which, in the progress of the bill through the senate, the administrator had given his consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">The act of congress was exhibited, and the history of the provision in favour of mrs. <em>Thornton, </em>therein contained, was proved, as it is above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\">The circuit superiour court declared, that the plaintiff received the <em>whole </em>sum allowed by the act of congress, in his representative character as administrator with the will annexed of col. <em>Thornton; </em>that the <em>entire </em>sum so received -by him was assets of his testator\u2019s estate in his bands to be administered, according to the will of the testator, and the laws of <em>Virginia; </em>and that the defendant <em>Walden, </em>the executor of the widow, had no right to any part of the money, either under the act of congress, or the testator\u2019s will, or the law of <em>Virginia: </em>and therefore the court decreed, that the whole of the money should be distributed among the distributees, in exclusion of the widow. <em>Walden </em>the executor of mrs. <em>Thornton </em>applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-10\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Abi\">The circuit superiour court erred, in not decreeing that the appellee administrator with the will annexed of col. <em>Thornton, </em>should pay to the appellant executor of mrs. <em>Thornton </em>the widow of that testator, the fourth part of the money received by him as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>administrator of his testator, by virtue of the act of congress of the 9th February 1833, with interest from the <em>time he </em>received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
