Copies of the obligations were exhibited with the bill. They were all under the hands and seals of <em>Elihu Trimble </em>and <em>James Tapseott. </em>One dated the 16th of December 1825, for 120 dollars, was payable nine months after date, to <em>Samuel Bondurant. </em>Another of the same date, for 149 dollars, was payable at the same time, to <em>Thomas Bondurant. </em>And a third, dated the 13th of December 1825, for 160 dollars, was payable on the 1st of January 1827, to <em>Darby Bondurant.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\">The bill, after describing the obligations that were given, set forth, that the same not being punctually paid, suits were brought thereupon by the assignees, and judgments obtained against the complainant for the amount of the bonds, which he had been compelled to discharge. It stated that <em>Trimble </em>had become embarrassed in his circumstances, and had removed from the state; and prayed that <em>Weaver </em>might be decreed to pay the complainant the amount which he had been compelled to pay as surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\"><em>Weaver </em>answered, that in 1825 he employed <em>Trimble </em>in the boating business, on the following terms : He furnished the boats and the loading; <em>Trimble </em>furnished the hands, and superintended the business ; and the profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>were divided. The respondent denied that <em>Trimble </em>was, in. December 1825, or at any other time, deputed to <em>Buckingham </em>to hire hands for 1826. He stated that he discharged <em>Trimble </em>from his employment in the latter part of 1825, or the beginning of 1826, and that <em>Trimble </em>afterwards continued the boating business on his own account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\">By the exhibits it appeared, that the judgments on the two first mentioned bonds were satisfied by the complainant on the 24th of July 1828; and that the judgment on the other bond was satisfied by him on the 2d of February 1829. Depositions were taken by both parties; the purport of which, so far as material, appears in the opinions of'the judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acm\">The cause was removed to the circuit court of <em>Rock-bridge, </em>and after being proceeded in as to <em>Trimble </em>by publication, came on there to be heard; when the circuit court declared, that it was satisfied a partnership existed, as charged in the bill, and that <em>Trimble </em>being nonresident and insolvent, the defendant <em>Weaver </em>was responsible to the complainant for the amount paid by him. A decree was entered in conformity with this opinion ; and upon the petition of <em>Weaver, </em>an appeal was allowed him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-6\">The <em>attorney general </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-7\"><em>Peyton </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-8\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ab\"><em>Tapscott, </em>the complainant in the court below, had a clear right to be substituted- to all the remedies of the <em>Bondurants, </em>the obligees in the bonds, and for this reason, as well as because the remedies against the partners on the original contract of hiring had been extinguished at law by <em>Trimble\u2019s </em>having given a higher security <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Donaghe\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>1 Rand. 300. <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman\u2019s ex\u2019ors, 3 </em>Leigh 548.) he is entitled to come into a court of equity. This has scarcely been ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tioned, and the only serious point raised is whether <em>Weaver </em>was liable to the <em>Bondurants, </em>who hired the slaves to <em>Trimble, </em>orto <em>Tapscolt, </em>his surety in the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">I think that a partnership in the boating business between <em>Weaver </em>and <em>Trimble </em>is clearly established by the evidence, and indeed admitted in the answer of <em>Weaver; </em>and that this partnership existed when the slaves were hired, and for some time after. The slaves were hired by <em>Trimble </em>to be employed in the boating business, and were actually so employed during a portion of the time that the partnership continued. <em>Breaver </em>says, the partnership was dissolved about the last of the year 1825, or early in 1826 ; but there are several circumstances inducing me to fix the period of dissolution as late, at least, as April 1826. According to him, by the terms of the partnership, he was to furnish the boats and loading, and <em>Trimble </em>to superintend the business and furnish the hands; whilst the profits were to be equally divided. Taking his own statement, it is enough to fix his responsibility to third persons. A participation in the profits and losses made them general partners in <em>that </em>concern, and subjected each one to all the liabilities of such general partnership, whatever may have been the stipulations and arrangements <em>inter sc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The reason why the partner taking a part of the profits is liable to creditors, is this, that he takes part of the fund on which they rely for payment. A dormant partner, to whom a vendor gives no credit, and whose responsibility constituted no part of the consideration moving him to sell, is liable to the whole extent of engagement, in matters which, according to the usual course of dealing, have reference to the business transacted by the firm. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, 3 </em>Price 538. <em>Saville </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>4 T. R. 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">There can be no doubt, that the hiring of hands to be employed in the boating business had immediate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ference to the nature of the dealings between <em>Trimble </em>and <em>Weaver.. </em>The trade in which they were engaged could not be carried on without hands, any more than without boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">It made no difference, that <em>Weaver </em>gave no express authority to <em>Trimble </em>to hire. If he had been dealing in matters without the scope of the partnership, that circumstance would have been material; but not in contracts relating to the partnership. Gow on Partnership 67.</p>\n<p id=\"AxN\">Nor was it more material, if <em>Trimble </em>hired on his own account, without expressly naming the partnership; or that <em>Tapscott </em>became his surety in ignorance of its existence. How these facts were, does not clearly appear. The probability is, that as the partnership was one of some notoriety, <em>Trimble, </em>when he went to <em>Buckingham </em>to hire hands, and asked strangers to become bis sureties, would speak of the business in which he was concerned, and refer the persons with whom he was dealing to the ultimate responsibility of the firm. But it is not necessary to establish that fact. If <em>Tapscott </em>was ignorant of <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>being a partner, it brings this case within the influence of those upon secret partnerships. Gow 176. If he knew it, but dealt with <em>Trimble </em>alone, without intending to release the partnership, it must be governed by the cases of <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Gibson &amp; Jephson, </em>1 Camp. 185. and <em>Gouthwaite </em>v. <em>Duckworth, </em>12 East 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">It is only, I think, in cases where a separate credit is clearly given to one of <em>the </em>partners, <em>to the exclusion of the rest, </em>that the latter are absolved. This^bservation will explain the cases of <em>Emly </em>v. <em>Lye, </em>15 East 7. and <em>Bevan </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>1 Simons 376. 2 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 189. cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel. In both of them, the partnership was known to the creditors, and the circumstances shew that they looked only to the individual partner with whom they dealt, and noj;- at all to the others. These cases, properly understood, do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>controvert the principle, that in purchases or bargains relating to the partnership, the act of one is considered the act of all, and that each may contract as if he were the authorized <em>agent </em>of <em>the </em>rest, and bind all by dealings within the scope and nature of their business. Gow 71. <em>Willet v. Chambers, </em>Cowp. 814. <em>Walden v. Sherburne, </em>15 Johns. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">When one deals with a partner in matters relating to the partnership business, it ought to be inferred that he deals on the credit of the partnership, unless the circumstances prove, that though apprized of the partnership, he meant to give individual credit. If would he hard to hold him bound to prove, that he knew of the partnership, and dealt on its credit. One of a firm dealing in produce goes into the country, and purchases from the farmer, without- naming his partners; or he gets another to become his surety for the purchase money. Is the vendor or surety bound to prove that he knew of the partnership, and dealt on its credit ? The presumption is in the affirmative; and to discharge the firm, it ought to appear clearly that he gave credit to the individual alone, and intended to absolve the other partners. See the observation of chief baron <em>Macdonald, </em>in <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>2 Camp. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">So far from this appearing in the case under consideration, I am persuaded that <em>Tapscott </em>never intended to become the surety of <em>Trimble </em>alone, in exclusion of his partner, and that his delay in applying to the latter proceeded only from his doubts about his legal rights, or the difficulty of procuring evidence to prove the partnership, now so clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">I am therefore for affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b453-8\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A3T\">It is sufficiently manifest, even from the answer of <em>Weaver, </em>that a partnership existed between him and <em>Trimble, </em>in the boating business, at the time when the slaves in the bill mentioned were hired by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Trimble, </em>\u00e1nd that the profits of the business were to be equally shared by the parties. It is also manifest from the testimony, that the slaves were hired for the partnership, and were applied to the uses thereof. Under these circumstances, it is perfectly clear that <em>Weaver </em>was equally liable with <em>Trimble, </em>even if <em>Tapscott, </em>at the time of the contract, were ignorant of the fact that <em>Weaver </em>was a partner. And if the fact of the partnership were known to <em>Tapscott, Weaver </em>is <em>a fortiori </em>liable; unless, indeed, it can be shewn that <em>Tapscott, </em>with this knowledge, contracted on the individual credit of <em>Trimble, </em>in exclusion of that of <em>Weaver. </em>Nothing of the kind is attempted to be proved, and it cannot be presumed without proof. <em>Weaver, </em>therefore, was clearly liable on the hiring; and the cases of <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman's ex'ors, </em>3 Leigh 548. and <em>M'Cullough et al. </em>v. <em>Sommerville, </em>not yet reported,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> shew that this obligation was not extinguished by the execution of a bond by his partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">I am therefore of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\"> This case has been since reported in 8 Leigh, p. 415.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b454-5\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AQy7\">concurred in the opinion of judge <em>Cabell.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b454-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ar5\">In this case I think it sufficiently appears, without a resort to the answer of <em>Weaver, </em>that there was a partnership in the boating business, commencing in 1825 and running into the year 1826. During that year, it was dissolved. In preparation for the business of that year, the slaves in question were hired by <em>Trimble </em>the partner of <em>Weaver. </em>It matters not, therefore, whether there was a subsequent dissolution or not. The transaction was during the partnership, and for its purposes. If it had been made in the name of the partners, and not under seal, it could not have been questioned that <em>Weaver </em>was responsible. He alleges, indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>that the partnership was a limited one; that he was to find the boats, and <em>Trimble </em>the hands. But this is not proved, and the imperfect character of <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>recollections (proceeding from the circumstance that the transactions of this concern were entrusted to his clerks and agents, or from some other cause) forbids implicit confidence in the answer. I rely rather upon the testimony of the witnesses, which goes to establish a general partnership. Yet it is perhaps of little moment how this fact may be. For even if the alleged arrangement was made between the partners, that <em>Weaver </em>should find the boats and <em>Trimble </em>the hands, yet the public had nothing to do with that arrangement, and as <em>Weaver </em>was to get half the profits, he was responsible for the hires, since that interest in the profits, <em>ipso </em>facto, constituted him a partner. In <em>Dry </em>v. Boswell, 1 Camp. 329. where, in a boating partnership, one party was to furnish boats, the other nevertheless was held responsible for the repairs, upon the general principles of partnership. So here, though <em>Trimble </em>was to furnish hands, yet <em>Weaver, </em>as a partner who was to receive one half of their profits, was responsible for their hires.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Conceiving it then to be clear, that if the hiring had been by contract not under seal, and expressly upon the credit of the firm, <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>responsibility would have been undoubted, I will next remark, that as I interpret the testimony, <em>Tapscott </em>did understand from <em>Trimble </em>that there was a partnership between himself and <em>Weaver, </em>and accordingly contracted upon the faith of <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>liability. But if I am mistaken in this construction, then the ordinary case is presented, of a contract for a firm by the ostensible partner, there being a secret partner unknown at the time, who receives the benefit of the contract. If, as it appears to me, there was a partnership throughout the year 1825, and running into the year 1826 till the boating season was over or far advanced, and these slaves were employed in boating, then they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>clearly came into the use of the concern, and contribu<em>J </em>ted in no small degree to the handsome profits admitted to have been received : and if so, upon the general principles of partnership, those who were to share the profits were bound for their hires,</p>\n<p id=\"A1qN\">If, then, <em>Weaver </em>would have been clearly responsible had these contracts been without seal, it only remains to enquire whether that will make a difference here. And I think it will not. At law, indeed, the partner who does not join in a bond is not bound by the sealing of his copartner. But equity looks into the character of the transaction. It looks not to the form of the thing, but to the substance. The seal cannot hide from its searching eye the real nature of the case, or the. consideration or intention of the contract. It respects, indeed, that intention, if fair and upright, as much as a court of law. If, therefore, it.appears that the- bond of an individual partner is taken with a view to his <em>distinct </em>responsibility, a court of equity would not thwart that intention by disregarding his individuality. But if, on the other hand, it appears, that though the contract is under seal, it is <em>for </em>the firm; if the firm is looked to on the one part, and intended to be contracted for on the other; or if the contract is for matters germane to the business of the concern, and the benefit of it goes to the copartnery ; then the partners are bound, notwithstanding the form of the transaction. The case of <em>Sale v. Dishman's ex'ors </em>was decided on these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Looking, then, to the real character of the transaction, let us see whether there is any thing from which it can be inferred that the <em>individual </em>responsibility of <em>Trimble, </em>a poor boatman, was looked to. The <em>bond </em>is the only ground of inference, and that loses all force, when we consider that it was most probably adopted in conformity with general usage in the hire of slaves, and in compliance with the notions and requisitions of the owner. On the other hand, if <em>Tapscott </em>was informed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the partnership, as he alleges, every presumption of <em>law </em>is in favour of the intention to look to the firm rather than the individual partner. \u201cIt is possible,\u201d says chief baron Macdonald, <em>(2 </em>Camp. 99.) \u201c that separate credit may be given to one of two partners individually, but the presumption of law is otherwise, and that presumption must be rebutted by very clear evidence.\u201d And this is reasonable; for why should the partner desire to bind himself and absolve the concern ? or why should the dealer with him prefer to bind him individually, when, if bound as a partner, he is personally not less bound, and there is the additional security of his partner? In this case, it is absurd to suppose that <em>Tapscott </em>took <em>Trimble's </em>individual responsibility, if he knew of <em>Weaver's </em>connexion with him; and if he did not know of it, then the execution of a sealed instrument could not have been with a view to indicate his individual responsibility, in contradistinction to that of the concern. In every view of the case, then, I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">I have said nothing of the cases from East and from Simons, because they have been already commented on by one of my brethren. I do not think they can have any influence upon this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Brookk, J. concurred in opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
