The executor not having chosen to do so, he is to be considered as a borrower, and annually charged with <em>interest; </em>and such interest, and not the principal, is to be applied to the disbursements.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b508-9\">Although a decree gives interest on a sum which, according to the mode of stating the account, is itself interest, yet if it be manifest that a settlement upon proper principles would have made the balance larger, and that such balance would have been principal, the decree will not be reversed at the instance of the debtor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b508-10\">The proper mode of stating an executor\u2019s account after a reasonable time has been allowed for payment of debts, laid down in the opinion of the court delivered by the president.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b508-11\">Where the decree for a sum due by an executor to legatees is in favour of all the legatees jointly for the whole sum, instead of being in favour of each legatee severally for his proper part, the error is not one by which the executor is aggrieved, and he has no right to have the decree reversed therefor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b508-12\">The former decisions, that a decree in favour of a legatee against an executor, which omitted to require a refunding bond, would be considered erroneous, and for such error would be reversed with costs, reviewed by the court, and a different rule now established.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b508-13\">Where it is apparent that such omission was not intentional, but resulted entirely from inadvertence, an appellate court, if the decree be right in other respects, will affirm -it so far as if has gone, with costs to the appellee as the party substantially prevailing, and will then proceed to make such further decree in relation to a refunding bond, as the court below ought to have made.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-14\"><em>Robert Snodgrass </em>made his will on the 3d of September 1806, whereby he desired all his just debts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>be paid by his executors, for which purpose he subjected his estate in the first instance. Then he disposed of the residue as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-4\">\u201cI desire and do hereby authorize my executors to rent out my real estate and hire out my negroes, except the old woman <em>Magg, </em>who I wish to be hired by my executors, and in case she should be rendered incapable of work, as much of the money arising from her hire to be applied to her support; and all the rest of my personal estate, and the money (as much as is necessary) arising from said rent, hire and sale, to be applied to the maintenance and schooling of my children, and the balance, if any, to be put out to interest. I also desire, when my youngest child comes of age, that my land be sold in the way my executors think most to the interest of my children. 1 also will that as my children come of age or marry, that they receive an equal share of my personal estate; and as the education and maintenance of my youngest children will be more than the older ones, my will further is, that my executors pay, out of the rent of my land, such expenses as the guardian shall think necessary for that purpose. I also will that the balance of the rent of the land, if any, and the money arising from the sale of said land, be equally divided between my sons <em>Tilghman </em>and <em>William Adams, </em>and my daughters <em>Sabra, Elizabeth, Jenny </em>and <em>Miranda, </em>when my youngest child comes of age. And I do request my friend and neighbour <em>Edward Mitchell </em>to take the guardianship of all my above named children, and to put out my said children to such places as he thinks best, and to superintend the education of my said children, and bind out my sons to trades when they come to proper age for that purpose.

At the same time an order was made appointing \u00e1ppraisers of the personal <em>. </em>under which an appraisement was made in the same moni-h. It amounted to 4101 dollars 81 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\"><em>Joseph Snodgrass, </em>the executor, died in the summer or fall of 1809, having made a will, which was duly recorded, whereby he appointed <em>Alexander Handly </em>and <em>John Walker </em>his executors. <em>Handly </em>alone qualified; and thenceforth he acted as the executor of <em>Robert Snodgrass.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7yE\">Under an order of the court of probate, made at October term 1809, the accounts of <em>Joseph Snodgrass </em>as executor of <em>Robert </em>were stated by commissioners appointed for the purpose; and according to this settlement, which was returned to court and ordered to be recorded at August term 1810, there was a balance due from the executor on the 25th of November 1809, of 3066 dollars 78 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">Under an order made at February term 1823, a commissioner in chancery reported, that after giving notice to the parties, he had examined the accounts, and found the balance due from <em>Joseph Snodgrass </em>as executor, on the same 25th of November 1809, to be 2775 dollars 97 cents. He also took an account of <em>Handly\u2019s </em>transactions as executor of <em>Robert Snodgrass, </em>shewing how much he had received and paid, to November 1822, without making any annual rests. <em>Handly </em>having rendered an account of interest received by him for money loaned out, the commissioner debited him with the amount so received, but made no charge against him of-interest upon the yearly balances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">The same commissioner made another settlement, under an order made at February term 1826, in which \u25a0he charged <em>Handly </em>with farther sums received by him, gave him credit for farther payments and for commissions upon his receipts, ascertained the balance due from him, and stated the portions to which the different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>legatees were entitled of the balance thus ascertained. o This settlement was returned and ordered to be recorded at November term 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">In 1834, a bill was filed in the circuit court of <em>Botetourt </em>by <em>Tilghman Snodgrass, William A. Snodgrass </em>and <em>Miranda Snodgrass, </em>to surcharge and falsify the accounts settled in 1823 and 1826. It stated, that <em>Sabra </em>and <em>Elizabeth, </em>two of the daughters mentioned in the will of <em>Robert Snodgrass, </em>had died intestate and without issue, and that <em>Jenny, </em>another daughter, by her will gave the whole of her interest in the estate to the complainant <em>Miranda </em>for life, remainder to <em>Robert S., Henry W. </em>and <em>William N. Snodgrass, </em>infant children of <em>Tilghman Snodgrass. </em>The bill, besides detailing objections to numerous items in the accounts, particularly insisted that the executor ought to be charged with interest on the balances in his hands, annualfy, and that his disbursements ought tobe defrayed out of the interest on the balances. It alleged that there were no demands against the estate, to prevent him from putting out those balances at interest; that loans were in fact made by him, and that borrowers were required to pay usurious interest. <em>Handly </em>and the infant children of <em>Tilghman Snodgrass </em>were made defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\"><em>Handly, </em>by his answer, strongly objected to the settlements of 1823 and 1826 being disturbed after such a lapse of time, and relied upon the circumstance that the last settlement was made on the motion of the guardian of the complainant <em>Miranda, </em>and at the instance of the other plaintiffs in this suit. He stated, that when that settlement was returned to court and ordered to be recorded, all the complainants were upwards of twenty-one years of age, and some of them, as he believes, near thirty years old. And he charged that all of them were personally present, and that they were satisfied with and acquiesced in the settlement. They received from him the amounts coming to each accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ing to the settlement, and executed to him refunding-bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmLE\">The infant defendants answered by a guardian <em>ad litem.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">An order was made by the circuit court, directing <em>Handhj </em>to settle his accounts before a commissioner of the court. Under this order, the commissioner stated an account, making annual rests on the 25th of November in each year. He charged the executor with the sums annually received by him for rents and hires, and gave him credit each year for commissions and disbursements, which were thus paid out of the receipts in that year. By stating the account in this way, and putting the disbursements against the principal, it appeared that on the 25th of November 1827, the day to which the settlement extended, the whole principal was exhausted; but there was a balance of interest due the estate, amounting to 1733 dollars 42 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">Both parties excepted to the commissioner\u2019s report, and the circuit court overruled the exceptions of both. Whereupon the court,\u2014being of opinion that, under the circumstances of the case, the transactions should be considered as having closed on the 25th of November 1827, at which time the executor should have paid over to those entitled the amount in his hands ; that the parties, from that period,' stood towards each other in the relation of debtor and creditor, and the amount in the executor\u2019s hands should be considered as principal, upon which he should pay interest,\u2014adjudged, ordered and decreed that the defendant <em>Handhj </em>pay to the plaintiffs the said sum of 1733 dollars 42 cents, with interest from the said 25th of November 1827, and their <em>costs </em>of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\">From this decree an appeal was allowed, on a petition of Handly, repeating the ground taken in his answer as to the effect of the former settlements, and assigning the following additional errors :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>1. That the circuit court had, by its decree, given <em>1' \u00b0 </em>interest upon the sum of 1733 dollars 42 cents from the 25th of November 1827 until paid, whereas the report of the commissioner shewed this balance to be composed entirely of interest, and the allowance of interest upon it was giving to the plaintiffs compound interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">2. That the court had given a joint decree in favour of the plaintiffs, instead of ascertaining and determining how much the plaintiff <em>Miranda </em>was entitled to receive in her own absolute right, and how much she was to hold and enjoy during her life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">3. That the plaintiffs were not required to give refunding bonds.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-8\"><em>Broclcenbrough </em>and <em>Edward Johnson </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-9\"><em>J.

Anderson </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">The 1st point relied upon by the appellant in this case is, that the appellees having unreasonably delayed for eight years to institute this suit to surcharge and falsify the account of .1826, their bill should have been dismissed without farther enquiry. I cannot think so. One of the complainants was a female and under age when that account was in progress, though probably of full age when the report was returned and confirmed ; and though the other complainants were of full age, the gross errors in the account of 1S26 must satisfy every mind, that an equally gross ignorance alone could have prevented their taking measures for its correction. Moreover, the statute of 1826 having now established a limitation of ten years for suits of this description, we cannot, in a case like this, however inclined to frown upon stale demands, reject a party whose suit has been commenced within that period. Now here, the foundation of this suit being to surcharge and falsify the account of 1826, the limitation must be taken from that date ; or at most from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1825, the maturity of the youngest child, before whose attainment of full age no account could be demanded according to the provisions of the will. I do not think, therefore, that this objection is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"A_u\">2. As to the charge of interest upon interest from 1827. If, this charge were wrong, still it .is obvious that had the account been properly settled, the balance against the executor would exceed the sum now reported to be due. <em>Carter's ex'ors </em>v. <em>Cutting and </em>wife, 5 Munf. 238. <em>Burnley's adm'or </em>v. <em>Duke &amp;c. </em>1 Rand. 108. For by the will the estate was directed to be put out at interest, and according to the decision in <em>Garrett &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Carr &amp;c. </em>if the executor did not choose to do so, he is to be considered as a borrower, and should be annually charged with interest, and the <em>interest </em>and not the principal should be applied to the disbursements. A settlement upon this prinhiple, even without holding him to strict account for his large profits made by usury, would have made the balance much larger; and moreover, that balance would have been <em>principal, </em>as the interest and not the principal would have been absorbed by the disbursements. Moreover, the transactions of the estate were closed in 1827, at latest. They should have been considered as closed soon after the testator\u2019s death. According to the case of <em>Garrett &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Carr &amp;c. </em>the balance should have been struck after a reasonable time allowed for payment of the debts. The balance should then have been charged against him as a borrower; and from that time until the distribution, the account should have been adjusted as an account between ordinary debtor and creditor. When the time of distribution arrived, the amount appearing due should have been apportioned at once among the distributees, and the portion of each carried to the separate account of each individually. It would then of course have been due, and being, as to them, a principal sum due, it would carry interest. The result is precisely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>same as the case now stands ; and there is no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">3. The next point I shall consider is the objection to the joint character of the decree. This is doubtless irregular, but it is no concern of the appellant; since the complainants having made themselves his joint creditors by taking a joint decree, he can safely pay to all or any, and the receipt of any one will be good against all. He can then suffer no injury; and if so, he was entitled to no appeal, since the statute gives the appeal only to those who are <em>aggrieved </em>by the decree. And such has always been the course of this court. The plaintiff in error must shew an error <em>to his prejudice, </em>or he will not be entitled to a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">4. The remaining error assigned is the omission to require a refunding bond. I am free to confess, that in many former decisions of this court, this omission has <em>bee a </em>considered as a substantive error, for which decrees have been reversed with costs. The hardship of this case, however, with the conviction of the utter uselessness of such a bond, where thirty years have elapsed from the testator\u2019s death, and where his debts <em>seem not </em>to ha.ve amounted to 100 dollars at his decease, had pressed upon my mind the consideration of the propriety of conforming our practice in relation to this matter, to the recent decisions of the court in analogous cases, rather than to the former adjudications. It seems to me, that it is an abuse of justice to reverse the decree of an inferior court, not for an error in the actual judgment of the court, but for a mere omission or oversight, which in many cases the losing party stands by and witnesses without objection, that it may be used to his advantage in a superior tribunal. It is obvious that the failure in those cases to require bond is always an oversight. It is never intentional. If a court were to <em>refuse </em>to require it, there would be good ground of complaint. But where it is but an omission, and where all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the principles and details of a decree are in favour of the appellee, ought the court nevertheless to reverse the decree ? or ought it not rather to affirm it, taking care to correct it in the matter in which it is defective ? In favour of the latter course of proceeding, there are numerous precedents of the affirmance of decrees in which there were important omissions or defects to the prejudice of the appellant, where it was apparent that'tbey resulted not from the judgment of the court, but from inadvertence. Of some of these cases I will take notice. In some, there was a reversal with costs to the <em>appellee; </em>in others, there was an affirmance, with a correction of the error merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Of the first description is the case of <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>4 Rand. 478. That was an injunction by a vendee against his vendor, on the ground that a title could not be had. The injunction was dissolved, and a conveyance ordered. The vendee appealed. This court was of opinion that the order was defective, in not annexing it as a <em>condition </em>of the dissolution, that the conveyance should be made. Yet it gave the appellee his costs, though it might seem that the appellant had good cause of appeal. The same principle was followed in <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Patteson, </em>3 Rand. 66. where the court erred in not conventing the necessary parties. In that case, judge <em>Cabell, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, makes this very appropriate remark: \u201c Had the appellant, at the hearing of the cause, brought to the view of the inferior court the defects in the bill and in the order of publication, they would doubtless have been there amended or supplied. Not having done so, he shall not lie by and take advantage of them in the appellate court, to throw on the opposite party the costs of an appeal which the law never intended to allow for the correction of such defects.\u201d These are wise and just sentiments; and from the influence of them, courts have sometimes said that counsel shall not be permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tod to raise in the appellate court, for the first time, a . . . 1*1 it *ii point which, if made m the court oelow, might have been obviated. 18 Johns, Rep. 559. We follow this principle frequently, in rejecting objections to accounts where there has been no exception, and in other cases. <em>Brockenbrough &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Blythe\u2019s ex\u2019ors &amp; al. </em>3 Leigh 619. And though it is not followed in all cases, yet I am of opinion that in cases of this description the principle is peculiarly appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">I proceed to notice some cases, where, for errors against the appellant, the court has not reversed the decree, but has simply corrected the error. Such are the cases where the appellant\u2019s bill has been dismissed absolutely, when it should have been dismissed without prejudice. In these cases, although the appellant is aggrieved by a decree concluding his rights forever, yet the error is merely <em>corrected, </em>and the decree affirmed. Of this we have many examples. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Pilcher\u2019s devisees, 6 </em>Munf. 425. <em>Stott &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Baskerville &amp;c. </em>Id. 20. <em>Rootes </em>v. <em>Holliday &amp;c. Id. 251. Ellis </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>Id. 456. So too in <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>Bradford &amp; al. </em>1 Leigh 163. 172. on an appeal by the purchaser of a trust subject, he was held liable. The court of chancery, however, directed an account of <em>profits </em>of a part of the slaves he had purchased and afterwards sold, with a view to charge him with those profits, instead of interest, for which alone he was liable. Here was an error by which he would have been aggrieved. Yet the decree was affirmed with costs to the appellee, and <em>corrected </em>instead of being reversed. So in <em>Lewis &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Billips &amp;c. </em>1 Leigh 366. though a decree was rendered against the holders of the legal title for a conveyance, without taking an account of the expenses of procuring it, and making the payment of them a condition precedent to the conveyance, yet there was no reversal, but an affirmance with costs, and the decree corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"AIb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Such, in my opinion, should be the course in this case. This court is not bound to follow a practice which' is found pregnant with mischief. The practice of the courts should not, indeed, be lightly changed; but it is not like the rules of property, which can only be changed by legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion to affirm the decree with costs ; correcting the error, as was done in <em>Heffner </em>v. <em>Miller &amp; others, </em>2 Munf. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The other judges concurred. Decree affirmed with costs, and omission to require a refunding bond corrected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
