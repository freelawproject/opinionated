He then pleaded not guilty, and the jury impannelled to try the issue, found him guilty as alleged in the <em>second </em>count, and not guilty as alleged in the <em>first </em>count. Whereupon the defendant moved the court to enter judgment in his favour; but the court overruled the motion, and gave judgment for the commonwealth for a fine of 20 dollars and the costs of the prosecution. On the trial the defendant filed a bill of exceptions in these words\u2014\u201c Memorandum : After the court had instructed the jury, \u2018that if they shall be of opinion, from the evidence, that the defendant played cards at the house of <em>John Nicely, </em>as in the indictment is alleged, and that the house of said <em>Nicely </em>was one at'which persons, who called therefor, were furnished with either meat or liquor, for which a charge was made, whether he had obtained a license or not, then the said house is, within contemplation of law, a house of entertainment, or tavern, and they ought to find a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>verdict of guilty\u2019\u2014the defendant asked for the follow-0 <em>\u2022* </em>ing instruction, viz. That before they can find the defendant guilty under the second count in the indictment, it must appear from the evidence, that the house of <em>John Nicely </em>was a house of entertainment licensed by law, or that it was a place of public resort, at the time of the playing alleged in the said second count of the indictment. Which instruction the court refused to give ; to which opinion the defendant excepts,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-5\"><em>Robert C.

The defendant was acquitted under the first count of the indictment, and no offence against the penal laws of the commonwealth is charged in the second count.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-6\">It is admitted that an indictment under the act to prevent unlawful gaming, which charges the gaming to have taken place (in the words of the fifth section) at \u201c an ordinary, racefield, or other public place,\u201d or at a <em>tavern </em>(which is, <em>ex vi termini, </em>both an ordinary and a public place) or at a house of public resort, whether licensed or not, is good. <em>Hord </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Leigh 674. <em>Wortham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Rand. 675. But here the words of the indictment are, \u201c at the house of <em>John Nicely, </em>the same being then and there a <em>house of entertainment.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-7\">. 1. A house of entertainment is not <em>ex vi termini </em>an ordinary, tavern, a house of public resort, or a public place. A house may be a house of entertainment, and yet neither of these. It is true that \u201c house of entertainment\u201d is a general term which may comprehend them all, but it does not necessarily import any one of them; and it is not sufficient that the terms used in the indictment should comprehend the forbidden place, along with other places not forbidden. The defendant has a right to require that the charge which he is called upon to answer should be distinctly made; and as the place is of the very essence of the charge, the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>used should designate a forbidden place, and a forbidden place only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-8\">2. A house of entertainment merely, is not \u201ca tavern\u201d within the 16th section of the act, upon the true construction of that section ; and therefore the reasoning of the general court in the case of <em>Wortham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-9\">The obvious intent and meaning of that section is, to embrace within the provisions of the act all houses of public resort, whether licensed or not, so as to subject the keepers of such houses, as well as those who play there, to the penalties of the act. The whole context and policy of the act sustains this construction. It is an act to suppress <em>public </em>gaming; or (in the words of the preamble to the 5th section) \u201c to prevent gaming at ordinaries and other public places.\u201d The 16th section does, indeed, use the terms \u201c every house of entertainment ;\u201d not absolutely, however, but in connexion with other words which explain and modify their meaning, and shew what sort of house of entertainment the legislature contemplated. It is as if the section read, \u201c every house of entertainment <em>and </em>public resort,\u201d or, \u201cthat is a house of public resort,\u201d or, \u201c being a house of public resort.\u201d It is impossible to suppose that the legislature meant to include under this section any and every house of entertainment, of every description and for any purpose. A. has a house at which B. and C. with their families board by the month, or by the year. They are not members of A.\u2019s family, and therefore A.\u2019s house is, for them, a house of entertainment; but it will scarcely be contended, that such a house is a tavern, within the 16th section of the gaming act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-10\">II. There is nothing on the face of the record, on which judgment can be rendered against the petitioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-11\">The jury find him guilty of gaming at \u201c a house of entertainment.\u201d Now, a house of entertainment is a place of public resort, or it is not. If it is not a place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>of public resort, then, neither <em>ex vi termini </em>nor by operation of law, neither within the 5th nor the 16th section of the act, is it a forbidden place ; and the court cannot pronounce judgment on such a finding, any more than if the jury had found the defendant guilty of playing at the private house of A. or B. And if it be a place of public resort, then he is entitled to an acquittal, under the express finding of the jury, that he was not guilty of playing at a place of public resort. The whole verdict of the jury must be taken together; and, so considered, that verdict is merely nugatory, or it ascertains beyond all question, that whatever a house of entertainment maybe, it is <em>not </em>a place of public resort.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b635-4\">Lomax, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Axh\">delivered the opinion of the court.\u2014The court is of opinion, that the authority of <em>Wortham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>is decisive in sustaining the second count in the indictment in the present case. The case referred to has decided (in conformity to the 16th section of the gaming law) that a house of public resort, whether licensed or not, is a tavern, and consequently is a public place within the terms of the 5th section ; and that it is sufficient that the indictment should, in the terms of the 16th section, charge the gaming to have been committed in a house of public resort, and such charge is as correct as if laid in the words of the 5th section.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In the case now under consideration, the indictment charges (in like manner in the words used by the legislature in the 16th section) that the gaming was perpetrated in \u201c a house of entertainment;\u201d and it would seem necessarily to be brought, by the legislative definition of a tavern, which is considered a public place, within .the scope of the 5th section, as was the case in <em>Wortham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Whatever complaint may be made of the vagueness of the expression <em>\u201c </em>every house of entertainment,\u201d and the extent to which that expression may be carried, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>was fully competent to the legislative authority to adopt those terms in the widest construction ; and if such appeared to be the design of the legislature, the courts would be bound to conform to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">There is no occasion, however, for the apprehension that the words \u201ca house of entertainment\u201d can be liable to any dangerous or inconvenient latitude of construction. \u201cA house of private entertainment\u201d is an expression frequently used in the acts of assembly, and though \u2022the word <em>private </em>is used, yet for many purposes such houses are regarded as <em>public. </em>The meaning which the legislature attaches to these terms of description seems not liable to misconstruction. Nor does the expression seem more liable to misconstruction when the word <em>private </em>is dropped, and the house of entertainment is declared to be a tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It is objected in this case, that the defendant having been acquitted upon the first count in the indictment, which charged the gaming to have been committed \u201c at the house of <em>John Nicely, </em>the same being then and there a place of public resort,\u201d it is apparent that the house of entertainment where the defendant, under the second count, was convicted of playing, could not have been a public place. This objection assumes, that all the of-fences charged in the indictment must necessarily have been the same, and that no evidence was offered but of one and the same offence. This, the court thinks, is contrary to the intendment of the law, by which each offence in each count of the indictment is to be regarded as a separate, distinct offence, at least until it be shewn that there was only one offence. There is nothing in this record to shew that that was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The court is of opinion that there is no error in the proceedings, and therefore refuses the writ of error prayed for.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
