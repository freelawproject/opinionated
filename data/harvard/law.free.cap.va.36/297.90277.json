That he thereupon called upon <em>Chevis, </em>and, as attorney for the plaintiff, required him to return the execution: which was accordingly returned in June 1828. That as soon thereafter as he could meet with <em>Chevis </em>(which he could not do for some time) he, as attorney, made a formal demand of the money from <em>Chevis, </em>which he failed to pay. Whereupon a notice was immediately prepared; but the indisposition of the judge caused a failure of the court for several terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-3\">The counsel by whom this proof was made, was not the attorney who prosecuted the original suit, wherein the judgment was obtained on which the execution issued against <em>Jett </em>and others. The attorney in that suit <em>w&amp;s-Thomas Smith, </em>one of the defendants in the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\">The said counsel also proved, that at the time he first called on <em>Chevis </em>as attorney, and at the time he made the demand, he had no formal written authority to act, and presented none ; but that he was at that time regularly qualified, and regularly practising, as an attorney in the court of <em>King George </em>county, and acted on the authority conferred on him by the plaintiff, as his counsel or attorney. That since he was first spoken to by the plaintiff, he had received various letters from him, on the subject of his claim, and in relation to the steps to be taken; which steps he had since taken. He further proved, that at the lime when he first called on <em>Chevis </em>as attorney, <em>Chevis </em>admitted that the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>had been satisfied, and mentioned that his sureties meant to contend that they were not liable for the debt, on the groun(j that he had collected the money as agent of the plaintiff; but that no such defence could be made, because he had received the money as sheriff and not by virtue of any agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">The plaintiff also proved, that <em>Austin Smith, </em>one of the obligors in the sheriff\u2019s official bond, died before the notice in this case was given. It appeared, how-' ever, that administration had been granted on the estate of <em>Smith, </em>and that the administrator was living in the county of <em>King George.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aro\">To sustain the defence, the sureties offered evidence to prove that mrs. <em>Chapman, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, owned a tract of land in <em>King George </em>county, and that before it was sold, <em>Chevis </em>rented it out, and received the rents : that the land was sold to <em>William S. Jett, </em>and the two deeds prepared on the occasion were drawn at the request of <em>Chevis; </em>one being a deed from mrs. <em>Chapman, </em>conveying the land t\u00f3 <em>Jett, </em>which was to be sent to her to execute; the other, a deed of trust from <em>Jett </em>to <em>Chevis, </em>to secure the purchase money. By the deed of trust, which was produced, it appeared that the debt thereby secured was for 800 dollars, and was due by two bonds for 400 dollars each, one payable the 1st of April 1824, and the other the 1st of April 1825. The bond payable in 1824 was produced, and appeared to be in the handwriting of <em>Chevis. Judgment </em>had been obtained on it, and execution having issued, a forthcoming bond was <em>taken; </em>and on that forthcoming bond the judgment'was obtained, on which the execution issued that was mentioned in the notice. The deed of trust bore date the 15th of April 1823, and the witness who drew it, thought it was written on that day. He was sure the deeds were written about that time. He did not recollect distinctly what passed between <em>Jett </em>and <em>Chevis </em>during the negotiation, but his impression was, that some difficulty arose between them as to the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>of payment, which made it necessary that letters should \u2022 __ - <em>9 </em>* i # pass between <em>Chevis </em>and mrs. <em>Chapman, </em>who resided m the county of <em>Elizabeth City. </em>Subsequent to the sale, the witness saw the bonds for the purchase money in the possession of <em>Chevis. </em>He did not recollect the precise time, but remembered seeing them in the possession of <em>Chevis </em>after he qualified as sheriff. It appeared that <em>Chevis </em>qualified in the first instance as sheriff in May 1824, and that the suit on the bond payable in 1824 was commenced in July of that year. The witness further testified that he once had a conversation with the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff stated, that he had often pressed <em>Chevis </em>for money, and could not get any; that he told <em>Chevis </em>he did not wish mr. <em>Jett </em>sued, but wished him to get the money as soon as he could, and transmit it to him, his mother having left some debts which he wished to pay. The plaintiff also told the witness, that he had been deceived in <em>Chevis; </em>that he had thought, if there was an honest man in the world, he was one. This remark was made in a conversation in which the plaintiff was complaining that <em>Chevis </em>had pressed <em>Jett </em>for the money, and had made use of it himself. He complained that <em>Chevis </em>had sued <em>Jett </em>contrary to his wishes. Yet, though he would not have wished <em>Jett </em>sued, he did not say that <em>Chevis </em>had no right to bring the suit. The witness being asked if he knew whether <em>Chevis </em>had levied the execution against <em>Jett, </em>stated, that he did not know any thing about it, but that <em>Chevis </em>had stated to him that he had levied it on negroes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">Another witness testified, that in 1825, he went from <em>Norfolk </em>to <em>Richmond </em>in the steamboat <em>Richmond, </em>the captain of which was a gentleman named <em>Chapman; </em>who, learning that the witness was from <em>King George, </em>told him that he had relations in that county, and asked the witness about <em>Chevis. </em>He stated that he had put some claims arising out of the sale of his mother\u2019s land to <em>Jett, </em>in the hands of <em>Chevis </em>to collect, and enquired whether he was good; to which the witness an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>swered, he believed he was. The plaintiff in this case is the same gentleman who was captain of the steamboat. In the winter of 1826-7, the witness being in <em>Richmond, </em>was called on by him, and he again made enquiries as to the solvency of <em>Chevis. </em>The witness, not having confidence at that time in <em>Chevis, </em>rather evaded the question. The plaintiff stated that he had been disappointed in <em>Chevis. </em>In the winter of 1827-8, the plaintiff again expressed to the witness uneasiness about his claim, and stated that <em>Chevis </em>had written to him, promising to meet him in <em>Richmond, </em>and pay him the money, but had failed to do so. The plaintiff did not, in any of these conversations, intimate that a suit had been brought against <em>Jett. </em>No impression was made on the mind of the witness of a suit having been brought. And the witness expressed his belief, that the plaintiff did not know, at the time, that there had been a suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">After the sureties had closed their evidence, the plaintiff, in farther support of his motion, introduced a receipt in these words : \u201c $230.

The plaintiff excepted to the opinion, and appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-10\">The cause was argued by <em>Harrison </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Robinson </em>for the sureties.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-11\">I. <em>Harrison </em>relied upon <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Crummey and </em>others, <em>2 </em>Rand. 323. as establishing the binding effect of the sheriff\u2019s return upon his sureties. They could only be exonerated by shewing that the return was false, and was procured by a fraud in which the creditor participated. Nothing of the sort was here pretended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>II. He relied upon <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Stokes and Betts, </em>4 Munf. 455. as establishing, that notwithstanding the 54th seetion of the execution law, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. p. 544. judgment may be entered against the sheriff for the nonpayment of money mentioned in an execution, where a demand has been made by an attorney at law. If, upon demand being made, the sheriff fail to require a written order, he is considered as waiving it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">III. He said, that if this were a proceeding by action, and one obligor were dead, the action would be properly brought against the surviving obligors. Such being the regular common law mode of proceeding, the statute giving a motion ought not to be construed as requiring the motion to be proceeded in differently.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\"><em>Robinson </em>replied, that he should endeavour to sustain the judgment without repudiating the case of <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Crummey and others. </em>In the statement on the back of the execution, he said, interest is calculated to the 11th August 1826. If that was the time of receiving the money, it was not only after the return day of the execution, but after the year had expired for which these sureties were bound. To get over this difficulty, the plaintiff had introduced original <em>receipts; </em>but they did not help the case; for one was dated before the date of the execution, and the other after the return day. Take these dates as correct, and neither payment could have been valid as a payment to the sheriff <em>virtute officii. </em>To the last payment, the case of <em>Chapman v. Harrison, </em>4 Rand. 336. is strictly applicable. According to that case, if <em>Chevis </em>had no other authority to receive from <em>Jett </em>the 200 dollars paid on the 9th of December 1825, than his authority as sheriff, <em>Jett </em>might be compelled to pay the money a second time. Now, suppose there had been no return on the execution, and the plaintiff had sued out another, and endeavoured to make <em>Jett </em>pay the 200 dollars again j could the plaintiff have succeeded in this ? Unquestionably not: because <em>Chevis </em>had au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>thority to receive the money independently of his au- ** thority as sheriff If the debtor, paying after the return day, would be discharged on the ground that the payment was not to the sheriff as such, but as agent of the plaintiff, how can the sureties be made responsible ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-5\">They are not responsible for his agency. But again, suppose the money was paid to <em>Chevis </em>as sheriff; it is certainly competent to the sureties to prove that the sheriff has paid the debt, and that <em>Chevis </em>owes it in his individual character. If another had been the agent of <em>Chapman, </em>they might have proved payment by the sheriff to that agent. The sureties ought not to be in a worse condition, because the sheriff and agent are the same person. The money received by him as sheriff should be considered as paid to himself as agent. In <em>Cook &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>6 Barn. &amp; Cress. 739. 13 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 305. the bailiff had levied as such, but the surplus beyond the amount of the executions was held to be received by him as agent and not as bailiff. In <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>7 Cow. 739. the money was considered to have been received by the sheriff not as such, but as agent. The 54th section of the execution law requires, in such a case as this, that the creditor shall name some person in the county, to be his agent for the purpose of receiving the money on the execution. It is impossible to doubt that <em>Chevis </em>was the agent named, and that he had complete control over the money. If he was not the agent, there was none. It is only by supposing him the agent having authority to receive the money, that we can account for the plaintiff\u2019s lying by from 1825 to 1830. The case is one in which the plaintiff trusted <em>Chevis </em>individually. <em>Chevis </em>has committed a breach of trust; and the plaintiff wishes to visit the consequences of his own confidence, upon others, who are not in fault.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-7\">II. The case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Stokes and Betts </em>goes to shew that the name of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney endorsed on the execution is a written order within the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of the statute. That argument will not avail here. For the attorney who made the demand is not the attorney whose name was endorsed on the execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A04\">III. In <em>Royster &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Leake, 2 </em>Munf. 280. there was first a judgment against the deputy, and afterwards a separate judgment against the sureties. This was objected to, but sustained. Since then, the statute has been altered by the introduction of the words \u201cor the securities of either of them, or their legal representatives, jointly.\u201d The statute may have been altered to prevent defendants being burthened with the costs of separate motions. But it matters not why the alteration was made. We are not now trying a common law action, but a motion. Whence does the plaintiff get his authority to make the motion? From the statute, and from the statute alone. The statute makes it lawful, on a motion, to give judgment against the parties or their representatives <em>jointly. </em>It does not make it lawful to give a judgment against the surviving obligors separately. It follows that the judgment asked in this case upon motion, was not authorized by law, and that the motion ought to have been overruled.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\"> This section provides, that <em>\u201cif </em>any sheriff, undersheriff, or other officer shall make return upon any writ of <em>fieri facias </em>or <em>venditioni </em>exponas, that he hath levied the debt, damages or costs, as in such writ is required, or any part thereof, and shall not immediately pay the same to the party to whom the same is payable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>or his attorney,\u201d\u2014\u201c it shall and may be lawful for the creditor at whose suit such writ of <em>fi\u00e9ri facias </em>or <em>venditioni exponas </em>shall issue, upon a motion made in the next succeeding general court, or other court from whence such writ shall issue, to demand judgment against such sheriff, undersheriff or other officer, or the securities of either of them, or their legal representatives, jointly, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the money or tobacco mentioned in such writ, or so much as shall be returned levied on such writs of <em>feri facias </em>or <em>venditioni ex-ponas, </em>with interest thereon at the rate of fifteen <em>per centum per annum, </em>from the return day of the execution until the judgment shall he discharged; and such court is hereby authorized and required to give judgment accordingly, and to award execution thereon: <em>provided, </em>such sheriff or officer have ten days previous notice of such motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b330-5\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AtG\">I am of opinion that there is not sufficient proof of <em>Chevis,s </em>agency for <em>Chapman, </em>to absolve the sureties of <em>Chevis </em>from responsibility for his omission to pay over the amount of the execution made by him, to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. <em>I am </em>farther of opinion that as no objection was made by <em>Chevis </em>to the attorney\u2019s authority to collect the demand, this d\u00e9fence cannot now be made by himself or his sureties. Notwithstanding the provisions of the statute, the demand of the attorney <em>upon record, </em>has been decided to be sufficient to fix the sheriff (4 Munf. 4-55.); and it is equally clear to my mind, that if the sheriff acknowledges the authority of any other attorney, or, by his silence and his conduct, may be fairly presumed to have admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>It, it is too late to make the objection when a motion is <em>t m </em>made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">I am also of opinion that upon a fair construction of the statute, although the creditor <em>may </em>move against the sheriff and the surviving sureties, and the representatives of the deceased sureties, <em>jointly, </em>yet as the obligation is several as well as joint, the creditor has a right to a several as well as joint remedy. Next, it would seem from the case of <em>Leftwich </em>v. <em>Berkeley, 1 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 61. and other cases in this court, that though the obligee in a joint and several bond cannot proceed against more than one obligor unless he proceeds against all, yet if one be dead, he may proceed jointly against all the survivors. It was, therefore, regular in this case to proceed against all who were living, unless the act imperatively <em>requires </em>the joining of the representatives of the deceased. This at common law could not have been done, and it is not by this act commanded to be done, but only declared to be <em>lawful. </em>I am <em>therefore of </em>opinion to reverse the judgment, and enter it against the sureties as well as the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The other judges concurred. Judgment of circuit court reversed, and judgment entered against all the defendants in the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
