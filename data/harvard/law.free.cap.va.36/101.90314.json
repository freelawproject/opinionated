But upon the trial, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff upon the issue joined on the first plea (that of <em>performance) </em>only, without noticing the issue on the second plea: they assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages to 650 dollars. The defendant moved for a new trial; which motion the court overruled; and then gave the plaintiff a judgment for the damages assessed by the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-9\">The court, at the instance of the defendant, certified <em>the facts proved </em>at the trial; which were, in substance, as follows\u20141. The covenant was produced ; it was set out in <em>hcec verla </em>in the record, and corresponded with the statement of it in the declaration. 2. It was proved, that <em>John Guthrie, </em>the plaintiff, in the year 1797, being then in possession of the land under his purchase thereof from <em>Thompson, </em>offered to sell the same to <em>John Guthrie junior, </em>who, in consequence of that proposal, mentioned the subject to <em>Thompson; </em>upon which <em>Thompson </em>told him to have nothing to do with it, if he wished to avoid difficulty; that he <em>Thompson </em>would not make a title. 3; That in September 1817, <em>James Guthrie, </em>son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>of the plaintiff <em>John Guthrie, </em>made a tender to <em>Thompson </em>of 178 dollars 50 cents, being the full balance with interest then due to him on account of the purchase money of the land, which <em>Thompson </em>refused to receive, and he also refused to make a title to the land ; whereupon an arbitration of the difference was agreed upon, but <em>Thompson </em>afterwards declined to proceed, in the arbitration. 4. That in 1805, a suit was brought by <em>Peter Beverley </em>against the plaintiff' <em>John Guthrie, </em>for the land, in which <em>Beverley </em>was cast, but on a point not affecting the merits; and in 1817, another suit was brought by <em>Beverley's </em>heirs against him for the land, and this suit was still pending. 5. That the quantity of land included within the boundaries described in <em>Thompson's </em>covenant for the sale and conveyance of land to the plaintiff, was, in fact, about 90 acres, instead of 50 acres as mentioned in the covenant. 6. That in 1817, when the balance of the purchase money was tendered to <em>Thompson, </em>the land was worth from 15 to 20 dollars the acre. 7. That the plaintiff <em>John Guthrie </em>had cleared about 50 acres of the land, and made some valuable permanent improvements on it. 8. That he had held the land from the date of the covenant till he transferred the same to <em>James Guthrie, </em>for whose benefit this suit was brought; and that <em>James Guthrie </em>and those claiming under him, had ever since, and still, held it; nor had there been any other disturbance of the possession, but the suits of <em>Beverley </em>above mentioned, and the claim of <em>Hujjmire </em>mentioned in the <em>second </em>plea. 9. It was admitted, that the legal title of the land which <em>Thompson </em>covenanted to sell to <em>Guthrie, </em>was still in <em>Peter Beverley. </em>In addition to the facts above stated, the court certified sundry documents and proofs adduced for the defendant at the trial, for the purpose of sustaining the defence set up in his second plea; and the facts alleged in that plea seemed fully made out; but there is no occasion for any further notice of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>part of the case here, since it did not at all affect the ^ point on which this court decided the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOGl\"><em>Thompson\u2019s </em>executor applied by petition to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-9\">In the argument of the cause here, by <em>Stanard </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Johnson </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABT\">many points were debated ; but the opinion and judgment of this court determined only one of the questions argued at the bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-10\"><em>Stanard </em>insisted, that the defendant was certainly entitled to the new trial he asked, on the ground that the damages assessed by the verdict exceeded any just measure properly applicable to the case, and w\u2019ere, in truth, enormous and vindictive. Under the circumstances of the case, he thought, the plaintiff, if entitled to a verdict at all, ought to have had only nominal damages. But supposing him entitled to more, the utmost he could justly recover was the purchase money he had actually paid, with interest thereon from the date from which the plaintiff cduld be held responsible to the owner of the title for rents and profits. For that would undoubtedly have been the proper measure of damages, if this had been an action on a covenant of warranty, or any other covenant for assurance of title, in a deed executed for the conveyance of the land, and the breach alleged and proved had been an actual eviction of the purchaser : much more was it the proper measure of damages in this action on an executory contract for the sale of land and conveyance of title. <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 Rand. 132. <em>Threlkeld\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh\u2019s ex\u2019x, </em>2 Leigh 451. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Bell ex\u2019or, </em>3 Call 320. 326. <em>Flureau </em>v. <em>Thornhill, </em>2 W. Blacks. 1078. Here, where only a part of the purchase money had been paid by the purchaser, and where he and those claiming under him had held and enjoyed the possession for more than <em>thirty </em>years before the action was brought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and still continued in possession, with little danger too of ever being deprived of it, the damages given by the verdict (as he shewed) far exceeded the amount of the whole purchase money with interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-4\"><em>Johnson </em>contended, on the other hand, that, in an action for the breach of an executory contract for the sale and conveyance of land, the proper measure of damages was the actual loss which the covenantee sustained by the breach, to be estimated, of course, with reference to the value of the land at the time of the breach. And if that was true, it nowise appeared, that the damages given by the verdict in this case were excessive. He put the case of a covenant to sell and convey land for a consideration to be afterwards paid ; the covenantee making a tender of the purchase money at the time appointed for the payment of it, and the covenantor refusing to receive it, and to go on with the contract : in such case, if the purchase money paid, with interest, was the measure of damages, the purchaser would be entitled to no damages at all; and the vendor (for any remedy which <em>the law </em>afforded the person he had wronged) might violate his contract at pleasure. In actions upon covenants of warranty, and the like, contained in deeds of conveyance of land executed, the measure of damages had been settled upon technical reasons, which were not more applicable to executory contracts for the sale of land, than to executory contracts for the sale and delivery of personal estate; and he insisted, that there was no good reason for a distinction, in this respect, between contracts for real and contracts for personal estate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-11\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AeZ\">I am of opinion, that the circuit court ought to have granted a new trial in this case, on the ground, if upon no other, that the damages were excessive and vindictive. [Here, the judge recapitulated the leading facts of the case.] Although <em>Thompson </em>had not the le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>gal title, there is no evidence to shew that he had not such an equitable one, as, combined with his possession and the long possession of those holding under him, would have enabled his assignee to defend himself against the claim of <em>Beverley. </em>No eviction had taken place; no offer had been made to <em>Thompson </em>to cancel the bargain, yield the possession to him, and remit him to his original rights. The purchase money was but <em>\u00a3 </em>50. and only part of it had been paid. The verdict of the jury for so large a sum as 650 dollars in damages, must have been rendered in consequence of its being proved that in 1817, when the balance of the purchase money was tendered, the land was worth from 15 to 20 dollars per acre in cash, and that the boundaries of the tract, which was sold for 50 acres, more or less, really contained about 90 acres. A regard to both these elements, in connexion with the return of the purchase money advanced, must have influenced the jury. But throwing out of view the probability that the title of the covenantee had been perfected by the lapse of time; disregarding the fact of his neglecting for so many years to tender the balance of the purchase money, and ask for a title; and supposing him to have been actually evicted by <em>Beverley's </em>heirs ; the jury went greatly beyond the damages to which the plaintiff was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In the case of actual eviction from land for which the purchaser has a conveyance, he can only recover the purchase money, with interest for such time as he is liable to be called on for rents and profits, and the costs of defending the title. This is the settled rule by which the damages are measured in cases of eviction under an executed contract, <em>\u201c </em>whether they be claimed in an action upon a warranty, or covenant of seisin, or of power to convey, or for quiet enjoyment:\" see <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>and <em>Threlkeld's adm'r </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh's ex'x. </em>The same rule applies, at least with equal force, to executory contracts for land. In <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>sident <em>Pendleton, </em>who delivered the opinion of the court, ^ seemed to think it applied <em>a fortiori: </em>for whilst he in-dined to the opinion, that if a conveyance was made . 1 . . . with warranty, the purchaser upon eviction was entitied on the covenant to the increased value of the estate, he declared, that as in that case the contract was <em>executory, </em>a court of equity would adjust the damages upon equitable principles; and, accordingly, he decreed the value at the time of the agreement. So in <em>Flureau </em>v. <em>Thornhill, </em>on covenant to convey a tract of land at a future time, which had increased in value, and the vendor had no clear title, the vendee was only allowed the purchase money and interest, for that was his real loss. And judge <em>Green, </em>in <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>says, that s\u2018 in all cases of <em>executory </em>contracts, the compensation in case of failure, when the property sold has in the mean time increased in value, should be the same as in case of an executed contract with warranty, and an eviction; for the real loss to the purchaser is the same.\u201d Judge <em>Cabell </em>too, in the case of <em>Threlkeld's adm'r </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh\u2019s ex\u2019x, </em>draws the distinction between contracts to deliver personal property, and contracts to convey lands, at a future period, in these words : \u201c In all executory contracts for the delivery of personal property at a future day, the established standard of damages is the value of the property at the time and place when and where it ought to be delivered. In all executory contracts for the conveyance of land at a future time, the established measure of damages is the purchase money.\u201d On a covenant to make a good title, where there is no fraud on the part of the vendor, and he sells believing his title to be a good one, or that it can be made so, the rule must be the same. The vendee\u2019s loss, in case of failure, is the purchase money; the profits, as long as he receives them, standing in lieu of interest, unless so far as they are recovered. For this loss he ought to be compensated, if the land falls in value; and no more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>compensated, if it rises. Such a rule offers no temptation to the vendor to violate his contract; because, if he has a good title, the vendee can claim specific performance in a court of chancery, instead of bringing his action at law. As to the additional quantity of land over and above that sold, the vendee has no claim whatever to compensation; and with respect to loss sustained by having put improvements on the estate, he cannot recover, for the reasons assigned by judge <em>Green </em>in <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Jaclcson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Hence, the plaintiff here, in case of actual eviction, would seem to have been entitled to little more than 100 dollars, which he had paid, with some interest. Under the actual circumstances of \u2018the case, I am strongly inclined to think, his damages should have been nominal: but as (if my opinion prevails) the cause must be sent back for a new trial, and its aspect may be changed by new pleadings and new evidence, I forbear to give any opinion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">The other judges concurred. Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
