His will was proved and recorded in the month of September in that year; and his wife qualified as the executrix. All the testator\u2019s children named in his will, and all his afterbora children, were living at his death, except, perhaps, his son <em>Robert; </em>as to whom the bill in this cause stated that he died in his father\u2019s lifetime, and it was not denied ; but there was some evidence that made it doubtful whether he died before or shortly after his father; however, he died in infancy, and the time of his death had no effect on the rights of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">The testator\u2019s widow, <em>Mary Manson, </em>died in 1814; leaving only two of the testator\u2019s children her surviving, namely, his daughter <em>Elizabeth </em>(now the wife of <em>Hans-ford) </em>of whom his wife was pregnant when the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>was made, and his afterborn son <em>Peter Manson. </em>All the other children of the testator, who survived <em>him, </em>but did not survive the testator\u2019s <em>widow, </em>had been married, and left children. His daughter <em>Anna Manson </em>married <em>John liaughton, </em>and died in 180G, leaving her husband her surviving, and a daughter named <em>Mary, </em>who married <em>Robert Jennings. </em>His son <em>John Manson </em>died in 1801, leaving two children, <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>Robert; Elizabeth </em>married <em>Kemp Elliott; Robert </em>died in 1824, leaving a widow <em>Mary </em>(who is his administratrix) and two children, <em>John </em>and <em>Edward, </em>who were infants when this suit was brought. His daughter <em>Polly Manson </em>married <em>James Moss, </em>and died in 1808, leaving her husband her surviving, and two children, <em>Mahala </em>and <em>John Moss, </em>infants when this suit was brought. And his son <em>Thomas Manson </em>died in March 1813, leaving three children, two of whom, <em>Wilhelmina </em>and <em>Maria, </em>are yet living, and were infants when this suit was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-3\">About a year after the death of the testator\u2019s widow, namely, in November 1815, the testator\u2019s son <em>Peter Manson </em>and <em>Thomas Hansford </em>and his wife <em>Elizabeth </em>obtained an order from the county court of <em>York, </em>appointing commissioners to divide the slaves of the testator which had been held by his widow during her life under his will, between <em>them, </em>the only children of the testator that survived the widow; and in December 1815, the division was made between them accordingly, to the exclusion of the families of the testator\u2019s other children, who survived him, but died before his widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\">In Juno 1825, the bill in this cause was exhibited, in the court of chancery of <em>Williamsburg </em>(whence it was transferred to the circuit superiour court of <em>James City), </em>by <em>Kemp Elliott </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>his wife, daughter of the testator\u2019s deceased son <em>John Manson, </em>of whom the bill stated there was no known <em>representative,\u2014Mary </em>the widow and administratrix, and <em>John </em>and <em>Edward </em>the infant children, of <em>Robert </em>the deceased son of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>John Manson,\u2014Robert Jennings </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife, the daughter of the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Anna Manson </em>(after-wards mrs. <em>Haughton) </em>of whom it was stated there was no known <em>representative,\u2014Wilhelmina </em>and <em>Maria Manson, </em>infant children of the testator\u2019s deceased son <em>Thomas Manson, </em>of whom it was stated there was no known representative,\u2014and <em>John </em>and <em>Mahala Moss, </em>infant children of the testator\u2019s deceased daughter <em>Polly Manson </em>(afterwards mrs.

The testator\u2019s son <em>Richard, </em>who was born after the making-of his will, was not made a party, the bill stating that he died in 1814, intestate, without wife or child, and had no known representative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">The bill set forth all the facts above stated; and then alleged, further, that the defendant <em>Hansford </em>had sold and disposed of all the slaves which he acquired by the division of December 1815, except <em>eight, </em>and of these <em>eight </em>he had conveyed five to <em>Samuel Sheild </em>by deed of trust to secure a debt to the defendant <em>Robert Sheild; </em>that the trustee had advertised those five slaves for sale, so that the same, if sold, might not be within reach of the process of the court; and that the plaintiffs apprehended, that <em>Hansford </em>would sell <em>and dispose </em>of the other three slaves still held by him, and so put them beyond reach : that the slaves which <em>Peter Manson </em>acquired at the division of December 1815, were now in the hands of the defendant <em>Robert Sheild, </em>his administrator ; but that <em>Sheild </em>intended to sell some of them to discharge debts due from his intestate\u2019s estate. The bill, therefore, prayed an injunction, in the first place, to restrain the defendants from selling the slaves, and that security should be exacted from them to have the property forthcoming, or that it should be committed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the care of the marshal of the court; and finally, a de- \u00ab cree for the just shares to which the plaintiffs were entitled of all the property of the estate of the testator <em>Robert Manson </em>that had come to the hands of the defendants, and of the profits thereof, of which accounts were asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\"><em>Hansford </em>and wife answered, that before this suit was brought, <em>Hansford </em>had sold two of the slaves mentioned in the injunction, and the other had run away. They insisted, that the division of December 1815 was made according to the just rights of the parties under the will of the testator <em>Robert Manson: </em>they relied on <em>Hansford\u2019s </em>possession of more than five years, and on the statute of limitations; and submitted whether there were proper parties before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The defendant <em>Sheild </em>made default; and the bill was taken <em>pro confesso </em>against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\">The plaintiffs afterwards filed an amended bill, shewing administrations, granted since the filing of the original bill, of the estates of the several decedents therein mentioned as having no known representative: that the estate of <em>Anna Houghton </em>was now represented by the plaintiff <em>Jennings; </em>that the estate of <em>John Manson </em>deceased had been recently committed to the sheriff of <em>Warwick, </em>the estate of <em>Thomas Manson </em>deceased to the coroner of <em>Norfolk, </em>and the estate of <em>James Moss, </em>the deceased husband of <em>Tolly Manson, </em>that of the testator\u2019s son <em>Richard Manson, </em>and that of <em>Robert Manson </em>the elder (the testator), had been committed to the sheriff of <em>York; </em>all of whom were made parties defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">The sheriff of <em>York, </em>administrator of the three estates above mentioned, put in an answer, which, however, was merely formal.

Hansford </em>and wife were ordered to render accounts of all the slaves and other property of the estate of the testator <em>Robert Manson, </em>which came to their hands, with an account of the value of what had been sold by them, the hires of the slaves they had kept, and interest on the money received for those sold. And <em>Sheild, </em>as administrator of <em>Peter Manson, </em>was ordered to render similar accounts, together with an account of administration of his intestate\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The accounts ordered were taken accordingly, and . .

And the court appointed commissioners to sell the slaves, and to deposit the proceeds of sales in the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Norfolk; </em>and farther ordered and decreed (without intending to settle the principles of the division) that the commissioner of the court should make a special statement, dividing the balances reported to be doe from <em>Hansford </em>and <em>Sheild </em>the administrator of <em>Peter Manson, </em>and the amount of hires collected or to be collected, among all the parties entitled, according to their apparent interests ; charging the two daughters of <em>Thomas Manson </em>deceased with 400 dollars, the agreed value of advancements to their said father from the estate of his father the testator <em>Robert Manson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">The sale was made in pursuance of the order, and a report thereof returned.

The first and main point debated, was the question upon the construction and effect of the will of the testator <em>Robert Manson: </em>Whether, in the bequest therein contained, that after the death of the testator\u2019s wife, the whole of his personal estate should be divided among his <em>surviving children </em>thereafter named, the word <em>surviving </em>referred to the death of the wife, when the division was to be made ? or to the death of the testator ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-13\">The appellants\u2019 counsel contended for the former construction; and he insisted, that it was a general prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ciple of construction applicable to all cases like the present, that words of <em>survivorship </em>should be referred to the period of division and enjoyment, unless a special intent appeared to the contrarjr, according to the decision of sir <em>John Leach </em>in <em>Cripps </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>4 Madd. Ch. Rep. 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-4\">The counsel for the appellees maintained, that the words of <em>survivorship, </em>here, had reference to the death of the testator. They denied, that the general principle of construction stated by the vicechancellor in <em>Cripps </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>was sustained by authority: and they insisted, that the general principle was the direct <em>reverse; </em>that, in bequests like this, the words of survivorship must be referred, not to the death of the tenant for life when the division was to be made, but to the death of the testator, so as that the legacy should vest in all the legatees that survived <em>him, </em>unless there was something special to shew that the period of division was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">The following authorities were cited and examined in the argument: <em>Brograve </em>v. <em>Winder, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 634. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Long, </em>4 Ves. 551. <em>Daniell </em>v. <em>Daniell, </em>6 Ves. 297. <em>Jenour </em>v. <em>Jenour, </em>10 Ves. 562. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Ayscough, </em>19 Ves. 534. <em>Hoghton </em>v. <em>Whitgreave, </em>1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 146. <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Ld. Kenyon, </em>3 Madd. Ch. Rep. 410. in which cases, the construction that referred the words of survivorship to the event upon which the division was to be made, prevailed. <em>Earl of Bindon </em>v. <em>Earl of Suffolk, </em>4 Bro. P. C. 574. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Bayly, 3 </em>Id. 195. <em>Roebuck </em>v. <em>Dean, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 265. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Woods, 3 </em>Ves. 204. <em>Maberly </em>v. <em>Strode, </em>Id. 450. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bigg, </em>7 Ves. 280. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>6 Taunt. 213. 1 Eng.

Rep. 263. cases in which the construction that referred the words of survivorship to the death of the testator, prevailed. But the counsel for the appellees insisted, that whatever might be the general rule of construction, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>whether there was any such general rule or not, upon the plain intent of <em>this </em>will, the testator\u2019s children who <em>survived him, </em>took a vested interest in the remainder expectant on the wife\u2019s life estate; in arguing which proposition, they cited <em>Walley </em>v. <em>North, </em>3 Ves. 364. <em>Halifax </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>16 Ves. 168. <em>Woodstock </em>v. <em>Shillito, </em>6 Sim. 416. 9 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 337. They also cited the opinion of <em>Denman, </em>C. J. in <em>Doe </em>d. <em>Pilkington </em>v. <em>Spratt, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Adolph. 731. <em>27 </em>Eng. C. L. Rep. 166. that \u201cthe law favours the vesting of estates, and that it is an established rule of construction, not to read, a limitation in a will as being a <em>contingent </em>remainder, unless such clearly appears to have been the testator\u2019s intention; if it admits of being considered a <em>vested </em>remainder, it will always be read as suchand to shew that this rule was peculiarly applicable to bequests of personal estate, and especially to residuary bequests, they cited <em>Bolger </em>v. <em>Mackell, </em>5 Ves. 509. So, they said, in the construction of deeds of settlement, the courts always strove to find a construction whereby descendants should be provided for; <em>Woodstock </em>v. <em>Duke of Dorset, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 569. <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Ld. Clifden, </em>6 Ves. 499. <em>Powis </em>v. <em>Burdett, </em>9 Ves. 428. <em>King </em>v. <em>Hake, </em>Id. 438. <em>Howgrave </em>v. <em>Cartier, </em>3 Ves. &amp; Beam. 79. <em>Perfect </em>v. <em>Ld.

The counsel for the appellants contended, that, if the construction of the will under which the .appellees claimed was correct, yet, as their rights as next of kin and distributees of their deceased parents, accrued in 1814 when the testator\u2019s widow died, and the possession of the defendants commenced in 1815, and this suit was not brought till 1825, the statute of limitations was a bar to it. The objection supposed that the appellees could, as next of kin and distributees, maintain this bill; for if they could, he said, it did not appear that they, or at least several of them, were under any legal disability which would avoid the operation of the statute as a bar to <em>their </em>claim and suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The counsel for the appellees answered, that <em>Peter \u2022 </em>\u2022 \u2022 <em>Manson, </em>the intestate of the defendant <em>Skeild, </em>was himself the representative of <em>Richard Manson </em>and <em>James Moss, </em>so that the statute could not be a bar to the claim of their distributees; and that the other parties were all under disabilities of coverture or of infancy at the time their title accrued, which prevented the bar of the statute as to them. Besides, they said, the statute of limitations could not have been a bar to a suit brought by the administrators of the decedents whose next of kin and distributees had filed this bill, because the statute could not have begun to run against the estates of those decedents, till there were administrators to represent them; which was not the case till after the commencement of this suit, except as to two of them, of whom <em>Peter Manson </em>himself, whose unjust possession'is complained of, was the administrator. <em>Murray v. East India Company, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 204. 7 Eng. C. L. Rep. 66. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hardiman, </em>2 Leigh 347. And as the statute would have been no bar to the suit of the administrators, so it was no bar to the suit of the distributees, who claimed through the administrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">III. The appellants\u2019 counsel objected, that the next of kin and distributees of the deceased legatees could not maintain this bill to recover personal property belonging to the estates of those decedents: that administrations should have been taken of the estates of the decedents, and the claim should have been prosecuted by the administrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">The answer was, that the next of kin and distributees could maintain the bill, though they could not have a decree for distribution among them, without making the personal representatives of the decedents parties ; and here, the personal representatives were convented before the court as parties defendants. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Frazier's ex'ors, 2 </em>Leigh 642. <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>3 Leigh 567.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ALX\">The main question in this cause arises \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 on the bequest in the will of the testator <em>Robert Manson, </em>that at the death of his wife, the whole of his personai estate (which he had bequeathed to his wife for life) <em>should be equally divided among his surviving children thereafter named, Sec. </em>And the question is, whether the words <em>surviving children </em>shall be taken to refer to the period of the testator\u2019s death, or to that of the death of his widow the tenant for life ? If to the former, the interest vested in all the testator\u2019s children living at his death, and passed to their representatives ; the time of distribution among them being alone postponed : if to the latter, then <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>Peter Manson, </em>who alone survived the tenant for life, were entitled to the whole property; and the decree must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">After an attentive examination of all the authorities cited at the bar (wdiich include, I believe, all that have any material bearing on the subject) I am of opinion, that although the children of the testator were not to take in possession until the death or second marriage of the widow, they took an interest at the period of the testator\u2019s death ; that wherever the words <em>survivors </em>and <em>surviving </em>are used in a will, especially by an unlearned man <em>inops consilii </em>(as this testator evidently was), without manifesting any special intent to the contrary, the safest and soundest construction, that most consonant to the intention of the testator and best supported by the authorities, is to refer them to the death of the testator, and not to give the whole estate to such legatee as happens to survive the tenant for life, or, if none survives, to declare a total intestacy. The only authority directly opposed to this construction is the case of <em>Cripps </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>decided by sir <em>John Leach </em>in 1819\u2014 where the vicechancellor laid down as the general rule, that words of survivorship are to be referred to the period of division and enjoyment, if there be no special intent to the contrary; and that if a previous life es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tate is given, the period of division being the death of the tenant for life, the survivors at such death will take the whole legacy\u2014which, he said, was the principle of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Long, Daniell </em>v. <em>Daniell, </em>and <em>Jenour </em>v. <em>Jenour. </em>But I think it will be found, that those cases do not sustain the proposition; while the cases of <em>Wilson v. Bayly, Roebuck </em>v. <em>Dean, Perry </em>v. <em>Woods, Maberly </em>v. <em>Strode, Brown </em>v. <em>Bigg, Doe </em>d. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Prigg, </em>are manifestly in opposition to it. The last case I consider as directly in point, or rather as going beyond the case at bar, because the remainder there was to a <em>class, </em>and here it is to children <em>named.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In the case of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Long, </em>the three sisters among whom and \u201c the survivor or survivors of them\u201d the legacy was to be divided after the death of the tenant for life, all outlived their mother the tenant for life, as well as the testator; and the bill was brought by the <em>executors </em>of <em>Christiana., </em>one of the surviving sisters; the only question being, whether the sisters were tenants in common or joint tenants. The chancellor, on the authority of <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>decided that upon the death of <em>Christiana, </em>her third part passed by her will. So far, the case is opposed to the principle stated by sir <em>John Leach. </em>But lord <em>Alvanley </em>added this observation\u2014\u201c If all the sisters had not survived their mother, <em>fossibly </em>1 might have adopted the construction, that the survivorship related to the death of the mother, and not of the testator; for I think that construction is not to be adopted, if any other can be.\u201d It will be found that this loose <em>dictum </em>of lord <em>Alvanley </em>not only misled sir <em>John Leach, </em>but betrayed sir <em>William, Grant </em>in the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bigg, </em>into the observation (whilst the argument was going on) that the general leaning of the court was against construing the words of survivorship to relate to the death of the testator, if any other period could be fixed upon. In the case of <em>Shergold </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>13 Ves. 375. he retracted that remark; and stated, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>in regard <em>\u201c </em>to the effect of a general clause of survi- . , , r vorship, he had found the result ol the authorities contrary to what had fallen from the court during the argument of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bigg, </em>founded upon what lord Alean<em>Icy </em>had said in one of the cases ; and that, in a great majority of them, the survivorship had been referred to the period of the testator\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">In <em>Daniell </em>v. <em>Daniell, </em>there was a clear, special intent to refer the survivorship to the period of the death of the tenant for life, not onty by the effect of the words \u201c to be paid equally between the two sons <em>James </em>and Francis, or <em>the whole to the survivor of them,\u201d </em>but more conclusively by the mode in which the testator disposed of the other sum of \u00a31000. to the same persons, in which the period of division was, beyond all doubi, the period at which he intended it to vest; a circumstance relied on strongly by sir <em>PV. Grant, </em>as confirming his construction of the clause on which the question arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">The case of <em>Jenour </em>v. <em>Jenour </em>was one of considerable doubt and difficulty, and in the course of it lord <em>Eldon </em>intimates an opinion, but does not decide, as to the effect of two clauses in the will; one giving \u00a3200. <em>per annum., </em>after a previous estate for life, equally to be divided between the testator\u2019s nephews and nieces, and the survivors of them; and the other giving \u00a3200. <em>per annum, </em>after a previous estate for life, to be equally divided between his two nephews, and \u201c <em>to go to the survivor of them.\u201d </em>But no sucli question was before the court; and, in point of fact, all the nephews and nieces survived the tenants for life. The question argued and determined arose out of a clause in the will giving \u00a3 92. long annuities, to be equally divided between his two nephews, and to go to the survivor of them, after the death of the testator\u2019s brother and sister; and really turned upon the point whether they were to take as joint tenants, with benefit of survivorship between them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>selves, or as tenants in common. Lord <em>Eldon </em>determined, that the plaintiff should take the moiety of the <em>\u00a3 </em>92. <em>per annum, </em>absolutely, as tenant in common. The case seems, therefore, to belong to the same class to which <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Long </em>may be referred; and thus, like the two former, it affords no support to the principle it was cited to sustain.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">I have looked into the other cases cited by the appellants\u2019 counsel, to shew that a general clause of survivorship after a previous estate, is to be referred to the period of division, unless a special intent to the contrary <em>appears\u2014Brograve </em>v. <em>Winder, Hoghton </em>v. <em>Whitgreave, Newton </em>v. <em>Ayscough, </em>and <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Ld. Kenyon. </em>In the three first cases, the intention was very clear to refer the survivorship to the death of the tenant for life. The estate, <em>at that time, </em>was to be sold by trustees and divided. That naturally pointed to the period of sale, as the period to ascertain who were the persons to take. In two of the cases, it was real estate to be converted into money by trustees, who were not themselves to take until after the death of tenant for life; so that (as the master of the rolls observed in one of them) the subject matter did not, until the death of the tenant for life, <em>exist in the form in which it was given. Newton </em>v. <em>Ayscough </em>is distinguished by sir <em>W. Grant </em>from <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>and likened to the cases of <em>Brograve </em>v. <em>Winder </em>and <em>Hoghton </em>v. <em>Whitgreave; </em>in the former of which lord <em>Loughborough </em>admitted it to tie generally true that the words \u201c survivors or survivor,\u201d or \u201c surviving,\u201d after a previous estate, would not prevent the vesting of the estate at the death of the testator. The remaining case of <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Ld. Kenyon </em>turned on a bequest, after a life estate, to the testator\u2019s two brothers in equal shares, \u201c or <em>the whole to the </em>survivor.\u201d Sir <em>John Leach </em>was of opinion that it was the meaning of the testator, that if one only survived the tenant for life, he should take the whole ; that it was a vested gift to the two as te<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>wants in common, subject to be divested if one alone . \u00bb survived; but as both brothers died m the lifetime of the tenant for life, the estate never was divested, and the money was divisible between the representatives of the two brothers. In this case, it is manifest, there was a special intent that the survivor should take the whole ; and the opinion of the vicechancellor, that the estate <em>vested </em>in both, shews that it does not interfere with the rule I have indicated as the true one, in the first part of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">That rule is sustained by the cases I mentioned before, and several others unnecessary to be cited. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bigg, </em>(divested of the hasty observation of sir <em>W. Grant, </em>which he afterwards retracted in <em>Shergold </em>v. Boone) is in point; and so is <em>Long </em>v. <em>Prigg, </em>decided in the year 1828. Sir <em>John Leach </em>said that <em>Roebuck </em>v. <em>Dean </em>and <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Woods </em>did not square with the other authorities ; but the first is cited and approved in <em>Halifax </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>the latter in <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Ayscough, </em>and both by <em>Bayley, </em>J. in delivering the judgment of the court in <em>Long </em>v. <em>Prigg. </em>After this, I cannot doubt the soundness of the observation made by lord <em>Loughborough </em>in <em>Brograve </em>v. Winder\u2014that it is generally true the word <em>survivors </em>will not prevent the vesting of the estate at the death of the testator; or, as lord <em>Alvanley </em>expressed it in <em>Maberly </em>v. <em>Strode, </em>\u201cthe <em>blind </em>words \u2018 with benefit, of survivorship\u2019 &amp;c. mean the survivors at the death of the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">But if the general rule were as sir <em>John Leach </em>states it to be, I. should still be of opinion, that the words of <em>this </em>will shew a special intent that the interest should vest in the children surviving at the testator\u2019s death, and the child his wife might have. For, 1st, the profits are given for the comfort and support of his wife and children thereafter named, during the wife\u2019s life; which is indicative of his intention to vest the estate in the children to be supported. 2ndly, If the wife mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ried again, she was to take but one third of the estate, , and unless the whole vested in interest in the children, there would be a partial intestacy as to the two thirds; which ought not to be presumed; it being clearly the intention of the testator to dispose of his whole estate. 3rdly, The bequest is to children specially named ; and I cannot believe the testator meant to make a tontine among them, and if all but one died before the mother, for that one to take all, in exclusion of grandchildren or their descendants. This would, I believe, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, defeat the intention. 4thly, The estate is to be equally divided amongst children named, as individuals, not as a <em>class: </em>equality between <em>them </em>is the obvious intent; and this equality would be defeated by allowing a survivor <em>to </em>take the whole. 5thly, If none survived the tenant for life, a total intestacy is the consequence, which this testator manifestly did not intend. And, lastly, the provision that if his wife was then with child, that child was to have an equal part of his personal estate <em>with the rest of his above-mentioned children, </em>shews that the testator meant that each of his children named should have an equal part in any event. He does not make the interest of the child to be born, dependant upon his surviving the mother, although his possession is necessarily postponed; and, therefore, it ought not to be presumed, that he intended to make the interest of his other children dependant on that event. If, therefore, the period to which survivorship relates is to be ascertained, \u201cnot by any technical words, but by the apparent intention of the testator, collected either from the particular disposition, or from the general context of the will,\u201d (19 Yes. 536.) I feel no doubt upon <em>this </em>will, that the testator meant all his children to take a vested interest at his death; and, consequently, that the decree in this particular is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Upon the other points argued at the bar, I shall touch very briefly, there being no difference of opinion among the members of the court in regard to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>As to the length of possession, and the statute of limi- \u00b0 ill ill tations, it was not contended that they would have protected the defendants in the court below, against the claims of the legal representatives of the deceased legatees, if a suit for the property had been brought in their names. But it was argued, that they protect the defendants against the equitable right of the next of kin or distributees of those decedents to sue; an equitable right being barred by the same length of time that would bar a legal right. No authority was cited to shew that a person under the disability of infancy or coverture, who might, at the commencement of such disability, have sued by <em>prochein amy, </em>may not sue during its existence, in the same manner, although more than five years have elapsed. The action belongs to the infant or <em>feme </em>covert, not to the next friend ; his or her rights are saved, till the disability ceases. Here, the plaintiffs having been under the disability of infancy or coverture, their case was not within the statute; nor will equity carry the statute beyond the law. Moreover, at the time when <em>Hansford </em>and <em>Peter Manson </em>took possession of and divided the estate of the testator <em>Robert </em>Manson, there was no representative of that estate in being: they ought to be considered as executors in their own wrong, liable, like all other executors, to legatees and distributees.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The last point is, I think, settled by the cases of Frazier v. Frazier, and <em>Samuel </em>v. Marshall, cited at the bar, and by another case, <em>Moring </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>4 Call 577. all of which proceed upon the assumption, that legatees or distributees may sue in equity, but they are bound to bring the executor or administrator before the court, in order to a decree for distribution. It would bo productive of much inconvenience and injustice, if they could not avail themselves of their equitable rights to injoin a sale (as in the present case) or to prevent other irreparable mischief, before an administration of the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>could be obtained, or where an executor or administrator should be indisposed to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"ASV\">I think the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Brookenbrough, Cabell and Brooke, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b120-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqTQd\">dissented on the first question. He said\u2014\u25a0 <em>Robert Manson, </em>by his will dated in 1785, devised his estate for the support of his wife and children during her widowhood, but in case she married, then she was to have only a third part during life : he then proceeds, <em>\u201c </em>and further my desire is, that she continue on the plantation I now live on, <em>and at her death </em>for the whole of my personal estate to be equally divided <em>among my surviving </em>children hereafter named, viz. Anna\u201d &amp;c. All the children named (besides three others born after the date of the will) survived the testator, but <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>Peter </em>alone survived the widow. And the question- is, whether they are exclusively entitled to the personalty P I am of opinion that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">If it appeared in this case, that the testator had lost a child or children before the date of his will, the natural construction of the word <em>surviving </em>would be to refer it to that event. But there is no proof of such fact, and the contrary inference may be drawn from the testimony. It has accordingly been contended, that the word <em>surviving </em>must refer either to his own death or to the death of his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">In deciding upon this alternative, we must bear in mind that the law has given to the testator the absolute disposition of his property, and that his will in relation to it is the law which must govern it, provided the provisions of it are not in violation of the laws of the land. The only legitimate object of inquiry, therefore, is, what was the intention of the testator ? and that intention is better discerned by looking to his language and the provisions of the instrument, than by a resort to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>judicated. cases upon other wills, or to rules of construction often arbitrary, and very often irreconcilable with the true meaning of any other will than that upon which they have been founded. Let us then endeavour, in <em>this </em>case, to get at the testator\u2019s intention from his very words. His desire is, that \u201c <em>at the death of his wife </em>his whole personal estate be equally divided among bis <em>surviving </em>children hereafter named, viz. <em>Anna\u201d </em>&amp;c. <em>Surviving whom </em>or wLat ? The word <em>surviving </em>is a relative term. It means, <em>ex vi termini, </em>a person who outlives another person, or who outlives some certain event. To what, then, does this <em>relative </em>term <em>related </em>what is its antecedent ? We have seen, that it does not refer to the previous death of other children. Neither does it refer to the testator himself: Ins death had not been spoken of; no reference had been made to it, nor is it natural, or customary, or necessary, that the testator should provide that his legatees must survive himself. At the date of this will, the <em>law </em>provided <em>that; </em>for, at that time, all legacies lapsed if the legatee died in the testator\u2019s lifetime. To what, then, does this word relate ? It relates to his wife, of whom he was then speaking, and to the event of her death, which he had then just mentioned. Surviving <em>whom \u00b6 </em>Surviving her. Surviving <em>what </em>? Surviving her death. Herself, or her death, are the immediate objects to which this relative expression refers. Nothing can be more plain ; and nothing can obscure the meaning, but an attempt to elucidate it by a multiplicity of cases. Of these cases I shall say but little. If a rule is to be laid down, I conceive that wLich is stated by sir <em>John Leach, </em>somewhat modified, to be the proper one; that if there be a previous limitation of the property to another, with a limitation over to the survivor or survivors of a class or of certain individuals, the survivorship must be referred to the period of division, <em>if there be no intent to the contrary discoverable in the will. </em>On the other hand, it is contended, that by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>later decisions the <em>testator's death </em>is the period, <em>unless an intent to the contrary is to he deduced from the mil. </em>Thus, both rules are found to refer themselves, at last, to the matter of intention ; and, of course, they in fact offer no certain rule whatever for our direction. We must, at last, look to the will itself, and interpret, as we best may, that governing principle which is to be our guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Some objections which have been suggested to my construction of this will, require notice. It is said, that by this construction the children of those who are dead are not provided for, and that it cannot be supposed the testator intended to disinherit them. To this it was well replied, that if the survivorship be referred even to the death of the testator, the same difficulty would have occurred, in case of the death of a child in his lifetime, leaving children. We must take it, therefore, that he had no design to provide against such contingency; and as the objection is equally applicable to either hypothesis, it can have no influence in inducing us to adopt the one rather than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Again, it is asked, how would it have been if the widow had married ? would not the estate have been at once distributable among all the children ? I think not. Even in that event, I incline to think the testator intended all but her third to be kept together for the support of the children ; for there can be no question that there was to be no <em>division </em>till her death. But admit it were otherwise, it brings us only to this, that in one alternative (her marrying) the estate would be divisible at once, and would comprehend all the children <em>then </em>alive; and in the other alternative (her remaining a widow) the division would be postponed until her death, because she was during life to have the use of the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">It may be said, however, that here the division is to be between persons expressly named. But, according to my construction, the words \u201c among <em>my surviving children </em>hereafter named, viz. Anna\u201d &amp;c. are to be under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>stood thus, \u201c among <em>the survivors of my children </em>hereafter named,\u201d &amp;c. and then there is no difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"AKH\">It seems to have been thought unnatural for the testator to exclude the families of those dying in his wife\u2019s life. About this, opinions might well differ. Admit the interests to have been vested, and then the <em>husbands </em>of the daughters, and <em>not their children, </em>would at their deaths have taken their interests. Is it certain that <em>every </em>testator would be satisfied with such a result? Would every testator have been willing, that these vested interests of his daughters should, upou the division at his wife\u2019s death, have gone into the hands of their husbands, rather than to his surviving children ? May not this testator well have objected to giving vested interests to his daughters, which, even before they came into possession, might have been made chargeable with their husbands\u2019 debts ? May he not even have chosen to postpone the vesting in interest of his sons\u2019 portions, to prevent the sacrifice of such remote and unsaleable interests by their imprudence ? These things seem to me very possible ; and if we can suppose any testator might intend such provisions, I think we must say this testator did intend them.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">I am therefore of opinion, that <em>by the will, </em>the children who survived the widow were alone entitled; and .1 should think it proper to dismiss the bill, but for the interest of <em>Richard, </em>who was born after the date of the will, and pretermitted. He is not comprehended by the will; <em>Armistead </em>v. <em>Dangerfeld, </em>3 Munf. 20. And he is therefore entitled, under the statute, to the same portion of his father\u2019s estate as if he had died intestate, which he is to have by way of charge upon the other legatees; Ibid. This interest, upon his death, devolved upon his personal representative for the benefit of his next of kin, many of whom are parties in this cause. <em>Richard Manson's </em>administrator is now a defendant. Under the circumstances of this case, I think the plaintiffs had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ground for coming into equity. They had an interest\u2014 possibly not a very large one\u2014and the property in which they were interested was about to be wasted or eloigned, there being at that time, it would seem, no administrator of <em>Richard. </em>Their equitable interest gave them a right, under these circumstances, to the aid of the court; and they might still be sustained here, with leave to shape their bill anew according to their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">As to the statute of limitations, it could not, I think, oppose any obstacle to their success, since the administration on <em>Richard\u2019s </em>estate has been recent; and the statute could not begin to run until administration, as it did not run against <em>Richard </em>himself, he having died before the cause of action accrued. I doubt, moreover, whether the statute would run between the afterborn child and those whom the act of assembly makes chargeable to him. The case is certainly not within the express provisions of the statute of limitations; for the remedy of the pretermitted child is only in a court of equity; and that court, I apprehend, would not rigorously apply the statute to a case partaking strongly of the character of a trust, so as to protect the children who have got possession of the whole property, against the just claims of their own brother to his portion of the inheritance. On this point, however, it is not necessary to give any explicit opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the decree should be reversed, and <em>the cause </em>remanded to be proceeded in upon the principles I have declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
