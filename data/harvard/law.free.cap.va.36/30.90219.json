The declaration alleged a joint contract of the three defendants with the plaintiff for the work; and the defendants pleaded jointly, <em>non assumpsit.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-13\">Upon the first trial, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 1164 dollars damages. The defendants moved the court for a new trial; the court overruled the motion; and the defendants filed a bill of exceptions to that opinion. The court then gave the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>judgment for the damages assessed by the verdict; and the defendants appealed to the circuit court of <em>Campbell.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AeK\">The question in the circuit court, therefore, was whethcr, upon the state of the case appearing in the bill of exceptions, the county court erred in refusing the new trial asked by the defendants ? The bill of exceptions did not pui'port to state the <em>facts proved </em>at the trial: it set forth <em>the evidence </em>on the part of the plaintiff, at large, as it was delivered by the witnesses, and the substance of the defendants\u2019 evidence. From the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence it appeared, that the work for which he claimed compensation in this action, was the building of a stone wall in the town of <em>Lynchburg, </em>for the purpose of filling up a deep ravine, in order to connect the <em>Lynchburg and Salem turnpike road </em>with a street called <em>the sixth alley </em>in that town. That the <em>Lynchburg and Salem turnpike company </em>could only bring their road to the outer boundary line of the town. That, therefore, the persons owning property in the lower part of the town, and interested in connecting <em>the turnpike road </em>with <em>the sixth alley, </em>set on foot a subscription for the purpose of effecting the work: there were twenty subscribers, engaging to pay various sums by them respectively subscribed ; and among the subscribers were two of the defendants, namely, <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bullock, </em>but the delendant <em>Lynch </em>was not a subscriber. That all three of the defendants were interested in the improvement, beiug owners of property in the town which would be benefited thereby. That the plaintiff did the stone work which was required to connect the turnpike road with the alley of the town. That the defendants <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bullock </em>superintended the work, gave directions concerning it while it was in progress, were present at the measurement of it after it was done, and directed the plaintiff to make out his account for the same against themselves and <em>Lynch; </em>and <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bullock </em>after-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>wards, upon being applied to for payment, made declarations and did acts, from which it might very fairly be inferred, that <em>they </em>held themselves bound to pay for it, or to see it paid for, and, therefore, that <em>they </em>had made the contract with the plaintiff for the <em>work: </em>but there was no evidence adduced on the part of the plaintiff, that the defendant <em>Lynch </em>had ever said or done any thing, from which it could be inferred, that <em>he </em>was a party with <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bullock </em>in the contract for the work with the plaintiff; and when he was applied to for payment, by the plaintiff, he promptly disclaimed all connexion with the transaction; nor did the evidence shew the least reason for supposing that he was connected with it, except the direction given by <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bullock </em>to the plaintiff, abovementioned, that he should make out his account <em>against them and Lynch. </em>Such being the state of the evidence on the part of the plaintiff, it is unnecessary to state that adduced for,the defendants : upon the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing, he was not entitled to maintain this joint action, and to have a joint verdict and judgment, against <em>Davis, Bullock </em>and <em>Lynch, </em>even if his evidence was sufficient to entitle him to recover against <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bullock. </em>Therefore, the circuit court reversed the judgment of the county court, set aside the verdict, and remanded the cause for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-4\">There were several trials in the county court after-wards, with various results. At the last trial, the defendants tendered a demurrer to the evidence, wherein they set forth all the evidence on both sides: but the plaintiff objected to join in the demurrer, and the court refused to compel him to do so. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 95S dollars with interest &amp;c. for which the court gave him judgment, and the defendants again appealed to the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">Upon this second appeal to the circuit court, the question was, whether the county court erred in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>compel the plaintiff to join in the demurrer to evidence tendered by the defendants ? The evidence of the plaintiff set forth in that demurrer consisted of the testimony of several witnesses, who were adduced to prove that <em>Davis, Bulloch </em>and <em>Lynch </em>jointly contracted with the plaintiff for the stone work in question; but taking the plaintiff\u2019s evidence alone, and discarding that of the defendants entirely, though the evidence was stronger than that given at the first trial, it was yet plainly insufficient to implicate <em>Lynch </em>as a party to the contract with the plaintiff; it rather led to the opposite conclusion, that <em>Lynch </em>was nowise a party to it. The circuit court was of that opinion; and, therefore, reversed the judgment of the county court, and again remanded the cause, with directions that the plaintiff should be compelled to join in the demurrer to evidence tendered by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-3\">In the county court, accordingly, the plaintiff joined in the demurrer to evidence; and a verdict was taken for him, subject to the opinion of the court upon the demurrer. The court gave judgment upon the demurrer for the defendants; the plaintiff appealed to the circuit court, where this judgment was affirmed; and then he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-4\"><em>Grattan </em>and <em>Stanard, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-6\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ASI\">The cases of <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>1 Leigh 340. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>2 Leigh 337. and <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ashby, </em>6 Leigh 135. shew, that the bill of exceptions taken to the opinion of the county court overruling the motion for a new trial, was well taken ; and the judgment of the circuit court reversing the first judgment of the county court, cannot be impugned on that ground. The bill of exceptions did not, it is true, purport to state the <em>facts proved, </em>but only the <em>evidence given; </em>yet as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s evidence (throwing out of view all the evi- ^ ' \u00b0 . , dence for the defendants, and admitting that of the plaintiff to be true) was clearly insufficient to support his action, the circuit court was right in directing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">As to the question whether the plaintiff ought to have been compelled to join in the demurrer to evidence, I take the rule to be, that either party may demur, unless the case is clearly against the party offering to demur, and his object appears to be merely to delay the decision. Every case involves questions of law and fact, and a party has a right, admitting the facts which his adversary\u2019s testimony fairly conduces to prove, to bring the question of law arising out of the facts to the consideration and judgment of the court. How he may do this, is a point of practice, settled differently in <em>England </em>and in this country. The <em>english </em>practice is shewn by the cases of <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Hunter, 2 </em>H. Blacks. 187. and <em>Cocksedge </em>v. <em>Fanshaw, </em>1 Doug. 119. <em>our </em>practice, by the cases of <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, 2 </em>Rand. 353. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, </em>5 Rand. 1. <em>Hansbrough's ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Thom, </em>3 Leigh 147. <em>Clopton </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>6 Leigh 278. We permit all the evidence to be spread on the record, reject the demurrant\u2019s evidence where it conflicts with that of the other party, consider such party\u2019s evidence as true, and make all inferences of fact from it which may be fairly and reasonably deduced. But we do not prevent either party from demurring, unless in a case so clear, both upon the fact and law, as to afford some reason for believing that vexatious delay is the object. Now, in the case at bar, there was much room to doubt whether the evidence proved any thing against <em>Lynch, </em>and if it did not, whether the other defendants were liable. It involved the consideration of what acts amounted to a contract with the plaintiff on the part of <em>Lynch, </em>or to a recognition of a previous contract; and the evidence not being direct, but doubtful as to the inferences both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>fact and law properly deducible from it, I think the defendants had a right to demur, and that the plaintiff was properly compelled to join.</p>\n<p id=\"AYq\">Then, upon the demurrer to evidence itself, I am of opinion, that the evidence of the plaintiff, taking it all as true, proves nothing from which the jury ought fairly and reasonably to have inferred a contract with the plaintiff <em>on the part of Lynch; </em>and that, therefore, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The other judges concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
