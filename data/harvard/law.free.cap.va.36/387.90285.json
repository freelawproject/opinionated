The bill prayed a decree directing a conveyance to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-7\">The answers of the defendants did not deny that they had heard of the contract of sale to the complainant, before the conveyance from <em>Charles Green </em>to <em>Yerby; </em>but both defendants denied that <em>John Green </em>was authorized to make the contract, and <em>Yerby </em>relied on the statute of frauds, and insisted that, under the statute, the agreement entered into by <em>John Green </em>was not binding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-4\">The memorandum of the agreement was as follows : \u201cArticle of agreement between <em>John Green </em>of the one part, and <em>Nathaniel Grigsby </em>of the other part, witnesseth, the said <em>John Green </em>hath this day sold unto <em>Nathaniel Grigsby </em>two lots of land, containing about seventeen acres each, for the sum of four hundred and twenty five dollars, two hundred and fifty in hand paid, whereof the said <em>Green </em>acknowledges the receipt, the balance to be paid the first of November next. One of the above mentioned lots is <em>Charles Green's </em>property, brother of said <em>John, </em>being his part of his father\u2019s land, and said to be No. 5.\u2014the other lot being <em>John Green's </em>own part of his father\u2019s land, and said to be No. 8.\u2014ibr both of which the said <em>John Green </em>doth bind himself, his heirs &amp;c. to make the said <em>N. Grigsby </em>a good and sufficient deed on or before the first day of November next. Witness our hands and seals, this 30th day of August 1830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">******** <em>John Green </em>\u00a7 n. s. | ********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">*\u25a0:-*****\u25a0* <em>Nathaniel Grigsby </em>|n. s. | ********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-11\">Depositions were taken on both sides. In the opinion as well of the court below as of this court, the evidence established that <em>John Green </em>was authorized by <em>Charles </em>to make such a contract as was made with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>complainant, and that <em>Yerby </em>knew the contract had been made at the time that he purchased. The circuit court of Fauquier, affirming this contract in all things, decreed that <em>Yerby </em>should, by good and sufficient deed, release to <em>Charles Green </em>all right, title and interest that he had in or to the land by virtue of his purchase from Charles, and that <em>Charles Green, </em>upon the plaintiff\u2019s paying or tendering to him the sum of 175 dollars, should, at the costs of the plaintiff\", by good and sufficient deed, convey the land to the plaintiff with special warranty. The defendants were further adjudged to pay the plaintiff his costs. From this decree, on the petition of <em>Yerby, </em>an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-4\">The cause was argued by <em>Harrison </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Morson </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXU\">upon the questions made by the pleadings, and upon the following objections taken by <em>Harrison </em>to the decree : 1. that if it be proper <em>to </em>direct the appellant to convey back to <em>Charles Green, </em>the decree ought to go still farther, and direct <em>Charles Green </em>to pay back to the appellant the money received from him ; and 2. that admitting <em>Charles Green </em>had authorized <em>John </em>to sell, yet he bad given him no authority to receive payment, and the payment to <em>John </em>could only be valid to the amount of his half of the purchase money, so that, instead of 175 dollars, the sum mentioned in the decree, the appellee should be decreed to pay 212 dollars 50 cents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b413-5\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0qz\">If this were a case of the first impression, and we had now, in the absence of authority, to decide upon the true meaning of the statute of frauds in relation to contracts for the sale of lands, I should be much inclined to say, that a specific execution of this contract ought not to be decreed. But our legislature has copied the provisions of the english statute of 29 Charles 2. ch. 3. almost <em>verbatim, </em>and our courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>have generally adopted the construction given of that statute in <em>Westminster Hall. </em>' This is perhaps the safest course, particularly when we recollect that at the several revis\u00e1is the statute of frauds has been reenacted, with a full knowledge of the interpretation given to its words, in the courts of that country from which we borrowed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">It has been there repeatedly settled, that an agent authorized by parol to sign a contract for lands, is thereunto lawfully authorized, within the provisions of the statute. The authority to sell implies an authority to do every thing necessary to complete the sale, and make it binding on the principal. It is on this principle that an auctioneer empowered to sell, has always been held to be the agent of the vendor empowered to sign. In no one of the cases has it ever been required, that an express authority to sign should be superadded to the authority to sell, although the authority to sign is certainly required by the statute. It has, in all of them, been taken for granted that an agent authorized to sell lands, is empowered to do every act necessary to complete the contract. As the statute declares that no agreement for the sale of lands shall be binding, unless it is in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person <em>thereunto </em>(that is, to the <em>signing) </em>lawfully authorized, it could not be presumed that he who authorizes another to sell his lands, meant to deprive him of the power to render that sale effectual and binding on the purchaser. If the agent sells, and does not sign a note or memorandum in writing, the vendor has the same <em>locus poenitentice </em>as if he himself verbally agrees to sell; for he may revoke the authority of the agent at any time before the agreement is executed according to the statute. So an agent to purchase must have authority to bind the purchaser by signing the agreement, although his authority may be revoked before the contract is reduced to writing and signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>These propositions I take to be clearly established t. n t by all the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The signing required by the statute must be such as to have the effect of giving authenticity to the instrument, and be so intended; but it does not seem to be necessary that the principal\u2019s name should any where appear. The statute is complied with, if the contract for the sale of the principal\u2019s land be in writing, and signed by his agent, with a view' of authentication, and having the effect. No other construction can possibly be placed on the cases of <em>Kemeys </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>3 Ves. &amp; Beam. 57. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Trecothick, </em>9 Ves. 234. and <em>White </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>4 Taunt. 209. In the case at bar, the authority to sell is clearly proved; the intention by <em>John </em>to sell the land of <em>Charles Green </em>is expressed in terms; and the agent signs his name at the foot of the instrument, and with a view to authentication.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Further, after the contract was signed, <em>Charles Green </em>was told by <em>Chapman S. Green </em>that his agent had sold the land to <em>Grigsby, </em>and <em>Charles </em>said he was satisfied, and glad he had sold it. Here was a ratification of <em>John Green's </em>act, before he conveyed to <em>Yerby, </em>and this wmuld bind him, under the authority of the case of <em>Maclean </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>4 Bingh. 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Of this sale to <em>Grigsby, </em>it is proved that <em>Yerby </em>had express notice before he purchased or contracted to purchase from <em>Charles Green.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Under these circumstances, I fee 1 bound by the weight of authority to affirm the decree executing the contract of the 30th of August 1S30, between <em>John Green </em>the agent of <em>Charles </em>and <em>N. Grigsby, </em>with the variation suggested by the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">As to a decree between the defendants, that <em>Charles Green </em>refund the purchase money said to have been received by him from <em>Yerby, </em>it is sufficient to say, that no such matter was put in issue by the pleadings in the case, and there is no satisfactory evidence of the fact of such payment to be found in the record. The re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ceipt copied at the foot of the deed is not authenticated, r . r . . . . and is suspicious on its face, for it is dated the 17th of September 1830, and promises that <em>Charles Green </em>should make a deed to <em>Yerby </em>when called on, although the deed had already been made (if we may judge by its date) on the 8th of September preceding. This may be accounted for; but the paper is not proved, and there is no other evidence of the payment to <em>C. Green </em>by <em>Yerby </em>than what is to be found in the deposition of <em>Joseph </em>Varner, in an answer to a question having no reference to such payment. He is asked, at what time <em>Charles Green </em>said he intended to sell his land to <em>Yerby </em>? and he answers, \u201c It was a few minutes before I saw mr. <em>Yerby </em>pay the money to <em>Charles Green. I supposed </em>it to be for the land.\u201d It is evident that this loose answer to an incidental question would not justify a decree for a specific sum, if it were otherwise proper in a case like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Upon the whole, I concur in the decree to be indicated by the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Parker, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The decree of the court of appeals was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201c The court is of opinion that there is no error in the decree, except so far as it requires a release from the appellant to <em>Charles Green, </em>instead of decreeing a re-conveyance by the appellant to the said <em>Charles Green, </em>with warranty only against himself and all claiming under him : therefore it is decreed and ordered that the said decree, so far as the same is above declared to be erroneous, be reversed and annulled, and that the residue thereof be affirmed; and also that the appellant do pay unto the appellee, as the party substantially prevailing, his costs by him about his defence in this behalf expended. And it is ordered that the cause be remanded to the circuit superiour court, to be further proceeded in according to the foregoing opinion and decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
