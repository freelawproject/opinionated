But at the next term after these proceedings, there was a judgment entered for the plaintiffs as upon a general demurrer by them to the defendant\u2019s plea of <em>nil debet; </em>and the court gave judgment for them also on the plea of <em>no such record, </em>and then judgment for them according to the demand in the declaration ; namely, for the debt and <em>interest.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">The defendant applied by petition to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU4h\">contended, 1. That while the issue joined on the plea of <em>nil debet </em>stood on the record, no demurrer to that plea was admissible ; the plaintiffs could not reply and demur too. And if the demurrer was not properly admissible, much more irregular and erroneous was the proceeding of the court overruling the plea as upon demurrer, when in truth no demurrer had been put in. The consequence of this irregularity might have been to deprive the defendant of a good plea, such as payment of the debt after the judgment rendered. 2. That the plea of <em>nil debet </em>to this declaration was not a demurrable plea. He said the case of <em>Clarke's adm'r </em>v. <em>Day, </em>2 Leigh 172. required a reexamination; and notwithstanding that case, he insisted, that the laws of <em>Maryland </em>must, in our courts, be regarded as matters of fact to be proved by evidence; that the declaration here should have set forth the effect of the law of <em>Maryland ; </em>or the plaintiffs might have replied, that the plea was not a good bar according to the law of that state; and the question whether it was so or not, was, in its nature, a matter of fact, and so a proper subject of pleading and evidence: that the court could not upon a general demurrer to the plea take judicial notice, that by the law of <em>Maryland </em>the plea was not a good plea to the action there. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>3. That this being an action on a judgment, the dec\u00edaration should have demanded what the judgment gave, namely, the debt and the <em>damages, </em>not the debt and the <em>interest, </em>for which no judgment was given, though the payment of <em>interest </em>was, by the memorandum, to be a defeasance of the judgment for the <em>damages; </em>in like manner as in debt on a judgment for the penalty of a bond to be discharged by the payment of principal and interest, the declaration should demand the penalty adjudged. <em>Ragsdale, ex'or </em>v. <em>Batte ex\u2019or, 2 </em>Wash. 201. <em>Anderson adm'r </em>v. <em>Price, </em>4 Munf. 307.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>Robinson, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzWH\">said, 1. That it was plain the question whether the plea of <em>nil debet </em>should be received or not, was not decided, but was held <em>sub judice </em>till the defendant\u2019s counsel should shew the authorities to sustain it. It was doubtless owing to a clerical misprision that the <em>similiter </em>was added to the plea. But if the plea was not a good plea to the action, the defendant could have had no benefit from atrial of the issue upon it. Suppose the plea an improper one, which the court below should have rejected, and from which the party could have derived no benefit; this court would not reverse the judgment for any irregularity in the manner in which the plea was overruled. If the plea had been received, it should have been struck out; <em>Wyche </em>v. <em>Maclin, 2 Rand. 426. Read </em>v. <em>Hanna's ex'or, </em>3 Rand. 56. Then, 2. he said, the plea was unquestionably demurrable : he relied on <em>Clarke's adm'r </em>v. <em>Day, </em>and cited also <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>6 Har. &amp; Johns. 182. and <em>Wernwag </em>v. <em>Pawling, </em>6 Gill &amp; Johns. 500. And as to the last point, he insisted, that the declaration properly demanded the interest which was really due, instead of the damages which were not due, by the judgment. But if that was a defect in the declaration, it was cured by the statute of <em>jeofails, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 103. p. 512.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> In <em>Maryland, </em>interest is recoverable of right in actions on bonds or other written contracts for the payment of money on a day certain; but the practice is, <em>to </em>give judgment for it in the form of damages, with a memorandum at the foot of the judgment, that the damages shall be released on payment of the interest. <em>Preston </em>v. <em>West, </em>4 Har. &amp; M\u2019Hen. 70. <em>Gwinn </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>1 Har. <em>&amp; </em>Johns. 574. <em>Newson's adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>7 Har. &amp; Johns. 417.

The cases of <em>Ragsdale </em>v. <em>Batte, </em>and. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Price, are </em>not direct authorities upon the point, and without disturbing them, we may sustain the declaration in this case. I consider the demand of the plaintiffs to be substantially for the debt and interest, they having, at the time the judgment was entered, released the damages and agreed to receive interest in lieu of them. After that agreement, they never could enforce payment of 400 dollars damages, which were equivalent to thirty-three years interest, when only three years interest was due at the date of the judgment. Now, this is not the case of a demand <em>reduced </em>by payments or matter <em>ex post facto. </em>The reduction is in the judgment itself, and the plaintiffs never had title to demand more. They therefore properly demanded what was due, and no more. Indeed, it is obvious, that this practice in <em>Maryland </em>has been adopted to enable the plaintiff to recover continuing interest; and though the contrivance seems awkward, we cannot fail to see, that the true meaning of the judgment is that the plaintiffs shall recover their debt with interest till paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The plea of nil <em>debet </em>was, in this case, an improper plea, according to the decision in <em>Clarke's adm'r </em>v. <em>Day, </em>which we are not disposed to disturb, though I do not acquiesce in some of the reasoning of judge <em>Coalter in </em>that case. The court, therefore, erred in receiving the plea, and might very properly at a subsequent time correct that error by setting aside the issue and the plea. It has done this, substantially, by entering a judgment as if there had been a demurrer. Perhaps, indeed, we ought to infer that there was one; but even if there were none, the court having done what was right, we cannot reverse its act because it has not done it in the right way; since the mode of doing it has no influence upon the justice of the case. It was said, indeed, that if the plea had been rejected, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>might have pleaded payment, and that he has been taken by surprise. I do not think so. He ought to have pleaded payment at first, or if he did not, still, on the plea of <em>nil debet </em>being overruled, he would have had a right to plead payment. But he offered no such plea. Had be done so, I should have considered it error to refuse it, as the court, by accepting his first plea, had led him reasonably to suppose he might defend himself under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">I am. of opinion, that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>I entirely concur in the opinion of the president. I did not concur in all the reasoning of judge <em>Coalter </em>in <em>Clarke's adm'r </em>v. Day, though I did in the conclusion to which he came, and I said no more. I then entertained the opinion I do now,\u2014that the judgments of our sister states, under the constitution of the <em>U. States </em>and the acts of congress in pursuance thereof, are to be treated as domestic judgments; and that the effect of such judgments in the state from which they came, is a question of law, not a question of fact as in the case of foreign judgments. And I was surprised to hear it argued to the contrary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Brockenbrough and Parker, <em>J. </em>concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
