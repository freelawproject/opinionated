That <em>Dudley </em>afterwards died j and <em>Edward Archer </em>was his administrator. That <em>Spooner </em>had collected in the suit he had prosecuted for <em>Dudley, </em>more than was sufficient to pay <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John </em>the money <em>Dudley </em>had directed him to pay them; but <em>Archer, </em>the administrator, had forbidden the payment. That both parties demanded the money; and <em>Archer </em>threatened to move against him for refusing to pay money collected as an attorney. Being thus exposed to conflicting demands, and being liable to be sued by one or the other party, however he should act, he prayed that the parties should be compelled to interplead, and that the court should decide to whom the money should be paid &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\"><em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John </em>answered, that they had received a note of one <em>John R. Archer </em>for 300 dollars, which not having been paid at maturity, he gave them another note for 500 dollars, which they were to hold as collateral security for the payment of the 300 dollars due on the former note; but the note for 500 dollars was, at its maturity, protested for nonpayment. That afterwards, <em>Dudley </em>entered into a written agreement with <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John, </em>whereby he guarantied the payment of the said debt of 300 dollars. That <em>Dudley </em>represented, that <em>Spooner </em>had claims belonging to him in his hands for collection; and proposed, that he would order <em>Spooner </em>to pay, out of the first money he should collect, the amount thus due from <em>Dudley </em>to <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John. </em>That <em>Booth </em>assenting to this proposal, he and <em>Dudley </em>went together to <em>Spooner, </em>and <em>Dudley </em>directed <em>Spooner </em>to pay <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John </em>the amount in question, out of the first rrioney he should collect; <em>Spooner </em>promised both <em>Dudley </em>and <em>Booth, </em>that he would do so; and <em>Booth, </em>confiding in <em>Dudley </em>and <em>Spooner, </em>did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>viot require a written order. The answer concluded with a prayer, that <em>Spooner </em>should be decreed to pay the money in question to <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATJ\"><em>Archer, </em>the administrator of <em>Dudley, </em>answered, that he was ignorant of all the facts alleged in the bill, and especially of the alleged order or transfer by <em>Dudley </em>of the money to be collected by <em>Spooner </em>to <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John. </em>He said, it nowise appeared, that <em>Dudley </em>was under any kind of obligation to pay <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John </em>the money due them by <em>John II. Archer: </em>that the conversation between <em>Dudley, Booth </em>and <em>Spooner, </em>granting that such conversation did take place as represented, did not amount to an assignment of <em>Dudley\u2019s </em>funds in <em>Spooner\u2019s </em>hands to <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John: </em>and that, notwithstanding that conversation, he as the administrator of <em>Dudley </em>was entitled to the whole amount collected by <em>Spooner.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-7\"><em>Dudley\u2019s </em>guaranty mentioned in the answer of <em>Beers, Booth SfSt. John, </em>was exhibited, and was in these words: \u201c I hereby guaranty to Beers, <em>Booth Sf Si. John </em>300 dollars due to them by J. <em>R. Archer, </em>and on which they <em>{B. B. Sf St. J.) </em>hold <em>R. P. Archer\u2019s </em>note in favour of <em>W. B. Giles, </em>and by him indorsed and by J. <em>R. Archer, </em>dated 20th May 1828, at 60 days, for 500 dollars, and which was protested when due, and now remains unpaid. And should <em>B. B. Sf St. J. </em>not be able to collect their money (300 dollars and interest) out of said note, I hereby bind myself to pay the same in twelve months from this date. <em>Petersburg, </em>22nd October 1828. (Signed) <em>Joseph Dudley.\u201d </em>What was the consideration on which <em>Dudley </em>gave this guaranty, was not stated in the answer, and nowise appeared; and how he was implicated in the protested notes therein mentioned, or at all connected with that transaction, was left wholly unexplained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-12\">The cause was heard, by consent, on the bill, the answers, and <em>Dudley\u2019s </em>contract of guaranty: and the court decreed, that <em>Spooner </em>should pay the money he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>had collected to <em>Archer, </em>the administrator of <em>Dudley; </em>an&lt;^\u2019as ^ aPPeared that this suit was brought by <em>Spooner, </em>in consequence of the demand of the money of him by <em>Beers, Booth &amp;f St. John, </em>the court also decreed that <em>they </em>should pay <em>Archer </em>his costs of suit. <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John </em>applied by petition to this court for an <em>appeal; </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-4\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Allison </em>for the appellants, and <em>Macfarland </em>for the appellee <em>Archer,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIK\">upon two questions; 1. whether the decree was right in directing the money to be paid to <em>Archer; </em>and <em>2. </em>whether it was right in giving <em>Archer </em>his costs against <em>Beers, Booth 8f St. John </em>?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AoG\">There is no evidence in this case, but <em>Dudley\u2019s </em>contract of guaranty; for as to the bill of interpleader, which it was contended was evidence, there is no pretence for so considering it. The case then is clearly against the claimants, <em>Beers, Booth Sf St. John, </em>since the answer of <em>Dudley\u2019s </em>administrator admits nothing. More need not be said: yet I will add, that taking the facts to be as stated in the answer of <em>Beers, Booth &amp;f St. John, </em>they had no title to recover. For the guaranty itself appearing to be without consideration, and having been subsequent to the contraction of the debt, and without any promise of extended credit, it was void, and <em>Dudley </em>was <em>under no </em>obligation to fulfil the engagement it implied. The guaranty may, therefore, be thrown out of the <em>case; </em>and then it is the naked case of a man directing another <em>verbally </em>to pay the debt of a third person out of his funds, without consideration. Such direction is void; and though, if complied with before countermand, the party could not complain, yet it may be countermanded at any time. Had <em>Spooner </em>paid over the money to <em>Beers, Booth f St. John, </em>or had he so far bound himself to them in consequence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>order, as to be irrevocably fixed for the debt to them, the payment would have been valid against <em>Dudley. </em>But having never paid, or bound himself to pay, <em>Dudley </em>had in his lifetime, and his administrator now has, full power to retract.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">If <em>Dudley </em>had been <em>bound </em>for the debt, and had directed <em>Spooner </em>to pay, there would be more reason to regard the direction as irrevocable; particularly if <em>Spooner </em>had <em>promised </em>payment to the creditor. Then it would have resembled the case of <em>Sharpless </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>4 Dall. 279. There, the person giving the direction was the <em>actual </em>debtor, and the person receiving it made an express promise to apply the fund as directed: here, the party was no debtor, and there was no promise. There, the court held, that the debtor had made an appropriation of his funds to pay his debts to his creditors, which appropriation he could not revoke: here, he directs an appropriation, without consideration, to pay the debt of another, over which direction he had a complete power of revocation, until the money was actually paid. That has never yet been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The other judges concurred. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
