That <em>Shelton </em>executed a deed of conveyance to <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Coleman </em>of his undivided moiety of the land, and <em>Rudd\u2019s </em>wife being an infant at the time, <em>Rudd </em>covenanted with the purchasers for the conveyance of her moiety to them when she should attain to full age. That <em>Coleman </em>paid the moiety of <em>the </em>purchase money due to <em>Rudd; </em>and <em>Rudd\u2019s </em>wife having attained to full age after the death of both <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Coleman, </em>a deed was execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ted by <em>Rudd </em>and wife to <em>Russell </em>the curator of <em>Wilson, ** . </em>and <em>Shepherd </em>the executor of <em>Coleman, </em>conveying her undivided moiety to them. That of the moiety of the / . . <em>a </em>purchase money (1100 dollars) which was due to <em>oriel-ton, Wilson </em>paid him only 625 dollars, leaving 475 dollars still due, for which <em>Wilson </em>agreed to give him his bond and a mortgage of the land to secure the payment, but he died without having executed the bond or mortgage, or paid the debt. That <em>Shelton </em>brought an action at law against <em>Russell </em>the curator of <em>Wilson, </em>for the balance <em>of </em>the purchase <em>money </em>due him ; but being advised, that his acknowledgment of the receipt of the whole consideration, contained in his deed of conveyance of the land to the purchasers, would be an estoppel against his demand at law, he had dismissed that suit. And the bill, without shewing what kind of curator the defendant <em>Russell </em>was, or what authority the order appointing him curator had conferred, prayed a decree against the personal estate of <em>Wilson </em>in the hands of the curator, for the balance of the purchase money due to <em>Shelton, </em>and that the land should, if necessary, be subjected to the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\"><em>Russell, the </em>curator of <em>Wilson, </em>nowise contested his liability in that character, for the debt claimed of the decedent\u2019s estate, to the extent of the personal assets in his hands, if the debt was justly due; but ho earnestly denied the justice of the claim. He relied not only on the acknowledgment of full payment of the consideration contained in the deed executed by <em>Shelton </em>to the purchasers, but on a formal receipt for the whole purchase money subjoined to the deed and signed by him, as conclusive of the fact of payment; and he stated some extrinsic circumstances, which, he insisted, corroborated that written evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">The answer of <em>Shepherd </em>executor of <em>Coleman </em>averred the full payment by his testator to <em>Rudd, </em>of the half of the purchase money due to him for his wife\u2019s moiety of the land, which <em>Coleman </em>had undertaken to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The order appointing <em>Russell </em>curator of the estate of <em>Wilson, </em>was not exhibited; nor did it appear in any way, what was the nature of that appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-3\">The deed executed by <em>Rudd </em>and wife to <em>Russell </em>the curator of <em>Wilson, </em>and <em>Shepherd </em>the executor of <em>Coleman, </em>and the deed of <em>Shelton </em>to <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Coleman, </em>were exhibited. The latter contained the acknowledgment of the payment of the purchase money due to <em>Shelton, </em>and there was subjoined to it <em>Shelton\u2019s </em>receipt in full for the same, as stated in the answer of the defendant <em>Russell.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-4\">But there was full and clear proof, that in fact only the sum of 625 dollars was paid by <em>Wilson </em>to <em>Shelton, </em>and that <em>Wilson, </em>when he received <em>Shelton\u2019s </em>deed with the receipt thereto subjoined, agreed to give him his bond for the balance of the purchase money yet due to him, and a mortgage of the land to secure the payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">The plaintiff dying pending the suit, it was revived in the name of his administrator.

That such a bill could not be maintained against a mere curator of a decedent\u2019s estate, such as (for aught that appeared in the record) <em>Russell </em>was ; <em>Wynn\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Wynn\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>8 Leigh 264.\u20142. That the heirs and administrator of <em>Wilson, </em>as well as the heirs or devisees and executor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Coleman, </em>were proper and necessary parties. 3. That the formal receipt of <em>Shelton </em>for the whole purchase money from <em>Wilson, </em>subjoined to his deed, shewed \u201c \u201c that the acknowledgment of payment in the deed itself was not merely forma], and that this concluded <em>Shelton </em>in equity, as well as at law, from alleging that he had not received the purchase money. 4. That the deed made by <em>Rudd and wife </em>to the curator of <em>Wilson </em>and the executor of <em>Coleman </em>was nugatory; and the court, in all <em>events, ought not to </em>have decreed the payment of the purchase money, till the title of <em>Rudd and wife </em>was conveyed to the heirs of the purchasers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\"><em>Daniel </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhP\">answered, 1. That this case was distinguishable from that of <em>Wynn\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Wynn\u2019s aim\u2019rs. </em>There it appeared, that the curator had been appointed under the 24th section of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. p. 380. merely to collect and preserve the goods of the decedent, during the pendency of a contest for the administration, and the objection to the proceeding against the curator was presented by the pleadings. Here, the curator, while he controverted the claim upon its merits, nowise denied his responsibility in that character, to the extent of the decedent\u2019s estate in his hands, if the debt was justly due; and as a curator appointed under the 42nd section of the statute (Id. p. 386.) was liable to the suits of creditors in like manner as an administrator-, this court ought to regard the defendant in this case, as such a curator liable to be sued. 2. That as <em>Coleman </em>had paid all he was bound to pay, and as the curator of <em>Wilson </em>had assets in his hands to pay the debt, and those assets were primarily liable for it, the objection for want of parties was merely formal and immaterial. 3. That the proof was full and clear, that the purchase money due to <em>Shelton </em>had not been <em>paid; </em>and as to the alleged estoppel, though it concluded the plaintiff at law, it could not bar him of relief in equity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>Willes 9. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>1 Salk. 285. <em>Gillespie and wife </em>v. <em>Moon, 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 585. 596. 4. That <em>Shelton </em>having executed a conveyance of his . . , , <em>. , </em>moiety, was entitled to payment ol the purchase money due to him, which <em>Wilson </em>had agreed to pay him, and to a lien on <em>Wilson's </em>share of the land; and it was incumbent on the heirs of the purchasers to procure from <em>Rudd </em>and wife a proper conveyance of her moiety. That was their lookout, not <em>Shelton's.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-8\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Afvx\">The decree is erroneous in decreeing against the appellant as curator of the estate of <em>Wilson, </em>though it nowise appears, either from the allegations of the bill or the facts stated in the record, that he was such a curator as is by law liable to be sued or capable of defending the estate of the decedent. It is also er- ' roneous in decreeing payment of the purchase money of the land, when no proper title had been made to the heirs of <em>Wilson, </em>to whom, and not to his curator, the property should' have been conveyed. The heirs of <em>Wilson, </em>together with the heirs and devisees of <em>Coleman, </em>ought to be.made parties. The deed to the curator ought to be vacated and annulled, and a proper conveyance decreed to the heirs of <em>Wilson; </em>upon the execution of which, payment of the balance of the purchase money should be decreed against <em>Wilson's </em>personal representative, with liberty to resort to the land, if the decree against the personal representative <em>should </em>be unavailing. The decree is, therefore, to be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded to the circuit superiour court, to be proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
