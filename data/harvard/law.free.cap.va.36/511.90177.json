Code, ch. 111. ^ 53. p. 4:33.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The objection is, that it is not a sealed <em>instrument; </em>and by the act it is only made lawful \u201c for any person, by his or her last will and testament, or by any other instrument in writing, under his or her hand and <em>seal, </em>attested and proved in the county or corporation court by two witnesses, or acknowledged by the party in the court of the county where he or she resides, to emancipate and set free his or her slaves.\u201d This act, it is conceded, must be strictly complied with, and to effect emancipation, the instrument must be under the <em>seal </em>of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">That under which the plaintiffs in error claim, is in the common form of deeds of emancipation, beginning \u201cKnow all men by these presents,\u201d and signed by <em>Edmund Edrington, </em>with a scroll annexed, in which the word <em>seal </em>is written. It is subscribed by two witnesses, who certify that it was signed, <em>sealed </em>and acknowledged in <em>their </em>presence, and upon their evidence it was duly admitted to record; but it conclues, \u201c In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my <em>hand </em>this 21st day of October 1817,\u201d without saying, <em>in the body of the instrument, </em>any thing about a <em>seal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">If the instrument, having a scroll to it, had been acknowledged in court by the party (as the act allows) instead of being proved by the witnesses, I think there could have been little question that it would have been a sufficient recognition of the scroll as a seal, to give it the force and obligation of a sealed instrument. All that is required by the common law, or by our act of assembly, is, that the impression in the one case, or the scroll in the other, should be added with <em>intent to seal; </em>and if the party shall acknowledge before the court an instrument having a scroll, as his act and deed, nothing more can be required. The act of 1788, which our courts have decided to be in affirmance of <em>the common law of Virginia (Jones &amp; Temple v. Logwood, </em>1 Wash. 42. <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Mackay, 2 </em>Leigh 488.) declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>&lt;&lt; any instrument to which the person making the same shall affix a scroll <em>by way of seal, </em>shall be adjudged and holden to be of the same force and obligation as if it were actually sealed.\u201d It would be in derogation of that act, to decide that a scroll, affixed with the view of perfecting an instrument <em>required by law to be under seal, </em>and acknowledged by the party in court with the intent of complying with the law, was not a seal, because it was not called such in the body of the instrument ; and it would be equally unreasonable to predicate the same thing of an instrument proved by witnesses who attested the sealing as well as the signing and delivery. The common law does not require that the party should any where in the instrument speak of a seal, but only that it <em>be </em>sealed, and the sealing proved. In Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, a book of the highest authority, it is said (vol. 1. p. 55. Atherly\u2019s edi.) \u201c A deed is good, albeit these words in the close thereof, <em>in cujus rei testimonium sigillum meum ayposui, </em>be omitted, and <em>albeit there be no mention made in the same that the deed was sealed and delivered; </em>so in truth it be duly sealed and delivered, and the sealing and delivery be proved.\u201d Here, then, is an express authority that the proof of a seal is sufficient, although no mention is made of it in the body of the instrument; and as scrolls are placed by our law on precisely the same footing as seals, when affixed by way of seal, I take it to be clear law that a scroll may be proved to have been so affixed, without mention of it in the body of the instrument. The true doctrine is stated with great clearness by chief justice <em>Tilghman </em>in the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Glassel, 2 </em>Serg. &amp; Rawle 504. \u201c There are two principles,\u201d says he, \u201c well founded: one, that although in the body of the writing it is said that the parties have set their hands and seals, yet it is not a specialty unless it be actually sealed and delivered: another, that if it be actually sealed and delivered, it is a specialty, although no mention be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>of it in the body of the writing. The fact, and not the assertion, fixes the nature of the instrument.\u201d Thus, to constitute a sealed instrument, there must be a seal or scroll affixed, and some recognition of it in the instrumerit, or some evidence of it <em>aliunde; </em>but it can never be maintained that such evidence, whether by the proof of witnesses or acknowledgment of the party, will not supply the place of such recognition. If the maker says merely, \u201c witness my hand;\u201d if the attestation of the witnesses takes no notice of the sealing; if there are expressions in the instrument not usually found in deeds, but common in simple contracts, as if it commence \u201cFor value received I promise\u201d &amp;c. all these are circumstances (and there may be others) affording strong <em>presumptive </em>evidence that the party did not intend to bind himself by deed, and has not so bound himself. When some of these circumstances exist, and especially when all concur, they may outweigh the <em>mere </em>circumstance of a scroll being annexed, which might be so easily placed there after the execution of the writing ; but this presumption, like any other, may surely be rebutted by proof of the fact that the scroll <em>was </em>annexed <em>by way of seal, </em>and by the maker. Thus, suppose he says at the time, \u201cI affix this scroll as my seal,\u201d or within the scroll he writes the word \u201c seal,\u201d and then delivers it as his deed; I am at a loss to conceive how any court or jury could resist the conclusion that it was a sealed instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">It is said, however, that the decisions in this court are inconsistent with this opinion: and there may be some loose expressions to be found in them, giving countenance to the objection. But when the cases themselves are carefully examined, I am persuaded they will not be found to support it. They are the following: <em>Baird </em>v. Blaigrove, 1 Wash. 170. <em>Austin's adm'x </em>v. <em>Whitlock's ex'ors, </em>1 Munf. 487. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bulloch &amp;c. </em>4 Munf. 442. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Hurt's commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>sioners, 2 </em>Rand. 446. <em>Peasley </em>v. <em>Boatwright, 2 </em>Leigh it i rn 1 195. and a late case not yet reported.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> These cases, except the last, I have critically scanned; and by giving the facts of each, with the opinions of the judges, it would be easy to shew that they do not exclude proof <em>almnde </em>of the sealing of the instrument. But this would swell my opinion to an inconvenient length; and I must content myself with a few general observations respecting their scope and effect. In all of these cases the writings purported to be <em>signed </em>only. They had either no attesting clause, or it was merely in the form \u201c Teste A. B. &amp;c.\u201d without noticing the sealing. In most of them a consideration is expressed; a circumstance unusual, as the judges say, and unnecessary in specialties, but common in simple contracts of the character of those in question. In none of them was the instrument such as the law required to be recorded, or such as it made available only when sealed ; and in not one was there any proof that the instrument had been actually sealed, or scrolls annexed by way of seal. The court had to judge by inspection of the paper, and by inspection only; and the judges say that as in its beginning, conclusion and <em>attestation, </em>no mention is made of its being sealed, and the fact is not otherwise proved, but rendered improbable by other circumstances, the <em>mere </em>accident of a scroll being found was insufficient to shew it was affixed by <em>way of seal, </em>when possibly <em>it might </em>have been added by inadvertence, or afterwards by the holder. Judge <em>Tucker, </em>indeed, in the case of <em>Austin\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Whitlock\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>goes somewhat farther; but his observation was not necessary to its decision, since no evidence <em>dehors </em>the instrument <em>was </em>offered, and the case did not turn upon it. The instrument concluded \u201c witness my hand,\u201d and the attesting witness, who was then dead, had not attested its sealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The case referred to as lately decided and not yet reported may have gone somewhat farther, and (as my judgment in the court below was reversed) I may think, too far. But, as well as I recollect its circumstances, the only one which distinguished it from the previous cases, was the fact that the word <em>seal </em>was written within the scroll. But there were no attesting witnesses, and no proof that the word <em>seal </em>was written by the maker of the note; and as the judges present who decided it assure me there is nothing in their opinions affecting the present question, I do not feel myself trammelled by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Assuming, then, that an instrument of writing, not stated in the body of it to be sealed, may, if it have a scroll, be proved to be a specialty by attesting witnesses to its sealing, notwithstanding it concludes 11 witness my hand,\u201d the next enquiry is, whether it appears by this record, that the scroll was affixed by <em>Edrington </em>as his seal ?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">The attesting clause (which is a part of the instrument necessary under the act of assembly to the validity of the instrument, unless it is acknowledged in court by the grantor) purports that it was <em>sealed </em>as well as delivered; and it was proper that <em>mention </em>should be made, by way of attestation, of such sealing and delivery. Sugden on Powers, p. 237. On the proof by the oaths of these witnesses, the deed was afterwards ordered to be recorded. It could not have been legally admitted to record as an instrument of emancipation, unless the witnesses swore that it was sealed, as well as acknowledged and delivered, in their presence. These circumstances amount at least to <em>jrrima facie </em>evidence that the instrument was duly sealed, and greatly outweigh the single presumption arising from the fact that no notice is taken of it in the body of the writing. A much stronger case is stated by <em>Sugden, </em>in his treatise on powers, p. 236. where he says, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>authority of lord <em>Eldon, </em>that \u201c if, in the attestation of an instrument, it is stated to have been sealed in the presence of witnesses, it will, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed to have been sealed, although no impression appear on the parchment or paper.\u201d Here, besides the attestation, something equivalent in general to an impression in wax does appear; to wit, a <em>scroll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\">Doubtless, <em>Edrington </em>intended to make this instrument of writing conform to the act of assembly. It does so in all other particulars; and the witnesses to it declare that it conformed also in the requirement of sealing. This of itself would distinguish this case from all others which have come under the consideration of the court of appeals, and leaves no doubt on my mind that the court below was right in regarding the instrument as a deed of emancipation duly executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">On the other questions presented by the record, I coucur entirely in the views taken by the president, and in the conclusion to which he arrives on the whole case.</p>\n<author id=\"b542-5\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANk\">The emancipation law enacts that a master may emancipate his slave by an \u201cinstrument in writing, under his hand and seal, attested and proved in the county or corporation court by two witnesses, or acknowledged by the party in the court of the county where he resides.\u201d The statute respecting seals says, \u201c any instrument to which the person making the same shall <em>affix </em>a scroll <em>by way of seal,\u201d </em>shall be adjudged to be a sealed instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The current of decisions in this court is, I think, that the mere annexation of a scroll will not make it a sealed instrument, but if it shall appear, either from the body of the instrument itself, or from the <em>clause of attestation, </em>that the scroll was affixed by way of seal, it is then a sealed instrument. Although that clause is no part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the instrument, yet as it is written on the same paper, if it appear from it that the scroll was affixed by way of seal, it is just as good as if the obligor had in the instrument itself declared it to be a seal. In <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Blaigrove, </em>the agreement had a <em>scroll </em>opposite to each signature: the conclusion was \u201cas witness our <em>hands,\" </em>and the attestation simply \u201c <em>teste;\" </em>neither spoke of the instrument being sealed. President <em>Pendleton </em>said, \u201c The court are not satisfied that this is to be considered as a sealed instrument. It is in no part of it expressed to be sealed. The attestation is the same as in common simple contracts not under seal.\u201d The irresistible inference is, that if the attestation had been in different form\u2014if it had recognized the seal, it would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">That position is also to be deduced from the opinions of the court, and particularly from that of judge <em>Roane, </em>in <em>Austin's adm'x </em>v. <em>Whitlock's ex'ors, </em>1 Munf. 487. I am satisfied that it is in no manner impugned by the case of <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Tate's ex'or, </em>not yet reported.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In the case before us, the instrument is signed by <em>Edrington, </em>and has a scroll annexed to his name, in which is written the word <em>seal; </em>but as he does not, in the body of the instrument, speak of it as a seal, this would not do. But the clause of attestation is not simply \u201c <em>teste,\" </em>as in the two cases above mentioned, but is written thus, \u201c Signed, <em>sealed </em>and acknowledged in presence of us <em>Alcx'r R. St. Clair, Walter U. Tapp;\" </em>and on the evidence of the subscribing witnesses it is admitted to record as an instrument emancipating the slave <em>Lavinia </em>and her four children. It was, then, an instrument under <em>Edrington's </em>hand and <em>seal, </em>as much as if he had placed there a seal of wax.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The next question arises from the <em>proviso, </em>which says that all slaves so emancipated shall be liable to be ta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ken by execution, to satisfy any debt contracted by the person emancipating them, before such emancipation is made.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">Admitting that the debt for which the plaintiffs in error were taken in execution was contracted by <em>Edrington </em>to <em>Paries </em>before the instrument of emancipation was executed (which, however, does not clearly appear from the special verdict) still the question arises whether the afterborn children of the freedwoman can be taken in execution. On the principle that the child follows the condition of the mother, and that the mother became absolutely free by the instrument of emancipation, subject only to the contingent liability of being taken in execution for prior debts, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs in error, being <em>born free, </em>were not liable to be reduced to slavery. On this point I refer to the opinion of the president, in which, and the grounds on which it is founded, I entirely concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">I am of opinion that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b544-5\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4Bt\">I have carefully examined all the reported cases as to scrolls annexed to deeds by way of seals; and I am perfectly satisfied that this case is materially different from all of them. There is a fact in this case, which is not to be found in any of the former cases. In the attestation by the subscribing witnesses, they expressly state that the instrument was signed, <em>sealed </em>and acknowledged in their <em>presence; </em>and, as I understand the record, they prove the same thing on o\u00e1th before the court. The act of assembly gives validity to scrolls annexed by way of seal, without specifying the manner in which such annexation shall be proved. It does not require it to be recognized in the body of the deed. Here it is stated by the subscribing witnesses in their attestation, and is moreover proved by their oaths. I am clearly of opinion that the instrument is a good deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The case of <em>Maria &amp;c. v. Surbaugh, 2 </em>Rand. <em>228. is, </em>in my opinion, conclusive of this case; and 1 have nothing to add to the luminous exposition of it, made by the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-10\"> <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Tate\u2019s ex\u2019or, 7 </em>Leigh 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-13\"> Reported 7 Leigh 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b545-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ako\">I shall say nothing on the first point in this case, which has been so satisfactorily disposed of by my brother <em>Parker, </em>except to declare my concurrence with him in the result to which he has come.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Taking the instrument of emancipation, then, in this case, to be a good deed, we are brought to the enquiry whether the children of the mother born after the execution of the deed are subject to the creditor\u2019s execution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">And here let me say at once, that this case must be ruled by the act of assembly, and brought within the operation of the proviso, or the creditor must fail. The case of <em>Woodley </em>v. <em>Abby, 5 </em>Call 336. decided by a divided court, and <em>standing altogether </em>alone, does not form so imperative a rule as to compel us to embrace it with all its consequences. If these cases of emancipation are to be brought within the rules of law as to fraudulent alienations, then emancipated slaves are not only liable to the subsisting debts of the emancipator, but if he was in embarrassed circumstances, they would be chargeable, by a fishing bill, for prospective debts also. I cannot think that such a construction would be obedient to a statute, whose emphatic terms declared that the slave emancipated under it should be as free, to all intents and purposes, as if emancipated by the act itself. Emancipation is not strictly a <em>gift oi property. </em>It is the exoneration of a human being from the bonds which our institutions have fastened upon him, and which the beneficence of our times has authorized the master to remove. Still less can I look upon it as a gift without consideration. The considerations mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ving to the act are of the gravest character, and but for the proviso in the statute, I should consider the emancipated slave as forever discharged from the credilor\u2019s demand, at least where it has not assumed the character of a direct lien. I shall therefore proceed to consider the case under the law as it now stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\">First, let us see what is the immediate effect of the whole statute upon the condition of the slave. And here it is clear that by the deed of emancipation he is <em>instantly </em>emancipated and set free; he is, <em>upon its execution, </em>entirely and fully discharged from servitude, and \u201c enjoys as full freedom as if he had been particularly named in the act.\u201d He is entitled immediately to a copy of the instrument of his emancipation\u2019, from, the clerk. He is at once invested with all the rights of a freeman, except those political rights from which, by other laws, every black is excluded. With the protection of his free papers, he may go where he pleases without question. He is at once entitled to acquire and enjoy <em>property. </em>His person is under the protection of the laws, and he has a right to sue for injuries done to person or to property. He may even acquire lands and hold slaves, and will transmit them by inheritance to his children. If charged with a capital of-fence, he is tried like a freeman, and the law throws around him the sa\u00edne protection of a grand jury, and the same right of challenge to his triers, which the white man enjoys. And all this notwithstanding the proviso; of which we need no better evidence than this, that were it otherwise, no free negro could have these privileges who claims his freedom since 1792, inasmuch as all have been subject to the operation of that proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><em>Lavinia, </em>then, upon the execution of this deed, became to all intents and purposes free; subject indeed to be taken by execution for the antecedent debts of her master, but <em>still </em>free. Whatever might be the ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>feet of an execution levied upon her, and a sale under it to satisfy a debt, until such levy and sale she is unquestionably free. If the creditor does not elect to levy the execution upon her, her enjoyment of freedom is not disturbed. If, out of the avails of her labour, or by the aid of others, she can discharge the debt, her freedom cannot be disturbed. If an execution is even levied upon her, yet if she can shew that there is other property to satisfy the debt, it will be held liable <em>(Woodley </em>v. Abby, 5 Call 350.) and she will continue to enjoy her freedom, which never can even be suspended until a sale. For even though there be no other means of satisfying the debt, she would not be sold absolutely, but only for such a length of time as would be necessary to discharge it. <em>Patty </em>v. <em>Colin, 1 </em>Hen. <em>&amp; </em>Munf. 519. What would be her state during that time, has not been settled by any adjudicated case. But 1 should humbly apprehend that in such a case, at least, as that of a temporary sale, though the purchaser would exercise over her the rights of a master, she would not be considered as a slave. If she were so considered, all her acquired property would devolve upon her master, and all her other rights as a freewoman would be annihilated, though her term of service might be but for a year, and though she should at any time be enabled to redeem herself by discharging the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Be this as it may, <em>Lavinia </em>became absolutely free upon the execution of the deed, subject only to a charge for payment of debts. She never has had an execution levied on her, and if living, she is now free, and has been so ever since 1817. Her <em>status </em>then has always, since 1817, been that of a freewoman, and so still continues. If then her children follow the condition of the mother, according to the maxim <em>\u201cpartus sequilur ventrem,\u201d </em>her children must be free, as she was free when they were <em>born, </em>and has always continued free since, and still so continues, if living. If it be otherwise, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>leads to this singular consequence, that her emancipation is perfected by the sale of them; it is consummated forever (provided there be no further debt) by the satisfaction of this execution by the sale and perpetual servitude of her <em>children. </em>She who was born a slave, and expressly subjected to the debt, is made free; and those who were born free, and not expressly subjected by the act, are made slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">But it is said that the qualification attached to the emancipation of <em>Lavinia, </em>of liability to execution, extended to those who were born afterwards in her stale of freedom. I think not. We should not extend the proviso of the statute to those whom it does not expressly embrace, nor should we adopt a principle in direct conflict with what is now the well established ' law of the land. In <em>Maria &amp;c. v. Surbaugh, 2 </em>Rand. 228. this court decided that the condition of the child was to be determined by the existing condition of the mother at the time of its birth, without regard to any changes in that condition by any possible future event. It decided that a child born in the actual <em>status </em>of slavery of the mother was absolutely a slave for life, although the day after its birth the mother\u2019s enjoyment of her freedom accrued under a deed of long anteriour date. If then the child can derive no advantage from the certain prospective freedom of the mother, shall he be prejudiced, on the other hand, by the <em>uncertain contingency </em>of her subsequent reduction to slavery? If we mete out equal and impartial justice to all, we cannot affect the child by a possible change of <em>status </em>in one direction, when we deny him the benefit of a certain change in another. We cannot refuse to consider him as following the <em>status </em>of his mother at the time of his birth, when he will thereby become free, since we hold him to that <em>status </em>by which he is made a slave. Accordingly, we find judge <em>Green </em>declaring in <em>Maria &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Surbaugh </em>(and <em>judge Cabell </em>concurred) \u201c that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>civil state of the children, with all its consequences, is determined by the civil state of the mother <em>at the time of their birth, </em>without regard to the present obligation of a free woman to serve, or the present right of a slave to be free, thereafter. The sole enquiry is whether, at the time of the birth of the children, the mother be <em>in fact </em>slave or free, <em>without regard to what may be her future state.\u201d </em>And judge <em>Brooke </em>observes that \u201cthe rule that children shall be bond or free according to the condition of the mother, imports the <em>condition at the time of the birth, </em>in exclusion of any future right to libertyand by consequence (I will add) in exclusion of any future obligation to servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">These views might be much enlarged and illustrated; but 1 shall content myself with what has been said, as presenting the reasons upon which 1 am clearly of opinion to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
