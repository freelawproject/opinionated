It is my will and desire that the said <em>Jane Ewell </em>shall have the above mentioned negroes free from any control of her husband <em>Alfred Ewell </em>in any wise whatsoever. And for this purpose do I appoint <em>James E. Heath, </em>attorney at law, as a trustee for the management of the said property for the benefit of the said <em>Jane Ewell </em>and her heirs.\u201d The will was duly recorded, and <em>Heath </em>acted as trustee under it, until <em>James P. Strother </em>was substituted for him. This substitution was by virtue of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>decree of the superiour court of chancery holden at <em>Fredericksburg. </em>The terms of the decree were complied with by <em>Strother, </em>and he received possession of the negroes and their increase from <em>Heath. </em>On the 2Sth of September 1828, <em>Strother </em>(who then resided in <em>Russell </em>county, and who had the slaves in his possession in that county) with the consent and approbation of <em>Jane Ewell, </em>permitted <em>Benjamin Plummer, </em>who had intermarried with <em>Maria Antoinette, </em>a daughter of the said <em>Jane Ewell, </em>and who resided in the county of <em>Prince William, </em>to take <em>Eliza, </em>a daughter of the slave <em>Sucky </em>mentioned in the will, upon condition that <em>Plummer </em>should, at his own expense, return her to <em>Strother, </em>with her children, if she should have any, whenever demanded. <em>Eliza, </em>at this time, had no children. <em>Plummer, </em>upon taking her on the day mentioned, carried her to his residence in the county of <em>Prince William, </em>where he kept her until the 5th of August 1833, on which day he sold her and two children of hers, born after the said 28th of September 1S28, to a negro trader by the name of <em>Daniel. </em>The negro trader immediately removed <em>Eliza </em>and her children out of the state of <em>Virginia, </em>to <em>Alexandria </em>in the district of <em>Columbia, </em>a distance from <em>Plummer's </em>residence of 12 or 15 miles, and placed them in the bands of his agent <em>James M'Daniel, </em>who took them to <em>Richmond </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>and there sold them and another slave to <em>John L. Lightfoot </em>on the 7th of September 1833, for the sum of 625 dollars. <em>Lightfoot </em>had possession of <em>Eliza </em>and her children from the time of his purchase until the 15th of November 1833, when <em>Strother </em>took possession of them in the county of <em>Smyth, </em>while <em>Lightfoot </em>was in the act of removing them out of the state through that county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">On the 17th of November 1835, an action of detinue was commenced in the circuit court of <em>Smyth </em>county, by <em>Lightfoot </em>against <em>Strother, </em>to recover <em>Eliza </em>and her children. The general issue was pleaded. And at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>trial, the jury returned a special verdict, finding the facts before mentioned. It found also the following additional facts: That about the first of August 1833, <em>Strother, </em>having heard that <em>Plummer </em>was not doing well, and was not likely to continue to be a safe person to trust with the possession of <em>Eliza </em>and her children, wrote to <em>Jesse Weems, </em>in the county of <em>Prince William, </em>authorizing and requesting him, as his agent, to take possession of <em>Eliza </em>and her children : that the said authority and request were not received by <em>Weems </em>till the --day of August 183-3, some days after <em>Eliza </em>and her children had been sold to <em>Daniel, </em>and conveyed out of the state by him : and that on <em>Weems\u2019s </em>receiving the request and authority aforesaid, he would forthwith, as the agent of <em>Strother, </em>have demanded <em>Eliza </em>and her children, or taken legal means to recover the possession of them, but for their previous sale to and immediate removal by <em>Daniel.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">The circuit court adjudged the law upon the special verdict to be for the defendant; and a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed to the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-12\"><em>Watson </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-13\">The <em>attorney general </em>and <em>M\u2019 Comas </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-14\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ajb\">It appears by the special verdict in the case, that when <em>Lightfoot </em>purchased from <em>Daniel, </em>neither he nor <em>Plummer </em>the loanee of <em>Strother </em>had been in possession of the slaves in controversy \u201c by the space of five years.\u201d Our act to prevent frauds and perjuries declares, that loans of goods and chattels made or pretended to be made to any person wdth whom, or those claiming under him, possession shall have remained by the space of five years, without demand made and pursued by due process of law on the part of the pretended lender, shall be taken to be fraudulent as to the credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tors and purchasers of the persons <em>so remaining in possession; </em>that is, <em>for five years. </em>But when <em>Lightfoot </em>purchased, the five years had not expired; and so he is not within the words of the act. If he bad been a creditor of <em>Daniel </em>at the date of his purchase, instead of purchasing from him, the possession <em>then </em>existing would not have rendered the loan fraudulent; and by the act, creditors and purchasers are placed upon the same footing. <em>Daniel, </em>the purchaser from the loanee, could never have acquired a title, short of five years adverse possession ; although <em>his </em>creditors, or purchasers under <em>him </em>thereafter,- might connect his adverse with <em>Plummer\u2019s </em>fiduciary possession, for their own protection. The mischief which the act intended to remedy was this, that lenders or pretended lenders could, at common law, set up secret trusts against those who, at the time they purchased, did so upon the strength of a possession which usually gives title to personal property, without any notice to them of its fiduciary character. But if they purchased before the five years expired, there could be no good reason for protecting them, farther than they were already protected by the act of limitations. If, at the time of the purchase, the loan is not considered as fraudulent, it would seem that it ought not to become so by the possession of the person who ought to have enquired into the title, and as to whom it was not fraudulent at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">This view of the question is fully sustained by the case of <em>Auld </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>5 Cranch 361. In that case, the title of <em>Auld, </em>who was a trustee for creditors, was held under persons who had been in possession (connecting the loanee\u2019s possession with that of <em>Jamesson </em>the debtor) for eight years; and yet the supreme court held, that the four years adverse possession of the latter could not be connected with the possession of the loanee for the same period, so as <em>to </em>make the case a fraudulent loan within the <em>Virginia </em>statute. Whether this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>may not, indeed, have gone too far, will remain a question for decision, if ever the point comes before this court. It may be distinguished from the ca,se at bar, in going probably somewhat farther in protecting the rights of an innocent lender, than it is necessary to go here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b479-5\">Brockenbrough, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtFS\">I have struggled hard in this case to maintain the right of the plaintiff in error to the slaves in controversy, because the loanee in this case, and those claiming under him (including <em>Lightfoot) </em>up to the 29th September 1833, and indeed up to the-day of November 1833, have had more than five years possession, without any demand made and pursued by due process of law on the part of <em>Strother </em>the lender, within the five years, and because no declaration of the loan, by deed or will in writing properly recorded, has been made by the said lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">But the language of the statute is too strong to be resisted. The loan of goods and chattels, of which possession shall have remained by the space of five years in the loanee and claimants under him, without demand and suit by the lender within the five years, is fraudulent, not in all cases and as to all persons, but as to certain persons only. It is not fraudulent as to the loanee himselfj nor as to volunteers under him, even though he or they may have had possession for ten years without , the demand of the lender. It is only fraudulent as to \u201c creditors and purchasers of the persons aforesaid <em>so remaining in possession.\u201d </em>These words \u201c so <em>remaining in possession\u201d </em>are especially to be noted, as they refer to the length of the possession of the loanee and claimants under him, from whom the holder has purchased, or of whom he is the creditor. The loanee, or persons claiming under him, must have had possession for five years, to render the loan fraudulent: as to <em>their </em>creditors or purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"AfL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Now, <em>Lightfoot </em>was not such a purchaser as is herein set forth, as to whom the loan shall be deemed fraudulent. He purchased from <em>Daniel, </em>who had purchased from the loanee, at a time when the loanee and <em>Daniel </em>had not had possession by the space of five years. He was not, therefore, a purchaser from one who came within the description just mentioned. Those from whom he purchased had not had the five years possession; and though he himself is a claimant under the loanee, and a purchaser from one claiming under the loanee, yet he cannot add his possession to theirs, because that would not make the possession of those from whom he purchased, a possession of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">It is a hard case on <em>Lightfoot, </em>because he has paid his money without knowing of the loan, and in a case where possession had remained for a long time with the loanee and a claimant under him. It seems still more hard, from the circumstance, that if he had made his purchase only three weeks later, that purchase could not have been disturbed, unless in the mean time the lender had made his demand, and pursued it by due course of law. Yet although it is hard, we may say that it is not the court, but the law, which has produced the hardship. It is only the legislature that can give redress in future cases. It might be well for them to say, that such loans shall be taken to be fraudulent as to all persons except the loanee and volunteers under him; or perhaps still better to say, that all loans of chattels, especially of slaves, <em>shall be </em>void, unless evidenced by deed, duly recorded in a certain time, or by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">But as the matter now stands, I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b480-6\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACz\">I was at first inclined to think that the law was in favour of the plaintiff in error. But a more attentive examination of the act of assembly has perfectly convinced me that the law is otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>This is the case of a contest between the lender of property, and a purchaser under the loanee. The remarks which I may make as to the construction of the act of assembly, will therefore be regarded as applicable to the case of a purchaser, without considering whether they are or are not applicable to the case of a creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Five years had not elapsed after the loan and before the purchase by the plaintiff in error, although they had elapsed before the commencement of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">At common law, no length of possession by the loanee would protect a purchaser from <em>him. </em>This was productive of much mischief; for third persons who had been induced to become purchasers, relying on the possession of the loanee as the indicium of the right of property, were often surprised and defeated by the exhibition of loans, of the previous existence of which they had no knowledge, and no means of obtaining knowledge. It was the object of the statute to remedy this <em>evil. But </em>how does it propose to remedy it? Not by protecting every fair purchaser from a loanee, but those purchasers only who had become such on the faith of five years previous possession by their vendors or those under whom they claimed. The words of the act of assembly are <em>too </em>plain to admit of doubt as to their meaning. After having spoken of a loan made to \u201c any person with whom, or those claiming under him, possession shall have remained by the space of five years,\u201d the act goes on to declare, that the loan <em>\u201c </em>shall be taken, <em>as to the creditors and purchasers of the persons aforesaid, so remaining in possession, </em>to be fraudulent within this act.\u201d It is manifest, therefore, that the possession which this act interposes as a shield to the purchaser, is a possession <em>previous </em>to his purchase. If he relies on his possession subsequent to his purchase, it will be unavailing, unless it be for such a time as will present a bar under the act of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"Aek\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AL86\">By the statute of frauds it is provided, that where a loan is made to any person, with whom, or those claiming under him, possession <em>shall have </em>remained for five years without suit, the same shall be taken, <em>\u201c as to the purchasers from the person aforesaid so remaining in possession, </em>to be fraudulent, and that the absolute property is with the possession, unless &amp;c.\u201d The purchaser, therefore, who would protect himself by this act, must shew that he has purchased <em>from a person with whom, or those claiming under him, </em>five years possession under a loan has remained. <em>Lightfoot </em>cannot do this. The possession of <em>Plummer </em>together with that of <em>Daniel, </em>from whom <em>Lightfoot </em>purchased, falls short of five years by about three weeks. It cannot be pretended that on <em>the day after His purchase, </em>he had title; for on that day, those under whom he claimed had not had five years poss\u00e9ssion. To make up the five years, he must add three weeks of <em>his own </em>possession. But his own possession cannot give him title under <em>this </em>act. His title under it can only arise from five years possession <em>(anteriour to his </em>purchase) of those under whom he claims. If there has been no such possession', he has no title. Were it otherwise, it would follow that if a slave be lent to A. who holds him under the loan only a month, and sells him to B. who holds him for four years and eleven months, his title will become good by wrong,\u2014 by his own continued possession to the prejudice and ad\u2019versary to the rights of the lender; and this too, although his title was good for nothing the day after his purchase. This cannot be. He may, indeed, acquire title under the statute of limitations, if the possession continues adversarily for five years in himself or in those under whom he claims. But under the statute of frauds he can acquire no title, unless those under whom he claims have had full five years possession <em>anteriour to his purchase. </em>He cannot weld the two statutes together, or eke out, with his own adversary possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the possession of those tinder whom he claims. In this case, <em>Lightfoot </em>having purchased within the five years, his title is not good, and judgment was properly rendered against him. I am of opinion that it be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
