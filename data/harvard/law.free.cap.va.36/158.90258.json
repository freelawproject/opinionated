Those words, descriptive of the character in which he sued, may well be taken as surplusage; and the rather, as it is certainly true, that he could not maintain the action upon the <em>ground of property, </em>merely by reason of the authority vested in him as receiver. The case is much less strong than that of <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Nekervis, </em>4 Rand. 359. where the words \u201c cashier of the farmers\u2019 bank of <em>Virginia,\u201d </em>attached to the plaintiff\u2019s name, were considered as surplusage. The <em>first </em>count, therefore, is good. The <em>second </em>count declares on the plaintiff's <em>possession </em>as a <em>fiduciary: </em>and this count also is good. For a fiduciary who has possession and is deprived of it, has a right of action against the person detaining; because of his own obligation to restore it to the owner when lawfully demanded. The plaintiff', in this case, was a bailee liable to the court, or to the owner, for the slave of which he had suffered himself to be dispossessed; and, by reason of this liability, he might maintain <em>detinue, </em>to enable him to comply with his own obligations, whether express or implied; 1 Chitt. Plead. 118. 2 Wms. Saund. 47 a. b. c. d. note 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Wyatt, 2 </em>Taunt. 268. It was argued, that this was a misjoinder of action. I do not think so. The plaintiff is the same in both counts; and though he claims the possession on two grounds, first on the ground of the <em>right of property, </em>and next of the <em>mere right of possession, </em>yet on each ground the claim is in his own right; and whether he succeed on one or the other count, the judgment must be precisely the same. Neither count sets forth a <em>claim in auter droit; </em>without which the objection is without foundation. 1 Chitt. Plead. 200. I am of opinion, that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The other judges concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
