Sutton- </em>having been arrested on the writ, and not appearing, judgment was entered against him by default, and a writ of inquiry of damages awarded. At a subsequent term, as the record stated, the parties came <em>hy their attorneys, </em>and (without setting aside the judgment or the writ of inquiry) mutually submitted all matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in difference between them in the case, to the final de- \u2022 \u2022 termination of two arbitrators and such umpire as they should choose in case they should disagree; the arbitrators to proceed <em>ex </em>parte, in case either party should fail to attend, after receiving ten days previous notice of the time and place appointed for the arbitration &amp;c. The arbitrators made and returned an award, in these words: \u201c Pursuant to the annexed order of arbitration from the county court of <em>Caroline </em>to us directed, we have proceeded, at <em>Golansville, </em>agreeably to notice, to make up an award in the case of <em>W. W. Dickinson </em>against <em>J. Sutton, </em>and find a balance due to the said <em>Dickinson </em>plaintiff, from the said <em>Sutton </em>defendant, of 443 dollars, exclusive of costs. Given under our hands &amp;c.\u201d And this award being returned to the court, at its next succeeding quarterly term, the court ordered, that it should be made the judgment of the court; and that the plaintiff' should recover against the defendant the sum of 443 dollars, and his costs of suit. <em>Sutton </em>applied to the circuit court \u00edbr a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which was allowed ; but the circuit court after-wards affirmed the judgment of the county court; and to this judgment of affirmance, a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed to <em>Sutton </em>by a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-7\">The cause was argued here by <em>Stanard </em>for the plaintiff' in error, and <em>Johnson </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7y0\">upon the following objections taken by the former\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-8\">1. That as the defendant had not entered an appearance to the action, he could have no attorney in court; and, if the authority of an attorney at law were a warrant to him, in any case, to submit his client\u2019s cause to arbitration, yet he could only be authorized to make such reference after an appearance in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">2. That as the blank left in the declaration for the damages could only be supplied from the writ, and thus the damages were but 300 dollars, the matters in dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ference in the action, which were the only subject of reference, could not exceed that sum ; and the arbitrators, in awarding a larger sum, exceeded their authority, and so their award was void.
