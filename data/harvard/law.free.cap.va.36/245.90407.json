The legatee <em>Lucy Cross </em>was the wife of <em>Samuel Cross, </em>who had been in possession of the slaves bequeathed to her, for many years before the testator\u2019s death, though whether on a <em>loan </em>or on a <em>gift </em>from the testator, was the disputed question in this cause; and he continued in possession of the ten slaves and their increase during his life. He died intestate in 1805. Immediately after his death, his widow took possession of the whole of the slaves, and continued to exercise entire and undisturbed ownership over them and their previous and subsequent increase (which was very numerous) during her life; and she lived till after the commencement of this suit. <em>Oliver Cross, </em>the eldest son of <em>Samuel Cross, </em>took administration of his estate; and in the inventory and appraisement thereof returned by him to the county court, these slaves were not mentioned; and so far from ever exercising or claiming any ownership over them as part of his father\u2019s estate, he acted for some time as the agent of his mother in the management of them, and thereby admitted the right she claimed in them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-4\">The legatee <em>Lucy Cross </em>had four children; <em>Oliver Cross, </em>who died before his mother, leaving five children ; <em>Catharine, </em>who married <em>Daniel Lyle, </em>and died before her mother, leaving her husband her surviving, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>but <em>not leaving any issue; Thomas Cross, </em>and <em>Elizabeth, </em>the wife of <em>Benjamin Hazelgrove, </em>both of whom are yet living. The mother, acting as tenant for life of the whole of the slaves, and of the increase thereof, bequeatbed to her by the testator <em>John Tinsley\u2019s </em>will, gave the possession of some of them to her son <em>Oliver </em>in his lifetime, of others to her son <em>Thomas, </em>of others to her son in law <em>Hazelgrove, </em>and of two to her other son in law <em>Lyle; </em>and <em>Hazelgrove </em>had sold two of those put in his possession, and iyZe was about to sell one of the two he had received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">In January 1835, <em>Thomas Cross </em>and the five children of <em>Oliver Cross </em>exhibited a bill, in the circuit superiour court of <em>Hanover, </em>against their grandmother <em>Lucy Cross, Hazelgrove </em>and <em>Lyle; </em>wherein, after setting forth the will of the testator <em>John Tinsley, </em>and all the facts above stated, they represented, that by the bequest of the slaves to the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Lucy Cross </em>and to her children after her death, <em>Lucy Cross </em>was, after the death of her <em>husband Samuel Cross, </em>entitled <em>to </em>a life estate in the whole of the slaves and their increase, with remainder to such of her children as should survive her, and the issue of such as should die before her <em>leaving issue, </em>excluding entirely such as should die before her <em>without leaving issue. </em>And then they stated, that <em>Hazelgrove </em>and his wife <em>Elizabeth </em>had as yet no issue, and it was now wholly improbable that she would leave or have any, yet <em>Hazelgrove </em>had already sold two of the slaves which he had received; that though <em>Catharine, </em>the wife of <em>Lyle, </em>bad died before her mother without leaving issue, so that no share of the remainder of the slaves expectant on her mother\u2019s life estate ever vested in her, yet her surviving husband <em>Lyle </em>was about to sell one of the two slaves which he had received ; and that <em>Hazelgrove </em>and <em>Lyle </em>supposed they had, and acted as if they had, the absolute property in the slaves that had been put into their possession, and would probably so dispose of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>as that they would not be forthcoming at the death of the tenant for life, to be divided among the persons who would then be entitled to the remainder, according to the effect of the bequest and executory limitation in the will of the testator <em>John Tinsley </em>contained. Therefore, the bill prayed, that the defendants <em>Uazelgrove </em>and <em>Lyle </em>should be injoined from selling or otherwise disposing of any of the slaves then held by them respectively, and should be compelled to give security to have the slaves now in their possession, forthcoming at the death of the defendant <em>Lucy Cross, </em>for division among the parties who should be then entitled thereto in remainder, and to account for the value of those they had sold; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">The defendants <em>Lucy Cross, Uazelgrove </em>and <em>Lyle, </em>put in a joint answer, in which they denied the title set up by the plaintiffs under the will of the testator <em>John Tinsley: </em>for they alleged, that, shortly after the mar- . riage of that testator\u2019s daughter, the defendant <em>Lucy, </em>with her late husband <em>Samuel Cross, </em>which marriage took place in 1784, the testator gave and delivered, in absolute property, to <em>Samuel Cross, </em>eight of the ten slaves which he afterwards by his will bequeathed to his daughter <em>Lucy, </em>and the other two of the ten were the increase of the <em>eight </em>so <em>given; </em>that <em>under that gift Samuel Cross </em>took and held all the slaves and their increase, claiming them as his own absolute property by title paramount to the bequest in the will of the donor ; and having so held the undisputed possession of the slaves for more than ten years before the death of the testator <em>John Tinsley, </em>the statute of limitations perfected his title to the property: that thus, all the slaves belonged to the estate of <em>Samuel Gross, </em>and were subject to distribution among his widow and children, though they were kept together for the general benefit of the family: that the widow did not choose to claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>her thirds, and have the residue divided, but permitted each child to take and use a portion of the slaves, expecting that at her death they would be equally divided among all her children, including her daughter <em>Catharine Lyle; </em>ten or more of them were put into possession of her son <em>Oliver Cross, </em>of which all but three had been returned after his death ; seven were put into possession of her son <em>Thomas Cross; </em>thirteen weie put into the possession of <em>Ilazelgrove, </em>who married her daughter <em>Elizabeth, </em>and other slaves were put in <em>Ilazelgrovf s </em>possession, as agent of his mother in law; and two slaves had been put into the possession of the defendant <em>Lyle, </em>the husband of the deceased daughter <em>Catharine. </em>The defendant <em>Ilazelgrove </em>admitted, that he had sold two of the slaves he had received. The defendant <em>Lyle </em>denied, that he had sold, or intended to sell, either of the slaves he had received upon his marriage with his deceased wife. And the defendants all insisted, that the slaves in question belonged to the estate of <em>Samuel Cross, </em>and were subject to distribution among all his children, without regard to the executory limitation contained in the will of the testator <em>John Tinsley.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-4\">The defendant <em>Lucy Cross </em>died pending the suit, and it was revived against her administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">The main question in the cause was a question of fact. There was no doubt, that the parent stock of the slaves in question had been in possession of <em>Samuel Cross, </em>for some nine or ten years before the death of his father in law, the testator <em>John Tinsley, </em>having been put into his possession by <em>Tinsley: </em>but the question was, whether they had been delivered by <em>Tinsley </em>to <em>Cross, </em>as a <em>gift </em>to him and his wife ? or only upon a <em>loan, </em>so that the lender might have resumed the possession at pleasure ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">There were several depositions for the plaintiffs, going to prove, that the slaves delivered by <em>Tinsley </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Cross, </em>were delivered to him only on <em>loan, </em>and that mrs\u201e <em>Cross </em>and her eldest son <em>Oliver Cross </em>had often so declared. And in corroboration of that evidence, the plaintiffs relied on the circumstance, that the slaves had not been <em>inventoried </em>as a part of <em>Samuel Cross\u2019s </em>estate, as they would have been if it had not been known, that the title to them was derived from <em>Tinsley\u2019s will, </em>not from a <em>gift </em>made by him in his lifetime. On the other hand, there were the depositions of two witnesses, to prove <em>an absolute gift </em>by <em>Tinsley </em>to <em>Cross, </em>shortly after the marriage of the latter; but it appeared, that one of these witnesses must have been about <em>ten </em>and the other about <em>three </em>years old at the time of the marriage of <em>Cross </em>in 1784, shortly after which the gift was alleged to have been made. To account for the omission to inventory the slaves as part of the estate of <em>Samuel Cross, </em>the defendants shewed the advice of counsel, who (apparently) judging of the title to the slaves from <em>Tinsley\u2019s </em>will alone, advised that these slaves were not to be considered as part of <em>Cross\u2019s </em>estate, and therefore were not to be inserted in the inventory <em>, </em>though this advice was plainly erroneous, since even if the title was derived from <em>Tinsley\u2019s </em>will, the life estate thereby given to <em>Cross\u2019s </em>wife belonged to her husband, and should have been inventoried as part of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">The circuit superiour court was of opinion upon the evidence, that the parent stock of the slaves in question had been originally delivered by <em>Tinsley </em>to <em>Samuel Cross, </em>as a <em>gift, </em>more than five years before <em>Tinsley\u2019s </em>death, whereby <em>Cross </em>acquired a perfect title to them; and therefore, by its decree, the slaves were divided into four parts, and one part allotted to the children of <em>Oliver Cross, </em>one to <em>Thomas Cross, </em>one to <em>Hazelgrove </em>in right of his wife <em>Elizabeth, </em>and one to <em>Lyle </em>in right of his deceased wife <em>Catharine.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">The plaintiffs, children of <em>Oliver Cross, </em>applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-3\"><em>Scott, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b275-4\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOz\">I am of opinion, that the evidence in the cause establishes a <em>loan </em>from <em>Tinsley </em>to <em>Cross, </em>and not a <em>gift; </em>and that, therefore, the slaves in controversy are to be disposed of according to the will of <em>Tinsley. </em>The decree must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<author id=\"b275-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0Vg\">I am of opinion, that the decree in this case should be reversed. The answer states the marriage of <em>Lucy Cross </em>in 1784; and that shortly after the marriage, her father <em>Tinsley </em>gave the slaves in question to her husband, who held them for more than ten years before <em>Tinsley\u2019s </em>death in 1795. Hence the <em>gift, </em>if made at all, was made in 17S4 or 1785, and was therefore void, the statute of 1758 being at that time in force, not modified by the <em>proviso now </em>in the statute book, which was first introduced on the 31st December 1787. See 1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. \u00a7 51. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner\u2019s ex\u2019x, 1 </em>Wash. 139. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>3 Call 85. <em>Taylor ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>4 Call 92. <em>Spiers </em>v. <em>Willison, </em>4 Cranch 398. This is decisive of the question of title; and it is gratifying to place the case upon this ground, instead of resting the proof of a <em>gift </em>alleged to have been made fifty-four years ago, upon the testimony of two witnesses, one of whom was only three years old at the time the gift is alleged to have been made, and the other only ten, and whose memory seems to have been singularly unretentive, except as to the particular fact of this gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">With respect to the length of possession, it could not give title against <em>Tinsley </em>in his lifetime. The possession w'as not adverse, for it was with <em>Tinsley\u2019s </em>assent; and under the circumstances, the transaction not being a <em>gift, </em>must be taken to be a <em>loan, </em>which, after five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>years, would bar the lender as against creditors or purchasers, but could never ripen into a good title against himself in favour of <em>the </em>loanee. To consider <em>Samuel Cross </em>to have been in adverse possession, we must convert him into a wrongdoer, of which there is no evidence, as he confessedly came into possession by right, and without demand and refusal could not have become a <em>tortfeasor; Williams </em>v. <em>Snidow, </em>4 Leigh 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">With these views, it is unnecessary to examine the case farther. I shall only observe, that I think, under all the circumstances, the just inference is, that mrs. <em>Cross </em>held under her father\u2019s will, and did not claim under her husband. I am moreover inclined to think, that as between father and child, possession of a slave is very equivocal evidence of a <em>gift; </em>as temporary loans, particularly of young females, are very usual from a father to a young married daughter; and from mere possession unaccompanied by evidence of gift, there is nothing from which a gift can be more fairly inferred than a loan. In such case, it is the duty of the court to infer the less rather than the greater,\u2014the loan rather than the gift: for if the testimony is <em>satisfied </em>by the inference of a <em>loan, </em>upon what principle can we further infer the fact of a <em>gift </em>which is not required by the evidence in the case ?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I am of opinion, that the decree be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Brooke and Brockenbrough, <em>J. </em>concurred in the opinion of the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Parker, <em>J. </em>merely expressed his opinion, that the decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
