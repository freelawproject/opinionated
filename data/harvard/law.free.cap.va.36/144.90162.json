The receipt was in these words : \u201c August 9th 1819. Received of <em>Thomas Gilliam </em>executor of <em>Jeffrey Gilliam </em>deceased, 385 dollars and 29 cents, on account of the legacy bequeathed to me by the last will and testament of my father <em>Jeffrey Gilliam. </em>It is understood and agreed by the parties here mentioned, that should the above sum of 385 dollars 29 cents, on a fair settlement of said estate, be more than my proportion, the overplus to be returned by me, and on the contrary to receive any additional amount which may be due thereon. (Signed) <em>Edward Gilliam.\u201d </em>The signature of <em>Edward </em>was proved, and indeed admitted to be genuine. And this paper was the only evidence adduced of the alleged payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">On the other band, it was proved, that on the 9th August 1819, the date of the receipt, <em>Thomas Gilliam, </em>the executor was in the state of Tennessee, and <em>Edward Gilliam </em>the legatee was in <em>Virginia; </em>and no attempt was made to prove, that the money was remitted by <em>Thomas Gilliam </em>to <em>Edward, </em>though, had such a remitment been really made, the fact of the remitment, and the manner of it, would probably have been easily susceptible of proof: there was, indeed, no pretence that the money had been remitted from <em>Tennessee </em>to Virginia. It was proved, that <em>Thomas Gilliam </em>left <em>Virginia </em>in July 1818, and returned in the spring of the year 1S20 ; and then, was without money to pay a just debt which he owed to a brother in law. And <em>Edward Gilliam </em>himself being examined as a witness, deposed, that when his brother <em>Thomas </em>returned to <em>Virginia </em>in 1820, he told him, that he had sold his interest in his father\u2019s estate to <em>Pearman; </em>at which <em>Thomas </em>was very much displeased, and insisted, that <em>Edward </em>should nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>give him a receipt in full for his share of the estate; that <em>Edward </em>resisted this demand at first, but at length yielded to the importunity and the influence of his brother, and signed the receipt; that the receipt was in fact given by him in 1820, some months after his assignment to <em>Pearman, </em>and was antedated; and that <em>Thomas </em>had never paid him any thing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">The court ordered an account of the executor\u2019s administration of the estate of the testator <em>Jeffrey Gilliam; </em>and, in stating the account, the commissioner wholly disregarded the alleged payment by the executor to the legatee <em>Edward Gilliam, </em>of 385 dollars 29 cents. His report shewed a balance of 293 dollars with interest, &amp;c. due from the executor to <em>Pearman </em>as assignee of the legatee <em>Edward Gilliam; </em>and a balance of 251 dollars with interest &amp;c. due to the administrator of the other legatee <em>William Gilliam. </em>And the court approving the report, decreed, that <em>Thomas Gilliam </em>the executor, and the defendant <em>Wilcox </em>his surety, should pay those sums to the plaintiff, and to the administrator of <em>William Gilliam, </em>respectively, upon those parties respectively giving the executor the usual refunding bonds. <em>Wilcox </em>appealed from the decree to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-8\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-9\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b171-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKDb\">I am of opinion, that the decree should be affirmed. There is but one point on which I deem it necessary to make a remark: it respects <em>Edward Gilliam\u2019s </em>receipt for his legacy. I think it no evidence against <em>Pearman </em>his assignee, unless it is <em>proved </em>to have been given before the assignment. It cannot prove itself, neither its genuineness nor the truth of the date. The acknowledgments of an assignor that he has been paid his debt are no evidence against the assignee, unless they were made anteriour to the assignment; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>this is equally true, whether his acknowledgment is oral or written. Now a receipt is nothing but a written acknowledgment, and is not evidence against the assignee, unless it is proved to have been given anteriour to the assignment. The proof of this is upon the debtor. It was argued, that the date of the receipt must be taken as the true date, until the contrary is proved. I cannot think so. If it were so, every such paper would prove itself; which cannot be. Moreover, the parties to it know truly when it was given ; the assignee cannot know. The parties to it must, therefore, prove it; since otherwise, howev\u00e9r <em>false </em>and fraudulent it be, it will prove itself to be <em>true, </em>without the possibility of contradiction. Now, in this case, if we take the testimony of <em>Edward Gilliam, </em>the date is proved to be false; and even if we reject it, there is no proof that the date is true. Of course there is no proof, that the acknowledgment of the receipt of the money was made anteriour to the assignment, and it was therefore no evidence against the assignee. Without it, there is no difficulty in affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The other judges concurred. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
