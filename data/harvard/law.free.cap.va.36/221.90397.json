The first was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>brought in June 1823, by the president, directors and company of tiie bank of the <em>U.

States </em>by congress, contained four special and two general counts. 1. The <em>first </em>count set forth a promissory note, dated the ISth April 1820, at the city of <em>Washington, </em>by <em>Richard Cutts </em>to <em>Jackson, </em>for 3600 dollars, payable at the office of discount and deposite of the bank there, sixty days after date, for value received, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>and the indorsements of the note, at the same place and on the day of its date, by <em>Jaclcson </em>to <em>Charles </em>Cutts, and by <em>Charles Cutts </em>to the plaintiffs; and then averred, that when the note became due and payable according to its tenor, namely, on the 21st June 1820, it was duly presented for payment to <em>Richard Cutts, </em>the maker, and payment of the contents then and there duly demanded of him; but <em>Richard Cutts </em>did not; and would not, pay the same to the plaintiffs; of all which <em>Jaclcson </em>then and there had notice; by reason whereof he became liable to pay the said sum of 3600 dollars to the plaintiffs ; and so being liable, in consideration thereof, assumed to pay them the same. 2. The <em>second </em>count, after setting out and describing the note, the making and delivery thereof by <em>Richard Cutts </em>to <em>Jaclcson, </em>and <em>Jackson's </em>indorsement to <em>Charles Cutts, </em>as in the first count,\u2014alleged, that <em>Charles Cutts, </em>being on the ISth April 1820 (the date of the note) in possession of the note at <em>Washington, </em>and being then and there indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of 3600 dollars, in consideration thereof, <em>indorsed, </em>and by indorsing <em>assigned and transferred, </em>the note to the plaintiffs; and then averred, that when the note came to maturity according to its tenor, namely, on the 20th June 1820, <em>Richard Cutts, </em>the maker, failed to make payment of its contents, though thereto requested ; and <em>after </em>the note became due and payable, he became and still was wholly insolvent; by reason whereof <em>Jackson </em>became liable to pay the plaintiffs the said sum of 3600 dollars in the note mentioned, and so being liable, assumed &amp;c. 3. The <em>third </em>count, after setting out and describing the note, and the making and delivery thereof by <em>Richard Cults </em>to <em>Jackson, </em>as in the preceding counts,\u2014alleged, that <em>Jackson, </em>being on the 18th April 1820 (the date of the note) in possession of the note at <em>Washington, </em>and being indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of 3600 dollars, in consideration thereof, then and there <em>assigned </em>and <em>transferred </em>the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>to the plaintiffs, and thereby agreed to make himself ,. , . \u201e responsible lor the payment o\u00ed the contents thereof according to its tenor; and then averred, that <em>Richard Cutts, </em>the maker, failed to pay the contents of the note when it came to maturity, and was, <em>at the time </em>the note came to maturity, and had ever since remained, wholty insolvent, so that, though the plaintiffs had used due diligence to recover the money from him, they had been unable to do so; of all which <em>Jackson </em>had notice; by reason whereof he became liable to pay the plaintiffs the sum of 3600 dollars, and being so liable, in consideration thereof, assumed &amp;c. 4. The <em>fourth </em>count, after setting out and describing the note, and the making and delivery thereof by <em>Richard Cutts </em>to <em>Jackson, </em>as in the other counts,-\u2014alleged the indorsement of the note, at <em>Washington </em>on the day of its date, by <em>Jackson </em>directly to the plaintiffs; and then alleged due presentation of the note at its maturity, and due demand of payment from the maker, and his failure to make payment; of all which <em>Jackson </em>had notice; by reason whereof, and of the statute in such case made and provided, <em>Jackson </em>became liable to pay the plaintiffs the sum of 3600 dollars, and so being liable, in consideration thereof, assumed &amp;c. 5. The <em>fifth </em>count was for 3600 dollars <em>had and received </em>by <em>Jackson </em>to the plaintiffs\u2019 use ; and 6. the <em>sixth </em>was for so much money <em>lent and advanced </em>by them to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\"><em>Jackson </em>died pending the action; and it was revived against his administratrix. She demurred generally to each and every count in the declaration ; and pleaded, 1. the general issue; and 2. the statute of limitations of <em>Maryland, </em>the laws of which state were in force in the city of <em>Washington, </em>where the transaction occurred. And to this <em>second </em>plea, the plaintiffs demurred generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-9\">By consent of parties, the issues of fact were tried by a jury, without decisions being first had on the issues of law, reserving the questions arising on the demurrers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>for consideration and decision after the verdict should be found, together with such questions as should arise 0n the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3j\">The jury returned a special verdict, wherein they foun(j the <em>note </em>of <em>Richa,rd Cutts, </em>mentioned and described in the declaration, <em>in hcec verba, </em>with the indorsements thereof, in blank, by <em>Jackson </em>the payee, and by <em>Charles Cutts. </em>2. That <em>Jackson </em>indorsed the note, in <em>Virginia, for the accommodation of Richard Cutts, </em>the maker. 3. That the note was, on the day of its date, presented at the office of the bank of the <em>U. States </em>at <em>Washington </em>for discount, and was then and there <em>discounted by the plaintiffs for the accommodation of the maker. </em>4. That <em>Jackson received no part of the avails or proceeds of the note. </em>5. That the plaintiffs retained for discount on the note, for the time the same had to run, the sum of 38 dollars 40 cents, and lent to <em>Richard Cutts </em>the sum of 3561 dollars 60 cents upon the note. 6. That by the custom of <em>the bank of the U. States </em>at <em>Washington </em>and of the other banks of the district of <em>Columbia, </em>at the time this note was discounted, payment of a note or bill discounted at any of those banks, could not be demanded until the <em>fourth </em>day after the time limited by the bill or note for the payment thereof; and that the discount retained by the plaintiffs on this note, was computed at the rate of <em>six per centum per annum </em>for <em>sixty four days, </em>according to the custom aforesaid. And 7. that after the said note became due and payable, the plaintiffs used due diligence to recover the amount of the said note from <em>Richard Cutts, </em>the maker, and did not recover from him, or from <em>Charles Cutts, </em>the same or any part thereof. And if the law on this state of facts was for the plaintiffs, then the jury found for them 3600 dollars with interest from the 22nd June 1820; and if the law was for the defendant, then they found for her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-10\">The court held, that each and every count of the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration was good and sufficient, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the defendant\u2019s <em>second </em>plea (of the statute of limitations \u2022 of <em>Maryland) </em>was not a good plea in bar; and therefore, upon the defendant\u2019s demurrers to the declaration, and on the plaintiffs\u2019 demurrer to the defendant\u2019s <em>second </em>plea, the court gave judgment for the plaintiffs. And then the court held that the law upon the facts found in 1 the special verdict, was for the defendant, and gave judgment for the defendant accordingly. From which judgment the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-12\">II. The second suit was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>brought, in the same court and at the same time as the first, by the bank of the <em>Metropolis </em>against <em>Jackson, </em>on a promissory note, dated the 2nd August 1820, for 0600 dollars, payable at the bank of the <em>Metropolis </em>at the city of <em>Washington, </em>sixty days after date, for value received, made by <em>Richard Cutts </em>to <em>Jackson, </em>and indorsed by <em>Jackson, </em>the payee, and then by <em>Charles Cutts, </em>to the <em>bank; </em>which note was indorsed by the indorsers, and discounted by the bank, for the accommodation of <em>Richard Cutts, </em>the maker. The only difference between this case and that of <em>The Bank of the U. States </em>against <em>Jackson, </em>which this court thought worthy of notice, consisted in the single fact, found by the jury in their special verdict, that at the foot of the note on which this action was brought, there was a direction to \u201c credit the drawer,\u201d signed by <em>Jackson </em>with the initials of his name, J. <em>G. J. </em>The circuit court gave judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-13\">The causes were argued here by <em>Stanard </em>for <em>The Bank of the U. States, </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for <em>The Bank of the Metropolis, </em>and by <em>Wyndham Robertson </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\"> These cases would have been reported in their order (in 6th <em>Leigb) </em>among the causes decided at the fall term 1835, but that the principle on which they were decided, was involved in another case, that of <em>Jackson\u2019s administratrix </em>v. <em>The Bank of Marietta, </em>though it was there presented under different circumstances; which was argued at the same term with these, and the court gave judgment in it likewise, but afterwards set aside the judgment, and directed another argument. It was thought best to defer the report of all the cases, till that case should be finally determined. It was not decided till February 1838, and was then decided on a point peculiar <em>to </em>itself: see the report of it, <em>post.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-14\">Brokenbrough, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab5\">First as to the case of <em>The Bank of the U. States </em>against <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>administratrix: the only question I deem it necessary to discuss at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>length, is that arising from the two general counts of ^ declaration, and the finding of the jury. Do the <em>probata </em>agree with the <em>allegata </em>of those two counts ? Does the special verdict support them ?</p>\n<p id=\"A51F\">It is obvious, that the allegation in both those counts, sets f01-[h a debt due from the defendant himself, and a , . promise founded on that debt. Tne charge m the first, is a very different one from that of some other person\u2019s having had and received the money to the use of the plaintiffs, though obtained on the credit of the defendant ; and in the second, it is very different from the charge of the money being lent and advanced, not to the defendant himself, but to a third person at the defendant\u2019s request and on his credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The researches of the counsel have not pointed out a single case or authority sanctioning the doctrine, that the general counts in <em>assumpsit </em>may be supported against a defendant who has not received the money in some shape or other, which he is charged with having received, or against one for money lent to him, or paid and expended for his use, where it was lent, or paid, to a third person on his credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u201c Money lent\u201d (says <em>Chitty) </em>\u201c to the defendant himself, may be recovered under the common count for <em>money lent, </em>though delivered to another person at his request ; but if money be lent to a third person at the defendant\u2019s request, and both be liable to repay the money, the one on the loan, and the other in respect of his collateral engagement, which must be in writing, <em>the count against the latter must be </em>special.\u201d 1 Chitt. Plead. 340. This proposition is supported by <em>Butcher </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>1 Salk. 23. in which it is said, \u201cthe money being lent to <em>J. S. </em>the defendant cannot be obliged as for a debt, and liable to an <em>indebitatus, </em>but to a special <em>assumpsit, </em>as being but collaterally bound by the promise ; for the same money cannot be lent to two. Otherwise, had the money been only delivered to the son at the father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>request, or only <em>had and received </em>by the son at the father\u2019s request; for then the loan had been to the father, See also <em>Marriot </em>v. Lester, 2 Wils. 141.1 Wms. Saund. 211. note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"Axqt\">There has been much discussion in the books, on the question whether <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>would lie for monoy had and received, for money lent, or for money paid, against the drawer or acceptor of a bill of exchange, or against the maker or indorser of a promissory note. So far back as the case of <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Luttrell, </em>1 Call 232. a question arose in this court, whether the indorsee of a bill of exchange could recover against the indorser <em>on the general </em>counts in <em>assumpsit; </em>but the decision of the question was waived, because the evidence submitted would not authorize a recovery on any count. Judge <em>Pendleton, </em>however, said, \u201c that he could not forbear to mention that he did not much like this new practice of <em>general counts, </em>as they tend to surprise the other party, without giving him an opportunity of preparing for a. full defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">We have been referred by the appellants\u2019 counsel to many authorities, but I am much mistaken if they are not all reconcileable with the proposition with which I Erst set out. In the excellent treatise of Bayley on Bills p. 244. (Boston edi. 1826) it is said, \u201c A <em>bill </em>is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of money <em>lent </em>by the payee to the drawer, and a <em>note, </em>of money <em>lent </em>by the payee to the maker, and each, consequently, of money <em>had and received </em>by the drawer or maker to the use of the holder, and of money <em>paid </em>by the holder to the use of the drawer or maker.\u201d He further remarks, \u201cthat an <em>acceptance </em>is also <em>prima facie </em>evidence of money <em>had and received </em>by the acceptor to the use of the holder, and of money <em>paid </em>by the holder to the use of the acceptor; and an <em>indorsement, </em>of money <em>lent </em>by the Indorsee to the indorser.\u201d The two former propositions are proved to be true by the cases of <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>2 Ld. Raym. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>758. and <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>3 Burr. 1516. 1525. In the \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 first case lord <em>Holt, </em>whilst he denied that an action could be brought on a promissory note on the custom of merchants, yet declared, that there was an easy me-namely, a general <em>indebitatus </em>for money lent; and ][orc{ <em>Mansfield, </em>in the other, said\u2014\u201c I do not find it any . .. . <em>-it </em>where disputed, that an action on an <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>generally, for money lent, might be brought on a note payable to one or order.\u201d That the acceptance of a bill is also <em>prima facie </em>evidence of money had and received by the acceptor to the use of the holder, is, I think, proved by the strong cases cited by the appellants\u2019 counsel, <em>Le Sage </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>Forrest\u2019s Rep. 23. <em>Tatlock </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>3 T. R. 174. <em>Vere </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 T. R. 182. to which may be added <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Penniman, </em>1 Mason 306. in which too the .bill was not a negotiable instrument. It may also be readily agreed, that an indorsement is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of money lent by the indorsee to the indorser, and that the action may be maintained by the indorsee at least against the person who indorsed to him. Bayley on Bills, 246. referring to <em>Keesebower </em>v. <em>Tims, </em>before the king\u2019s bench, <em>22 Geo. </em>3. <em>State Bank </em>v. <em>Hurd, 2 </em>Mass. Rep. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">In the case of <em>Waynam </em>v. <em>Bend, </em>1 Camp. 175. lord <em>Ellenborough </em>is reported to have said, that in an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on a promissory note payable <em>to L. Toader </em>or bearer, the plaintiff (who was the holder) could not recover under the money counts, as he was not an original party to the note, and there was no evidence of any value being rec\u00e9ived by the defendant from him. If this be a correct decision, it restricts very much the rule that an indorsee may recover under the money counts against the indorser. There is much reason, however, to doubt its correctness. It is repudiated by the supreme court of <em>New York </em>in the case of <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Crafts, 12 </em>Johns. Rep. 90. where the court, after noticing that it was a <em>nisi prius </em>decision, remarked that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>contradicts several of the preceding decisions; that it . . contradicts <em>Tatlock </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>m which it was decided that an indorsee of a bill of exchange might recover against the acceptor, under the count for money had and received, upon the principle, that the giving such a bill is an agreement between all the parties to appropriate so much property, to be carried to the account of the holder of the bill; and that it contradicts <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>in which it was held, that the action for money had and received might lie in behalf of a bearer on a bill made payable to bearer, though it is very clear, that in that case the bearer was no party to the original bill. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the objections made by the supreme court of <em>New York </em>to the case of <em>Waynam, </em>v. <em>Bend </em>are well founded. The maker of a note, whether payable to bearer or to order, if appearing to be made for value received, must be presumed, till the contrary appears, to have received that value, which constitutes it a debt due from him to any person to whom it may come, in the fair course of trade. By our statute, bills or notes payable to bearer, cannot be made and passed by any individuals; but notes, bonds and bills may be assigned, and by an act passed since the decision in <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>5 Call 16. an assignee may maintain an action against a remote as well as an immediate assignor. If the obligee of a bond, or payee of a note, assigns or indorses it to another person, it is presumed, that the assignor or indorser has received value for it from his immediate assignee or indorsee; and when <em>he </em>becomes the assignor or indorser in his turn, the presumption is, that he has received value from his assignee or indorsee. Although the last assignee, or the holder, has not paid any thing to the obligee or payee, yet he has received the value from the intermediate party, and therefore may fairly be said to have received it to the use of that person who is entitled to the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"A42\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>However, though I am of opinion, that the case of <em>Waynam </em>v. <em>Bend </em>was not well decided, and that the indorsee of a note may maintain <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money had and received against the payee or remote jn(]orser&gt; yet I cannot perceive, that the doctrine has anf applicati\u00b0n to the present case. <em>We </em>must, on the present occasion, not only inquire into the presumptions arising from the making and indorsements of the note, but we must also attend to the facts found. The special verdict states, that the note was presented for discount to the plaintiffs, and was discounted by them for the accommodation of <em>Richard Cutts, </em>the maker thereof; that <em>Jackson </em>the defendant indorsed the note for the accommodation of the said <em>Richard Cutts; </em>and that no part of the avails or proceeds. of the note came to the hands of or was received by <em>Jackson. </em>It farther states, that the indorsement of the note by <em>Jackson </em>was in blank, and was the first indorsement, and that afterwards said note was indorsed by <em>Charles Cutts,. </em>and then delivered <em>to </em>the plaintiffs for, disepunt. Although then the note imports on, its face, that money was lent by <em>Jackson </em>to <em>Richard Cutts, </em>and the first indorsement imports that money was lent by <em>Charles Cutis </em>to <em>Jackson, </em>and the last indorsement, that money was lent by the plaintiffs to <em>Charles Cutts; </em>yet all these presumptions are done away by the facts found. No money was lent by <em>Jackson </em>to <em>Richard. Cutts, </em>nor by <em>Charles Cutts to Jackson, </em>nor - by the bank to <em>Charles Cutts: </em>but, by the consent and contract of all these parties, the note was discounted, and the money lent by the plaintiffs to the maker of the note on his direct responsibility, and the collateral responsibility of the indorsers. The parties contracted through the medium of a note made negotiable and payable at bank. Viewing it as a strictly commercial paper, the liability of <em>Jackson </em>became complete, when, on a failure of the maker to pay it at maturity, it was regularly protested, and notice thereof regularly given to the' in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>dorsers. If we do not consider it in our courts as a . . . strictly commercial paper, on the ground that it was not made negotiable by our statutes, the liability of <em>Jackson </em>depended on a suit being brought against the maker, and due diligence used in the prosecution thereof, and a failure to recover the money by execution; or, on the notorious insolvency of the maker, which would dispense with the suit. In whatever way we view it, still the responsibility of the indorser was not direct, but collateral. The loan was not made to him, nor the money received by him; but it was lent to and received by a third person, in part on his credit. He was therefore liable, in the language of the case cited from <em>Salkeld, </em>\u201c not to an <em>indebitatus, </em>but to a special <em>assumpsit.\" </em>The counsel for the appellants admitted, that if the case decided by the supreme court of the <em>U. States, </em>of <em>Page </em>v. <em>The Bank of Alexandria, 7 </em>Wheat. 35. be law, the general counts would not lie in this case. The full examination which this case has undergone, both at the bar and in our conferences, convinces me, that that case was correctly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">It was admitted, and indeed it seems clear, that the special counts in this declaration are not supported by the proofs. I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Then, as to the case of <em>The Bank of the Metropolis </em>against <em>Jackson's </em>administratrix; the only difference between it and the other, is, that the special verdict, after finding the execution of the note by <em>Richard Cut\u00eds, </em>also finds that <em>Jackson, </em>the payee, wrote at the foot of the note the words \u201c credit the drawer,\u201d signed his name thereto, and then indorsed the note in blank. I do not think that this varies the case. It rather tends to confirm the other finding of the jury. It seems to be equivalent to a declaration by <em>Jackson, </em>that he is not to have credit for the proceeds of the note, and, consequently, not to have the right to receive them; but that the maker is to have credit for the money, and to check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>for it. I think that this judgment should likewise be , affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"ApV\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ASo\">In <em>Israel </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>1 H. Blacks. 241. lord <em>Loughborough, </em>says, \u201c Where a party has not the su^stantial justice of the case on his side, the court will not favour any action he may bring: but where justice is clearly with him, they will, if possible, allow him to maintain the action he has brought, because the only effect of a refusal would be to make him adopt another form of action.\u201d Feeling strongly the correctness of this sentiment, and believing that the justice of the case is clearly with the plaintiffs in these actions, I have struggled hard to convince myself, that we ought to suffer them to maintain their actions, rather than put them to begin this ten years siege anew. But the opinions of my brethren, with the host of authorities and arguments arrayed in their support, have been too powerful for resistance; and I am obliged to say, that it seems better that these parties should suffer by the mistakes of their counsel, than that we should, to save them, break down the settled and established rules of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"AfO\">The four special counts were given up on all hands to be either bad on demurrer, or not sustained by the facts found in the special verdict; and the only point of serious discussion at the bar, was, whether those facts would support the general counts, for money lent, and money had and received. 1 must say, that, judging by the light of authority, they do not. The note was made by <em>Richard Cults </em>payable to <em>Jackson, </em>indorsed first by <em>Jackson, </em>and then by <em>Charles Cutts, </em>and discounted by the bank. <em>Jackson, </em>then, occupies the position of a remote, notan immediate indorser. It seems admitted, that the <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a loan or advance of money, resulting from the indorsement, would, unless destroyed by opposing testimony, support <em>indebitatus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>assumpsit </em>by the indorsee against his immediate indor<em>L J </em>\u00b0 . ser; and the cases seem to extend it to remote indorsers. As to this, I do not undertake to give a positive opinion ; for, whether it be so or not, it cannot influence the decision of tliis case. The special verdict has found, that the note was indorsed, and discounted, for the accommodation of <em>Richard Cults </em>alone, no part of the money coming to the hands of <em>Jackson. </em>This destroys the presumption of loan or advance arising from the indorsement, and leaves the money counts wholly unsupported. I refer, for the positions here taken, to cases cited by my brethren, which 1 have carefully examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">This opinion applies equally to the case of <em>The Bank of the Metropolis </em>against <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>administratrix, as I cannot think, that the words \u201ccredit the drawer\u201d make any difference.</p>\n<author id=\"b257-8\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATe\">I entertain no doubt, that on the facts found by the special verdict, <em>Jackson </em>became liable to the bank, and that that liability would have been enforced in this suit, if it had been asserted by a good declaration suited to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The declaration contains four speciaL counts on the note, and two general counts, for money lent and money had and received. All the special counts on the note are either dearly bad on demurrer, or are unsupported by the facts of the case as found by the jury. They were properly abandoned by the counsel for the appellants. The genera] counts are in themselves free from objection, but the question is whether they will avail the bank on the case stated by the special verdict ?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">I am entirely satisfied, after an examination of the authorities, that general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money lent, paid and advanced, or had and received, will lie for an indorsee against the indorser of a promissory note, and that the mere indorsement is <em>prima facie </em>evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>dence, that the money was lent, or paid and advanced, <em>** </em>^ by the plaintiff to or for the defendant, or that the money was had and received by the defendant to the use of the plaintiff, and that this <em>prima facie </em>evidence carries with it such presumption of the fact, as will entitle P^a'nt^ t0 recc)Ver? unless it shall be rebutted by other proper testimony. These propositions will not be controverted, as between an indorsee and his immediate indorser. I conceive they are equally true, as between an indorsee and a remote indorser. In <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>3 Burr. 1516. the bearer of a note payable \u201c to ship <em>Foo-tune </em>or bearer,\u201d brought an action On it, and inserted a count for money had and received. Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said\u2014\u201cUpon the count for money had and received, the case is clear beyond dispute; for undoubtedly an action for money had and received to the plaintiff\u2019s use, may be brought by the <em>bona fide </em>bearer of a note payable to bearer. There is no case to the contrary. It was certainly money received for the original advancer of it, and if so, it is for the use of the person who has the note as bearer.\u201d I do not think it possible to distinguish that case, in principle, from the case of an action by an indorsee against a remote indorser. <em>For the </em>money was received by the remote indorser for the use of his immediate indorsee, who paid it to him; and if so, it is for the use of any person into whose hands the note may subsequently come, by indorsement from that indorsee.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">But although an indorsement is <em>prima facie </em>evidence as aforesaid, yet it results from the very nature of <em>prima facie </em>evidence, that all the presumptions arising from it may be rebutted and destroyed by other testimony. Thus it may be, that the defendant indorsed the note without any consideration, solely for the benefit and accommodation of his indorsee; or it may be, that the defendant indorsed the note as a mere security for a precedent debt due from the maker to the indorsee, or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>money to be lent by the indorsee to the maker of the <em>J </em>, . noto: and if these facts be proved, the presumptions which would otherwise have arisen from the indorsement, are entirely done away; and the counts for money lent, money paid, or money had and received, are left without support; for it cannot be said with truth, in such a case, that any money was lent or paid to, or received by, the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\"><em>These </em>principles are decisive of the case before us. For it is expressly found by the jury, that the note was indorsed by <em>Jackson </em>and discounted by the bank for the accommodation of the maker, and that <em>Jackson </em>received no part of the proceeds. The case of <em>Page </em>v. <em>The Bank of Alexandria, </em>7 Wheat. 35. is precisely in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The case of <em>Th.e Bank of the Metropolis </em>against <em>Jackson's </em>administratrix cannot be distinguished from that of <em>The Bank of the U. States. </em>It is true, <em>Jackson </em>made a memorandum at the foot of the note, directing that the drawer should have credit for the avails of it: but that can make no difference. Jt is only evidence of what is expressly found by the jury, that the note was indorsed by <em>Jackson, </em>and discounted by the bank, for the accommodation of the maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">I am of opinion, that the judgments in both cases should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b259-14\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aax4\">I assent to the proposition advanced in argument by the counsel of the bank of the <em>U. Stales, </em>that the note in this case, being mere accommodation paper, was never an available negotiable note until it was discounted by the bank. This is so well established by the case of <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Rand. 332. that it is unnecessary to do more than refer to that case for the support of the proposition. Considering the transaction, then, in this light, let us inquire what is to be regarded as the character of the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"Apm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>. The act incorporating the bank of the <em>U. States </em>not having placed notes discounted by it upon the footing 0f bills of exchange, it has been attempted to bring this case within the influence of the doctrines of the <em>Virginia </em>law, as to the assignment of bonds. But it is ob-v-[ous \u00a1;0 me ft cannot be so considered. An assignment implies a subsisting debt, transferred from the obligee to the assignee, for a valuable consideration. It implies an engagement on the part of the assignee, to sue the obligor, and to use due diligence for the recovery of the debt: and it also implies an engagement on the part of the assignor, to refund what he has received, if the money cannot be recovered. In this case, there was no subsisting debt to assign: there was no assignment by <em>Jackson </em>to <em>Charles Cutts, </em>nor value received by <em>Jackson </em>from <em>Charles Cutts, </em>or by <em>Richard Cutts </em>from <em>Jackson; </em>nor did any money or value pass in the transaction at all, until it was advanced to <em>Richard Cutts </em>by the bank on discounting the note. Still less was there an engagement to refund money received on the supposed assignment, for no such liability was contemplated. In short, the case has not a single feature of the ordinary case of the assignment of a subsisting bond or note; and the law, therefore, which applies to such assignments cannot be brought to bear upon it. <em>\u201c </em>In Virginia,\u201d says chief justice <em>Marshall, \u201c </em>the indorser is liable under the implied contract, <em>by the gene?'al U7idersta?iding </em>of <em>the </em>country, which is that he will pay the note, if by due diligence it cannot be obtained from the maker. This condition was not expressed, but it was just, because it was consistent with general usage, and therefore was the real understanding with which such an indorsement was made and received. But in banks, this is probably not the usage, and therefore the same reason does not exist for annexing such a condition to the contract created by indorsement.\u201d In this case, the transaction was with a bank, and there is nothing in it from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>even the most acute could infer, that the parties de- , signed to place this paper on the tooting oi an assigned bond, or that it was the real understanding with which the indorsement wa.s made by the one party, or received by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"ANl\">How, then, is the contract to be considered ? This, after all, is the real question in the case. The court sits for the purpose of enforcing the agreements of parties according to their true intent and meaning, whatever may be the form giyen to such contracts. <em>\u201c </em>If,\u201d continues the chief justice, \u201cbanks are understood to receive notes made negotiable with them, as subject to the law which governs inland bills of exchange, then it would seem reasonable, in the case of notes actually negotiated with them, to imply from the act of indorsement an undertaking conformable to that usage. If the case then shewed, that such was the usage of the bank, and such the understanding under which notes were discounted, this court is not prepared to say, that the undertaking created by the indorsement would not be so fashioned as to give effect to the real intention of the parties.\u201d These opinions seem to me to be founded in good sense and the principles of justice. Let us, then, endeavour to get at. the real understanding of the parties in this case, and then \u201c fashion the undertaking so as to give effect to the real intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">On this subject, I think there can be little room to doubt. The verdict o\u00ed the jury has ascertained, that the note was indorsed by <em>Jackson </em>for the <em>accommodation </em>of <em>Richard Cutts, </em>who received the whole avails of the note, no part of which came to the hands of <em>Jackson. </em>This finding discloses to us the whole character of the transaction, unless we wilfully shut our eyes to what every body else can see, and close our understanding to facts which every intelligent man in the community must know. I should doubt whether it bo even necessary to find, specially, that banks discounting paper of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>this description, receive it as subject to the law which *\u25a0* governs inland bills of exchange, and not as subject to the law which governs the assignment of bonds and notes under the statutes of this commonwealth. That |g a matterj which I had apprehended was as well un^erstood as any other part of the commercial transactions of the country, even as the principles which govern the negotiation of bills of exchange themselves: and I should have found little difficulty in my own mind, in saying at once, that the parties intended to bind themselves as in the case of inland bills; and though they cannot change the law by contracting for the remedy, there is nothing to control their contracting for the responsibilities of drawers and indorsers of bills. The features of this transaction correspond most strictly with those of inland bills negotiated in our banks. <em>Jackson </em>indorsed the paper for <em>R. Cutts\u2019s </em>accommodation,\u2014 to enable him, on the credit of his name, to get a discount at the bank of the <em>U. States. </em>By this indorsement, he intended to make himself responsible for the debt. He did make himself thereby responsible. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Langstaffe, </em>Doug. 514. <em>Violet </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>5 Cranch 142. 4 Mass. Rep. 45. 2 Wash. 164. The only question remains,\u2014in what manner and on what terms was he to be responsible ? We have already seen, that the responsibility could not be that which arises in the case of assignment of subsisting debts, as there is no one feature of such assignment here. We must, therefore, consider him either in the light of a principal bound at all events, whether <em>R. Cutts, </em>the drawer, was solvent or insolvent, and whether the due demand had been made of him or not; or we must look upon him merely as a guarantor of the note, in like manner as the indorser of an inland bill of exchange. I do not think the former could have been \u201cthe real understanding and intention of the parties.\u201d We cannot wink so hard as not to see that such indorsement is neither made nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>received, in any other light than as a collateral under- <em>** </em>taking on the part of the indorsers, to be responsible in succession (4 Rand. 553. 562.) for the amount of the note, in ease it could not be obtained upon due demand from the maker. In this light, at least, it clearly appears to my mind.</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">In this case, however, it will be unnecessary, if I am right upon another point, to take upon us to decide upon the character of this contract, and its analogy to bills of exchange. I am satisfied the judgment must be affirmed, and the plaintiffs turned around to a new action: and if the action be renewed, a special finding may be introduced as to the usages of the bank, which will leave no doubt about the light in which the transaction is to be viewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The four special counts I understood to be abandoned, and very properly, for they are either defective in themselves, or do not fit the facts found by the verdict. Had the pleader been content to set forth those facts simply as they occurred, he could not have failed to draw a good declaration. But in attempting to mould the transaction into a technical form, he has unfortunately altogether.failed. It remains, then, only to inquire, whether the action can be sustained on the general counts. I am sorry to say, 1 think it cannot. Wo principle is better established, or upon a sounder foundation, than this\u2014\u201c that he who is chargeable upon a collateral undertaking, and not for his own debt, must be sued upon his special contract.\u201d 1 Chitt. Plead. 339. <em>Indebitatus assumpsit </em>does not lie against him, for he is not indebted, though he has made himself liable. He is responsible only upon his express engagement, and not upon an implied contract. That express engagement must be shewn to be complied with on the part of his adversary; and if he cannot be rendered liable upon the special counts because of a defect in the plaintiff's case, the plaintiff will not be allowed to go into evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>dence on the money counts. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>3 Esp. Rep. 155. in note. Chitt. on Bills 206. in note. This is in perfect consistency with the established principles in analogous cases, which refuse to the party leave to proceed on the general counts, where a special agreement is proVed, but different from that declared on.</p>\n<p id=\"AzK\">. It is unnecessary to bestow any separate attention on the case of <em>The Bank of the Metropolis </em>against <em>Jackson's </em>administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"AbT\">Both judgments are to be affirmed\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
