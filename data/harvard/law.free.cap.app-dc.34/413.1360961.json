Appellant\u2019s mark herein, however, is \u201cWm. A. Rogers A. I.,\u201d followed by a horseshoe inclosing the letter \u201cR.\u201d Appellee contends that this mark is deceptively similar to its marks \u201cWm. Rogers Mfg. Co.\u201d and \u201cWm Rogers &amp; Son.\u201d We think the accessories employed by appellant in its use of the word \u201cRogers\u201d reasonably differentiate its mark from appellee\u2019s. William A. Rogers, as appears in case'No. 585,, was the predecessor of appellant, and is now its manager. The use, therefore, of the mark herein involved is not without reason. The goods sold under such mark would probably be known as the \u201cHorseshoe Brand.\u201d At all events, the mark in its entirety is not readily to be confused with the marks of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">The decision is reversed, and the clerk will certify this opinion as by law required. <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
