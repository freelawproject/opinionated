The defendants have cross-appealed to contest the award of attorney\u2019s fees made to the plaintiffs and to seek an award of attorney\u2019s fees for themselves. Finding both appeals to be without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">As the district court held, the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>City of Madison, Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, </em>429 U.S. 167, 97 S.Ct. 421, 50 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976), is misplaced because the defendant Board of Regents has not opened its meetings, either partially or completely, to the general public. Consequently, the Board\u2019s rational procedural policy violates neither the First Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">As to the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs, the district court found that the plaintiffs obtained substantial voluntary relief as <em>a direct result of their lawsuit. </em>Consequently, the award of attorney\u2019s fees was proper. <em>Criterion Club of Albany v. Board of Commissioners of Dougherty County, </em>594 F.2d 118 (5th Cir. 1979). As to the defendants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees, they made no such request in the trial court. Further, such an award would be inappropriate since the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was not frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. <em>See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. E. E. O. C., </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">AFFIRMED on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion, 491 F.Supp. 138 (M.D.Ga. 1979), and the district court\u2019s order of October 26, 1979 (CA 78-69-ATH).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
