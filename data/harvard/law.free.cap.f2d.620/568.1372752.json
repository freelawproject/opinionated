Towry\u2019s injuries was conditioned upon his not seeking judicial review of the award. We have been informed by letter from the Acting Chief of the Claims and Tort Litigation Staff of the Office of the Judge Advocate General that the compensation award to which the Secretary of the Air Force determined Col. Towry was entitled is still open, and that Col. Towry may accept the tendered amount in satisfaction of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
