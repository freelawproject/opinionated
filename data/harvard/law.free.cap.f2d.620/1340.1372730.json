Margaret and Anna Koke appeal from a summary judgment dismissing their two-count complaint with prejudice. Count I alleged that Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. and Kingsley 0. Wright, Sr., a vice-president of that brokerage firm, violated \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j, Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and \u00a7 17 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count II alleged common-law fraud under pendent jurisdiction. In granting summary judgment, the District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that both counts were barred by the two-year statute of limitations provided by the Missouri Uniform Securities Act, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 409.411(e) (1969). The District Court had before it a substantial amount of discovery, including two depositions of Margaret Koke, her affidavit, and several exhibits. We affirm the dismissal of Count I; as to Count II, we vacate the ruling below and remand with instructions to dismiss the complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-18\">1. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-19\">We first summarize the facts before the Court below. Margaret Koke works for a small St. Louis business known as Southside Service Company, a home appliance repair service. She started as a call clerk, became a bookkeeper in 1941, and later assumed the role of manager in addition to the bookkeeping duties. In these capacities, she pays the bills, figures the payroll, sees to it that servicemen do their jobs, and makes sure that parts are properly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-20\">Southside Service Company was owned by Joseph E. Loisseau until 1969. Margaret invested in Associated Fund in 1954 or 1955 through a friend of Loisseau\u2019s. She also purchased government savings bonds from time to time. She was not an experienced investor, although she had accumulated, mostly through thrift, a rather sizeable estate. Margaret and her mother, Anna Koke, lived together in St. Louis. Anna had no experience handling money, having relied entirely upon her husband to manage the family finances. When he died in 1955, Margaret took over the management of the household and assumed the responsibility for taking care of her mother. In 1972, Anna went to a nursing home to live and is still there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>Margaret Koke became acquainted with Kingsley 0. Wright in the late 1960s when he was with the brokerage firm of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. Margaret bought mutual funds which Wright recommended, investing $25,000 of her own money and $15,000 of her mother\u2019s. Wright told her that she was making a sound investment, but Margaret did not know the type of securities she was investing in and didn\u2019t ask anyone. There is no claim in this suit that the Kokes were dissatisfied with the way their A.G. Edwards account was managed by Wright. Wright handled her account at A.G. Edwards until he left there in 1969 and took a similar position with Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co.; Margaret transferred her account and her mother\u2019s to Stifel at that time, too, and Wright continued to manage them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The events which led to the filing of this suit occurred after Wright left A.G. Edwards for Stifel and took the Koke accounts with him. They are recounted here from plaintiffs\u2019 point of view, giving them the benefit of all reasonable inferences, as we must when reviewing a summary judgment. One day Wright called Margaret. He told her about a new bond program that he and Stifel were starting for retirees. Wright explained that the investment would be stable, that \u201che- and Stifel Nicolaus and we would all be in [it] together,\u201d that it would provide a steady income, and that he wanted \u201cto get us out of mutual funds because he wasn\u2019t too sure what was happening there . . . .\u201d Wright further allegedly represented that the program involved no risk \u2014 \u201cif anything happened to [the bonds] why the whole country \u2014 nothing would be of any value. . . . [M]y E bonds, my war bonds would not be any good, my money in the bank wouldn\u2019t be any good and nothing would be any good.\u201d Wright represented, and Margaret believed, that purchasing the bonds Wright suggested would provide a steady income at no risk. She replied: \u201cWell, King, you know best, I\u2019m leaving it up to you. I don\u2019t have the time to check into anything, it\u2019s up to your judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">Wright began purchasing bonds for the Kokes\u2019 accounts in November, 1971, and continued to do so until May, 1973. At his suggestion, Margaret\u2019s and Anna\u2019s accounts were merged in 1972. The bonds purchased were not the \u201cno risk\u201d investment they were supposedly represented to be, and on at least five separate occasions \u2014 July, August, and October of 1972, and May and August of 1973 \u2014 the Kokes through Wright sold bonds at losses. All of the purchases and sales were immediately reported to the Kokes by way of confirmation slips and monthly by account statements, but because these writings appeared to Margaret to have been written in \u201chieroglyphics,\u201d she did not understand them and did not pay much attention to them. Upon their receipt, she simply put them in a drawer. She never knew that she was losing money and that the value of the account was decreasing. On occasion, Wright would send requests for more money, and she would ask him why it was necessary; Wright would assure her that \u201cnothing had happened to my account. I needed to increase my capital to keep interest at the same level.\u201d Wright constantly reassured her that nothing was wrong, and because she trusted him didn\u2019t ask questions about the details. Throughout all of her transactions with Wright and Stifel, Nicolaus, Margaret acted as her mother\u2019s agent; Anna knew nothing about the bond program and wasn\u2019t interested in it. She trusted Margaret to manage her money for her. Margaret, in turn, trusted Wright, and she told him on several occasions that she was trusting him to watch her interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">On September 17, 1974, all of the remaining bonds in the Koke account were sold at a loss, and no further purchases or sales were made on their account. At least eight confirmation slips showing the sales at a loss were received by Margaret on September 20,1974, and on September 27,1974, she received a monthly account statement summarizing the sales and losses. As was true with all written confirmations and monthly account statements, Margaret did not understand them and put them in a drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-10\">On March 7, 1975, Anna Koke\u2019s federal tax return was prepared, and the losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>from the bond sales were indicated. The return was prepared by an accountant, to whom Margaret had provided the confirmation slips and monthly account statements. Margaret did not read the return but merely glanced over it without realizing that it reflected the losses in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">On March 6, 1975, the Kokes\u2019 bond account with Stifel, Nicolaus was closed, but Margaret did not know of the closing until much later. In late November or early December, 1976, Margaret read a newspaper article about the trial of the suit by Milton Garnatz against Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., and Wright. See <em>Garnatz </em>v. <em>Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., </em>559 F.2d 1357 (8th Cir. 1977). She got in touch with the attorney representing Garnatz, and as a result she for the first time learned facts which led her to conclude that she had been defrauded through Wright\u2019s misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">Suit was filed on March 30, 1977. The complaint alleged that the defendants, Kingsley 0. Wright, Sr., and Stifel, Nico-laus &amp; Co. fraudulently represented that bonds were a stable, steady investment which would provide a steady income without fluctuation; that the bonds purchased for the plaintiffs would be of high quality and that there was no way they could lose; and that the recommended bonds and security purchases were part of a new plan for retirees, in which Stifel, Nicolaus was itself participating. The plaintiffs claimed that all of these representations were in fact false, and known by the defendants to be false. There was a substantial amount of discovery. Both Margaret Koke and Kings-ley Wright were deposed twice, and the parties answered interrogatories and requests for production. The defendants moved for summary judgment on September 6, 1979. The plaintiffs filed a timely opposition to the motion. Judgment was entered for the defendants on November 20, 1979, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">II. COUNT I</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">We first consider whether the granting of summary judgment on Count I was appropriate. In <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., </em>600 F.2d 139 (8th Cir. 1979), we held that suits brought in Missouri under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 must be filed within the two-year period of limitations provided by Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 409.-411(e) (1969), and we adhered to our previous ruling that the limitations period runs \u201cfrom the date of discovery of the fraud or from the date the fraud upon reasonable inquiry should have been discovered.\u201d <em>Vanderboom v. Sexton, </em>422 F.2d 1233, 1240 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>400 U.S. 852, 91 S.Ct. 47, 27 L.Ed.2d 90 (1970). Here, suit was filed March 30, 1977. If, upon reasonable inquiry, Margaret Koke should have discovered the alleged fraud more than two years earlier, before March 30, 1975, then Count I of the complaint was properly dismissed. We approach the question, of course, mindful that summary judgment is a drastic remedy and should be granted only in clear cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">The standard is an objective one. <em>Hupp v. Gray, </em>500 F.2d 993, 997 (7th Cir. 1974). What facts would alert a reasonable person to the possibility of wrongdoing? <em>Long </em>v. <em>Abbott Mortgage Corp., </em>459 F.Supp. 108, 116 (D.Conn.1978). Investors are not free to ignore warning signals which would cause a reasonable person to ask questions, but must \u201cexercise reasonable care and diligence in seeking to learn the facts which would disclose fraud.\u201d <em>Hupp v. Gray, supra, </em>500 F.2d at 996. \u201c[T]he statutory period . . [does] not await appellant\u2019s leisurely discovery of the full details of the alleged scheme.\u201d <em>Klein v. Bower, </em>421 F.2d 338, 343 (2d Cir. 1970). It comes down to this: Should a reasonable person in the position of Margaret Koke, upon reasonable inquiry, have discovered the facts constituting the alleged fraud on or before March 30, 1975?</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">The answer is yes. The confirmation slips and monthly account statements which were sent to Margaret were sufficient to require the initiation of an inquiry. While they are not a model of clarity for the novice investor, they provide information sufficient to require a reasonable per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>son to ask questions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even if Margaret Koke did not understand them, she was not free to ignore them, and that is what she did; she did not examine them carefully and did not ask anyone to explain them. The following exchange, which occurred during her first deposition, describes the actions she took to understand her account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-4\">Q Let me also ask you, did you receive monthly account statements every month from Stifel Nicolaus after Mr. Wright moved to Stifel Nicolaus? Did you receive these every month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-5\">A I suppose it was every month. I used to get them \u2014 it was every month I used to get them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-6\">Q You said you didn\u2019t understand them, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-7\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-8\">Q When you first received one, did you testify that you did not understand them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-9\">A I never could figure out what the heck they were doing, no, I never could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-10\">Q What attempts did you make to figure out the monthly account statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-11\">A I guess, basically, I never did go any further than just looking at them and not understanding them. I never went any further than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-12\">Q Did you ever ask Mr. Wright about them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-13\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-14\">Q And what they meant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-15\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-16\">Q Did you ever ask anybody at Stifel Nicolaus how you had done on your investments for the year [in preparation for the filing of tax returns]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-17\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-18\">Q Did you have any interest in how your investments were doing from time to time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-20\">A I never really \u2014 I just left everything up to him, sir. I never went into any of it, never did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-21\">Q Not even to know whether your bonds had risen or fallen in value?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-22\">A No, honestly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-23\">Miss Koke simply did not exercise the care and diligence reasonable under the circumstances to understand what was happening to her account. Had she examined the confirmation slips and compared them with each other, she would have discovered that bonds were being sold at substantial losses. For example, the sale of a particular bond at a certain price was indicated by a confirmation slip. The purchase of the same bond at a higher price would have been disclosed by an earlier confirmation slip. A comparison of the two slips, and simple arithmetic, would have indicated a loss. The same kind of simple comparison and examination of the monthly account statements would have revealed the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-24\">The confirmation slips and account statements reflecting losses were received by Margaret during 1972, 1973, and 1974. Although we need not fix a precise date, it is clear that at some point a reasonable person would have, upon reasonable inquiry, discovered that Wright\u2019s representations were untrue. The District Court fixed that date at no later than March 6, 1975, the date the Kokes\u2019 bond account was closed. We believe that this date gives the Kokes the benefit of every reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-25\">Miss Koke\u2019s tax returns were prepared yearly by an accountant, yet she did not ask him for assistance in understanding her bond account. Again, we turn to her deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-26\">Q I\u2019ll give you back Defendants\u2019 Exhibit H, your 1972 tax return that shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>under capital gains and losses, a loss of fifty thousand Glen Aldens. Did you ever read your tax return in 1972 showing that loss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-4\">A I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-5\">Q Glen Aldens were some of the bonds you had purchased from Mr. Wright, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-6\">A I don\u2019t even \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even tell you what the names \u2014 I mean, if you\u2019d ask me, I couldn\u2019t even tell you for sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-7\">Q Let me give you back Defendants\u2019 Exhibit A, your first bond statement. Does it show Glen Alden as being one of the bonds you purchased?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-8\">A Yes it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-9\">Q Did you ever read that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-10\">A I never actually tried to figure those out, sir, I never did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-11\">Q Did you ever read that to determine the names of the bonds that had been purchased for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-12\">A No I didn\u2019t, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-13\">Q Did you ever ask Mr. Wright what bonds had been purchased for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-14\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-15\">Q Mr. Keller prepared your tax returns, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-16\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-17\">Q Did he ever discuss the returns with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-18\">A No he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-19\">Q Did he read through them with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-20\">A No he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-21\">Q What type of information did you give Mr. Keller concerning your bonds to permit him to prepare your tax return?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-22\">A Well, I would just send him the little forms that I would get from the savings and loans and the forms that I would get from either A. G. Edwards or Stifel Nicolaus and just put\u2019em in an envelope and send them all in to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-23\">Q Did you ever ask him how you had done during the year on your investments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-24\">A No, never talked to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-25\">The District Court was correct in concluding that Court I was barred by the statute of limitations, and the dismissal of that Count is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-28\">III. COUNT II</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-29\">Count II of the complaint incorporated the allegations of Count I and alleged fraud under the common law of Missouri. The District Court held that the fraud claim was barred by the same statute of limitations that barred Count I, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 409.-411(e) (1969), reasoning that this statute \u201cwas made applicable to plaintiffs\u2019 state claim by the decision ... in <em>Morris v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., supra.\u201d </em>The appellants argue that an action in Missouri for common-law fraud is governed by the five-year period of limitations set out in Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 516.120 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-30\">At the outset, we cannot agree that <em>Morris </em>is controlling. We stated in <em>Morris </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC3Z\">[t]he only issue presented on appeal is whether the district court properly applied the two-year blue sky limitations period contained in section 409.411 to appellants\u2019 federal securities claims, or whether the court should have instead applied the five-year period provided in section 516.120 for common law fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-31\"><em>Morris v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., supra, </em>600 F.2d at 140. <em>Morris </em>dealt with the proper period of limitations for Rule 10b-5 actions, and the resolution of the limitations question in that case does not apply to fraud claims under Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-32\">We find it unnecessary, however, to resolve the limitations issue, and we express no opinion about whether \u00a7 516.120 should have been applied rather than \u00a7 409.411(e). We find, instead, in light of <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), and its successors, that the pendent fraud claim should be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-33\">In <em>Gibbs, </em>the Court set out the basic principles which should be applied where federal and state claims are presented together. First, the federal claim must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>substantial enough for the vesting of subject-matter jurisdiction. Second, the federal and state claims must present one constitutional \u201ccase.\u201d If they derive from a common nucleus of operative fact, and if aside from their federal or state character, they normally would be tried in one proceeding, this element is present. Third, even if the court has the power in a constitutional sense to hear the entire case, it need not do so, for \u201cpendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff\u2019s right.\u201d 383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. at 1139. The exercise of the court\u2019s discretion involves \u201cconsiderations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants\u201d and \u201c[njeedless decisions of state law should be avoided both as a matter of comity and to promote justice between the parties.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">M In the case at bar, it is clear that the federal securities claim was substantial. Claims are \u201cinsubstantial only if the prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous . . .\u201d <em>Goosby v. Osser, </em>409 U.S. 512, 518, 93 S.Ct. 854, 859, 35 L.Ed.2d 36 (1973). The federal and state claims here presented would normally be tried together, since their factual bases are identical. And, had the motion for summary judgment been denied, weighing judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the parties, the District Court would have been warranted in exercising its discretion in favor of trying both claims in the same lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">This case, however, did not proceed in such a fashion. The federal claim was dismissed before trial, and we have upheld that dismissal. The Supreme Court in <em>Gibbs </em>said that if the federal claims are dismissed before trial, \u201cthe state claims should be dismissed as well.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. at 1139. Although this statement appears unconditional, later cases leave substantial doubt that it was intended to be mandatory. In <em>Rosado v. Wyman, </em>397 U.S. 397, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970), in a three-judge-court context, the Court ruled that the mootness of the federal constitutional question did not deprive the court of power to hear pendent nonconstitutional claims. We agree with the Tenth Circuit that, as long as the federal claim is not dismissed for insubstantiality, \u201cthe <em>Gibbs </em>dictum is not a restriction on a court\u2019s power but rather is a guide to the exercise of its discretion.\u201d <em>Transok Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Darks, </em>565 F.2d 1150, 1155 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1006, 98 S.Ct. 1876, 56 L.Ed.2d 388 (1978). <em>Accord, State of Arizona v. Cook Paint &amp; Varnish Co., 541 </em>F.2d 226, 227 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 915, 97 S.Ct. 1327, 51 L.Ed.2d 593 (1977); <em>Kavit v. A. L. Stamm &amp; Co., </em>491 F.2d 1176, 1180 (2d Cir. 1974) (if federal claims are subject to dismissal or summary judgment, pendent jurisdiction should not be exercised \u201cabsent exceptional circumstances.\u201d) In <em>Kuhn v. National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, </em>528 F.2d 767, 771 n. 6 (8th Cir. 1976), we said that the \u201cearly dismissal of the federal claim is one factor tending to support dismissal of the state claim as well, . . . but it is not determinative.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the dismissal of the federal securities claim before trial, standing alone, did not <em>compel </em>dismissal of the state fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">This conclusion does not end the inquiry, however. The question still remains whether, in the circumstances of this case, the state claim <em>ought </em>to be tried in federal court. In <em>Kuhn, </em>we suggested that appropriate factors for consideration are the difficulty of the state claim, the amount of judicial time and energy already invested in it, the amount of additional time and energy necessary for its resolution, and the availability of a state forum. <em>Ibid. </em>Having weighed these considerations, we are convinced that the state claim should be dismissed without prejudice. We are influenced primarily by the desire to avoid the needless, and non-definitive, federal resolution of an important question of state law. The limitations question has not been resolved by the Missouri appellate courts. The only Missouri case squarely in point is the decision of Judge Hoester of the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>Court of St. Louis County in <em>Braun v. Sti-fel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., </em>No. 390344 (1979), <em>appeal pending, </em>Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, No. 42498. Judge Hoester held that a common-law securities fraud claim is governed by the two-year limitations period set out in Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 409.-411(e) (1969). Since an appeal is pending in <em>Braun, </em>a more definitive ruling on the limitations question should be forthcoming. We are persuaded that dismissal of the state claim at bar is warranted as a matter of comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">We are also influenced by the availability of a state forum in which the Kokes may litigate their claim. At argument, counsel for appellants disclosed that they some time ago filed in state court a suit against the appellees virtually identical to Count II. Thus, our dismissal will not foreclose the opportunity for litigation in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">We do not foresee a significant increase in inconvenience to the parties if the fraud claim is pursued in state court rather than federal. The discovery in the District Court can be used in the state litigation, so the efforts of the parties to gather facts will not have been wasted. And finally, dismissal will allow the appellants to obtain a definitive'ruling on the limitations issue in state court, thereby \u201cprocuring for them a surer-footed reading of applicable law.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers v.
