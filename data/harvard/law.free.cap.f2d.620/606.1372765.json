Reddick was convicted of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The fraudulent scheme alleged in the indictment related to defendant\u2019s marketing in Wisconsin of a utility rate and cost consulting service which he claimed would save subscribers money on their utility bills. Defendant sought authorization under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for an investigator to locate and interview potential witnesses among his former customers in California, where he had marketed similar consulting services from 1967 until June, 1977, when he moved to Wisconsin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The magistrate denied this motion without prejudice, finding that defendant had made an insufficient showing of necessity for the services. On appeal, defendant urges that in rejecting his request, the magistrate incorrectly applied the relevant statutory standard and violated his constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, effective assistance of counsel and compulsory process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">As a preliminary matter, the government contends that defendant waived his right to appeal the denial of his motion by failing to renew the motion before the magistrate and by not raising the request before the trial judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While our research has not revealed any case holding that objections to a magistrate\u2019s ruling under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e) must first be made to a district court, the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), authorizing district court judges to refer numerous other pretrial matters to a magistrate, provides that reconsideration of a magistrate\u2019s pretrial finding authorized under that subparagraph may be made by a district court judge. We have interpreted this requirement as prohibiting direct appeal to this court from a magistrate\u2019s pretrial findings. <em>See United States v. Reeds, </em>552 F.2d 170, 171 (7th Cir. 1977) (per curiam). <em>See also United States v. Haley, </em>541 F.2d 678 (8th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While \u00a7 3006A lacks similar language suggesting the proper procedure for review of a magistrate\u2019s denial of authorization of services for indigent defendants, we believe requiring a defendant to seek intermediate review in a district court or to renew the motion in that forum represents the better rule. Such intermediate review, preferably before the initiation of trial, serves the interests of judicial economy by placing the issue before a trial judge who is more intimately familiar with the details of the case than this court could hope to become and is, therefore, in a better position initially to review the merit of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Even if we were to reject the government\u2019s contention on this procedural issue, our application of the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e) to the facts of this case would still compel affirmance of the conviction. As previously noted, \u00a7 3006A(e) permits authorization of investigative services if the defendant is financially unable to obtain them and if they are necessary. We have no doubt about defendant\u2019s inability to have procured such services at his own expense; however, we believe that while the services might have been required to defend against the original indictment, the assistance defendant sought was not necessary to defend against the charges in the superseding indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">Specifically, subparagraph 4(a) of Count I of the first indictment had stated that the misrepresentations and promises which defendant made to the alleged victims of this scheme included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-12\">That 80% of . [defendant\u2019s] customers experienced a savings in their electrical bills as a result of [defendant\u2019s] utility rate and cost consultant service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">Since many of defendant\u2019s former customers resided in California, his proving this statement to be accurate arguably would have required some investigation of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ant\u2019s practices in that state. The government indicated it would seek to prove the falsity of the representation by reference to the utility bills of defendant\u2019s 571 customers in California. These records were subpoenaed and made available to defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We need not decide whether access to these records would have provided defendant with an adequate opportunity to defend against the original charge because the alleged statement quoted above was omitted from the superseding indictment. The list of misrepresentations, which defendant allegedly made, was reformulated to include promises given only to the alleged victims in Wisconsin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, investigation of defendant\u2019s practices in California was not necessary to defendant\u2019s effective defense against the new charges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In his brief and his arguments before this court, defendant stated that, even under the superseding indictment, the investigative services in California were necessary to develop and to establish the defense of his good faith belief in the truth of the representations he made to the alleged Wisconsin victims. In asserting this contention, defendant has not added any new factual support to his original showing of necessity made before the magistrate. In the affidavit supporting the request for authorization, defense counsel stated he had spoken by telephone with two of defendant\u2019s California customers, and that they said they had saved money as a result of defendant\u2019s services.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counsel also stated that he had talked by telephone with a California attorney whom defendant had consulted concerning representation in that state and that the attorney said he had a list of clients whom defendant\u2019s services had benefited. We agree with the magistrate that recitation of these facts constituted an insufficient showing of necessity to warrant hiring an investigator to work in California. We see no way in which investigation of these \u201cleads\u201d in California would have been of substantially more assistance in establishing defendant\u2019s alleged good faith belief than were the utility bills and responses to government questionnaires available to defendant. The magistrate made clear that she was willing to reconsider her ruling if defendant could make a stronger showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>of the necessity for the proof requested. Defendant did not do so in that forum, and he has not brought to our attention any additional facts that would warrant authorization of the requested services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Finally, in addition to alleging a failure to comply with the applicable statutory standards, defendant states in conclusory language that his constitutional rights have been violated. He has not made a particularized showing with respect to any of these alleged violations. His claims on both the constitutional and the statutory grounds are quite speculative. Defendant has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence the prejudice required for reversal of his conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-19\">. Section 3006A(e)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-28\">Counsel for a person who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expert, or other services necessary for an adequate defense may request them in an ex parte application. Upon finding, after appropriate inquiry in an ex parte proceeding, that the services are</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">. The transcript for the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance held before Judge Doyle on March 21, 1979, indicates that defense counsel stated he intended to renew the motion; the record shows that counsel did not follow up on this expression of intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\">. We note in passing that subsection 2(2) of the recently enacted Federal Magistrates Act of 1979, 93 Stat. 643 (1979) (to be codified as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3)), provides for direct review in the courts of appeals of final judgments entered by magistrates in civil cases in which the parties have consented to the magistrate\u2019s exercise of \u201ccase dispositive\u201d jurisdiction. No similar changes are made in the procedures governing review of magistrates\u2019 pretrial rulings made under \u00a7 636(b) in criminal cases and in civil cases in which the litigants do not give such consent. We infer from the congressional silence on this matter continued legislative approval of requiring review in the district court of magistrates\u2019 pretrial rulings in these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\">. The government had also sent questionnaires to individuals in California whose names it derived from cancelled checks turned over by defendant. In oral argument, counsel for the government stated she received approximately 200 responses from the mailing and of these, eight indicated the customer may have saved some money from utilizing defendant\u2019s services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">. The superseding indictment stated that defendant had made the following misrepresentations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">(a) That the victim is likely on the wrong utility rate and is being overcharged:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">(b) That certain rates not applicable to the respective victim were available as a matter of choice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">(c) That NORMAN C. REDDICK, or a Selec-tra representative, on behalf of Selectra [the company name under which Reddick operated], would personally contact the victim\u2019s power company and review the victim\u2019s utility records covering at least the last year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">(d) That Selectra would analyze at least one year\u2019s past utility bills of the victim and determine whether:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\">(1) Available discounts and concessions were given;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-13\">(2) Bills were computed correctly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\">(3) The lowest rates were applied;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-16\">(4) Engineering changes would effect savings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-17\">(5) Metering consolidation or additional metering would effect savings; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">(6) Refunds are indicated.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b688-19\">. Our finding on this point disposes of defendant\u2019s contention that the magistrate incorrectly interpreted his request for authorization as one relating only to preparation of a defense against the \u201c80% success rate\u201d claim and that defendant needed the investigative services to show that \u201cany\u201d of the alleged misrepresentations were true. We reiterate that proof of the truth of the misrepresentations alleged in the superseding indictment did not require evidence from California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-20\">. In oral argument, defense counsel stated he had tried to contact a total of forty-two of defendant\u2019s former customers in California by telephone. He said he spoke with eighteen, \u201ctwelve of [whom] . refused to talk . , four of [whom] said they didn\u2019t remember anything about it, two of [whom] . remembered and said they didn\u2019t save any money, and two of [whom] . remembered and did save money.\u201d Defendant subpoenaed the two individuals who said they saved money, and they testified at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b689-15\">. In oral argument, counsel for defendant also stated that defendant\u2019s computations for determining how he could have saved his subscribers money were so complicated that the services of a California utility analyst were necessary to prepare an adequate defense to the superseding indictment. However, when asked if he had ever sought authorization to hire a utility analyst, counsel responded in the negative. He said the investigator whom he wanted to hire would have contacted such an expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b689-25\">. As we noted in our discussion of the denial of investigative services in <em>Mason v. Arizona, </em>504 F.2d 1345 (9th Cir. 1974), cert, <em>denied, </em>420.U.S. 936, 95 S.Ct. 1145, 43 L.Ed.2d 412 (1975), \u201cthe inquiry is the same constitutionally as under section 3006A: whether a defendant has established prejudice by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Christian v. United States, </em>398 F.2d 517 (10th Cir. 1968).\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>542 F.2d 1283, 1315 (7th Cir. 1976), cert. <em>denied, </em>430 U.S. 934, 97 S.Ct. 1558, 51 L.Ed.2d 779 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
