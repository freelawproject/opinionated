Hungate, United States District Judge, from proceeding with trial of a case, No. 79-1017-C, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, wherein the district court has found jurisdiction over petitioner, allegedly a Yugoslavian concern, under Missouri\u2019s long-arm statute. Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 506.500 (Vernon). The order complained of overruled petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the action against it for want of jurisdiction on April 9, 1980. Judge Hungate made no certification as contemplated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) and, indeed, from the materials before us it does not appear that he was asked to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-21\">The petition for writ of prohibition, filed April 18, 1980, obviously involves an attempt to seek interlocutory review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Given a proper record on the jurisdictional issue we might well entertain an interlocutory appeal. <em>See and compare Hutson v. Fehr Bros., Inc., </em>584 F.2d 833 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 983, 99 S.Ct. 573, 58 L.Ed.2d 654 (1978). However, we should not ordinarily permit use of the extraordinary writ as a substitute for the interlocutory review procedure provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), <em>School Dist. of Kansas City v. State of Missouri, </em>592 F.2d 493 (8th Cir. 1979), and we decline to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The petition is dismissed without prejudice to resort to efforts to effect an interlocutory appeal. <em>See </em>FRAP 5(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
