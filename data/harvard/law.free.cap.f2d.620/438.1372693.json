Capili, who specializes in anesthesiology, contended below as he does here that the defendants\u2019 refusal to grant him such privileges based on that exclusive contract constitutes a violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>and violates his civil rights as protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The district court dismissed the antitrust claim upon defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion. It held that Capili\u2019s factual allegation could not support plaintiff\u2019s contention that interstate commerce was \u201csubstantially affected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Thereafter, the district court, following a hearing on the merits of the remaining \u00a7 1983 claim, granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court concluded that the question of whether the governing body of a public hospital can constitutionally treat physicians differently is governed by the traditional rational basis inquiry. The Court went on to find the defendants\u2019 actions in entering into the exclusive contract, which provided for anesthesiology services on a 24-hour-per-day, 7-day-per-week basis, was reasonable and justified by the community\u2019s and hospital\u2019s needs. The requirements for provision of proper care and services to surgical patients formed a rational basis for the exclusive contract decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">We have examined the record and considered the written and oral arguments, and are of the opinion that the district court\u2019s judgment is fully supported by the law and the evidence. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
