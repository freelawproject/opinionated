Roberson and the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of Labor, seek review of a final decision by the Benefits Review Board which denied disability payments to Roberson under the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950. The Board reversed the administrative law judge\u2019s award of compensation benefits for temporary total disability and permanent partial disability, granted pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(b), (c)(21), on the ground that the order was not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. Roberson and the Director urge this court to reverse the Board, contending that there was substantial evidence to support the order, and the Board impermissibly reweighed the evidence without deferring to the factual determinations of the administrative law judge. We hold that the Board did not err in concluding that there was not substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the order of the administrative law judge, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">As found by the administrative law judge, Roberson was injured September 18, 1974 while working for Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its Beaumont, Texas shipyard. She was on a dry dock sandblasting under a ship which was being repaired when she backed up and placed one foot into a small hole, causing her to fall into a sitting position. She reported the accident and was taken to the St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital for medical attention. Her abrasions were cleaned and she was sent home. Roberson was paid compensation benefits from September 19 to October 1, 1974, and from October 14, 1974 to February 2, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The administrative law judge summarized Roberson\u2019s subsequent trips to medical doctors in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">Since the accident Claimant [Roberson] has consulted a number of doctors (Tr. 44-48). Dr. George B. Stephenson, orthopedic surgeon, Beaumont, Texas, examined Claimant on October 14, 1974. At that time, she complained of swelling inside her right knee and pain in her left ankle whenever she walked. She made no complaint of back pain (Tr. 72). On the basis of his examination Dr. Stephenson determined that Claimant \u201chad a contusion to her right knee as a result of a fall . . . .\u201d (Tr. 78). In his view, there was \u201cno reason why she couldn\u2019t go back to work\u201d <em>(Ibid).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">Dr. Joseph M. Barnhart, orthopedic surgeon, Houston, Texas, examined Claimant on February 4, 1975. At that time, Claimant stated that \u201cher right leg ached all the way down from the hip and involved the entire foot from the tip of the great toes and equally in each of the other toes\u201d (Post Ex. 1 pp. 6-7). He performed tests such as straight leg raising, pin touching, range of hip and knee motion and deep tendon reflex. He also obtained X-rays of the back and leg. Dr. Barnhart decided that Claimant\u2019s back and leg showed no evidence of an existing injury (Post Ex. 1 pp. 11-15).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">The record contains the report of Dr. I. S. McReynolds, orthopedic surgeon, Houston, Texas, dated April 9,1975 (Emp. Ex. 2). Dr.- McReynolds relates that Claimant was examined by him and she complained \u201cof aching, throbbing, and swelling of the right leg from the hip to the toes. The knee will buckle on her. She had pain in the pelvis and the pubic area\u201d <em>(Ibid). </em>Dr. McReynolds conducted a series of physical motion tests and tooks X-rays. He states in his report that Claimant appeared to him to be exaggerating her condition and over-reacting in her complaints of pain <em>(Id. </em>at p. 2). He reports that there \u201cis nothing present on physical examination at this time which would indicate to me that [Claimant] has any residual disabling abnormality as a result of her fall sustained in September 1974\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">On March 16, 1976, nearly eighteen months after the claimed disabling accident and one month before the administrative hearing in this matter, Roberson visited a fourth doctor, Dr. Henry Alexander Reid, III, an orthopedic surgeon in Beaumont, Texas, and complained of back pain. Ro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>berson told the doctor \u201cthat approximately three years before she had injured her back and had had pain in her back and right leg since that time.\u201d She made no mention of her compensation claim. Based upon Roberson\u2019s subjective complaints, Dr. Reid diagnosed her condition as \u201ca degenerative disc disease in the lower lumbar spine.\u201d Dr. Reid stated during his deposition that he found no objective evidence of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Dr. Reid was repeatedly asked during his deposition to state a cause for Roberson\u2019s claimed pain. He was unable to do so. Counsel for Roberson at one point asked Dr. Reid if his diagnosis would be \u201cconsistent with a traumatic injury to the low back.\u201d The doctor replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">I find that very difficult to answer. I made a diagnosis of degenerative disc disease and injury can accentuate this process. She could have had a degenerative disc at the time and the injury could have accentuated the degenerative process or the injury may have had nothing to do with the problem she has. I can\u2019t say. I saw her much later and none of this was related to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The doctor consistently declined to relate Roberson\u2019s disc disease to her accident. \u201cI can\u2019t say whether the problem she has now was caused by that accident or accentuated by it. I simply know what the lady told me at that time, and she related the onset of her back trouble to an accident she had.\u201d With this medical evidence before him,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the administrative law judge concluded that Roberson\u2019s fall resulted in temporary total disability and permanent partial disability, and made an award of compensation benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the course of his decision, the administrative law judge detailed at some length Roberson\u2019s lack of credibility. The judge noted that \u201c[a]t the hearing, Claimant\u2019s description of her back and leg condition was generalized and indefinite.\u201d He stated that an. analysis of Roberson\u2019s injury is \u201cgreatly hindered by (1) a lack of clear communication between Claimant and others and (2) Claimant\u2019s exaggeration of her pain and difficulty in moving around.\u201d Roberson\u2019s \u201clack of clear communication\u201d was demonstrated, in the administrative law judge\u2019s view, by her \u201cdemeanor, unresponsive answers and lack of completeness in her testimony concerning her injury.\u201d Contradictions in Roberson\u2019s testimony were also noted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>The judge concluded that \u201c[bjased upon such contradictions and my observations of the Claimant while she testified, [I] find that her testimony, in part, lacks credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">In analyzing the medical evidence in the record, the administrative law judge noted that \u201cDr. Reid could not say whether there was any relationship between the Claimant\u2019s back condition and her accident at work.\u201d He stated, however, that Dr. Reid had testified that Roberson could have had a degenerative disc disease at the time of the accident, and the accident might have accentuated the degenerative process. In making his final determination of disability, the administrative law judge \u201caccepted Dr. Reid\u2019s opinion based upon his subjective findings that Claimant has a disc injury,\u201d and did not \u201ccredit as controlling the views <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>of Drs. Stephenson, Barnhart and McRey-nolds, based upon their lack of objective findings, that Claimant has no injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The employer appealed the order to the Benefits Review Board, contending, among other things, that the award of disability compensation was not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. The Board reversed the administrative law judge. Roberson and the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs then petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s decision, contending that the Board erroneously applied the substantial evidence test in reversing the administrative law judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">As an initial matter, we are faced with the standing of the Director to seek review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision. In 1972, Congress amended the LHWCA to provide a two-step process for review of any compensation order entered under the LHWCA by a duly appointed hearing officer. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921. Pursuant to section 921, \u201cany party in interest\u201d may appeal'the decision of the hearing officer to the Benefits Review Board. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b). Subsequently, \u201c[a]ny person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the Board\u201d may seek review of that order in the United States court of appeals. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c). As we detailed at length in <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Donzi Marine, Inc., </em>586 F.2d 377, 382 (5th Cir. 1978), the Director has \u201cno interest on his part, either pecuniary or administrative, which is adversely affected by the decision of the Board in this case.\u201d Hence, the Director is not a person \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s order, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), and may not petition this court for review of that order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Associates, </em>601 F.2d 659, 670 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>I.T.O. Corporation of Baltimore v. Benefits Review Board, </em>542 F.2d 903, 909 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>vacated sub nom. Adkins v. I.T.O. Corp. of Baltimore, </em>433 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 2967, 53 L.Ed.2d 1088, <em>rev\u2019d on remand on other grounds, </em>563 F.2d 646, 648 (1977). We therefore proceed to consider Roberson\u2019s contentions as contained in her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Under the provisions of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3) the Benefits Review Board is \u201cauthorized to hear and determine appeals raising a substantial question of law or fact taken by any party in interest from decisions with respect to claims of employees under [the LHWCA].\u201d The Board\u2019s scope of review, however, is restricted. \u201cThe findings of fact in the decision under review by the Board shall be conclusive if supported, by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). The LHWCA does not set forth a standard of review for use by this court in reviewing the decisions of the Board. However, \u201cit is evident that we are to review only for errors of law, and to make certain that the Board adhered to its statutory standard of review of factual determinations.\u201d <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maintenance Service, </em>529 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Army and Air Force Exchange Service v. Greenwood, </em>585 F.2d 791, 795-96 (5th Cir. 1978). The question before this court therefore is whether the Board properly applied the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test in reviewing the decision of the administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">\u201cSubstantial evidence in the record considered as a whole\u201d is a strict and limiting standard of review. \u201cThus the Board does not have authority to engage in a <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence, or to substitute its views for that of the administrative law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>judge.\u201d <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maintenance Service, </em>529 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir. 1976). However, \u201c[t]he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The evidence supporting the decision or order under review \u201cmust do more than merely create a suspicion of the existence of facts upon which the order is based.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. A.O. Fuller Super Markets, Inc., </em>374 F.2d 197, 200 (5th Cir. 1967). In short, the review \u201cis not to be a mere rubber-stamping of the [administrative law judge\u2019s] order when the reviewing Court is unable to conscientiously conclude that the evidence supporting such decision is substantial.\u201d <em>Goins v. Noble Drilling Corporation, </em>397 F.2d 392, 394 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">On the present record we cannot say that the Benefits Review Board erred when it determined that the administrative law judge\u2019s award of disability compensation was not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. This case bears a striking resemblance to an earlier LHWCA case from this circuit, <em>Goins v. Noble Drilling Corporation, </em>397 F.2d 392 (5th Cir. 1968). In <em>Goins, </em>nine of the eleven doctors who testified stated that the claimant was in good physical condition and able to return to work. Two doctors, however, presented some evidence of disability. The Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Employees\u2019 Compensation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> awarded the claimant compensation under the LHWCA, and the employer sought review in district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court reversed the Deputy Commissioner, concluding that the two medical reports favorable to the claimant did not constitute substantial evidence. One report was found to be \u201cnothing more than a collection of medical terms woven around the thread of the patient\u2019s own statements about the nature of his accident and his persistent complaints.\u201d <em>Goins, supra, </em>397 F.2d at 394. As for the other report, the district court stated that \u201c[a] less concrete and conclusive report could hardly be imagined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the district court on appeal, noting that review under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard was to be more than a \u201cmere rubber-stamping of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In this case the Benefits Review Board, over the dissent of one member, held that there was not substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole to support an award of disability compensation. The Board, like the district court in <em>Goins, supra, </em>noted that the great preponderance of the medical evidence in the case militated against Roberson. The Board recognized that Dr. Reid gave the only medical testimony favorable to Roberson\u2019s case. The Board further noted that Dr. Reid\u2019s initial examination of Roberson came eighteen months, after the claimed injury whereas the other doctors had examined her within seven months of her fall. The Board also emphasized that Dr. Reid was \u201cnot informed by claimant on her initial visit to him that she was seeking evaluation as a result of an employment related injury.\u201d The Board then made the following analysis of the evidence supplied by Dr. Reid\u2019s deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">In reaching his opinion as to the extent of claimant\u2019s injury and disability, Dr. Reid relied solely on claimant\u2019s subjective complaints. Subjective complaints are simply those complaints of pain and other symptoms which are related by the patient to the doctor. In response to questioning, Dr. Reid acknowledged that he had not relied on any objective findings in reaching his diagnosis. The evidentiary value of Dr. Reid\u2019s testimony in this regard is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>therefore, questionable. This is particularly so when viewed with the fact that the administrative law judge had serious doubts relative to claimant\u2019s credibility. . It does not follow that the administrative law judge, who expressed serious doubts about claimant\u2019s credibility after having personally observed her, could then proceed to base his conclusions regarding claimant\u2019s disability upon the opinion of a doctor who had relied solely upon claimant\u2019s complaints to form his opinion that the claimant was disabled. Certainly, if the administrative law judge had doubts with respect to claimant\u2019s credibility, then testimony which was given by Dr. Reid and which relied exclusively upon claimant\u2019s complaints cannot be viewed as substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Apart from its reliance on the subjective complaints of the discredited claimant, the Board also commented upon the materiality of Dr. Reid\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">[T]he testimony of Dr. Reid cannot be relied on because of its equivocations and the failure of Dr. Reid to make any connection between claimant\u2019s injury and any subsequent physical impairments which claimant may have suffered. . Dr. Reid\u2019s testimony is also full of examples of his inability to state a definite opinion with regard to claimant\u2019s physical limitations. ... In the Board\u2019s opinion, medical evidence, such as Dr. Reid\u2019s testimony, which fails to state with any degree of certainty an opinion regarding claimant\u2019s injury and subsequent physical impairments does not constitute substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">We are unable to conclude that the reasoning of the Board, set forth above, is erroneous. Like the district court in <em>Goins, supra, </em>the Board considered evidence in the record which detracted from the conclusion of the administrative law judge. The Board properly determined that, on the record as a whole, the administrative law judge\u2019s order was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Todd Shipyards, Inc. v. Fraley, </em>592 F.2d 805, 810-11 (5th Cir. 1979). The Board did not exceed its statutory authority in reviewing compensation awards under the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b), and must therefore be</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. Only Dr. Stephenson testified in person at the hearing before the administrative law judge. All other medical evidence of examining physicians was received in the form of depositions or written medical reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">. Roberson was awarded temporary total disability payments at the rate of $70.18 per week for the period from September 19, 1974 to June 4, 1975, and permanent partial disability payments of $22.28 per week thereafter, computed on an assumed 35% permanent partial disability. Past due payments were to be made in a lump sum, together with 6% interest. In addition, the employer was ordered to pay $1,436.50 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-13\">. The administrative law judge noted the following contradiction in Roberson\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqL\">On the one hand, Claimant has applied for employment indicating that she is willing to try to work for the Employer, and she stated in her unemployment application filed with the Texas Employment Commission that she is \u201cpresently able to work\u201d (Tr. 113; Emp. Ex. 8). On the other hand, she testified at the hearing that she could not engage in any physical activities or even walk as far as half a block (Tr. 111-112).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. The Director, in his reply brief, argues that <em>Donzi Marine, supra, </em>is inapplicable to this case as it is not a \u201ccoverage case\u201d but one involving \u201cthe allocation of the burdens of proof and persuasion under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act and the magnitude of those burdens.\u201d Reply Brief for the Federal Petitioner at p. 2. We fail to see how this distinction heightens the Director\u2019s \u201cadministrative interest\u201d in this case in such a manner as to distinguish it from <em>Donzi Marine.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\">.
