The searches were conducted upon all such offenders who were detained overnight in the Racine County jail due to an unwillingness or inability to post bond before their initial appearance in court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The searches were conducted despite the absence of any probable cause to believe that the detainees were concealing contraband or weapons on their bodies. The district court ruled that the appellants\u2019 practices violated the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and granted Ti-netti both declaratory and injunctive relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>We affirm the judgment of the district court, which is published at 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979), and adopt the district court\u2019s Memorandum and Order as the decision of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\">. Although the searches were discontinued in response to this lawsuit, the district court ruled that the situation was \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d. 479 F.Supp. 486, 489 (E.D.Wis. 1979). This ruling was not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
