KENNEDY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Respondent appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of petitioner\u2019s Writ of Habeas Corpus. Petitioner was convicted in Warren Circuit Court, Kentucky of first degree robbery, in violation of KRS \u00a7 515.020. The District Court found that questions by the prosecutor of defendant and certain comments by the prosecutor in final argument were, in effect, a reference to post arrest silence impermissible under <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Petitioner had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and made a statement to the arresting officers regarding his whereabouts at the time of the robberies. When this proved incorrect, he told the officers that he did not recall where he was. At trial he testified he was with friends and family members who also provided alibi testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The respondent\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the petitioner\u2019s claim was not properly reviewable by the District Court because it was not properly preserved by an objection, as required by Kentucky law. This argument is based, in large part, on <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), in which the Supreme Court held that the failure to comply with a state\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement which precludes direct review likewise precludes federal habeas corpus review absent a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d. This failure to comply with the state\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement amounts to an independent and adequate state procedural ground for affirming the conviction with regard to that issue. <em>Wainwright, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 81-82, 86-87, 97 S.Ct. at 2503-2504, 2506. In deciding <em>Wainwright, </em>the Supreme Court specifically rejected the application of the sweeping language in <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), to a defendant\u2019s failure to raise objections at the trial court level to the admission of a confession. <em>Wainwright, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 87-88, 97 S.Ct. at 2506-2507. The rule in <em>Fay v. Noia, supra, </em>had been read by this Court and others as allowing federal habeas corpus review, in spite of a defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the state\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement, unless the defendant had attempted a \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d of the state court procedure. <em>See Minor v. Black, </em>527 F.2d 1, 4-5 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>427 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 3189, 49 L.Ed.2d 1198 (1976). The decision in <em>Wainwright </em>appears to now preclude such a broad reading of the rule in <em>Fay v. Noia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Among the reasons cited by the Supreme Court for rejecting the \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d rule and requiring deference to states\u2019 contemporaneous objection requirements, in the absence of a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d, are the following: (1) A contemporaneous objection requirement allows the record of the constitutional claim to be made when the recollections of the witnesses are freshest, rather than years later in a federal habeas habeas corpus proceeding. (2) It allows the judge who observed the demeanor of the relevant witnesses to make the factual determinations necessary for deciding the federal constitutional question. (3) Contemporaneous objections give the trial court an opportunity to cure the claimed error, thereby making a major contribution to the finality of criminal litigation. (4) Compliance with a contemporaneous objection rule may cause the prosecution to reassess its request for the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>of evidence when confronted with claims which would indicate the possibility of reversal by the state appellate courts or upon federal habeas corpus review. (5) The rule in <em>Fay v. Noia </em>could encourage \u201csandbagging\u201d on the part of defense lawyers who wish to take their chances on the verdict of the initial jury, intending to raise their constitutional claims and obtain a new trial through federal habeas corpus proceedings if the initial verdict is unfavorable. <em>Wainwright, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 88-89, 97 S.Ct. at 2507.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The merits of deferring to states\u2019 contemporaneous objection requirements were summarized by the Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">The failure of the federal habeas courts generally to require compliance with a contemporaneous-objection rule tends to detract from the perception of the trial of a criminal case in state court as a decisive and portentous event. A defendant has been accused of a serious crime, and this is the time and place set for him to be tried by a jury of his peers and found either guilty or not guilty by that jury. To the greatest extent possible all issues which bear on this charge should be determined in this proceeding: the accused is in the courtroom, the jury is in the box, the judge is on the bench, and the witnesses, having been subpoenaed and duly sworn, await their turn to testify. Society\u2019s resources have been concentrated at that time and place in order to decide, within the limits of human fallibility, the question of guilt or innocence of one of its citizens. Any procedural rule which encourages the result that those proceedings be as free of error as possible is thoroughly desirable, and the contemporaneous-objection rule surely falls within this classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\"><em>Wainwright, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 90, 97 S.Ct. at 2508.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">It is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the questions and arguments which are the subject of the instant Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. This Court must first determine whether Kentucky\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule precluded petitioner from raising on direct appeal the issues he now raises. If so, <em>Wainwright </em>precludes federal habeas corpus review in the absence of a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Kentucky\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement precludes appellate review of matters which are not objected to, unless manifest injustice results. <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>512 S.W.2d 501 (Ky.1974); <em>Stone v. Commonwealth, </em>456 S.W.2d 43 (Ky.1970). When the Kentucky Supreme Court reviewed petitioner\u2019s claims on direct appeal, it noted the factual distinctions between this case and <em>Doyle v. Ohio, supra, </em>and then ruled that the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the claimed error precluded its consideration on appeal. <em>Hockenbury v. Commonwealth, </em>565 S.W.2d 448 (Ky.1978). This decision is consistent with other Kentucky decisions addressing a defendant\u2019s failure to object to similar statements and comments made by the prosecution. <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>556 S.W.2d 922 (Ky.App.1977); <em>Minor v. Commonwealth, </em>478 S.W.2d 716 (Ky.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1064, 93 S.Ct. 563, 34 L.Ed.2d 517 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kentucky\u2019s decision not to review this matter was an adequate and independent procedural state ground for denying petitioner\u2019s claim which <em>Wainwright </em>requires this Court to honor in the absence of a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">The District Court in the instant case found that application of the rule of <em>Wainwright </em>did not preclude review of petitioner\u2019s claim because the comments and questions of the prosecutor amounted to \u201cplain error\u201d. A review of the language and rationale of <em>Wainwright </em>indicates that the District Court erred in making an inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>pendent assessment of \u201cplain error\u201d rather than deferring to the state court\u2019s application of its contemporaneous objection requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In reaching its conclusion the District Court relied, in part, on <em>Minor v. Black, supra. </em>This Court\u2019s refusal in <em>Minor </em>to defer to the Kentucky court\u2019s ruling on its contemporaneous objection requirement, however, was based on an application of the \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d rule which has since become improper under <em>Wainwright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The District Court also relied on the \u201cplain error\u201d language contained in several of the post- <em>Wainwright </em>cases from this Court. In those cases, however, this Court either determined that review was not precluded under the <em>state\u2019s </em>contemporaneous objection requirement, <em>Berrier v. Egeler, </em>583 F.2d 515 (6th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 955, 99 S.Ct. 354, 58 L.Ed.2d 347 (1978); <em>Cook v. Bordenkircher, </em>602 F.2d 117 (6th Cir. 1979), or found that the \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d exception to the <em>Wainwright </em>rule had been met, <em>Rachel v. Bordenkircher, </em>590 F.2d 200 (6th Cir. 1978). This Court has never ruled that federal habeas corpus review is proper under <em>Wainwright </em>based solely on an independent federal analysis of \u201cplain error\u201d. The first post- <em>Wainwright </em>case in this Circuit to refer to a \u201cplain error\u201d analysis was <em>Berrier v. Egeler, supra. </em>In that case the Court made a proper <em>Wainwright </em>analysis of the state\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement. <em>Berrier v. Egeler, supra, </em>583 F.2d at 522. The Court subsequently noted, however, that the magnitude of the error would make it cognizable in a habeas proceeding as \u201cplain error\u201d even where no objection had been made at trial. The Court then cited a federal criminal case which applied the federal procedural rule allowing review of \u201cplain error\u201d, even in the absence of a contemporaneous objection. This language should not be taken to mean that the application of the federal procedural rule on \u201cplain error\u201d can be substituted for an analysis of the state procedural rule under <em>Wainwright. </em>Such a holding would be contrary to the rule and rationale of <em>Wainwright </em>which allows the state rule to be an adequate and independent state ground for the decision and thus requires a focus on and application of the state\u2019s procedural rule. Consequently, the District Court erred in applying an independent determination of \u201cplain error\u201d, rather than deferring to the state court\u2019s application of its procedural rule in the absence of a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Most contemporaneous objection requirements, like the one in the instant case, include some provision for \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d or \u201cplain error\u201d. Consequently, deference to a state court\u2019s application of its procedural rule will, to some extent, make the availability of federal habeas corpus relief turn on the state\u2019s assessment of the substantiality of the constitutional claim. This result, however, does not allow the federal courts to make an independent application of the state\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement. <em>Wainwright </em>makes it clear that the role of the federal courts in preventing manifest injustice in these cases is maintained through the application of the \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d exception to the finality of the state procedural rules, rather than an independent application of those rules.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">The \u201ccause\u201d-and-\u201cprejudice\u201d exception to the <em>Francis </em>[v. <em>Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48 L.Ed.2d 149] rule will afford an adequate guarantee, we think, that the rule will not prevent a federal habeas court from adjudicating for the first time the federal constitutional claim of a defendant who in the absence of such an adjudication will be the victim of a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\"><em>Wainwright, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 90-91, 97 S.Ct. at 2508.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\"><em>Wainwright </em>compels the federal court to defer to the state court\u2019s application of its own contemporaneous objection requirement. Under <em>Wainwright </em>a District Court\u2019s only role in making an independent determination so as to prevent a miscarriage of justice is in the application of the \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d exception contained in the <em>Wainwright </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Petitioner argues that <em>Wainwright </em>is not applicable in the instant case since the Kentucky courts reached the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim. Petitioner is correct in his assertion that <em>Wainwright </em>does not preclude federal review of claims in habeas corpus proceedings when, in spite of the petitioner\u2019s failure to object to the matter at trial, the state courts reach the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim instead of denying direct review of the claim on procedural grounds. <em>Wainwright, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 87, 97 S.Ct. at 2506; <em>Cook v. Bordenkircher, </em>602 F.2d 117, 119 (6th Cir. 1979). This ruling is consistent with the rationale of <em>Wainwright </em>since the failure to comply with a state\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement cannot be deferred to as a separate and independent procedural ground precluding federal review if the state itself did not preclude direct review on the basis of that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In denying appellate review due to petitioner\u2019s failure to object at trial, the Kentucky Supreme Court made a cursory review of petitioner\u2019s substantive claim. The relevant portion of the Court\u2019s decision follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination of Hockenbury was in part directed at his failure to give an alibi at the time of his arrest. In his closing argument the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney bemoaned the fact that Hockenbury\u2019s alibi was first offered at trial. This court has expressed its disapproval of the use of post-arrest silence to impeach a defendant. <em>Niemeyer v. Commonwealth, </em>Ky., 533 S.W.2d 218 (1976); <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>Ky., 558 S.W.2d 590 (1977) (Lukowsky, J., dissenting); <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>Ky., 564 S.W.2d 528 (Rendered February 21, 1978). However, this case is unlike one in which a defendant stands mute at arrest and first offers an explanation or alibi at trial. It is abundantly clear from the record that Hockenbury at the time of his arrest was willing to discuss with the officers his whereabouts at the time of the robberies. Hockenbury was not silent, as he contends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">It is also clear from the record that trial counsel made no objection during the cross-examination of Hockenbury, nor did he object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. This court has repeatedly held that absent proper objection, the failure to assert a claim in a trial court precludes its consideration on appeal. RCr 9.22; <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>Ky., 512 S.W.2d 501 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\"><em>Hockenbury v. Commonwealth, </em>565 S.W.2d 448, 450 (Ky.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Since the question of whether the state court reviewed the constitutional claim on its merits or refused to review it on procedural grounds is critical to the application of the <em>Wainwright </em>rule, a difficult situation is created when the court has arguably done both. In view of the rationale of the <em>Wainwright </em>rule, however, it is clear that the central question in such an instance is whether the state court denied petitioner\u2019s claim based on <em>an </em>adequate and independent state procedural ground. In cases such as this where the state court has arguably given more than one reason for the denial of petitioner\u2019s claim, we hold that the federal court must determine whether the petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the contemporaneous objection requirement was a substantial basis of the state court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">In this case the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court makes it clear that its denial of petitioner\u2019s claim was based, in substantial part, on petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the state\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement. The plain language of the second paragraph quoted above indicates that the procedural ground precluded direct review by the state courts. Further, the Court\u2019s review of the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim was cursory at best. The Court simply reviewed the impropriety of using post-arrest silence to impeach a defendant and noted the factual distinction between the instant case and the other cases on the issue already decided by that Court. The Court did not make a complete analysis on the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim, nor did it make a concrete ruling on the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>factual distinction that it had noted. Instead it relied on the procedural ground in denying petitioner\u2019s claim. Finally, it is apparent that the nature of Kentucky\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule required the Court to make a cursory review of the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim. As stated, the Kentucky rule precludes appellate review of matters which are not objected to, unless manifest injustice resulted. At least some review of the merits of a defendant\u2019s claim must be made in order to determine whether to apply the procedural rule or review the merits on the basis of manifest injustice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, we conclude that the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claim was substantially based on the state procedural ground, despite the cursory review of the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In summary, Kentucky\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claim on procedural grounds, specifically his failure to object at trial, was an adequate and independent state ground and therefore precludes federal habeas corpus review in the absence of a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d. The District Court erred in failing to defer the state\u2019s application of its own procedural rule and instead making an independent determination of \u201cplain error\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Petitioner made no argument regarding \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d in his brief on appeal, apparently because of the nature of the District Court\u2019s analysis. However, petitioner did argue \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d to the District Court and, in fairness, should be given an opportunity to show \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d. Although we might well be able to determine on the record before us the \u201cprejudice\u201d portion of the two prong <em>Wainwright </em>test, we do not have all the information which the parties may wish to present on the \u201ccause\u201d prong. Consequently, we remand this case for a determination of whether there is a sufficient showing of \u201ccause\u201d for the petitioner\u2019s failure to object to the claimed error at trial and of actual \u201cprejudice\u201d to the petitioner, in accordance with the rule in <em>Wainwright.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">. This Court subsequently granted habeas corpus relief to the defendant in <em>Minor, </em>ruling that it was not bound by the state\u2019s ruling on its contemporaneous objection requirement based on the \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d rule in <em>Fay v. Noia, supra. Minor v. Black, </em>527 F.2d 1, 4-5 (6th Cir. 1975). As previously noted, the \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d test is no longer the proper one under the holding in <em>Wainwright.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. In the similar case of <em>Minor v. Commonwealth, </em>478 S.W.2d 716 (Ky.1972), the Kentucky court made a short analysis of the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim and then ruled that the defendant did not make a sufficient objection to authorize appellate review. In the subsequent habeas proceedings this Court recognized that the essence of the state court\u2019s decision had been to deny review based on the defendant\u2019s failure to object at trial. <em>Minor </em>v. <em>Black, </em>527 F.2d 1 (6th Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
