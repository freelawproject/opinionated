Due to an inadvertent operational error by an accountant, the corporation made contributions to the plans on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Ludden in fiscal 1972, but not on behalf of the only other eligible employee, secretary Whitehead! Therefore, the Commissioner determined that the plans failed in 1972 to qualify under I.R.C. \u00a7 401(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>a deficiency against the Luddens for income tax on the contributions made in their behalf in that year. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(b), 83. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner, 68 T.C. 826 (1977). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">To gain the tax benefits of qualification, plans must satisfy \u00a7 401(a) in their operation as well as in their terms. <em>See Myron v. United States, </em>550 F.2d 1145 (9th Cir. 1977). In operation, the 1972 plans benefited only 67% of the employees (not 70%) and 67% of the eligible employees (not 80%), so the plans were disqualified under I.R.C. \u00a7 401(a)(3)(A). Moreover, the 1972 plans discriminated, in operation, in favor of officers/shareholders/highly compensated employees (the Luddens), so the plans were disqualified under I.R.C. \u00a7 401(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The conceded error that disqualified the plans should have been quickly rectified by retroactively reallocating a small share of the Luddens\u2019 1972 contributions to Whitehead\u2019s account. However, despite the Luddens\u2019 asserted willingness, this was not done until the Tax Court\u2019s adverse decision was before this court on appeal. The Tax Court h\u00e9ld that it had no jurisdiction, in a deficiency proceeding, to render an advisory opinion on the question raised by the Luddens: whether retroactive reallocation of the contributions would so well cure the inadvertent operational error that it would be an abuse of discretion for the Commissioner not to recognize the 1972 plans as qualified in the event such a reallocation was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We agree with the Tax Court, and we reserve the question that would have been properly presented had the Luddens caused the plans\u2019 trustee to rectify the error before submission of the case to the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\">.
