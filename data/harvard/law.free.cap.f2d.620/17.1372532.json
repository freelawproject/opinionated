Staats, Comptroller General of the United States, appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Morris E. Lasker, J., granting the motion of Bristol Laboratories Division of Bristol-Myers Company (\u201cBristol\u201d) for summary judgment and denying the government\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. During 1973 and 1974, Bristol entered into negotiated fixed-price contracts with the Veterans Administration and with the Defense Supply Agency of the Defense Department; pursuant to 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313(b), these contracts contained a clause that granted the Comptroller \u201caccess to and the right to examine any directly pertinent\u201d business records \u201cinvolving transactions related to\u201d the contracts. In 1974, the Comptroller formally requested Bristol to make available all records \u201cdirectly pertinent\u201d to the contracts. The parties disagreed, however, as to what records were required to be produced; accordingly, Bristol commenced an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in order to limit the Comptroller\u2019s access to its records. Judge Lasker held that the government\u2019s interpretation of the access-to-records clause incorporated in the contracts was untenable as a matter of both statutory interpretation and contractual construction. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm for the reasons given in Judge Lasker\u2019s excellent opinion, reported at 428 F.Supp. 1388 (S.D.N.Y.1977), to which we refer the reader.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">We would see no reason to say anything further except that in the unusually lengthy period between Judge Lasker\u2019s opinion and this appeal, see note 1, supra, there have been two opinions in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, upon which the government relies heavily, bearing on the scope of the Comptroller\u2019s authority to examine records similar to those he seeks here. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories, </em>597 F.2d 672 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Staats, </em>574 F.2d 904 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 959, 99 S.Ct. 362, 58 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978). These cases reject the holding of the court below, but we do not find their reasoning persuasive. We note particularly that not only was there a vigorous dissent in <em>Lilly, </em>see 574 F.2d at 918 (Pell, J., dissenting), but also that the precedential force of that decision has been weakened by the reluctant concurrences of two members of the <em>Abbott </em>panel, see 597 F.2d at 674 (Pell, J., concurring), 675 (Wood, J., concurring). Compare also <em>SmithKline Corp. v. Staats, </em>483 F.Supp. 712 (E.D.Pa.1980) with <em>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v. Staats, </em>No. 74-1447 (D.D.C. filed Aug. 12, 1977), appeal docketed, No. 79-1435 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 30, 1979); see generally Case Comment, The Comptroller General\u2019s Authority to Examine the Private Business Records of Government Contractors, 92 Harv.L.Rev. 1148 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">. Both parties filed timely notices of appeal from Judge Lasker\u2019s order. Subsequently, a panel of this court remanded the case for consideration of Bristol\u2019s request for a protective order without prejudice to prosecution of the appeals. In September 1979, the district court approved a protective order, which had been agreed to by the parties. Only the appeal of the government is before us today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
