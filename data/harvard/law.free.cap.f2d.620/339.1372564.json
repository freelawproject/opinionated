Carter, <em>District Judge, </em>469 F.Supp. 630, assessing $50,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses against plaintiff-appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>lant Robert B. Nemeroff and his law firm, Hale and Dorr, on the ground that they commenced an action under the federal securities laws in bad faith. The district court awarded the fees to Alan Abelson, Robert Bleiberg, and Dow Jones &amp; Company, three of the defendants in the action. The remaining defendants cross-appeal from the judgment below on the ground that they too should have been awarded attorneys\u2019 fees. For the reasons below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Robert B. Nemeroff, a practicing dentist in New York City, was a shareholder of Technicare Corporation (\u201cTechnicare\u201d), a manufacturer of medical equipment. Represented by the well known Boston law firm of Hale and Dorr, and in particular by Gordon T. Walker, Esq., a member of the firm, Nemeroff commenced a two-count class action on March 25,1977 in the Southern District of New York against twelve defendants, including all of the defendants-appellees. The defendants-appellees consist of three \u201cpublishing defendants\u201d and five \u201cshort seller or investor defendants\u201d. The publishing defendants are Alan Abelson, author of a column entitled \u201cUp &amp; Down Wall Street\u201d, which appears in the financial weekly <em>Barron\u2019s, </em>of which he is a managing editor; Robert M. Bleiberg, the editor of <em>Barron\u2019s; </em>and Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc., the publisher of various financial publications and services, including <em>Barron\u2019s </em>and <em>The Wall Street Journal. </em>The short seller or investor defendants are Meyer Berman; the hedge fund Cumberland Associates and its managing partner, Walter Mintz; and the hedge fund Robert Wilson Associates and its managing partner, Robert Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">The first count of the complaint alleged that all the defendants had conspired to violate \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1976), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (1975). This count alleged that the publishing defendants deliberately leaked non-public information about forthcoming Abelson columns to the investor defendants, and in particular that the publishing defendants gave advance warning to the investor defendants that Abelson would make negative comments about Technicare; that the comments caused or tended to cause a decline in the price of Technicare stock; that the publishing defendants did this in order to enable the investor defendants to trade at a profit; and that the investor defendants profited from the information by selling Technicare short prior to publication and making covering purchases at a depressed price after publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">The second count named the investor defendants only. It alleged that they engaged in a manipulative scheme to depress the price of Technicare stock through a pattern of massive short selling in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78i(a) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">On January 6, 1978 an amended complaint was filed. Nemeroff abandoned his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>allegation that the publishing defendants deliberately had leaked information about the Abelson columns to the investor defendants but alleged in his amended complaint that the investor defendants deliberately had <em>solicited </em>negative Abelson columns in an attempt to drive down the price of Tech-nicare stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In May 1978, pursuant to plaintiff\u2019s voluntary stipulation to dismiss the action, an order was filed dismissing the action with prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The stipulation explicitly reserved defendants\u2019 right to move for costs and reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, but without plaintiff\u2019s conceding that defendants were entitled to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In June 1978 defendants moved for costs, disbursements and attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that the action had been commenced and prosecuted in bad faith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants requested that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees be \u201cassessed against plaintiff and/or his counsel.\u201d Oral argument on defendants\u2019 motions was heard in September 1978. Thereafter additional documents were filed by both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">On April 18,1979 the district court filed a comprehensive, reasoned opinion. 469 F.Supp. 630. The court held that the action had been commenced in bad faith against the publishing defendants and awarded them $50,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to be taxed against Nemeroff and Hale and Dorr. The court held that the action had not been commenced in bad faith against the investor defendants and accordingly denied their motions for attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>fees and expenses. The court held that defendants were the prevailing parties and granted their motions for costs to be taxed against plaintiff pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d). Pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, the court ordered that the action be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On May 10, 1979 a final judgment was entered in accordance with the court\u2019s opinion. From that judgment, the instant appeal and cross-appeals have been taken as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In January 1977 Gordon T. Walker and Hale and Dorr first became involved in the discussions which led to the commencement of this action. At that time Walker met with a client of Hale and Dorr, Herbert Stein, who was a shareholder of Centronics Data Computer Corporation (\u201cCentronics\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By then <em>Barron\u2019s </em>already had carried several Abelson columns critical of Technicare.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Stein told Walker that he was concerned that Abelson also would criticize Centronics in a forthcoming column. Stein said he had been informed that Abelson had criticized Technicare at the instance of several investors, including Robert Wilson, who had established large short positions in Techni-care. Stein said that the same investors had established short positions in Centron-ics. Stein also mentioned that the Techni-care trading was being investigated by the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). He gave Walker the names of two brokers who had voiced suspicions about the Technicare trading.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">During the period between the meeting with Stein in January and the commencement of the action in March, Walker and his firm investigated the allegations regarding Technicare and Centronics. Walker called the NYSE and the SEC and received confirmation that they were investigating complaints about Technicare. Walker spoke to Howard Roth, one of the brokers mentioned by Stein, who reiterated his suspicions about the trading in Technicare. He stated that Nemeroff, his client, was considering commencing an action against Dow Jones and the investors holding short positions in Technicare. He added that Nemeroff would be represented by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison in the action. Later, Roth informed Walker that Nemeroff would not be represented by Paul, Weiss at that time \u2014 for reasons not relevant here \u2014 and that he had recommended to Nemeroff that he retain Hale and Dorr. Nemeroff later decided that he wanted Hale and Dorr to commence an action on his behalf. On March 20 an associate of Hale and Dorr discussed a draft complaint with Nemeroff. The complaint was filed on March 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">In the remainder of this section of our opinion, we shall summarize only those facts believed to be necessary to an understanding of our rulings on the legal questions presented. The essential facts are those which led Walker to believe that there were adequate grounds for the commencement of Nemeroff\u2019s action against defendants. These facts fall generally into two categories:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> first, the nuts and bolts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the alleged conspiracy, including Abelson\u2019s columns, Abelson\u2019s relationship with the investor defendants, and the pattern of trading in Technicare; and second, Walker\u2019s contacts with the NYSE attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">THE COLUMNS</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Barron\u2019s </em>carried a series of articles beginning in May 1976 which mentioned Techni-care or the CAT scanner market. All but one were written by Abelson. To the extent that these columns were negative, and not all of them were,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> they stated that the market for CAT scanners was going to level out because of various factors, including their high cost and the increasing concern over the rising cost of medical care, increased competition, and state regulation of hospital expenditures. The columns indicated that Technicare would be particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>vulnerable, due in part to its proportionately large reliance on CAT scanner sales.</p>\n<p id=\"A2D\">THE TRADING</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Technicare was first listed on the NYSE in December 1975. During the first two months of 1976 approximately 100,000 shares were sold short. The aggregate short position remained relatively stable until October 1976, when it began to rise sharply.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The aggregate position was over 238,000 shares by March 1977, when the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The price of Technicare stock rose until approximately the end of 1976, when it began to decline. The only Abelson column which was closely related to a decline in the price of Technicare stock was that of January 10, 1977. Technicare fell almost three points, to $34.50, after that publication.</p>\n<p id=\"Az_\">THE NYSE INVESTIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"A7i\">An important factor relied on by Walker in determining whether there was any basis for the charges against the publishing and investor defendants was what he understood to be the conclusion reached by the NYSE that there was in fact a \u201ccorrelation\u201d between the appearance of the Abelson articles and the short sales of Techni-care stock. Walker says that he was told on February 3, 1977 by an NYSE attorney, Jeffrey Hass, Esq., that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d of a \u201crelationship\u201d between the short sellers and Abelson. Hass later denied making those statements; but in a supplemental affidavit he conceded that he could understand, based on their February 3 conversation, how Walker \u201ccould have come away from the conversation with the good faith impression that I had m\u00e1de such statements.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court found\u2014 erroneously in our view \u2014 that the February 3 conversation was immaterial, because of a February 8 conversation which Walker had with Hass and others at the NYSE during which the NYSE people purportedly indicated that the NYSE was satisfied that there was no support for charges of manipulation. The critical fact, however, is that on February 8 Walker learned only that the NYSE was satisfied that the <em>Technicare </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>specialist </em>of the NYSE was not involved in manipulation. Walker did not receive the report of the NYSE investigation until July 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">In addition to the foregoing, Walker points to other facts which led him to con-elude that there were adequate grounds for commencing the action, including statements by Robert Wilson in a market newsletter<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and what Walker understood to be prior similar conduct on the part of Abelson and the investor defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>THE DISTRICT COURT OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"A3N\">In its opinion of April 18,1979 the district court found that the action was <em>commenced </em>in bad faith, but it made no finding on the propriety of plaintiff\u2019s <em>conduct </em>of the litigation. The court found it unnecessary to reach the latter issue in view of its approach to the case. 469 F.Supp. at 632 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">With respect to the commencement of the action, the court found, as to appellants\u2019 motive, that \u201c[t]he evident purpose was to secure maximum publicity harmful to the publishing defendants\u201d and that \u201c[c]learly, the purpose could not have been to litigate on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635 \u2014 36. As to the colorability of appellants\u2019 complaint, the court found that, although Nemeroff, Roth and other Technicare investors believed that Abelson was guilty of wrongdoing, \u201c[t]he suit was filed either with the knowledge that counsel had no adequate factual basis to sustain the allegations or in reckless disregard of the fact that proof of the charges was not available. In either circumstance, plaintiff and his counsel knowingly proceeded with litigation that lacked foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636. The court also stated that \u201cneither the plaintiff, his counsel, Roth, nor Stein had one iota of proof\u2014 in the sense that term is defined in a court of law \u2014 that Abelson was leaking any information to the short-selling defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. The foregoing constitute the underpinning for the court\u2019s ultimate finding that the action was commenced in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Despite the invitation by counsel that we conduct a de novo review of the facts in view of the unique character of this proceeding, we find it unnecessary to do so. <em>See Jack Kahn Music Co. v. Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co., </em>604 F.2d 755 (2 Cir. 1979); <em>New York v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>550 F.2d 745, 750-53 (2 Cir. 1977); <em>Dopp v. Franklin National Bank, </em>461 F.2d 873, 878-79 (2 Cir. 1972). As we have indicated above, note 4, <em>supra, </em>the record before us consists entirely of documents and no evidentiary hearing was held in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">We hold, based on our careful examination of the entire record, that the district court\u2019s finding that the action was commenced in bad faith was clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Central to the court\u2019s clearly erroneous ultimate finding of bad faith was the court\u2019s erroneous subordinate finding regarding Walker\u2019s knowledge of the results of the NYSE investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The general American rule governing allocation of the costs of litigation places the burden of counsel fees on each party, regardless of the outcome of the action. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975) (no \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d' exception to the general rule); <em>F. D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 126 (1974) (reversing award of fees under Miller Act where there was no explicit statutory provision). Although the origin of the so-called American rule is somewhat unclear, there is no doubt about its current vitality.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Fees can be shifted to the prevailing party under various exceptions to the general rule. The most important of these are the explicit statutory provisions which recently have proliferated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Another instance of fee-shifting is the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d exception which spreads the cost of litigation to those persons benefiting from it. <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1 (1973); <em>Mills v. Electric AutoLite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375 (1970); <em>see also Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161 (1939) (fee shifted where plaintiff established right of others to recover from specific assets through stare decisis); <em>Trustees v. Greenough, </em>105 U.S. 527 (1882). Finally, there is the exceptional power to shift fees where an action has been commenced or conducted \u201cin bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>F. D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., supra, </em>417 U.S. at 129; <em>accord, Browning Debenture Holders\u2019 Committee v. DASA Corp., </em>560 F.2d 1078 (2 Cir. 1977); <em>see also Vaughan </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>369 U.S. 527 (1962) (in admiralty, damages for failure to give maintenance and cure may include counsel fees as \u201cnecessary expenses\u201d where defendant wilfully failed to respond to plaintiff\u2019s request for such maintenance).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\"><em>Browning Debenture Holders\u2019, supra, </em>clarified the requirements for a finding of bad faith in this Circuit. We held that there must be \u201cclear evidence\u201d that the claims are \u201centirely without color <em>and </em>made for reasons of harassment or delay or for other improper purposes.\u201d 560 F.2d at 1088 (emphasis added). In the instant case we find it unnecessary to reach the question of the motives of Nemeroff or his counsel, for we hold that the claims were not \u201centirely without color\u201d at the time the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">A claim is colorable, for the purpose of the bad faith exception, when it has some legal and factual support, considered in light of the reasonable beliefs of the individual making the claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The question is whether a reasonable attorney could have concluded that facts supporting the claim <em>might be established, </em>not whether such facts actually <em>had been established.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>We hold here that a reasonable attorney could have concluded, with respect to the first count of the complaint, that there was a relationship, in some cases a close relationship, between Abelson and the investor defendants; that Abelson had made comments critical of Technicare; that the price of Technicare had declined during the period in which Abelson\u2019s columns were published; that the investor defendants had sold Technicare short; and that the NYSE had found a correlation between the Abelson columns and the pattern of short trading.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">As for the second count which alleged that the investor defendants had violated \u00a7 9(a) of the Exchange Act, we hold that a reasonable attorney could have concluded that there was an unusual pattern of short sales of Technicare stock and that this pattern of sales was intended to depress and manipulate the price of Technicare stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Even if some or all of these facts were not in fact true or might later fail to be established, that is irrelevant to the determination of bad faith under our law. These reasonable beliefs were factually and legally sufficient. To require more would promote the unwarranted abortion of many potentially meritorious claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Aside from invoking the bad faith exception to the general American rule for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, appellees also sought to ground the award on \u00a7 9(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(e),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Fed. R.Civ.P. II.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The district court concluded that the \u201cultimate question\u201d under \u00a7 9(e) and Rule 11 was \u201cwhether the plaintiff and/or counsel instituted the action \u2018in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons.\u2019 \u201d 469 F.Supp. at 637 (citing <em>Browning Debenture Holders\u2019, supra, </em>and <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 210 n.30 (1976)). Congress has enacted a number of statutory exceptions to the general rule governing attorneys\u2019 fees. Some statutes require that reasonable fees be awarded to the prevailing plaintiff; other statutes are permissive. Some permissive award statutes, such as \u00a7 9(e), authorize an award of fees by the court \u201cin its discretion\u201d. By contrast, \u00a7 11(e) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e) (1976), authorizes an award of fees to the prevailing party \u201cif the court believes the suit or the defense to have been without merit\u201d; and \u00a7 323 of the Trust Indenture Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77www(a) (1976), authorizes an award of fees \u201chaving due regard to the merits and good faith of the suit or defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Arx\">Although the language of \u00a7 9(e) makes an award of fees discretionary, the legislative history of this provision indicates that Congress included it to deter bad faith actions and \u201cstrike suits.\u201d S.Rep.No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. (1934); Loss, Securities Regulation 1836 <em>et seq. </em>(2d ed. 1961). In interpreting a substantially similar provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Supreme Court concluded that fees should be awarded \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d <em>Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421 (1978). The Court pointed out that to require less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>would defeat Congressional efforts to promote vigorous enforcement of the statute, but to require more would be unnecessary, in view of the long-standing equitable power to award fees upon a finding of bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 419-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We hold that the minimum standard for an award of fees under \u00a7 9(e) of the Exchange Act is that set forth in <em>Christianburg Garment, </em>i. e., the action must have been frivolous and without foundation. Since we have held that the instant action was not entirely without foundation, we decline to sanction the award of fees to the defendants-appellees under \u00a7 9(e). <em>See Dewitt v. American Stock Transfer Co., </em>433 F.Supp. 994 (S.D.N.Y.1977), <em>modified, </em>440 F.Supp. 1084 (fee award under substantially similar provision of Exchange Act inappropriate where claim was not frivolous); <em>see also Acker v. Shulte, </em>74 F.Supp. 683 (S.D.N.Y.1949); <em>accord, Stella v. Kaiser, </em>83 F.Supp. 431 (S.D.N.Y.1949). In view of our holding, we need not consider whether a finding of bad faith also would be required for an award of fees under \u00a7 9(e). <em>See Colonial Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Brunswick Corp., </em>337 F.Supp. 546 (S.D.N.Y.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Rule 11 speaks in plainly subjective terms: the attorney\u2019s certification of a pleading is an assertion that \u201cto the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it. \u201d The standard under Rule 11, therefore, is bad faith. <em>See Kinee v.

Our summary of the facts and prior proceedings is based upon the record before us. It consists entirely of documents, including pleadings, affidavits and depositions. No evidentia-ry hearing was held in the district court. <em>See Dopp v. Franklin National Bank, </em>461 F.2d 873, 878-79 (2 Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">.

It is consistent with these underlying goals that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>plaintiff be allowed to rely to a reasonable extent on the investigation of his counsel. Our conclusion that the instant action was not entirely without foundation, judged in the light of the information revealed by the Hale and Dorr investigation, is sufficient to insulate both Hale and Dorr and Nemeroff from a finding of bad faith. <em>See Surowitz v.

The articles in question appeared at various intervals between May 3, 1976 and the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The article .of May 3, 1976, after praising Technicare, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">\u201cAll in all, seemingly, a very bright picture. Yet, as our colleague, Steve Anreder, discovered last week after chatting with a number of sources, from makers and users of CTs to medical researchers and FDA staffers, one that still may contain a few dark spots. For one thing, we might note, Technicare\u2019s CT sales pattern is erratic: it booked 33 new orders in the March quarter, up from 16 the previous three months but only half the 66 in its opening fiscal quarter. That suggests that demand for the device may be characterized by fits and starts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">More important, while the overall market for the space-age scanners is undeniably expanding rapidly, some insiders who have made a careful study of the prospects before taking the plunge believe it will level out within several years. And perhaps most significant of all, the growth of the field seems in danger of being swiftly outstripped by the growth in the number of competitors.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">The column of June 14, 1976 made a brief negative reference to Technicare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">\u201cA few weeks back, as the basis for a somewhat skeptical comment on Technicare, we cited rising CAT fever \u2014 the proliferating number of these computer-cum-X ray items (and the proliferating number of companies rushing into the field).

Japanese have worked up an entry</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">The column of July 19, 1976 did not mention Technicare by name, but did note that the large corporations in the market, such as GE and Pfizer, were more likely to succeed in the long run.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">The column of August 16, 1976 was not written by Abelson, and did not mention Techni-care specifically. It predicted a general \u201cshakeout\u201d of the CAT scanner market.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">The column of October 11, 1976 mentioned CAT scanners in passing, and noted that Ralph Nader had been critical of the devices, without mentioning Technicare specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">The column of January 10, 1977 summarized the negative comments of the May 3, 1976 column, and went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-19\">\u201cTechnicare will continue to do well over the short run, if only because it enjoys a sizable backlog of orders built up before the states began to put on the brakes. Sooner or later, though, we\u2019d expect, the company will feel the drag of go-slow policies. Moreover, Technicare is one of the two front-runners in the field, hence, any stretch-out is likely to prove especially harmful, since it will give the competition valuable time to cut down on the company\u2019s technical lead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-20\">The columns of February 14, 1977 and February 28, 1977 involved an erroneous report by Abelson that Technicare had failed to sign a distributorship agreement, followed by a retraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-21\">The information uncovered by the Hale and Dorr investigation of course must be judged in light of the requirements for stating a cause of action under \u00a7\u00a7 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act. Thus, if there is clear evidence that a necessary element of a cause of action is not susceptible of proof, then that cause of action as a whole necessarily is without foundation. Individuals who trade in a company\u2019s stock with knowledge that a favorable or unfavorable article about that company will appear are \u201cquasi-insiders\u201d who may have a duty of disclosure.

Roth told Walker that persons executing trades for the hedge funds had disclosed to him the identities of the short sellers. The short selling of Wilson, Berman and Mintz was confirmed in information which became available later.</p>\n<p id=\"AxT\">Walker also discovered from records of the <em>Business Week </em>litigation, note 11, <em>infra, </em>that Wilson, Berman and Mintz all knew Abelson and all spoke with him periodically. Later information revealed frequent meetings during the relevant period, particularly between Abelson and Mintz.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b425-10\">. Hass\u2019 first affidavit in relevant part stated: \u201cI told Mr. Walker that the New York Stock Exchange was preparing a chart to see if there was a correlation between the short position in Technicare and Alan Abelson\u2019s columns in <em>Barron\u2019s. </em>I never at any time described for Mr. Walker the contents of such a chart. Specifically, I did not say that there was \u2018no doubt\u2019 of a relationship between the short sellers and Mr. Abelson. In fact, I believe that the chart prepared by the Stock Exchange shows that just the opposite is true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">Hass\u2019 supplemental affidavit in relevant part stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-14\">\u201cBased upon my further reflection on this matter, I believe it may be useful to supplement and clarify my prior affidavit. I do not believe that my recollection of my conversation with Mr. Walker is necessarily inconsistent with Mr. Walker\u2019s recollection. Although it is still my recollection that I did not make several of the statements attributed to me by Mr. Walker, in the context of the entire discussion I can understand how he could have come away from the conversation with the good faith impression that I had made such statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-15\">As I noted in my prior affidavit, I told Mr. Walker that I believed Ms. Donovan\u2019s testimony before the New York Stock Exchange was truthful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-16\">It was always apparent to me that Mr. Walker had a good faith belief both that this was a meritorious cause of action and that there was good ground to support it as against each of the defendants.

In 1975 <em>Business Week </em>printed an article attributing to an investor the statement that he \u201chas a golden news leak and has profited from it. He often knows in advance what Alan Abelson, the Barron\u2019s columnist will be saying.\u201d Dow Jones, Inc. and Abelson brought a libel suit, which was settled. <em>Business Week </em>printed a retraction, which provided in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201cthere was no evidence that advance information on the contents of Barron\u2019s was intentionally leaked to investors by Abelson, Barron\u2019s or Dow Jones . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In the instant case, appellees and the district court relied on a conversation which Walker had with Richard Grimm, president of Techni-care, on March 14, 1977, after his conversation with Hass and the NYSE. Grimm taped the conversation, which is set forth here in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">\u201cWALKER: ... I have no intention of bringing such a suit as this before I\u2019m sati-sifed that there is a substantial basis for it. . [R]eally in a case such as this the lawyer\u2019s responsibility is to have almost a criminal standard of liability proven before a suit such as this brought \u2014 [sic] proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">GRIMM: Is it unfair to ask you, Gordon, at this point in time what degree of comfort you have with the ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">WALKER: . It\u2019s a very difficult situation because much of the proof is documentary which we simply aren\u2019t going to be able to get until we have subpoenas. So I have some bits and pieces which I\u2019ve been able to get from people who are willing to talk to us. It certainly corroborates the story we\u2019ve been hearing, and there are a few who have stories to tell about Marc Howard, Bob Wilson and the short sellers, and these stories certainly, if true, would sustain the action. So right now I\u2019m in a position of trying to verify what I\u2019ve heard. If what I\u2019ve heard is true, then I\u2019m perfectly convinced that there is a valid cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-17\">I think, however, that it is inappropriate to focus on Barron\u2019s or Alan Abelson as being the only key to this thing. I think really more it\u2019s a concerted action on behalf of the hedge funds to manipulate the price of the shares by a pattern of short selling activity, which in itself, in my opinion, is actionable and is a manipulative device. So that\u2019s the principal focus I have at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-18\">I\u2019ve tried to make it very clear to him [Howard Roth]: No. 1 \u2014 I\u2019m not going to do much until I have some assurance that we will be paid, and No. 2 \u2014 at that time I have some more detective work, if you want to call it that, to satisfy myself that this suit should be brought. I do want to make clear, however, that I am reasonably satisfied. I think it\u2019s a very valid, legitimate cause of action, and I think it should be brought at some point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-19\">[OJnce we\u2019re satisfied that there is a substantial basis to these allegations, then I see no problem in bringing the suit. As far as the substantiation is concerned, I think we have a great deal more on the short selling, the facts of the short selling, the apparent facts, which may be a contradictions [sic] of terms, of collusion, acting in concert, manipulating the price of the shares. I also have a lot of wild stories and there are people who, as I say, I\u2019ve spoken to, who tell me some incredible things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-20\">And this is in my opinion, but this is not the basis for my attendant conclusion, is about what\u2019s going on, in a sense \u2014 that Abelson calls Mark Howard or Bob Wilson and says \u2018what do you think of Technicare\u2019 and Wilson says \u2018I think it\u2019s lousy, GE\u2019s getting into the business and I\u2019m short the stock . . \u2019 and Abelson asks a few more questions and so the person he was speaking with knows pretty well that if this sort of article goes out it increases the short position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-22\">Just for example, I pulled from Abelson\u2019s columns over the last 12 months just the names, nothing but the names of the compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>nies he\u2019s talked about and there aren\u2019t really a great number of them. If you just read Alan Abelson you think that it\u2019s a pretty small universe, and how many thousands of publicly traded companies are there. Then when we compare these names with the names of the short positions that some of these hedge funds have, the correspondence is incredible. I\u2019ve also learned from the New York Stock Exchange, although I don\u2019t have it, that they have, of course, access to a lot more information than we do, that they\u2019ve put together a chart comparing the short sales of the customers of some of their member firms with the Abelson articles, that there is a high degree of correlation. Now I got this on the telephone from someone on the phone at the exchange but when I went in to talk to them they were not about to give me any hard information. The young fellow on the phone just wanted to impress me with how important he was on the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">But I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s happening and when you put it together I think there\u2019s a substantial basis for bringing the suit. Whether there\u2019s a substantial basis for ruining Alan Abelson\u2019s reputation, at this point I don\u2019t know and that troubles me a great deal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">Far from indicating Walker\u2019s bad faith, the foregoing transcript strikes us as indicating that Walker believed that the action would be well-founded, and yet held back from commencing it because he felt he had to be particularly certain of the adequacy of the grounds for the action before risking injury to the reputation of the defendants. Although the transcript is ambiguous as to whether Walker believed the publishing defendants were leaking or the investor defendants were soliciting, one plausible interpretation is that Walker believed that Abelson\u2019s phone calls to the investor defendants were in essence deliberate leaks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b427-14\">.

In view of our holding on the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case, it is unnecessary to consider whether plaintiff\u2019s limitation of his \u00a7 9(a) claim would bar the publishing defendants from being awarded fees under \u00a7 9(e). Moreover, since we affirm the judgment below insofar as it awarded costs to the defendants-appellees under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d), it is not necessary to consider the question of costs under \u00a7 9(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b429-14\">.
