Petitioner subsequently moved the court for a reduction of sentence, and his motion was denied. In December 1978, petitioner commenced these 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1976) proceedings. The district court referred the matter to the magistrate. By coincidence, the magistrate happened to have been the Assistant United States Attorney who had represented the Government in the earlier proceedings on petitioner\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence, and, therefore, he was automatically disqualified to hear petitioner\u2019s section 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(3) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The disqualification was, unfortunately, neither noticed by the magistrate nor called to his attention by counsel, and he proceeded on to the merits of petitioner\u2019s motion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate entered findings and conclusions and recommended to the district court that petitioner\u2019s motion be denied. The district court adopted these findings and the recommendation, and denied petitioner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Because of the disqualification, we treat the proceedings and the disposition below as a nullity. Accordingly, the judgment appealed from is vacated, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
