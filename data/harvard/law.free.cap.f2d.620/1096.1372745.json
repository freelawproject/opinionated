The Secretary of Agriculture is empowered to set a national acreage allotment for rice for each calendar year. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1352 (West 1973) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>(since amended).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The national allotment is then apportioned among the rice-producing states, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1353(a) (West 1973) (operation currently suspended, <em>see </em>n. 2 <em>supra), </em>and each state in turn apportions its quota among the farmers of that state as provided in Section 1353(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Section 1353(b) authorizes two different methods of allocating a state\u2019s acreage among its farmers. These methods are called \u201cproducer\u201d allotments and \u201cfarm\u201d allotments. The \u201cproducer\u201d method was employed in Texas during the- years relevant to this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under this method, a state\u2019s acreage is apportioned to \u201cfarms owned or operated by persons who have produced rice in the [sjtate in any one of the five calendar years immediately preceding the year for which such apportionment is made on the basis of past production of rice in the \"[sjtate by the producer on the farm taking into consideration the acreage allotments previously established in the [sjtate for such owners or operators; abnormal conditions affecting acreage, land, labor, and equipment available for the production of rice, crop rotation practices, and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of rice . . ..\u201d 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1353(b) (West 1973) (suspended).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized by Section 1354(a) to determine whether the total supply of rice in a marketing year will exceed the normal supply for that year. When he makes this determination, marketing quotas go into effect for the calendar year unless more than one-third of the farmers engaged in the production of the prior year\u2019s crop oppose the quotas in a national referendum conducted by the Secretary by secret ballot. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1354(b) (West 1973) (suspended). The marketing quota for a farm is the \u201cactual production of rice on a farm less the normal production of the acreage planted to rice on the farm in excess of the farm acreage allotment.\u201d 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1355 (West 1973) (suspended). The excess of rice produced is called \u201cfarm marketing excess,\u201d <em>id., </em>and is subject to a penalty of 65 percent of the parity price per pound for rice as of June 15 of the calendar year in which the crop is produced. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1356(a) (West 1973) (suspended). The result of these provisions is that in any year in which the Secretary of Agriculture determines that a surplus of rice exists and two-thirds of the nation\u2019s rice farmers concur, the possessor of a rice allotment may market a quantity of rice free from a substantial tax levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">The statutory scheme also created an interest which is referred to as \u201chistory of rice production\u201d or \u201crice history acreage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1353(f) (West 1973) (suspended). This interest gives its owner the right to be apportioned rice acreage as if the owner himself had produced in prior years the rice that was produced in those years by the transferor of the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>The statutory scheme provides for the transfer of this interest. When a rice producer in a \u201cproducer\u201d state dies, the transfer of his \u201chistory of rice production\u201d is governed by 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1353(f)(1) (added by Act of March 6, 1962, Pub.L.No. 87-412, 76 Stat. 20) (currently suspended), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-4\">If a producer in a [s]tate in which farm rice acreage allotments are determined on the basis of past production of rice by the producer on the farm, dies, his history of rice production shall be apportioned in whole or in part among his heirs or devi-sees according to the extent to which they may continue, or have continued, his farming operations, if satisfactory proof of such succession of farming operations is furnished the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">If a rice producer in a producer state wishes to transfer his \u201crice history acreage\u201d to another, subsections 1353(f)(2) and (3) govern.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A producer may transfer his interest to other members of his family with relative ease, see <em>id., </em>subsection (f)(2), but more stringent conditions apply when the transferee is not a member of the transferor\u2019s family. In this case, the transferor must permanently withdraw from rice production; and the transferee must have prior rice-producing experience, must acquire the entire farming operation pertaining to rice, except for land and irrigation equipment permanently attached to the land, and must actually plant at least 90 percent of his total producer rice acreage allotment in at least three of the four years following the transfer. <em>See id., </em>subsection (f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">It must be understood that a \u201cproducer rice allotment\u201d is an interest entirely different from \u201crice history acreage.\u201d A \u201cproducer rice allotment\u201d for a year gives a rice producer the right to grow and market in that year a number of acres of rice free from payment of the penalty levied by Section 1356. This right only relates to the year of the allotment. \u201cRice history acreage,\u201d in contrast, is an interest that entitles its owner to receive \u201cproducer rice allotments\u201d each year that the rice allotment program is in operation. At least ninety-seven percent of a state\u2019s acreage allotment for a year must be apportioned to farms operated by persons who produced rice in the state in at least one of the five prior years. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1353(b), <em>supra. </em>Thus, possession of \u201crice history acreage,\u201d although not an absolute statutory prerequisite to the receipt of \u201cproducer rice allotments,\u201d substantially increases the likelihood of receiving \u201cproducer rice allotments\u201d each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-15\">The statutory scheme appears to <em>require </em>that a national acreage allotment be set and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>then apportioned in each year. <em>See </em>7 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1352 &amp; 1353, <em>supra. </em>However, in years in which farm marketing quotas are not in effect, the allotment program has no effect because there is no penalty for growing rice without allotments in those years. Since the administrative costs of apportioning the allotments in such a year would serve no useful purpose, it is likely that no allotments would be issued in a year in which marketing quotas were not in operation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">Although the statutory scheme makes no provision for the transfer of \u201cproducer rice allotments,\u201d it does contemplate and provide for the transfer of \u201crice history acreage.\u201d <em>See </em>pp. 1097-1098, <em>supra. </em>The regulations promulgated by the Department of Agriculture which were in effect in 1973, however, permit the transfer of producer rice allotments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They contain no separate provisions for the transfer of \u201crice history acreage;\u201d however, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>contemplate that a producer\u2019s rice acreage history will always be transferred along with the producer\u2019s rice allotments. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 730.76, n.9 <em>supra. </em>The regulations create a \u201cseason\u201d for trading in rice allotments which runs from the issuance of the allotments (allotments appear to have ordinarily been issued on approximately January 1) until the end of March. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 730.72 &amp; 730.76, <em>supra. </em>For a transfer of an allotment to be effective, a number of conditions must be met, one of which is that certain information must be furnished the county committee by April 1. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 730.76(a)(2), <em>supra. </em>The April 1 date can be extended, but only if certain fairly stringent conditions are met. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 730.76(a)(3), \u00a7 730.72(b). Ordinarily, the allotments must be allocated to the producer\u2019s farms by May 1 or they will not be taken into consideration in the establishment of the marketing quota for each farm, although the May 1 date will also be waived under certain circumstances. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 730.-72(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">II. <em>Facts and Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"ahy-dedup-0\">With the statutory and regulatory framework in mind, we turn to the facts and procedural history of this case. .The facts are undisputed. The decedent, T. J. Babb, died on July 4,1973. He had been engaged for many years in the production of rice, and had annually been granted rice allotments under the Act since at least 1958. By notices dated December 1, 1972, and May 1, 1973, Babb was issued producer rice allotments of 1208.3 acres. Prior to the deadline of May 1,1973, in compliance with the applicable regulations, Babb allocated his 1973 allotment to farms on which he intended to produce rice for the crop year 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">At the time of his death, no producer rice allotment for 1974 had been determined for or issued to Babb. After Babb\u2019s death, by notice dated March 28,1974, a producer rice allotment of 1142.6 acres was issued to his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">The estate tax return filed by the First Victoria National Bank, appellee here, as executor included no amount for either the value of decedent\u2019s interests in the rice allotment program or the value of the rice crop growing on July 4,1973. After examination of the return by an agent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>Internal Revenue Service, the Service determined that items of $50,000, representing the value of crops growing on July 4, 1973, and $285,600,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> representing the value of decedent\u2019s rice producer allotment and rice production history, were includable in the gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">Appellee paid, under protest, the deficiency of $89,265.00 plus interest created by inclusion of the item valued at $285,600,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and filed a claim to recover that deficiency plus interest. Appellee asserted the rice allotment system created no \u201cproperty\u201d possessed by decedent on the date of his death, and, alternatively, that if any such \u201cproperty\u201d was includable in the estate, the \u201cproperty\u201d had no market value on the date of his death. The claim was denied, and this suit was filed by appellee in federal district court. Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) (West 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Each party filed a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Annexed to its motion, the United States filed an affidavit of its trial attorney enumerating 31 sales of rice allotments in Texas in 1973. All of these sales occurred in the months of January, February, and March, at prices which ranged from $192 to $300 per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion, ruling that (1) on July 4, 1973, decedent\u2019s 1973 rice allotment was \u201cused up\u201d and its value merged with the growing crops (which were valued at. $50,000), (2) decedent\u2019s history of rice production did not constitute property for estate tax purposes, and (3) there was no transfer of rice history upon Babb\u2019s death because any transfer was conditional upon subsequent events; to wit, that the transferees continue the rice farming operations. <em>See First Victoria National Bank (Babb) v. U.S., </em>443 F.Supp. 865 (S.D.Tex.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">III. <em>Is the value of \u201crice history acreage\u201d includable in decedent\u2019s estate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">The proper resolution of this appeal turns on whether \u201crice history acreage\u201d is \u201cproperty\u201d within the contemplation of I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2031 &amp; 2033, n. 1 <em>supra. </em>As we attempt to resolve this question, we necessarily must wrestle with the meaning of the label \u201cproperty.\u201d Documentation of the history and derivation of many interests which are today denominated \u201cproperty\u201d would require philosophers, professors of jurisprudence, and scholars of economics to call upon their full erudition and exegetic talents. The shelves of our jurisprudence are tomed with obituaries of species of property long ago tolled. Announcements of the nascence of other species which were unheard of and unspeculated upon centuries ago populate further volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">Although the varieties of property may not be infinite, any attempt to enumerate every species of property would beggar the mind and intellect of even the wisest of persons. Avoiding this Sisyphian endeavor, we embark on a Delphian one. As we begin, we must remind ourselves that \u201cproperty\u201d is an expansionist term. Its mooring is contemporary rather than historical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">The attempt to define \u201cproperty\u201d is an elusive task. There is no cosmic synoptic definiens that can encompass its range. The word is at times more cognizable than recognizable. It is not capable of anatomical or lexicographical definition or proof. It devolves upon the court to fill in the definitional vacuum with the substance of the economics of our time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>The Restatement of Property uses the word \u201cproperty\u201d to denote legal relations between persons with respect to a thing, see 1 Restatement of Property 3 (1936), but does not attempt to define which \u201cthings\u201d constitute \u201cproperty.\u201d The Supreme Court has said that \u201c[t]he accurate delimitation of the concept \u2018property\u2019 would afford a theme especially apposite for amplificative philosophic disquisition.\" <em>Gleason v. Thaw, </em>236 U.S. 558, 660, 35 S.Ct. 287, 288, 59 L.Ed. 717 (1915). Legal encyclopedias can provide us an interminable string of definitions suggested by various courts. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., </em>73 C.J.S. <em>Property </em>\u00a7 1 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">Some kinds of property known to the English common law never made the transatlantic voyage to our shores. Other kinds have died out over the years, and new forms have taken their place. Blackstone once attempted to enumerate the varieties of incorporeal hereditaments, listing ten: advowsons, tithes, commons, ways, offices, dignities, franchises, corodies, annuities, and rents. 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 21. Even these ten could be further subdivided; the general term advowson,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for example, includes advowson appendant, ad-vowson in gross, advowson presentative, ad-vowson donative, advowson collactive, ad-vowson of the moiety of the church, a moiety of advowson, and advowson of religious houses. <em>Id. </em>at 22; 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary 157 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">These types of property are no less foreign to contemporary American law than the statutorily-created interests known as \u201cproducer rice allotments\u201d and \u201crice history acreage\u201d would have been to Blackstone. \u201cProperty\u201d evolves over time. It can be described as the bundle of rights<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> attached to things conferred by law or custom, or as everything of value which a person owns that is or may be the subject of sale or exchange. <em>See </em>73 C.J.S. <em>Property </em>\u00a7 1 (1951). Both of these definitions contemplate the possibility that law or custom may create property rights where none were earlier thought to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">An example of this development can be seen in the \u201cright of publicity.\u201d Once thought to be a personal, non-assignable right emanating from the right of privacy, the \u201cright of publicity\u201d evolved into a legally-protected, transferable interest. <em>See, e. g., Haelan Laboratories v. Topps Chewing Gum, </em>202 F.2d 866, 868 (2d Cir. 1953). Recently, courts have been faced with the next question relating to the \u201cright of publicity\u201d \u2014 whether this right is devisable. Some courts have held that under some circumstances the right survives death and can be devised, <em>see, e. g., Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc., </em>579 F.2d 215 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>Hicks v. Casablanca Records, </em>464 F.Supp. 426 (S.D.N.Y.1978); others that the right terminates at death, <em>see, e. g., Memphis Development Foundation v. Factors Etc., Inc., </em>616 F.2d 956 (6th Cir. 1980); <em>see generally </em>Flecher <em>&amp; </em>Rubin, <em>Privacy, Publicity, and the Portrayal of Real People by the Media, </em>88 Yale L.J. 1577 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">In the \u201cright of publicity\u201d context, the courts have realized that the tag \u201cproperty\u201d expresses a legal conclusion rather than any independent meaning, <em>see Haelan Laboratories, supra, </em>202 F.2d at 868, but have nevertheless labelled the right \u201cproperty.\u201d <em>See Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc., supra, </em>579 F.2d at 221. An interest labelled \u201cproperty\u201d normally may possess certain characteristics: it can be transferred to others; it can be devised and inherited; it can descend to heirs at law; it can be levied upon to satisfy a judgment; it comes under the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court in a bankruptcy proceeding;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it will be protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>ed against invasion by the courts; it cannot be taken away without due process of law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">An interest may qualify as \u201cproperty\u201d for some purposes -even though it lacks some of these attributes. For example, an individual can have a \u201cproperty\u201d right in his job, see, e. <em>g., Perry v. Sinderman, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), so that he cannot be fired without appropriate procedural safeguards; yet the job is not assignable, transferable, descendible, or devisable. The \u201cright to publicity\u201d is transferable during life, see <em>Haelan Laboratories, supra, </em>but may not be devisable. <em>Compare Memphis Development Foundation, supra </em>(right terminates at death), <em>with Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc., supra </em>(right may survive death).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Possible revocability is not a destroyer. \"Ifs,\u201d \u201cmaybes,\u201d modifiers, and contingencies might negate the concept of property. But we must be certain that the analysis is a pragmatic one, not a theoretical one. So long as an interest is not \u201e chimerical, it should fall within the broad reach of ,the taxing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">The word \u201cproperty\u201d in the statute is not limited in its scope by concepts of property that existed when the estate tax was conceived. When property rights have come into existence since the statute\u2019s enactment, the generalized term must be expounded, and the terrain cartographed, by laborers in the fields of law and government. The economy and many of the elements of life today are different than they were even a generation or less ago. The Congress in its wisdom decided to use a general word like property rather than trying to envision what the ingenuity of man would evolve as something substantial. The tax gatherer is directed to seek out the esoterics of ownership and reap his share of an individual\u2019s harvest of bundles of rice upon his demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">The precise question before us is whether \u201crice acreage history\u201d is \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of the estate tax laws. In deciding this question, we start with the basic principle that \u201cunless there is some special reason intrinsic to the particular provision [under consideration] . . ., the general word \u2018property\u2019 has a broad reach in tax law.\u201d <em>DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>471 F.2d 1211, 1218, 200 Ct.Cl. 391 (1973). Appellee has presented us with a number of reasons which, it contends, suffice to exclude the value of Babb\u2019s \u201crice history acreage\u201d from his gross estate. We address appellee\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">Appellee contends that on July 4, 1973, the date of Babb\u2019s death, Babb had no interest that could be transferred. Appel-lee is correct that the 1973 allotment was \u201cused up\u201d in that it had already been allocated to certain farms and was absorbed into the rice marketing quota for those farms.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, appellee is not correct that the \u201ccurrent allotment\u201d is \u201cthe only thing the producer can deal with or use.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-14\">On July 4, 1973, Babb also possessed the \u201crice history acreage\u201d of his prior production. It is true that this \u201crice history acreage\u201d was of no further use in 1973, and, as appellee earnestly contends, that Babb had no enforceable right to any specific number of acres of producer rice allotment, or even to <em>any </em>future producer rice allotment at all, on the date of his death. It may even be true that, under the Department of Agriculture\u2019s regulations, Babb\u2019s rice acreage history could not have been transferred on July 4, 1973.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Babb did pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>sess \u201crice history acreage,\u201d an incorporeal, intangible possession that may or may not have entitled him to receive other rights (specifically, producer rice allotments and farm marketing quotas) in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Appellee relies heavily on <em>Hudspeth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>519 F.2d 1055 (5th Cir. 1975) (per curiam), a case involving the deducti-bility of a decrease in taxpayer\u2019s cotton allotment acreage<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> as a business loss under section 165(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. <em>Hudspeth </em>held that variations in a taxpayer\u2019s cotton allotment acreage from year to year do not constitute closed transactions for tax purposes,- so that no loss is deductible when a taxpayer\u2019s acreage is decreased. <em>See id. </em>at 1056. Noting that the cotton allotment scheme creates a reasonable expectancy that some cotton allotment will be assigned each year but that it neither contemplates, nor creates an enforceable right to, a constant acreage allotment from year to year, the court stated that \u201cfrom a pure property law standpoint, an allotment carries no vested rights to acreage allotments in future years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ap-pellee relies heavily on this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">However, appellee fails to note the succeeding paragraph of the <em>Hudspeth </em>opinion, which clearly distinguishes current year crop allotments from production history. \u201c[T]he taxpayers lost no part of their property in 1971. They continued to own during all of 1971 the production history which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>would entitle their lands to cotton acreage allotments in future years . . . <em>Id. </em>As we read <em>Hudspeth, </em>it supports the position of the United States by recognizing that crop allotment programs create two distinct types of interests: current year acreage allotments and production histories. The former interest creates no vested right which lasts beyond the current year; the latter, however, survives from year-to-year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">Appellee next contends that \u201call Babb had when he died was an expectancy that he might receive future allotments if they were issued and if they were issued on the basis of history of production.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 16. We cannot accept this contention, because Babb did have a <em>legally-enforceable right </em>to receive future allotments if they were issued, if they were issued on the basis of history of production. If rice allotments based on history of production were, issued in a year, and an owner of production history were refused his appropriate allotment, the owner of production history would be able to enforce his rights by a bill in equity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Williamson, supra, </em>232 F.Supp. at 480 (tobacco allotments enforceable by bill in equity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">The grain of truth in appellee\u2019s statement is that an owner of production history has no enforceable right to a continuation of the allotment program or to any specific number of acres of allotment until the national acreage allotment and apportionment factors for a given year are established. Appellee contends that in this situation the value of the expectancy cannot be included in the value of the estate of its owner. It argues that an extensive line of cases dealing with payments made to a named beneficiary or to the estate of a decedent by his employer are controlling.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> These cases are not relevant here. The leading case cited by appellee is <em>Dimock </em>v. <em>Corwin, </em>19 F.Supp. 56 (E.D.N.Y.1937), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>99 F.2d 799 (2d Cir. 1938), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>306 U.S. 363, 59 S.Ct. 551, 83 L.Ed. 763 (1939). As it states, in cases in which an expectancy of a payment to a named beneficiary upon one\u2019s death is sought to be included in a decedent\u2019s estate, \u201cthe precise property of the decedent is asserted to [be] his right . \u2018to designate the beneficiary of his death benefit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. This \u201cright\u201d cannot be sold or assigned by decedent, <em>see id. </em>at 59, nor does the \u201cright\u201d pass to the decedent\u2019s heirs. The \u201cright\u201d is thus entirely unlike \u201crice history acreage,\u201d which is, as we have noted, transferable, devisable, and descendible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">We find the analogy to the good will of a business to be more apt. No one can seriously doubt that good will is an asset whose value is includable in its owner\u2019s estate. <em>See First National Bank of Memphis v. Henslee, </em>74 F.Supp. 106 (M.D.Tenn.1947); <em>Estate of A. Bluestein, </em>15 T.C. 770, 786-88 (1950). Yet good will is an intangible asset which, like \u201crice history acreage,\u201d has value only because it carries the expectancy of receiving future assets of more concrete value. Like \u201crice history acreage\u201d good will is an asset whose value may evaporate overnight.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Like \u201crice history acreage\u201d, good will can be sold or devised. Like \u201crice history acreage\u201d, good will is ordinarily transferred along with other assets (in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>case of good will, a business; in the ease of rice acreage history, a rice farm).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\">Moreover, such expectancies as a right to compensation under a contingent fee contract, <em>see Duffield v. United States, </em>136 F.Supp. 944 (E.D.Pa.1955), and a promise to return property to an estate if other property is insufficient to meet the estate\u2019s tax obligations, <em>see Welch v. Hall, </em>134 F.2d 366 (1st Cir. 1943), have been held to be \u201cproperty\u201d includable in a decedent\u2019s estate. \u201cRice history acreage\u201d is no less certain an interest than these.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">Appellee also contends that the value of Babb\u2019s rice acreage history cannot be included in his estate because neither Babb nor his executor could control the transfer of the rice acreage history after Babb\u2019s death. The rice acreage history does not pass by will or by the laws of descent, appellee argues, but under the statute and regulations to those who continue his farming operations. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1353(f)(1) (West 1973) (suspended); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 730.-76(b)(1) (1973) (repealed), <em>supra </em>n. 9. However, it is undeniable that Babb\u2019s farms, including his rice farming operations, could pass either by testamentary bequest or by descent, and that in fact they passed under his will. His rice acreage history passed, along with his rice operations, to the persons he desired to inherit both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">Appellee may be attempting to emphasize the fact that an attempted testamentary transfer of rice acreage history along with the farming operations will be ineffective unless the heirs or devisees \u201cfurnish the county committee in writing . . . the names and addresses of the heirs or devi-sees and the extent each will continue the farming operations of the deceased.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 730.76(b)(1) (1973) (repealed). We attach no estate tax significance to the fact that the heirs or devisees must file a piece of paper with the county committee to establish their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-13\">We also fail to find convincing appellee\u2019s strained attempt to analogize \u201crice history acreage\u201d to an interest created after death, like a cause of action for wrongful death, <em>see Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, </em>465 F.2d 760 (2d Cir. 1972), or to Social Security survivors\u2019 benefits, <em>see </em>Rev. Rul. 67-277, 1967-2 C.B. 322. We note the crucial distinction that neither a cause of action for wrongful death nor Social Security survivors\u2019 benefits can ever be transferred by a decedent prior to his death. Each of these interests is \u201ccreated\u201d only upon a decedent\u2019s death, whereas Babb possessed rice acreage history prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-14\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-15\">\u201cRice acreage history\u201d is not only devisa-ble and descendible, but also transferable <em>inter vivos. </em>Those heirs who inherited Babb\u2019s rice farming operations, by filing the requisite document with the county commission, were able to retain possession of the \u201crice history acreage\u201d possessed by Babb the moment before his death. They could have converted the value of the rice acreage history into cash by selling it to others by early 1974, if not earlier.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When an interest possesses these attributes, there can be no doubt that its value must be included in the owner\u2019s estate, for the focus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>of the estate tax is on the passage of an interest at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Because the court below erred in holding that the value of Babb\u2019s \u201crice history acreage\u201d could not be included in the value of his estate, we must reverse the grant of summary judgment on this point. In remanding for a determination of the value of Babb\u2019s \u201crice acreage history,\u201d we caution that the value of the \u201crice acreage history\u201d must be separated from the value of a rice allotment for a year. Babb\u2019s 1973 rice allotment had been \u201cused up\u201d and its value had merged with that of the growing crops. However, on the date of his death, Babb also possessed \u201crice history acreage.\u201d The value of his \u201crice history acreage\u201d was properly includable in his gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">In early 1973, rice allotments and related production history were traded in Texas at prices in the vicinity of $200 to $300 per acre. This price included both (a) the right to market a quantity of rice in 1973 free from the penalty tax, and (b) the right to be considered for any rice allotments granted in years 1974-78 on the basis of the seller\u2019s history of production, for so long as the rice allotment program continued. On remand, the court must separate the value of the interests which were traded into these two parts to determine the value of the second part (\u201crice history acreage\u201d) for inclusion in the value of Babb\u2019s estate. Although the fair market value of production history may properly reflect a discount because of any uncertainties surrounding the continuation of the rice allotment program, these uncertainties were already reflected in the market price of the combined allotments and related history which were traded in early 1973. Thus, once the fair market value of the combined interests in early 1973 is determined, and the value of the right to market rice in 1973 is subtracted, the only further discount that should be necessary is to allow for any new uncertainties concerning the future of the rice allotment program which arose between the 1973 rice allotment trading season and July 4, 1973. Of course, any such uncertainties must be evaluated as they would have appeared to the market on July 4,1973, rather ' than through hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1176-15\">.

Appellee contends that the United States has conceded this point, but the United States denies having made any such concession, and our review of the record reveals none. The regulations are not at all clear on the transferability of acreage history in July. As noted earlier, <em>see </em>p. 1101 <em>supra, </em>the regulations make no provision for the transfer of \u201crice acreage history\u201d independent of a current year\u2019s \u201cproducer rice allotment.\u201d Appel-lee interprets this lacuna to mean that \u201crice acreage history\u201d cannot be transferred independently. Since the \u201ctrading season\u201d for producer rice allotments ends on April 1, appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>contends that any attempt to transfer \u201crice acreage history\u201d in July would be \u201cnull and void, unenforceable and without legal effect.\u201d In support of this proposition, appellee cites <em>McClung v. Thompson, </em>401 F.2d 253 (8th Cir. 1968), <em>Chandler v. David, </em>350 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1965), <em>Allen v. David, </em>334 F.2d 592 (5th Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 967, 85 S.Ct. 660, 13 L.Ed.2d 560 (1965), and <em>Williamson v. Holland, </em>232 F.Supp. 479 (E.D.N.C.1963). None of these cases supports appellee\u2019s position. <em>McClung, supra, </em>involved a purported transfer of a farm rice allotment in violation of the regulations then in effect. These regulations were interpreted to prohibit the transfer of a rice allotment from one person to another. The court held that the purported transfer did not operate to transfer the allotment because \u201cto permit owners to enter into an arrangement for the transfer of a crop allotment in disregard of the regulations would be contrary to the general scheme and purpose of the Agricultural Adjustment Act.\u201d <em>McClung, supra, </em>401 F.2d at 257. <em>Chandler, supra, </em>involved a purported transfer of a cotton allotment to another farmer, despite regulations which only permitted its transfer to other farms owned by the owner of the cotton allotment. <em>Allen, supra, </em>held that judicial review of a cancellation of rice acreage allotments and farm marketing quotas was available only under the procedures laid out by the Agricultural Adjustment Act. <em>Williamson, supra, </em>involved an action for judicial review of a tobacco acreage allotment which plaintiffs alleged was less than their entitlement under the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">As we interpret these cases, none is inconsistent with the transferability of \u201crice history acreage.\u201d Even if one must comply with the regulations governing the transfer of \u201cproducer rice allotments\u201d in order to effectively transfer \u201crice acreage history,\u201d nothing in these four cases is inconsistent with the enforceability of a contract entered into in July which provides that a producer\u2019s \u201crice acreage history\u201d is transferred to another producer, and that the following winter the transferor producer will take all actions required by the regulations to effectuate the transfer of his following years\u2019 rice allotment and all of his rice history acreage to the transferee. To the extent that anything in the regulations is inconsistent with the enforceability of such a contract, the regulations would have to be struck down, since nothing in the statutory scheme contemplates limiting the transferability of \u201crice history acreage\u201d to certain seasons of the year, and because no administrative goal could be served by holding such a contract unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">Moreover, even if the regulations can and do effectively limit the transferability of \u201crice history acreage\u201d to the January through March \u201ctrading season,\u201d such a restriction on transferability would not necessarily mean that Babb owned nothing of value on the date of his death. Restrictions on transferability, and even absolute prohibitions on transferability for a period of time, may affect the <em>value </em>of property, but do not control whether an interest is \u201cproperty.\u201d <em>See generally Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Pearl Gibbons Reynolds, </em>55 T.C. 172 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">. Although the rice and cotton allotment programs have many similarities, we have not studied the cotton allotment program carefully enough to determine whether its provisions are sufficiently similar to those for rice that their tax treatment will always be identical. For present purposes, we are willing to assume that the cases relied upon by appellee involving the tax consequences of cotton allotments are applicable to comparable situations involving rice allotments. <em>See generally </em>Westfall, \u201cAgricultural Allotments as Property,\u201d 79 Harv.L.Rev. 1180, 1188 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">. The statutory review scheme, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361-68 (West 1973) actually allows review of farm marketing quotas rather than the allotments themselves. As we noted earlier, however, see p. 1099 <em>supra, </em>the allotment itself has no utility other than entitling its holder to a marketing quota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">. <em>Estate of Bogley, </em>514 F.2d 1027 (Ct.Cl.1975); <em>In re Wadewitz Estate, </em>339 F.2d 980 (7th Cir. 1964); <em>Garber\u2019s Estate v.
