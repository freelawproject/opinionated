The ordinance conditioned the offering of religious matter door-to-door upon obtaining a permit. The trial court found unbridled discretion in the sheriff to disapprove such permits and accordingly held the ordinance unconstitutional. Subsequently, appellant filed a motion for an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The trial judge denied the motion. The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">A prevailing party in a civil rights action such as this is ordinarily entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust. <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263. Congress contemplated this standard in enacting the attorney\u2019s fee award amendment to \u00a7 1988. S.Rep.No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 5908. This in part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">\u201cIt is intended that the standards for awarding fees be generally the same as under the fee provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A party seeking to enforce the rights protected by the statutes covered by S.2278, if successful, \u2018should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402 [88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263] (1968).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA3\"><em>See Francia v. White, </em>594 F.2d 778 (10th Cir.). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 reads in applicable part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">\u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">The lower court based its denial of the motion for attorney\u2019s fees on its finding that defendants acted in good faith and that an award of attorney\u2019s fees would be unjust. The attorney\u2019s fee amendment to \u00a7 1988 contains no suggestion that there is a need to establish bad faith as a basis for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Gates v. Collier, </em>559 F.2d 241 (5th Cir.). This court recently affirmed an award of \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees against defendants without a good faith or bad faith condition. <em>Battle v. Anderson, </em>614 F.2d 251 (10th Cir.). In <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522, the Supreme Court gave the Act a broad interpretation and affirmed an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 against a good faith defendant. Thus the good faith of the defendant is not a reason for the denial of \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-19\">The trial court also stated that the award of fees would be \u201cunjust.\u201d Under the decisions the presence of good faith is not a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d as the term is used in the Senate Report quoted above. The record before us contains nothing which would constitute \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d A similar Green River ordinance in another Wyoming city had been declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>unconstitutional shortly before, and the movants had sought to work out the differences in meetings with the city attorney and the city police. The suit thus became the only course open to movants according to this record. While there have been decisions denying attorney\u2019s fees as unjust, these have been few and very limited. For example, one court declined to assess attorney\u2019s fees against defendants who were powerless to provide the remedy sought by the prevailing plaintiff. <em>Consumers Union of United States </em>v. <em>American Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>470 F.Supp. 1055 (E.D.Va.) (three-judge court), <em>prob. juris, noted, </em>444 U.S. 914, 100 S.Ct. 226, 62 L.Ed.2d 168. The court did assess attorney\u2019s fees against the remaining defendants. Another court denied attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party whose conduct the court found outrageous. <em>Scheriff v. Beck, </em>452 F.Supp. 1254, 1260 (D.Colo.) (Plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201cwas precipitated by an irrational, deliberate scheme to involve [defendant] in some type of litigation.\u201d). We perceive in the record before us no extraordinary or unusual factors that would render an award of attorney\u2019s fees unjust. Plaintiff challenged as unconstitutional an ordinance and prevailed under well-settled first amendment principles after attempts to negotiate had failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We remand the case for the trial court\u2019s determination of attorney\u2019s fees within the discretion provided by \u00a7 1988. <em>Lund v. Affleck, </em>587 F.2d 75 (1st Cir.). <em>See EEOC v. Safeway Stores, </em>597 F.2d 251 (10th Cir.), and <em>Gagne v. Maher, </em>594 F.2d 336 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>444 U.S. 824, 100 S.Ct. 44, 62 L.Ed.2d 30 argued, 48 U.S. L.W. 3449 (U.S. Jan. 9,1980). It is well-settled that the ACLU is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. <em>Dennis v. Chang, </em>611 F.2d 1302 (9th Cir.); <em>Reynolds v. Coomey, </em>567 F.2d 1166 (1st Cir.). In its determination the court should consider the factors listed in the House Report (No. 1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 8), and the Senate Report (No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 6), and such other factors as the court deems pertinent. Counsel for appellee strongly urged on appeal that a plaintiff\u2019s ability to pay is a special circumstance which could render an award of attorney\u2019s fees unjust. Because the record is undeveloped on this issue, we express no opinion on whether a trial court may consider ability to pay in exercising its discretion to award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Awards of attorney\u2019s fees under this Act should be supported by findings of fact sufficient to demonstrate how the conclusion was reached. <em>See Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, </em>611 F.2d 624 (6th Cir.); <em>Davis v. Fletcher, </em>598 F.2d 469 (5th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Plaintiff is also entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for work done on appeal, <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 693-700, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2575-2578, and for work done in resolving the fee issue itself, <em>Bagby v. Beal, </em>606 F.2d 411 (3d Cir.). These two factors should also be included in the consideration given by the trial court, and fees for work in this court should thus be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
