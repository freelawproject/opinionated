(the Center) petitions us to review and set aside, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or the Board) cross-petitions us to enforce, the Board\u2019s order, 245 NLRB No. 106 (1979), entered after this court had vacated a previous order, 236 NLRB 497 (1978), and remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with our opinion, 589 F.2d 1166 (1978). The initial order found that the Center had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to recognize, bargain with, or provide certain information concerning employees to the New York State Federation of Physicians and Dentists (the Union) which the Board had certified after elections conducted at the Center\u2019s Mary Immaculate and St. Mary\u2019s Hospital Divisions, and that the Center had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) by suspending for three weeks, in the two certified units, the salary increase reviews that were routinely accorded other salaried physicians and dentists. We held in our earlier opinion, with which familiarity is assumed, that the Board erred in reaching its \u00a7 8(a)(5) determination by limiting its consideration of the Center\u2019s objections to the election, which were based on supervisory activity on behalf of the Union, to those activities occurring after the filing of the later of two election petitions, 589 F.2d at 1169-74; at the very least, we directed, the Board must consider supervisory conduct occurring subsequent to the filing of the first petition. With respect to the \u00a7 8(a)(3) charge, we concluded that the Center, although acting in good faith, had indeed committed an unfair labor practice, albeit \u201cone of the most inconsequential unfair labor practice in the history of the National Labor Relations Act\u201d, 589 F.2d at 1174-75; and we directed the Board to reconsider its decision to proceed with this charge in the light of the reevaluation of the \u00a7 8(a)(5) charge which was necessary in any event. 589 F.2d at 1174-75. We also set aside the \u201cbroad order\u201d which the Board had inexplicably entered, and directed that \u201cthe cease and desist provisions of such order, if any, as may hereafter be entered shall be limited to the unfair labor practices found and other like or related unlawful acts.\u201d 589 F.2d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-17\">Predictably the Board concluded that, after extending its scrutiny of supervisory support for the Union to include activities going back to the first petition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and view<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ing still earlier acts and statements as lending \u201cmeaning and dimension\u201d to post-petition activities, see 245 NLRB No. 106 fn. 16, \u201cthe evidence of supervisory conduct in support of the Federation did not impair the employees\u2019 freedom of choice in the election or constitute interference which would warrant setting aside the election,\u201d <em>id. </em>at p. 80. It also adhered to its earlier finding of a \u00a7 8(a)(3) violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, it narrowed the scope of its previous order as we had directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In its discussion of the \u00a7 8(a)(5) charge the Board noted, p. 78, that \u201cmere supervisory participation in a union\u2019s organizational campaign does not necessarily warrant setting aside an election\u201d but that such participation could require that result where \u201c(1) employees may be led to believe the supervisor was acting on behalf of the employer and that the employer favors the union; and (2) employees could reasonably have been coerced out of fear of future retaliation by union-oriented supervisors into supporting the union.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In view of the Center\u2019s vigorous campaign against the Union, we agree with the Board\u2019s conclusion that the case does not fall within category (1); the issue concerns category (2). If we were the decisionmakers, we might be inclined to rule that the election was tainted in light of the possible impact of supervisory efforts on the Union\u2019s behalf. See <em>NLRB v. Handy Hardware Wholesale, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 935, 938 (5 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 954, 97 S.Ct. 2675, 53 L.Ed.2d 271 (1977); <em>Turner\u2019s Express, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>456 F.2d 289, 292-93 (4 Cir. 1972). However, we need not decide this. Determination of the effect of the supervisors\u2019 conduct is essentially a matter of drawing inferences, and it has long been settled that an agency\u2019s conclusions based upon such inferences should not be set aside by a reviewing court unless they transgress the bounds of reason. See, e. g., <em>FTC v. Pacific States Paper Ass\u2019n, </em>273 U.S. 52, 63, 47 S.Ct. 255, 258, 71 L.Ed. 534 (1927); <em>Radio Officers Union v. NLRB, </em>347 U.S. 17, 48-52, 74 S.Ct. 323, 339-341, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954); <em>consolo v. FMC, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1967). We cannot say that the Board transgressed these bounds by inferring that the supervisors\u2019 pro-Union activities left employee freedom of choice in an election unimpaired; the case might well stand differently if the Union had sought recognition on the basis of holding a majority of authorization cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">With respect to the \u00a7 8(a)(3) charge, we previously found a violation in the Center\u2019s three-week suspension of salary review effected without consulting the Union, 589 F.2d at 1174. While we adhere to our view that the violation was inconsequential under all the circumstances, this case is distinguishable from those in which the Board has applied a <em>de minimis </em>doctrine, see 589 F.2d at 1175 n.ll, and the choice whether or not to proceed with such trivia is for the General Counsel and the Board, rather than for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Petition for review denied; cross-petition to enforce granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-18\">. Although our opinion permitted the Center to attack more generally the rule of <em>Ideal Electric </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>&amp; Manufacturing Co., </em>134 NLRB 1275, 1277-78 (1961), limiting the Board\u2019s scrutiny of objections to an election to conduct between the filing of a petition and the election, see 589 F.2d at 1172 n.6, the Center apparently did not press this argument. See its Brief in this court p. 30 fn.*, but see the Board\u2019s opinion, p. 76. Its argument was rather that if the period after the filing of the first petition is scrutinized and still earlier activities are consulted for \u201cmeaning and dimension\u201d, the Board must necessarily conclude that the election was tainted. In any event the Center does not challenge the <em>Ideal Electric </em>rule in its Brief to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">. In footnote 23 to the Board\u2019s opinion, Member Penello, citing earlier expressions of his to similar effect, noted that if the \u00a7 8(a)(3) violation stood alone, he \u201cwould not consign the Board\u2019s scarce resources to those cases where the \u2018alleged misconduct is such that no purpose would be served by the issuance of a remedial order\u2019 \u201d [quoting from <em>Peoria Journal Star, </em>242 NLRB No. 139 (1979)]. Here, however, he concurred in the \u00a7 8(a)(3) determination on the ground that the \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation deprived the salary review suspension of that \u201cinsignificant or isolated\u201d character that might otherwise render its prosecution pointless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-12\">. We assume that by \u201cand\u201d, the Board meant \u201cor\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
