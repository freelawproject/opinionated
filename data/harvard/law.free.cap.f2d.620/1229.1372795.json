On the night of October 16, 1975, defendant Vanderwater, then an Illinois judge, arrested plaintiff Flor Lopez, caused him to be charged with petty theft, convicted him on the basis of a guilty plea that is alleged to have been forged, and sentenced him to jail for 240 days. Vander-water accomplished all this with minimal aid from a business associate and several police officers; he proceeded without the assistance of a prosecutor, a defense attorney, a court reporter, or a court clerk. The conviction took place near midnight in a police station in Aurora, Illinois. This \u00a7 1983 action by Lopez resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-16\">The district court granted summary judgment for Vanderwater on the ground of judicial immunity. We reverse that ruling, because Vanderwater committed non-judicial acts under color of state law that proximately resulted in violations of Lopez\u2019 constitutional rights. The district court also granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Gamble, Vanderwater\u2019s business associate. We reverse that ruling also.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-18\">At the time of the events that gave rise to this action Vanderwater was an associate judge of the Illinois Sixteenth Judicial Circuit. Before he became a judge, he, defendant Gamble, and two others owned an apartment building at 128 West New York Street, Aurora, Illinois. Although it is unclear whether Vanderwater retained an ownership interest in the building after he became a judge, he continued to perform his accustomed task of collecting the rent each week on behalf of the partnership; he did this up to and including the time of the events in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-19\">Flor Lopez had been one of the tenants in the building, but had fallen behind in his rent. Because of the arrearages Vanderwa-ter asked Lopez to move out, which he did in late August or early September, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-20\">From this point on, some facts are in dispute. As to them, any evidence favorable to Lopez must be accepted as true for purposes of our review of the summary' judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-21\">On the night in question, Vanderwater received a telephone call at his home in Aurora from a tenant reporting that Lopez was back in the building.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vanderwater asked the tenant to call the police and proceeded to the building armed with a handgun. Finding Lopez asleep in what had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>formerly been his apartment, Vanderwater awakened him and detained him with the aid of the gun until the police arrived. At Vanderwater\u2019s behest, the police arrested Lopez on the charge of criminal trespass, searched him, and took him to the booking area of the Aurora Police Station, where Vanderwater also went.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">The police station was housed in the same building as the Aurora Branch Court of the Illinois Sixteenth Judicial Circuit. The State\u2019s Attorney of Kane County also maintains an office in the building. On the night in question the court facilities of the Aurora Branch were locked, and no prosecutor or court personnel were present. Vanderwater was not assigned to sit in the Aurora Branch Court; he was assigned solely to the Geneva Branch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">When Vanderwater arrived at the police station he telephoned Gamble and asked him to come down and sign a complaint against Lopez. At that time Vanderwater contemplated charging Lopez with criminal trespass. Before Gamble arrived, however, the police searched Lopez again and found a key on his person. When this discovery was reported to Vanderwater, he drafted in longhand a \u201cNotice to Appear\u201d charging Lopez with theft of the key. Vanderwa-ter\u2019s deposition testimony about his decision to charge Lopez with theft instead of criminal trespass was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-6\">Q. Your initial intent was to charge criminal trespass?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-7\">A. When I was at 128 West New York Street and my only knowledge was that he had broken into the place again, my only intent was criminal trespass of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-8\">When he started talking in terms of pleading guilty, my thinking was \u2014 Like a couple of weeks ago, I had asked him specifically about the key. He denied the key. I found out about the key at the police station. Then my thinking changed to theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-11\">Q. Your thinking changed to theft while you were at the police station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-12\">A. When I saw the key.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">\u25a0 When Gamble arrived, he found Vander-water with Daniel Toomey, one of the arresting officers, in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office on the second floor of the police station building. These three being the only persons present, the evidence of what then occurred comes solely from their depositions. Gamble and Toomey signed the \u201cNotice to Appear\u201d Vanderwater had prepared, and Gamble also signed a blank complaint form. On the blank complaint form, Vanderwater certified in writing that Gamble had sworn to the truth of the allegations of the complaint. Vanderwater also signed a warrant for Lopez\u2019 arrest. Too-mey testified that while the. three were together Vanderwater stated that he would put Lopez away for 240 days in Vandalia State Prison. Vanderwater testified he probably said this in Gamble\u2019s presence. Gamble denied that he heard it said. Van-derwater also testified that the statement was \u201cprobably\u201d made before Gamble signed the papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">On a standard plea form, Vanderwater made entries indicating a guilty plea and a waiver of trial by jury. The form, thus modified, bears an illegible signature which Lopez says is not his.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-15\">While Lopez, according to his testimony, remained in his jail cell, he was, <em>in absentia, </em>arraigned, convicted, and sentenced by Van-derwater in the booking area of the police station. Vanderwater wrote on the bottom of the guilty plea form that Lopez had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>pleaded guilty, had been found guilty, and had been sentenced to Vandalia for 240 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\">The following day Vanderwater gave directions to personnel in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office to type in the blank complaint form Gamble had signed. These directions were carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Lopez remained in jail for six days. On October 22,1975, at the request of an attorney representing Lopez, Vanderwater entered an order suspending the 240-day sentence and directing that Lopez be released from custody. The judgment of conviction was vacated, and the case against Lopez was dismissed on November 25, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">As a result of the Lopez incident, Vander-water was removed from office by the Illinois Courts Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">Lopez commenced this \u00a7 1983 action against Vanderwater, Gamble, and five police officers in 1977. The five police officers have been dismissed from the case by agreement. Extensive depositions were taken by both sides. In December 1978 the district court denied a motion for summary judgment by Vanderwater. Thereafter, Vanderwater moved for reconsideration and Gamble moved for summary judgment. The court then entered summary judgment in favor of both defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vanderwater was held to be protected by judicial immunity under <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 35 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978), and Gamble was held not liable because the facts showed no more than that he asked a judge to exercise his powers, which was insufficient to create liability in view of <em>Sparkman v. McFarlin, </em>601 F.2d 261 (7th Cir. 1979) (in banc). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">The doctrine of absolute judicial immunity, as it applies to suits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, will protect a judge against liability for a given act if two conditions are satisfied. First, the act must not have been taken in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 357, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 35 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (quoting <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 351, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872)). Protection may be afforded even if the act was prompted by malicious or corrupt reasons, \u201cflawed by the commission of grave procedural errors,\u201d or taken in excess, but not in clear absence, of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 359, 98 S.Ct. at 1104.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, the act must be a \u201cjudicial act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360-62, 98 S.Ct. at 1106-1107. <em>Sparkman </em>stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-14\">The relevant cases demonstrate that the factors determining whether an act by a judge is a \u201cjudicial\u201d one relate to the nature of the act itself, <em>i. e., </em>whether it is a function normally performed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>judge, and to the expectations of the parties, <em>i. e., </em>whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 362, 98 S.Ct. at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Lopez argues that Vanderwater acted in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction\u201d because he acted outside a courtroom and had not been assigned to sit in Aurora or to hear the case. Before addressing these arguments, it is to be noted that Vanderwater was authorized by law to hear the kind of case in which he acted and in fact had general jurisdiction except in felony cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lopez\u2019 argument that a judge has no jurisdiction outside a courtroom is without merit. Valid judicial acts are often performed outside the courtroom.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That the papers were signed in a police station instead of in a courtroom therefore does not mean that they were signed in clear absence of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">The district court was also correct in concluding that the absence of an assignment to the Aurora Branch of the court or the particular case did not result in clear absence of all jurisdiction. There is some dispute concerning whether the assignment requirement is jurisdictional under Illinois law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but we think at most the absence of assignment rendered Vanderwater\u2019s actions in excess of, but not in clear absence of, jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under <em>Sparkman, </em>this is not enough to deprive him of immunity. 435 U.S. at 357-58 &amp; n.6, 98 S.Ct. at 1105 &amp; n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel also argues, as we understand him, that the totality of the circumstances in this case are enough to have deprived Vanderwater of all jurisdiction. Among these circumstances are the facts that Vanderwater had an interest in the case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that he had prejudged the case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that he proceeded to judgment despite his knowledge of fundamental constitutional infirmities in the procedure that was followed. Even \u201cgrave procedural errors,\u201d however, are not enough, under <em>Sparkman, </em>to deprive a judge of all jurisdiction. 435 U.S. at 359, 98 S.Ct. at 1106. Malice and corruption are similarly insufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 98 S.Ct. at 1104. Therefore, Vanderwater\u2019s acts in arraigning, convicting, and sentencing Lopez, outrageous as they were, were not, under <em>Sparkman, </em>taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">The district court was also correct in concluding that these acts were \u201cjudicial acts.\u201d They satisfy the <em>Sparkman </em>criterion of functions \u201cnormally performed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>judge.\u201d <em>See </em>435 U.S. at 362, 98 S.Ct. at 1107. The second criterion, whether the parties \u201cdealt with the judge in his judicial capacity,\u201d seems inapplicable here. Van-derwater himself was, in substance if not in form, the complainant; Lopez, the only party other than the state, was, if we are to believe his deposition testimony, unaware of the entire course of the proceedings and thus unable to deal with Vanderwater in his judicial role or otherwise during the proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The question of immunity can hardly turn on whether Gamble, who was only formally the charging party and was not present at the judicial segment of the events leading to Lopez\u2019 incarceration, dealt with Vanderwater as a judge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Accordingly, Vanderwater is absolutely immune from suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for his acts of arraigning, convicting, and sentencing Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">The irregular arraignment, conviction, and sentence were not, however, the only acts of Vanderwater that proximately caused Lopez\u2019 injury. Vanderwater acted as prosecutor. He made the decision to prosecute. He determined the offense to be charged, originally contemplating criminal trespass and then deciding on theft of the key. He prepared a written charge on the \u201cNotice to Appear\u201d form. He caused Gamble to sign the blank complaint form and the next day had that form completed by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s staff. He prepared a guilty plea and waiver of jury and caused a signature, which he says was Lopez\u2019, to be placed thereon. Finally, Vanderwater presented the charge and plea form to himself with the expectation that it would be the basis for an unconstitutional conviction and sentence. These acts were not functions \u201cnormally performed by a judge.\u201d They were not, therefore, \u201cjudicial acts,\u201d and are not, as a consequence, protected by judicial immunity. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, supra, </em>435 U.S. at 360, 98 S.Ct. at 1106; <em>Crowe v. Lucas, </em>595 F.2d 985 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Gregory v. Thompson, </em>500 F.2d 59 (9th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">These prosecutorial acts by Vanderwater were both the actual and the proximate cause of several violations of Lopez\u2019 constitutional rights, including, <em>inter alia: </em>his due process right to a disinterested judge, <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 75 S.Ct. 623, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955); <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927); his due process right to a judge who had not prejudged his case,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number><em>States v. Sciuto, </em>531 F.2d 842, 844-46 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>see United States v. Grinnel Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the advice of counsel at each critical stage in the proceedings, e. <em>g., Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972); <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); and his rights, absent waiver, to a jury trial, a public trial, compulsory process, and to confront adverse witnesses. U.S.Const. Amends. 6 &amp; 14. Even under Vanderwater\u2019s version of the events in question, these rights were abridged. Vanderwater\u2019s acts as a prosecutor were intended to make possible, and were an essential preliminary to, the series of wrongs that culminated in Lopez\u2019 illegal conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">Vanderwater\u2019s prosecutorial acts were taken under color of state law within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The \u201cunder color\u201d of state law element of a \u00a7 1983 claim is identical to the \u201cstate action\u201d requirement in an action based on the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>United States v. Price, </em>383 U.S. 787, 794 n.7, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 1156 n.7, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966). Action taken by a state official who is cloaked with official power and who purports to be acting under color of official right is state action and is taken under color of state law whether or not the action is in fact in excess of the authority actually delegated to the official under state law. <em>E. g., Screws v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 111, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1040 (1945):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-6\">It is clear that under \u201ccolor\u201d of law means under \u201cpretense\u201d of law. . Acts of officers who undertake to perform their official duties are included whether they hew to the line of their authority or overstep it. If, as suggested, the statute was designed to embrace only action which the State in fact authorized, the words \u201cunder color of any law\u201d were hardly apt words to express the idea.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP8\"><em>See also, e. g., United States v. Price, </em>supra, 383 U.S. at 795, 86 S.Ct. at 1157; <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 171-87, 81 S.Ct. 473, 484, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961) (overruled in an unrelated respect by <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 97, 98-100, 71 S.Ct. 576, 578, 95 L.Ed. 774 (1951); <em>United States v. Classic, </em>313 U.S. 299, 326, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1043, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941); <em>Gregory v. Thompson, supra, </em>500 F.2d at 62 (cited with approval in <em>Stump v. Sparkman, supra, </em>435 U.S. at 361 n.10, 98 S.Ct. at 1107 n.10).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">Counsel for Vanderwater has argued, however, that this accepted rule does not apply to judicial acts. As phrased in Vanderwater\u2019s brief, counsel contends that plaintiff Lopez is \u201cwhipsawed\u201d between the \u201cabsence of all jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cjudicial acts\u201d requirements and the color of law requirement. If jurisdiction is absent or the act is not judicial, counsel maintains, the color of law requirement is not met; if the color of law requirement is met, the act is judicial and jurisdiction is present. Acceptance of this theory would remove the limitations on absolute judicial immunity discussed above and render judges immune from any suit whatsoever under \u00a7 1983. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number><em>Sparkman </em>the Court did note that an allegation that a judge\u2019s action was taken under color of law may appear inconsistent with a contention that the same act was not a \u201cjudicial act,\u201d 435 U.S. at 360, 98 S.Ct. at 1106; <em>\"but\u201d cf. </em>435 U.S. at 369 n.6, 98 S.Ct. at 1111 n.6 (Stewart, J., dissenting). That passing observation, however, could hardly have been intended to wipe out limitations on judicial immunity implicitly recognized elsewhere in the opinion. There is no reason to differentiate between judges and other officers in applying the color of law requirement. Vanderwater was able to take his prosecutorial acts because he was cloaked with the office of judge. His use of that office to prosecute Lopez was action under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Because Vanderwater is not immune from liability for his prosecutorial acts, and because those acts were an integral part of his unlawful course of conduct, we reverse the summary judgment in his favor<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and remand this aspect of the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-7\">As to Gamble, who did not act under color of state law, any liability must rest on the theory that he conspired with Vanderwater, who did so act, to deprive Lopez of his civil rights. We could see no basis for an inference of conspiracy if Gamble had merely responded to Vanderwater\u2019s call, come to the police station, and, based on information about Lopez\u2019 conduct given him by Vanderwater, signed the papers charging Lopez with theft of the key. Signing the blank complaint was of course improper, but it hardly gives rise to a federal right, especially when Gamble understood that the complaint would contain the same charge as the handwritten notice to appear, which he also signed. Also, Gamble knew Vanderwater, a judge, was behaving like a prosecutor; but, even if we impute to Gamble knowledge of the proper limits of a judge\u2019s function, he would not be joining in a conspiracy by signing the papers in the good faith belief that the facts were true, at least unless he knew that the complaint would not be submitted to the State\u2019s Attorney for approval and presented before a disinterested judge. If Gamble, in good faith and without such knowledge, did no more than sign the appropriate papers to lodge a complaint against Lopez for theft of the key, relying on information that Van-derwater had supplied and that Gamble had no reason to doubt, Lopez could not make out a claim against Gamble under \u00a7 1983; for in that event Gamble would merely be invoking the exercise of judicial authority. <em>Sparkman v. McFarlin, </em>601 F.2d 261 (7th Cir. 1979) (in banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">There is, however, enough evidence to raise a genuine issue that precludes summary judgment. That issue is whether Gamble knew when he signed the charging papers that Vanderwater was carrying out a scheme to use his official position to railroad Lopez by first causing a charge to be brought and then acting as the judge in the ensuing case after already deciding what the outcome would be. Officer Toomey testified that in Gamble\u2019s presence Vanderwater stated that he intended to sentence Lopez to 240 days in Vandalia. Vanderwater first testified he was \u201csure\u201d he had made such a statement in Gamble\u2019s presence, then that Gamble was \u201cconceivably\u201d present when the statement was made and Vanderwater did not know whether it was before or after Gamble had signed the papers, and finally that before Gamble signed the statement Vanderwater \u201cprobably told [Gamble] . that [Lopez] was going to plead guilty to it; and . . . that I was going to sentence [Lopez] to 240 days.\u201d Gamble denied that such a statement was ever made in his presence. We think the testimony of Toomey and Vanderwater was sufficient to raise a genuine issue as to whether, before signing the papers, Gamble heard Vanderwater make the statement in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">If Gamble heard such a statement, the trier of fact would be entitled to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>he credited the statement, and that by signing the papers he participated with Vanderwater in a conspiracy to use Vanderwater\u2019s official position to deprive Lopez of his civil rights. As we have noted, Vanderwater himself was not immune for his prosecutorial acts, so Gamble would not escape liability for engaging in a conspiracy of which those acts were an essential part even if the rule were that a conspirator automatically shares a co-conspirator\u2019s immunity, which it is not, <em>see Sparkman v. McFarlin, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 264 \u2014 68 (Sprecher, J., concurring). Even apart from the prosecutorial acts, however, Gamble\u2019s signing of the charging papers with knowledge of Vanderwater\u2019s intentions would be evidence of more than \u201cmerely . . invoking an exercise of the judge\u2019s judicial authority,\u201d <em>see Sparkman v. McFarlin, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 262 (Fairchild, C. J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 269 (Tone, J., concurring), and could give rise to liability under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">The summary judgment is therefore reversed as to both Vanderwater and Gamble, and the case is remanded to the district court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1311-14\">.

Vanderwater was never assigned by Chief Judge Akemann of the Sixteenth Circuit to sit in Aurora or to hear Lopez\u2019 case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">. The district court originally denied the motion because it found that Vanderwater may have acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction by purporting to try a case in a courthouse to which he had not been assigned. The district court subsequently reversed this determination when it came to light that Vanderwater\u2019s Chief Judge, Judge Akemann, had expressed the view in a Special Administrative Order that assignment was not a prerequisite for subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">. The distinction between acts taken in \u201cexcess\u201d of jurisdiction and acts taken in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction\u201d was illustrated in <em>Sparkman </em>with examples taken from <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 352, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-10\">[I]f a probate judge, with jurisdiction over only wills and estates, should try a criminal case, he would be acting in the clear absence of jurisdiction and would not be immune from liability for his action; on the other hand, if a judge of a criminal court should convict a defendant of a nonexistent crime, he would merely be acting in excess of his jurisdiction and would be immune.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-16\">435 U.S. at 357 n.7, 98 S.Ct. at 1105 n.7. The Court in <em>Sparkman </em>further said that, in determining whether a clear absence of jurisdiction has been shown, the fact that the power to take a given action is not expressly included in a judge\u2019s jurisdiction under state law is less significant than the fact that it is not expressly excluded from that jurisdiction. 435 U.S. at 358, 98 S.Ct. at 1105. For judges of general jurisdiction, at least, this distinction appears to some to raise the spectre of judges who are \u201cfree, like a loose cannon, to inflict indiscriminate damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367 &amp; n.5, 98 S.Ct. at 1110 &amp; n.5. (Stewart, J., dissenting). As we read <em>Sparkman, </em>however, a two-step inquiry' is required; immunity will not be accorded an act that is non-judicial whether or not it is taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">. Illinois associate judges may hear misdemeanor cases but not felony cases without special designation. Illinois Supreme Court Rule 295; <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">. Many judicial acts, including signing of orders, ruling on motions, and conducting conferences with parties, are taken in chambers and not in a courtroom. It is not unusual for a judge to act on emergency stays and other matters of extreme urgency in his home. Appellate courts sometimes sit to hear argument in law schools. There is no formalistic requirement that a judge set foot inside a courtroom before he can act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">Plaintiffs counsel has cited some rather hoary Illinois precedent concerning a judge\u2019s power outside the courtroom. <em>E. g., Rafferty v. People, </em>72 Ill. 37 (1874); <em>People v. McWeeney, </em>259 Ill. 161, 102 N.E. 233 (1913). Whether these cases remain the Illinois law or not, we think they do not demonstrate that Vanderwater acted in clear absence of jurisdiction as that concept is employed in <em>Sparkman. </em>They deal merely with acts in \u201cexcess\u201d of jurisdiction, as opposed to acts in clear absence of jurisdiction, as <em>Sparkman </em>employed those terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1314-16\">. Chief Judge Akemann of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit has rejected the view that assignments are jurisdictional in his Special Administrative Order No. 22. <em>But cf. Charleston Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Muller, </em>16 Ill.App.3d 380, 306 N.E.2d 358, 361 (1974) (dicta).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1314-17\">. <em>Sparkman </em>makes plain that for purposes of immunity, a judge\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cmust be construed broadly.\u201d 435 U.S. at 356, 98 S.Ct. at 1104. Vanderwater\u2019s actions in trying the case in Aurora are more like those of a criminal court judge who invents a crime and convicts someone of it than they are like those of a probate judge who conducts a criminal trial. <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1314-18\">. Lopez has cited us to Illinois Supreme Court rules requiring that judges both be and appear impartial. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 110A, \u00a7\u00a7 61 &amp; 66. Although Vanderwater plainly violated these rules, we do not think that action deprived him of all jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1314-19\">. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">. The same was true in <em>Sparkman, </em>in which plaintiff was unaware that any court proceedings had been had until after she had \u2022 been sterilized pursuant to the court\u2019s approval of her mother\u2019s petition. Her expectations were not, apparently, considered relevant by the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">. In one respect, extending judicial immunity to Vanderwater here is more appropriate than was the extension of immunity to the judge in <em>Sparkman. </em>Here at least error could be corrected on appeal. <em>See Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1217, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). The same cannot be said of the wrongful conduct at issue in <em>Sparkman. </em>435 U.S. at 369-70, 98 S.Ct. at 1111 (Powell, J\u201e dissenting); <em>id. </em>at 368, 98 S.Ct. at 1110 (Stewart, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">. The prosecutorial acts were also taken in \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction,\u201d although this conclusion is unnecessary to our holding, <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra. </em>Acting as a prosecutor is not within an Illinois circuit judge\u2019s jurisdiction over \u201cjusticiable matters,\u201d as granted by 111. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 9. <em>Cf. </em>Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 110A, \u00a7 402(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">. Vanderwater testified in his deposition that he \u201cprobably\u201d told Gamble before Gamble signed the complaint that Lopez \u201cwas going to plead guilty to it,\u201d and that Vanderwater \u201cwas going to sentence him to 240 days.\u201d Officer Toomey testified that Vanderwater remarked on several occasions that night that he was going to give Lopez an eight-month sentence. Vanderwater\u2019s opinion on Lopez\u2019 guilt was formed not on the basis of a guilty plea that had not been received yet, nor on the basis of any facts of record in the case, but on his extra-judicial opinion and belief that Lopez had stolen the key. <em>Cf. United States v. Grinnel Corp., supra, </em>384 U.S. at 583, 86 S.Ct. at 1710. Also, Toomey testified that Vanderwater instructed him to give Gamble the key on the night in question, and that Toomey did so. Vanderwater was apparently so certain of the outcome of the case that he was willing to release the critical evidence from official custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">. The acts were the \u201cactual\u201d cause in that but for the acts the violations would not have occurred. Whether the concept of proximate cause is viewed in terms of foreseeability or in terms of a policy against liability for acts sufficiently causally remote, the acts in question were also the proximate cause of Lopez\u2019 injuries. Vanderwater clearly foresaw the result of his prosecutorial actions, and thus his own contemplated acts can scarcely be deemed intervening and superseding causes. Indeed, the fact that Vanderwater foresaw the result is one of independent constitutional injuries that Lopez sustained, the prejudgment of his case. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>supra. </em>Vanderwater\u2019s prosecutorial acts were not remote from the injury caused either in time or in a causal chain. We can perceive no policy that would favor cutting off liability for the acts on a proximate cause rationale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">.
