Baker, District Judge of the Central District of Illinois, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1280-22\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b1280-23\">The defendant was convicted in the district court of selling counterfeit alien registration receipt cards in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(b). He appeals to this court claiming that he was improperly convicted under the provisions of that statute and that properly, he could have been convicted only under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-24\">The issue presented for review is whether a person who sells counterfeit alien registration receipt cards sells a counterfeited instrument relating to the registry of aliens within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(b). We hold that he does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-25\">While the issue on appeal has not been decided heretofore by this court, it has been ruled upon by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number><em>States v. Castillo-Felix, </em>539 F.2d 9 (9th Cir. 1976) the same contention was made as to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a) which deals with the manufacture of counterfeit instruments related to the registry of aliens. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-4\">We find the contention without merit that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a) does not embrace the counterfeiting of an alien registration receipt card. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302 requires aliens to register. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 264.1(b) makes Form 1-151 evidence of such registration. The card is a paper authorized by law relating to the registry of aliens within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a). That section does not, as defendant contends, relate solely to naturalization and citizenship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-5\">We find without merit the contention that, since 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(d) is specific as to the counterfeiting of alien registration receipt cards, the prosecution should have been under it rather than under the more general provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a). It is the general rule that, where an act violates more than one statute, the Government may elect to prosecute under either unless the congressional history indicates that Congress intended to disallow the use of the more general statute. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>482 F.2d 1359 (9th Cir. 1973). There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that by the enactment of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(d) Congress intended to disallow the use of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a). <em>Cf. Kniess v. United States, </em>413 F.2d 752 (9th Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">We find the court\u2019s analysis persuasive and dispositive and adopt it as the ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
