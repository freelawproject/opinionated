It appeared that the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant in a district court, and judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant for $10.75 costs. A transcript having been filed in the office of the county clerk, an execution was issued out of this court to the sheriff of the county, and returned unsatisfied. On an affidavit stating these facts an order was granted, requiring the plaintiff to appear and be examined concerning his property. The plaintiff moved to set aside the order, and all proceedings thereon,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-13\"><em>Henry V.

P. R. 434), relied on to sustain the order, certainly goes to the extent of holding that such proceedings may be had in all cases where a transcript of a justice\u2019s judgment for any amount has been filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>with the county clerk, and an execution has been issued thereon to the sheriff and returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; but upon examination it will be seen that the judge, in making that decision, has failed to notice the distinction to which I have alluded respecting the kind of execution which may be issued upon a justice\u2019s judgment for less than $25, exclusive of costs, and the fact that the execution referred to in \u00a7 292, and the return of which unsatisfied forms the basis of supplementary proceedings, must be against property generally, and in the form prescribed by \u00a7 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Proceedings dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
