This action was brought to recover for services rendered \u25a0 to the defendants, as their clerk, for the months of October, November, and December, 1857. The plaintiff testified that about a week prior to the 1st of August, 1857, he made an agreement with the defendants to enter their employ, as a clerk, at a salary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of $600 per year\u2014the employment to last from the 1st of August, 1857, to 1st August, 1858; that he was paid up to the 1st of October, 1857, and, on the 26th of that month, was discharged, the defendants having failed and made an assignment on that day. Judgment was rendered, on this evidence, against the defendants for the amount claimed, and from this judgment they appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-6\"><em>Northrup &amp; Vernon, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-7\">I. The evidence shows that the contract on which the plaintiff seeks to recover, was a <em>parol </em>agreement made about a week before the 1st of August, 1857, for the services of the plaintiff for one year from and after the said 1st day of August, 1857. It was therefore an agreement which, by its terms, was not to be performed within one year from the making thereof; and is, for this reason, void by the Statute of Frauds. Rev. St, 3d ed., vol. II, pt. 2, tit. 2, chap. 7, \u00a7 2, p. 195; <em>Drummond </em>v. <em>Burrill, </em>13 Wend. 307; <em>Lockwood </em>v. Barnes, 3 Hill, 128; <em>Broadwell </em>v. <em>Getman, </em>2 Denio, 87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-8\">II. <em>\u201c </em>Although performance is to begin, and does begin, within the year, yet, if the agreement is not to be <em>completely </em>executed within that period, it is within the Statute of Frauds.\u201d 3 Hill, 128, <em>supra; </em>2 Denio, 87, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-9\"><em>E. W. Dodge, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4q\">cited <em>Young </em>v. <em>Dake, 1 </em>Selden, 463.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b125-10\">By the Court, Brady, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqB\">The respondent claimed from the appellants the sum of $150 for three months\u2019 services rendered under and by virtue of a contract made with them at the rate of $600 per year. The agreement was by parol, and was for a year\u2019s service, namely, from August, 1857, to August, 1858. The respondent remained in the service of the appellants until the 26th of October, 1857, when he was discharged by them. It appears, from the respondent\u2019s statement, that the agreement was made <em>one week preceding the </em>1st <em>of August, </em>1857, but that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>to <em>continue </em>irom August, 1857, to August, 1858, and it follows that it was an agreement which, by its terms, was not to be performed within one year from the making thereof, and is void. <em>Wilson </em>v. Martin, 1 Denio, 602; <em>Broadwell </em>v. Getman, 2 Denio, 87; <em>Lockwood </em>v. Barnes, 3 Hill, 128. But the appellants, having derived a benefit by a part performance, must pay for what they have received. <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra; King </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Hill, 485. And, having agreed as to the amount or rate of compensation, in the absence of proof as to the value of the services rendered, the agreement should be regarded as the measure of damages. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Brown, supra. </em>The respondent was paid up to the 1st of October, 1857, but remained until the 26th of that month. On the principles herein stated, he was only entitled to recover for twenty-six days service, at the rate of $600 a year, which amounted to $42.12. The judgment must therefore be reduced to, and affirmed for, that sum, and reversed as to the excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
