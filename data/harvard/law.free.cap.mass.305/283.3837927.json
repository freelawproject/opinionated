LeBlanc, grew out of a collision on June 26, 1937, between a motorcycle owned and operated by him and a motor truck owned by the defendant, and operated by its agent or servant. The declaration is in three counts, respectively, for the death of James E. LeBlanc, his conscious suffering and damage to his motorcycle. It was agreed at the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that there was evidence tending to show that at the time of the accident he was in the exercise of due care and that the operator of the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">It was admitted at the trial that the correct residential address of James E. LeBlanc at the date of his application for registration of his motorcycle, June 7, 1937, was 34 Milham Road, Marlborough, Massachusetts. The certificate of registration of the motorcycle \u2014 which was introduced in evidence \u2014 contained the same residential address. The original application for registration with the insurance certificate attached was introduced in evidence. On this application the answer to question 11, \u201cMassachusetts residential address,\u201d was \u201c34 Milham Road.\u201d Question 11 A, \u201cMail address, if different,\u201d was not answered. The entire answer to question 12, \u201cMunicipality, City or Town where vehicle is Principally Garaged,\u201d was \u201cMarlboro, Mass.\u201d The residential address stated on the insurance certificate was \u201c34 Milham Road Marlboro, Mass.\u201d An employee in the office of the registrar of motor vehicles testified, in substance, \u201cthat the application for registration together with the insurance certificate which is printed on the back of the application was on a single piece of paper from one end to the other without any perforation and that the name of James E. LeBlanc and address, as stated above, were typewritten in the insurance certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">At the close of the evidence the defendant moved for a directed verdict. \u201cThe court declined to act at that time on defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict subject to the defendant\u2019s exceptions and submitted the case to the jury under the following stipulation agreed to by the parties, to wit: \u2014'If upon the record the motorcycle of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate could have been found to have been legally registered, judgment to be entered for the plaintiff upon each count in the amount found by the jury; otherwise judgment to be entered on the verdict.\u2019\u201d The jury brought in a verdict for the plaintiff on all counts but the judge under leave reserved allowed the defendant\u2019s motion that a verdict be entered for the defendant. The plaintiff duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>As the case comes before us no question of pleading is presented. Since, however, the burden of proving that the motorcycle was not legally registered was on the defendant <em>(Conroy </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>217 Mass. 91; <em>Faria </em>v. <em>Veras, </em>298 Mass. 117, 119; <em>MacInnis </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>298 Mass. 505, \u201cthe motorcycle of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate could have been found to have been legally registered\u201d if a contrary finding was not required as matter of law. It is to be assumed that in making the stipulation as to the entry of judgment the parties contemplated that the question of law presented should be decided in accordance with the usual principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The basic facts are established: the actual residential address of James E. LeBlanc by agreement of the parties, and the form of the application by the records in the office of the registrar of motor vehicles. See <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>217 Mass. 495; <em>Crean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>292 Mass. 226, 228; <em>MacInnis </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>298 Mass. 505, 506. Apart from the provision that was added to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, by St. 1934, c. 361 \u2014 which is considered later \u2014 these established facts, as matter of law, required a finding that the motorcycle was not legally registered, because the application for registration did not meet the statutory requirement that it \u201ccontain ... a statement of the name, place of residence and address of the applicant.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2. A statement of the city or town in which the applicant resided was an essential part of that statement of his \u201cplace of residence.\u201d Incorrect statements as to the city or town of residence \u2014 apart from trifling inaccuracies <em>(Caverno </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>294 Mass. 110, 113) \u2014 and total omission of a statement of the \u201cplace of residence\u201d have been held to invalidate an attempted registration. <em>Di Cecea </em>v. <em>Bucci, </em>278 Mass. 15. <em>Ricker </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>290 Mass. 111, 113. <em>Crean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>292 Mass. 226. <em>Brodmerkle </em>v. <em>Gorolsky, </em>293 Mass. 517. <em>Lappanasse </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>297 Mass. 290, 293. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>299 Mass. 105, 106. This principle governs the failure of the applicant in the present case to state the city of his residence. Without such a statement the statement of \u201cplace of residence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>was defective. And the defect was not corrected by the statement in answer to question 12 that the motor vehicle was principally garaged in \u201cMarlboro, Mass.\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>299 Mass. 105, 106), or by the complete statement of the applicant\u2019s residence address on the insurance certificate. <em>Crean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>292 Mass. 226, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">By St. 1934, c. 361, entitled \u201cAn Act relative to the effect of certain misstatements in applications for registration of motor vehicles,\u201d etc., G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, was amended so as to provide that a \u201cmotor vehicle . . . shall be deemed to be registered in accordance with this chapter notwithstanding . . . any mistake in the statement of residence of the applicant contained in said application.\u201d The burden of negativing any such \u201cmistake\u201d in the application for registration of the motorcycle owned and operated by James E. LeBlanc was on the defendant as a part of its burden of proving that such motorcycle was not legally registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">It could not have been ruled as matter of law \u2014 that is, a finding of fact was not required \u2014 that this burden was sustained. The defendant contends that the <em>omission </em>from the \u201cstatement of residence\u201d (or, in the phrase of the application, \u201cresidential address\u201d) of the name of the city of residence of the applicant could not be a \u201cmistake\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We cannot agree with this contention \u2014 whatever might be true if no attempt whatever was made to state the \u201cresidence.\u201d It was said of the word \u201cmisstatements\u201d as it appeared in the title of the earlier act (St. 1928, c. 187, amending G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9), dealing with a like subject, that it was \u201ca word of broader signification than 'mistake\u2019 in the body\u201d of the act. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>275 Mass. 55, 57-58. At any rate it does not restrict the meaning of the word \u201cmistake.\u201d See <em>Lorain Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Bristol Street Railway, </em>187 Mass. 500, 505. And it has been said of the word \u201cmistake\u201d as used in that act, as well as in the act now under consideration, that it \u201cincludes only complete honesty of purpose accompanied by blameless oversight or ignorance of facts.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Brown </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>275 Mass. <em>55, </em>58. <em>MacInnis </em>v. Mor<em>rissey, </em>298 Mass. 505, 508. See also <em>Emeneau </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>282 Mass. 280, 284. This language, with other language, used in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>275 Mass. 55, 58, and quoted therefrom in <em>Emaneau </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>282 Mass. 280, 284, imports that the conduct of the applicant in stating his residence, rather than the result as it appears on the application, constitutes the \u201cmistake\u201d to which the statute refers. Making an incomplete statement of residence may be as truly mistaken conduct on the part of the applicant .as making an erroneous statement thereof. And without evidence other than the application for registration \u2014 where question 11 relating to the applicant\u2019s \u201cresidential address\u201d is in close proximity to question 12 relating to the \u201cMunicipality, City or Town where vehicle is Principally Garaged,\u201d which was answered \u201cMarlboro, Mass.\u201d \u2014 it cannot be ruled as matter of law that the applicant was not acting with \u201ccomplete honesty of purpose accompanied by blameless oversight\u201d when he made an application for registration of his motorcycle without including in his \u201cstatement of residence\u201d contained in said application the name of the city in which he resided. Compare <em>MacInnis </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>298 Mass. 505, 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The defendant does not contend that the registration of the motor vehicle was invalid on any ground other than that the application for registration thereof did not contain sufficient statement of the residence of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">It follows that the exceptions of the plaintiff are sustained and, in accordance with the stipulation of the parties, \u201cjudgment [is] to be entered for the plaintiff upon each count in the amount found by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
