G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152. The employee was killed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>course of his employment. He left a widow and two minor children. The insurer\u2019s liability for compensation was redeemed by a lump sum payment of $2,000, in accordance with an agreement approved by the Industrial Accident Board (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 48), and the board approved payment to the attorney (J. M. Marshall) acting in behalf of the dependents, in the sum of $200, to be paid out of the $2,000. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 13. But the \u201cinsurer further agreed to furnish $100, for expenses and legal services in connection with the appointment of a guardian or guardians for the two children of the deceased.\u201d The board \u201cinstructed\u201d the insurer to pay this amount to said Marshall \u201cout of which any expenses in connection with the guardianship was to be paid, and the balance of which was to be retained by attorney Marshall as his fee.\u201d The insurer complied with this order, but Marshall \u201chas kept the entire $100.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Later the board, upon the report of a single member (see G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 13; <em>Golden\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 178, 180-181), found that one D. W. Capillo had already been appointed guardian of the minor son of the deceased, and that Marshall was entitled to no more than $75 for his services, and ordered Marshall to pay $25 to Capillo, \u201cwho has already paid $19 to attorney Albert, out of his own pocket, and who shall pay $6 more to the attorney, Louis Albert, for his services on behalf of said guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Capillo, by a so called \u201cmotion for decree\u201d filed in the Superior Court, in which he recited that said Marshall had failed to comply with the order of the board, prayed for a decree enforcing the decision of the board. A decree was entered in the Superior Court that Marshall is indebted to Capillo in the sum of $25 \u201cwhich shall be paid\u201d by said Marshall with costs to said Capillo, from which said Capillo \u201cshall pay $6 to Louis Albert, Attorney.\u201d From this decree Marshall appealed to this court. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The sum of $100 was paid by the insurer in accordance with the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 39, as amended by St. 1937, c. 317, that compensation payable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>case of the death of an employee shall, if he has no legal representative, be paid to his dependents, and that when \u201cthe appointment of a guardian . . . of . . . [a] dependent who is a minor ... is required to comply with this chapter, the insurer shall furnish or pay for legal services rendered in connection with the appointment of such . . . guardian . . . [and that] Said payments shall be in addition to sums paid for compensation.\u201d The amount claimed by Marshall was solely for an attorney\u2019s fee, as was the amount claimed by Capillo, although Capillo was not himself the attorney. The right of each of them to receive such a fee was dependent upon the approval thereof by the Industrial Accident Board. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 13. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 24, \u00a7 1. The fact that Marshall had actually been paid the entire $100 did not preclude the board from requiring him to return a part of this amount, if the facts found by the board warranted <em>(Gritta\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 525, 529-530), unless the board was precluded from making such an order by the fact that it had previously \u201cinstructed\u201d the insurer to pay the entire amount to Marshall. The form of this instruction does not appear in the record though its terms appear. But even if it constituted a formal approval of Marshall\u2019s fee as attorney, we think \u2014 without deciding whether such an approval would be subject to revision by the board \u2014 that the provision therein that \u201cany expenses in connection with the guardianship\u201d were to be paid out of the <em>$100, and </em>only the balance \u201cretained by attorney Marshall as' his fee\u201d left it within the power of the board, under the authority conferred upon it by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 13, to approve attorneys\u2019 fees (see also \u00a7 16), to order the fee of the other attorney \u201cin connection with the guardianship\u201d paid out of the $100 received by Marshall. And there is no legal objection, in the circumstances shown, to ordering Marshall to make this payment to Capillo as guardian, rather than to his attorney or to the insurer. See <em>Gritta\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 525, 529-530. Moreover, the payment ordered cannot be said to be unreasonable in amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
