His automobile was registered in New York and was not registered in Massachusetts, and he had no permit from the registrar of motor vehicles to operate without registration here under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1933, c. 188, which was in force when this accident occurred. The plaintiff\u2019s family were spending the summer at Annisquam in this Commonwealth, where the plaintiff\u2019s wife had hired a summer place in May or June. The plaintiff spent week ends there with his family. He was on his way to Annisquam at the time of the accident. He had come into this Commonwealth with his automobile on June 27 and had made about five trips with his automobile since then, being at Annisquam about fifteen days in all in that summer. There was evidence of the due care of the plaintiff and of the negligence of the defendant, but there was no evidence of wilful or wanton conduct on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s automobile was being operated \u201cbeyond a period of thirty days\u201d after the date of its entry into this Commonwealth in that year without being registered and without the permit to operate without registration obtainable by properly insured nonresidents under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1933, c. 188. The automobile was a \u201ctrespasser\u201d upon the highway, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>plaintiff cannot recover. The case is fully governed by <em>VanDresser </em>v. <em>Firlings, ante, </em>51, decided this day. It is unnecessary to consider whether the plaintiff had acquired \u201ca regular place of abode\u201d in this Commonwealth, within the meaning of the statute. See now, however, St. 1939, c. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Although the defendant did not plead as a defence the unlawful presence of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile on the highway, no question of pleading appears to have been raised. Hence the ruling of the trial judge will stand. <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>D. A. Schulte, Inc. </em>275 Mass. 379, 385. <em>Maksymiuk </em>v. <em>Puceta, </em>279 Mass. 346, 352. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>280 Mass. 222, 228. Compare <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>291 Mass. 529, 533, and cases cited. See <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, </em>292 Mass. 562, 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
