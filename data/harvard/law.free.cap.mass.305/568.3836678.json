The defendant in that case has filed a motion to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">A petition to establish the truth of exceptions is in the nature of an appeal, by a party \u201caggrieved\u201d by the dis-allowance of such exceptions, for the purpose of correcting an error committed in the trial court. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 117. It can be maintained only by \u201ca party \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by the failure of the presiding justice to allow exceptions which ought to be allowed,\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell, peti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>tioner, </em>174 Mass. 253, 255, that is, \u201cwhen the act or omission of the judge is erroneous.\u201d <em>Meehan, </em>petitioner, 208 Mass. 60, 63. It does not appear from the petition in this case \u2014 even if, in favor of the petitioner, it is assumed that the allegations of the petition are true \u2014 that this bill of exceptions should have been allowed in the Superior Court as a whole or in part. As appears from inspection of the bill of exceptions originally filed, it is unnecessarily and unreasonably long because of the unnecessary statement of testimony in the form of questions and answers and the statement of details of evidence that are either unimportant or, so far as material to the presentation of questions of law sought to be raised by the exceptions, could have been summarized adequately in much briefer form. The bill, therefore, does not meet the statutory requirement that the exceptions \u201cshall be reduced to writing in a summary manner\u201d \u2014 a condition precedent to the allowance of a bill of exceptions \u2014\u2022 G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 113, and for this reason was rightly disallowed. See <em>Ryder </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>163 Mass. 536, 537; <em>O\u2019Connell, petitioner, </em>174 Mass. 253, 256; <em>Horan, petitioner, </em>207 Mass. 256, 257-258; <em>Isenbeck </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>217 Mass. 537, 539; <em>Romana </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>218 Mass. 76, 81; <em>Corsick </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>218 Mass. 144, 145; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Pierce Brothers, Ltd. </em>219 Mass. 187, 188; <em>Freedman, petitioner, </em>222 Mass. 179, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">A different conclusion does not follow from the allegations of the petition \u2014 even if true \u2014 in. regard to the conduct of the petitioner in seeking amendments in the Superior Court \u2014 which were not allowed \u2014 to the bill of exceptions as originally filed. The provision of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 113, that the \u201cexcepting party may be allowed to make such amendments to his bill of exceptions as will make it a more accurate statement of the exceptions originally filed by him,\u201d is to be construed liberally. <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>187 Mass. 542, 544. See also <em>O\u2019Connell, petitioner, </em>174 Mass. 253, 256; <em>Graustein </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>293 Mass. 207, 213. Since the exceptions were disallowed it is unnecessary to consider the extent to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>a judge of the trial court may go, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, in allowing amendments to a bill of exceptions. See <em>Graustein </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>293 Mass. 207, 213-214, where the bill of exceptions was al-. lowed and it was held that the \"changes made in the bill as allowed\u201d did not exceed \"the limits of permissible amendments.\u201d The \"place to settle exceptions and to make such amendments as may be necessary to render accurate the statement of the exceptions originally filed is in the Superior Court in ordinary cases. ... In the rare instances when it is necessary to file a petition for the establishment of exceptions in this court [the Supreme Judicial Court], the field of inquiry is not broadened beyond the exceptions filed in the Superior Court except as to slight unintentional errors.\u201d <em>Freedman, petitioner, </em>222 Mass. 179, 181. \u201c\u2018We have nothing to do with anything except the bill of exceptions\u2019 which was \u2018actually and seasonably tendered to the judge\u2019 and which by the \u2018petition he now seeks to establish.\u2019 <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>155 Mass. 233, 241. <em>Freedman, petitioner, </em>222 Mass. 179.\u201d <em>Money-weight Scale Co., petitioner, </em>225 Mass. 473, 476. (Of course we do not intimate that amendments to the original bill of exceptions actually allowed may not be considered.) It is apparent from inspection of the original bill of exceptions filed that it cannot be put in such form as to comply with the statutory requirement of statement \"in a summary manner\u201d merely by the correction of slight errors. A complete redrafting of the bill of exceptions would be required. The petition cannot be maintained for the purpose of obtaining such a redrafting of the bill through the allowance of amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-19\"><em> Beaudreau, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
