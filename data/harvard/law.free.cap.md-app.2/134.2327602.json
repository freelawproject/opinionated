Judge Foster\u2019s order was filed October <em>7, </em>1966 and this application for leave to appeal was filed October 18, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">Applicant was convicted October 25, 1954 in the Criminal Court of Baltimore of murder in the first degree and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The conviction was affirmed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the Court of Appeals. <em>Watson v. State, </em>208 Md. 210. His first petition under the Act was denied without a hearing on December 19, 1958 and no application for leave to appeal was noted. Applicant\u2019s second petition was denied without a hearing on November 17, 1961, and his application for leave to appeal was also denied. <em>Watson v. Warden, </em>228 Md. 653. On August 20, 1962, applicant\u2019s petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in the U. S. District Court was dismissed without prejudice to allow petitioner to exhaust his State remedies. His petition for rehearing was also denied on September 18, 1962. Applicant\u2019s third petition under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act was denied without a hearing on October 9, 1962, and the application for leave to appeal was likewise denied. <em>Watson v. Warden, </em>230 Md. 643. Applicant\u2019s second petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was denied on October 22, 1962. A third petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was filed by the applicant on April 24, 1963 in the U. S. District Court. As a result of that petition, Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen directed that the applicant be granted a full evidentiary hearing in the State Courts on four allegations of error. The applicant\u2019s fourth petition for post conviction relief, made pursuant to that order, was filed June 29, 1966. The four allegations designated by Judge Thomsen are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">1) The applicant was illegally arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">2) A confession used against the defendant was obtained in violation of the rule in <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">3) Suppression of evidence by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">4) Perjury by the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The applicant made several other allegations of error, which can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">5) The section of the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act providing that the petitioner may be deemed to have waived certain allegations of error if not raised in prior petitions or at trial is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">6) The evidence was legally insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">7) That he was denied Fourteenth and Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Rights by being himself with his attorney excluded from the indictment proceedings before the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">8) That members of his race were systematically excluded from the grand jury which indicted him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">9) That the grand jury necessarily had to declare a belief in God.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">10) That there was no opportunity for him to aid in the selection of the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">In his application for leave to appeal, in addition to reiterating the above allegations, the applicant alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">1) That he did not receive a full evidentiary hearing on all four points mentioned by Judge Thomsen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">2) Judge Foster flatly refused to hear testimony on the allegations 5-10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">3) That his counsel at the hearing before Judge Foster was inexperienced and inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-18\">4) That Judge Foster was prejudiced against the applicant. We shall discuss these allegations in the order above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-20\">As to the first allegation, the applicant testified that nothing was seized from him at the time of his arrest. An illegal arrest, in and of itself, does not vitiate a trial, <em>Ledbetter v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 643, and as no \u201cfruits\u201d of the arrest were used against the applicant in his trial, the legality, <em>vel non, </em>of his arrest is immaterial. <em>Ross v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 46. In any event, since the applicant\u2019s conviction became final before June 19, 1961 any relief from alleged searches and seizures under <em>Mapp v. Ohio, 367 </em>U. S. 643, would not be available to him as <em>Mapp </em>is not retroactive. <em>Lee v. Warden, </em>240 Md. 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-21\">As to the second allegation, the applicant is not within the ambit of Escobedo <em>v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478 and <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, as neither are to be applied retrospectively. <em>Callen v. Warden, </em>243 Md. 714; <em>Cooper v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 190. If the applicant\u2019s confession was freely and voluntarily made, it was properly admissible. <em>Bagley v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 154. At the hearing below, Judge Foster found that the confession was voluntary, after considering evidence produced at the hearing and after carefully reviewing the transcript of the applicant\u2019s trial. We cannot say that Judge Foster\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ings were erroneous from the record before us and hold that the applicant is not entitled to relief under his second allegation of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">As to the third allegation, the applicant contends that the police suppressed the statement of one Odell Thomason, which it is alleged, would have had some bearing on the outcome of the trial. Judge Foster found that the applicant did not know the content of the alleged statement and did not know how the statement would have aided him, and it is not clear that such a statement, in fact, existed. Thus, this contention is no more than a bald allegation without supporting facts in the record and affords no basis for relief. <em>Hamm v. Warden, </em>238 Md. 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">As to the fourth allegation, the applicant contended that certain police officers perjured themselves at the trial, by testifying that he was arrested two days after he now says he was arrested. As was noted by Judge Foster below, applicant\u2019s own testimony at the trial corroborated that of the police as to the date of his arrest. Therefore, we agree with Judge Foster\u2019s determination that this allegation had no factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">As to the fifth allegation, the applicant stated that he feels \u00a7645A of Art. 27, Md. Code, (1967 Replacement Volume) is unconstitutional in that it might prevent him from objecting later to violations of his right to due process which may have occurred at his trial. However, since none of applicant\u2019s allegations are here considered as previously waived by him, this statute has not prejudiced the applicant in any way, and he has no standing now to object to its constitutionality. See, <em>Sansbury v. Director, </em>237 Md. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Applicant\u2019s sixth allegation affords him no relief as the question of the sufficiency of the evidence for a conviction does not constitute a ground for post conviction relief. <em>Thornton v. Warden, </em>241 Md. 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">As to the seventh allegation, \u201cThe grand jury is an accusing body, and not a judicial tribunal; and it acts upon knowledge possessed by its members from any source, whether from witnesses brought before it, or from information gained before its sessions. * * * But it is an inflexible requirement that their investigations shall be carried on secretly and free from outside interference or influence; and great care is taken that they shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>be so carried on.\u201d <em>Coblentz v. State, </em>164 Md. 558, 566-567. See, <em>Bernard v. Warden, </em>187 Md. 273, 279-280. No attorney, other than the State\u2019s Attorney, his assistants, or someone appointed in their stead is permitted to attend the proceedings before the grand jury. <em>Coblentz v. State, supra, </em>at page 564. The appearance of any person before the grand jury attempting to influence the jury is not permissible. <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>184 Md. 86, 95. It has been held that one who is being investigated by the grand jury has no right, constitutional or otherwise, to appear before that body. <em>Duke v. United States, </em>90 F. 2d 840 (4th Cir. 1937) cert. denied 302 U. S. 685, rehearing denied 302 U. S. 775, (cited as authority in <em>Brack v. Wells, supra); United States v. Thompson, </em>144 F. 2d 604 (2nd Cir. 1944) opinions by L. Hand, J. cert. denied 323 U. S. 790. In <em>Hitzelberger v. State, </em>173 Md. 435 it was held that one under investigation who attempts to influence a member of a grand jury to present certain evidence in favor of that person may be held in contempt. It has also been held that one who merely solicits the grand jury to allow him to testify in his own defense may be held in contempt. <em>Commonwealth v. McNary, </em>246 Mass. 46, 140 N. E. 255, 256 (cited with approval in <em>Hitzelberger v. State, supra.) </em>In light of the above authorities, we hold that neither applicant nor counsel representing him had any right to be present during the proceedings before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As to the eighth allegation, there was no evidence produced at the hearing below that the members of the applicant\u2019s race were systematically excluded from the grand jury which indicted him. Bare assertions of error without substantiation in the record, afford no ground for relief. <em>Jones v. Warden, </em>244 Md. 720. See also <em>Giles v. State, </em>229 Md. 370; <em>Jackson v. State, </em>180 Md. 658; <em>Ross v. Warden, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The ninth allegation is without merit since the applicant\u2019s \u2022conviction became final before October 11, 1965 and <em>Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121, applies only to convictions not final as of that date. <em>Husk v. Warden, </em>240 Md. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">As to the tenth allegation, the method of selection of the grand jury in Baltimore City is provided by statute. <em>Charter and Public Local Laws of Baltimore City </em>(Flack) 1949, \u00a7382, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>383-384. The applicant clearly had no right to aid in the selection of the grand jury which indicted him and the allegation with regard thereto is frivolous and devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">With regard to the additional four allegations made in the application for leave to appeal, we find, from the record, as to the first thereof, that the applicant did receive a full evidentiary hearing on all matters stated by Judge Thomsen. As to the second thereof, it appears from Judge Foster\u2019s memorandum that the applicant was given every opportunity to testify on behalf of his allegations. Judge Foster said, \u201cPetitioner was given the opportunity to testify and did so at some length. * * * no evidence or argument was presented as to contentions seven and eight and they, therefore, must be deemed to have been abandoned.\u201d (Judge Foster considered these allegations on their merits in any event). We think it clear that the applicant was, in fact, given the opportunity to testify as to all his allegations of error and that this <em>contention has no merit. As to </em>the third thereof, the inadequacy of counsel at the hearing below, the applicant states only that his counsel was inexperienced and inadequate, without particularity. Such general allegations, of incompetency afford no basis for relief. <em>Kiah v. Warden, </em>232 Md. 653; <em>McCoy v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 108, 118. In any event, the record before us does <em>not </em>disclose <em>that at the </em>hearing the applicant raised the question of the adequacy of counsel representing him at that hearing and there is nothing in the record to support the allegation. It is not properly before us. Maryland Rule, 1085. As to the fourth thereof, in asserting that the Judge at the post conviction hearing was prejudiced against him, the applicant cites the above three allegations as demonstrating that prejudice. As we have found those allegations not to be meritorious, the applicant cannot rely upon them in asserting the prejudice of the judge at the hearing below. <em>McCloskey v. Director, </em>1 Md. App. 281. In any event, the record does not disclose that Judge Foster demonstrated prejudice in any way and on the contrary the applicant was afforded every opportunity to present and argue his allegations of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
