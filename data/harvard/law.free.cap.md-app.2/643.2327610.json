Byrnes, sitting in \u25a0the Criminal Court of Baltimore, denying relief sought by applicant\u2019s fourth petition under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Since the application failed to \u201ccontain a brief statement of the reasons why the order should be reversed or modified\u201d as required by Maryland Rule BK 46 (b), relief could be denied \u25a0on this ground alone. <em>Goetzke v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">In any event, Judge Byrnes found that the allegations of \u201cinexperienced counsel\u201d and \u201coverzealous judge\u201d were deemed to be waived and that the allegation of \u201cillegal search and seizure\u201d was deemed to have been finally litigated under Md. \u25a0Code (1967 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (b) (c). The petition \u2022presented no special circumstances to excuse the failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>raise the first two allegations in prior proceedings nor to rebut the presumption that the petitioner intelligently and knowingly failed to make them. The third allegation was raised in applicant\u2019s third petition, disposed of by the order denying the relief prayed and application for leave to appeal from the order was denied. <em>Bulluck v. Warden, </em>239 Md. 716. We agree that the first two allegations were waived and the third allegation finally litigated, \u00a7 645A (d) not being applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">There was no error in the dismissal of the fourth petition for relief without a hearing or appointment of counsel. See <em>Bagley v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 154; <em>Taylor v. Director, </em>1 Md. App. 23; Md. Rule BK48.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-12\">. Rule BK48 was rewritten June 33, 1967, effective September 1, 1967. The Rule as rewritten does not preclude a denial of relief sought by a subsequent post conviction petition without a hearing or appointment of counsel. <em>Jones v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 343, filed November 3, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
