In <em>State v. Long and Nelson, </em>1 Md. App. 326 (1967), this Court stated \u201cthe right to a speedy trial involves a nice balancing of two rights of society \u2014 the primary obligation to ascertain the guilt or innocence of an accused and the accused\u2019s right to have the accusation determined without oppressive delay.\u201d Since there is no definition of the term in the constitutions, and the varied circumstances surrounding particular cases are innumerable, and for the main part, unforeseeable, the term has properly been held to be a relative one, with the determination of the question as to whether or not an accused has been denied a speedy trial depending upon the facts of each particular case.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>241 Md. 599, 608 (1966). \u201cThe right of a speedy trial is necessarily relative. It is consistent with delays and depends upon circumstances. It secures rights to a defendant. It does not preclude the rights of public justice.\u201d <em>Beavers v. Haubert, </em>198 U. S. 77, 87, 49 L. Ed. 950, 25 S. Ct. 573 (1905). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>\u201cWhether delay in completing a prosecution * * * amounts to an unconstitutional deprivation of rights depends upon the circumstances * * * the delay must not be purposeful or oppressive.\u201d <em>Pollard v. United States, </em>352 U. S. 354, 361, 1 L. Ed. 2d 393, 399, 77 S. Ct. 481 (1957). The \u201cessential ingredient is orderly expedition and not mere speed.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>360 U. S. 1, 10, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1041, 1048, 79 S. Ct. 991 (1959). Applying the above stated principles, the Supreme Court of the United States found that a passage of 19 months between the original arrests and the hearings does not of itself demonstrate a violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a speedy trial. See <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U. S. 116, 120, 15 L. Ed. 627, 86 S. Ct. 773 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In <em>State v. Murdock, </em>235 Md. 116, 200 A. 2d 666 (1964), the Court cited <em>United States v. Patrisso, </em>21 F.R.D. 363, (S. D. N. Y.) (1958), wherein that Court had held that the \u201cconstitutional guarantee of a speedy trial is a personal right which may be waived and is waived by the accused\u2019s failure to demand trial,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights had not been violated as the Government had not \u201cdeliberately or oppressively sought to delay the trial\u201d nor did defendants make a showing of \u201csubstantial prejudice effected by the delays.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In the instant case, the appellant had temporarily, yet effectively, waived his right to a speedy trial by his actions and his failure to move for same until his letter of July 18, 1966, which was promptly acted upon by appointment of counsel on July 27, 1966, and the treating of the same as a motion for a speedy trial. Under the instant circumstances the delay involved from July 1966 until trial on January 9, 1967 was reasonable and nonviolative of the appellant\u2019s rights. Appellant had moved for and was granted a postponement of the first scheduled trial date of April 6, 1966; had failed to appear for trial on the rescheduled date of June 16, 1966; and, in fact, was not heard from again until his letter of July 18, 1966 to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Prince George\u2019s County expressing concern for the status of his sister\u2019s property, which was collateral for the forfeited bond of June 16, 1966. In that same letter appellant expressed his desire for trial. On July 27, 1966, the court viewed this letter as a motion for a speedy trial and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>pointed counsel. In addition to the above developments, the appellant had been arrested in March 1966 in the District of Columbia for armed robbery thus causing the revocation of a prior conditional release on April 8, 1966 and confinement in the District of Columbia Jail until August 10, 1966, at which time he was transferred to the Federal Reformatory at Lorton, Virginia. That trial remained pending until a finding of guilty was made on September 22, 1966, and a sentence of from four to ten years imposed with confinement at Lorton, Virginia. Furthermore, it was necessary to make arrangements with the office of the Attorney General of the United States for appellant\u2019s transfer for the instant trial, as the District of Columbia is not a signatory to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In view of the numerous circumstantial variables encounter-able in each particular case, the term \u201cspeedy trial\u201d is by necessity a relative one dictating that the ultimate determination as to whether or not a denial of a speedy trial has occurred rests on the particular facts of each case. We find that on the instant facts this delay does not constitute a lack of a speedy trial. We find no purposeful or oppressive delay by the State, nor prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">\n<em>Judgment' affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
