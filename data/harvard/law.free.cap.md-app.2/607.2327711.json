In addition, applicant\u2019s contentions must be deemed waived under Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (c) since there was no appeal from his trial, the allegations were not raised in his prior petition, no special circumstances sufficient to excuse the failure to raise them were presented and the presumption of waiver was not rebutted. Section 645A (d) is not applicable. Applicant also failed to comply with Md. Rule, BK 46 (b) in that he failed to state reasons why the order of the lower court should be reversed or modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In supplements to his application for leave to appeal the applicant presents additional grounds for relief which were not alleged in his petition. They are not properly before us. <em>Vanfield v. Warden, </em>243 Md. 685; <em>Watson v. Warden, </em>2 Md.
