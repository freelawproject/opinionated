Maguire, presiding without a jury, of the offenses of carnal knowledge and assault and battery charged under indictment No. 31410 and incest charged under indictment No. 31411. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 2 years on the conviction of carnal knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>edge, for a term of 1 year on the conviction of assault and battery, concurrent with the first sentence and for a term of 5 years on the conviction of incest, consecutive with the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Under the title \u201cIncest\u201d, Art. 27, \u00a7 335 of the Maryland Code (1967 Repl. Vol.) proscribes a person knowingly having carnal knowledge of another person, being within the degrees of consanguinity within which marriages are prohibited by law in Maryland. Md. Code (1964 Repl. Vol.) Art. 62, \u00a7 2 provides, among other prohibitions, that a man shall not marry his daughter. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 464 proscribes the carnal knowledge by any person, except male persons under the age of 18 years, of any female not his wife, between the ages of 14 and 16 years. Carnal knowledge and sexual intercourse are synonymous <em>(Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes, </em>6th Ed. \u00a7 11.01, p. 675), the ancient term for the act itself being \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d (4 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>210). So at common law, rape was the act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of 10 years by force without the consent and against the will of the victim. <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464. Sexual intercourse, and thus carnal knowledge, judicially defined, \u201cmeans actual contact of the sexual organs of a man and woman and an actual penetration into the body of the latter.\u201d <em>Robert v. State, </em>220 Md. 159, quoting <em>State v. Diamond </em>264 P. 697 (Nev.). Therefore, penetration is an essential element of the crime of rape at common law. <em>Craig v. State, </em>214 Md. 546. An unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of consent, commonly known as \u201cstatutory rape\u201d, is often characterized as \u201ccarnal knowledge and abuse\u201d <em>(Perkins on Criminal Law </em>[1957], ch. 2, \u00a7 5, p. 113), as in Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 462. The Court of Appeals has assumed that penetration is also an essential element of statutory rape. <em>Edmondson v. State, </em>230 Md. 66; <em>Smith v. State, </em>224 Md. 509; <em>Robert v. State, supra. </em>As the term \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d is used in Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 335 (incest) and \u00a7 464 (carnal knowledge of a female between the ages of 14 and 16 years) as it is in \u00a7 462, we assume that penetration is also an essential element of those crimes. But emission is not an essential element. It is not embraced within the definition of sexual intercourse (carnal knowledge) above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>and is not required to be proved to establish rape by the provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 461, prescribing the penalty for that crime. Thus the facts necessary to be proved to convict the appellant of the offense of incest were that he :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">1) knowingly engaged in sexual intercourse, as defined,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">2) with a person, being within the degrees of consanguinity within which marriages are prohibited in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The facts necessary to be proved to convict the appellant of the offense of carnal knowledge as charged were that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">1) was 18 years of age or over;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">2) engaged in sexual intercourse, as defined, with a female, who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">a) was not his wife; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">b) was between the ages of 14 and 16 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">\u201cFor this Court to reverse a judgment entered in a case tried by the lower court without a jury, it must be shown that there was no legally sufficient evidence, or proper inferences therefrom, from which the court could find the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Crum and Dunbar v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 132, 135, quoting <em>McCray v. State, </em>236 Md. 9, 15. In the instant case we think there was such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">It was uncontradicted that the prosecutrix was the daughter of the appellant and that she had attained her fourteenth birthday on January 15, 1966. It is a rational inference from the age of the prosecutrix that the appellant was over the age of 18 years. The real contention with respect to the evidence is that the act of sexual intercourse was not proved in that the testimony of the prosecutrix was not worthy of belief, and, even if believed, that penetration was not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">The prosecutrix testified that she left her house about 10:30 P. M. on October 23, 1966 with her father and two brothers, the older of whom, Tommy, was 13 years old. They drove in the appellant\u2019s automobile to a tavern. The younger brother was asleep and the appellant told Tommy to go to sleep. The appellant and the prosecutrix went into the tavern where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>appellant drank a beer and the prosecutrix drank a soda. The appellant told his daughter that the brakes on the car were not working and gave her a dime to call her aunt. Then, \u201cwe walked down into the glade and he took me into the woods a few feet and took my clothes down, and my slacks, my girdle and my underwear down to my knees and put his - - - he laid on top of me, and I tried to get loose, and he slapped me. And, I didn\u2019t get loose until he kicked me---I mean, I kicked him.\u201d He put his penis \u201call the way into me * * * I was trying to get loose and even got up and he smacked me, threw me on the ground again, and I kicked him to get loose and he grabbed hold of my arm and told me to get back into the <em>car; </em>and go with my brothers and go to my aunt\u2019s, but I didn\u2019t go up, we went to the house and he was down there. And, he beat Tommy for telling my mother and he beat Tommy, and she went and called the police.\u201d On cross-examination she said that she was in the woods with the appellant for two hours and a half and that he was on top of her for that length of time. In response to a question \u201cNow did he have his organ in you for that length of time?\u201d she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d On redirect examination, however, she indicated she did not \u201chave the proper conception of the amount of time\u201d she was with her father. She further said that she did not bleed, had no marks on her face or on her throat and neck and that there were no bruises or marks on her anywhere as a result of the incident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On cross-examination the prosecutrix denied that she had admitted, at the preliminary hearing, to having intercourse with other men and boys before. A police officer testified that he was not sure whether she said, at the preliminary hearing, that two boys once had attempted to have intercourse with her or that they did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>have intercourse with her. When cross-examined on this subject at the trial, the brother, Tommy, said that at the preliminary hearing she said she had had \u201cbad relations\u201d with boys or men other than the father, but he did not know the meaning of sexual intercourse and defined \u201cbad relations\u201d at one point as meaning, \u201cthey don\u2019t like each other.\u201d Tommy testified that they went to the tavern, that the younger brother was asleep, that the father told him to go to sleep and that when his father and sister came out of the tavern, the father gave \u201cher a dime to go call some place, and he grabbed her arm and jumped on her.\u201d His brother woke up and he and his brother walked back to their house. He did not see anything else. He told his mother what happened and she called the police. His father came home and beat him for telling his mother. A police officer testified that the condition of her clothes when he saw her shortly after the incident were \u201cgood\u201d and did not contain \u201cany dirt or mud\u201d and that he did not notice any bruises on her face and neck. Another officer testified that her clothes were \u201cmessed up a little bit * * * appeared a little wet but mostly wrinkled\u201d and were not torn. There was testimony by the police that when they were in her house and asked the prosecutrix whether \u201canything had happened between her and her father\u201d she shook her head indicating that it had not. They took her outside and when the sergeant arrived they asked her again \u201cand she said that she had been raped, so we asked the girl if she was sure she was raped or were you assaulted by your father placing his hands, or intercourse, and the girl said that specifically, intercourse. Her father had put it all the way in her.\u201d She said she had not told the police while she was in the house because she was scared.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The appellant urges that in view of all the evidence, the testimony of the prosecutrix \u201cwas so laden with contradictions, inconsistencies and unbelievable factors that it was clearly insufficient\u201d to sustain the convictions. We do not agree and cannot find from the record before us that the testimony of the prosecutrix was so contradictory as to be of no probative force, cf. <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334. The prosecuting witness in a rape case is not an accomplice, nor do we feel that such witness is an accomplice in an incest or carnal knowledge case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Therefore her testimony need not be corroborated. See <em>Leek v. State, </em>229 Md. 526. In non-jury trials the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses is for the trial judge to determine. <em>Dunlap v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 444; <em>Sadler v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 383. As the testimony of the prosecutrix had probative force, the trial judge could find from her testimony, if he believed it, as he did, that the appellant had engaged in an act of sexual intercourse with his daughter and that he had assaulted and beat her.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">With regard to penetration, the prosecutrix testified that her father put his penis \u201call the way into me\u201d and that he had his \u201cprivate\u201d in her. She said that he \u201craped me,\u201d but that he had not completed the act. The appellant concludes from this that she meant there had been no penetration, but it is clear from her testimony that what she meant by her statement that the act had not been completed was that there had not been an emission or \u201cdischarge\u201d on the part of the appellant and it is also clear that she knew what emission meant. On a number of occasions in cross-examining her, counsel referred to the acts of the appellant as \u201cintercourse\u201d and \u201crelations\u201d within the sexual connotation. Not only did she testify directly as to a physical act showing, or tending to show, penetration, but we think it clear from the record that she understood the meaning of the words \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and that counsel for the appellant recognized that she understood them. Had he thought otherwise it could have been brought out in cross examination. Penetration is a detail comprehended within the term. <em>Robert v. State, supra. </em>We think the evidence sufficient for the trial court to find that there had been penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">As there was evidence, believed by the trial court, either showing directly or supporting a rational inference of the facts to be proved, its judgments on the evidence were not clearly erroneous and we may not set them aside for that reason. <em>McFadden v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 511; Md. Rule, 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The appellant also contends that upon the convictions of incest and carnal knowledge, the offense of assault and battery merged therein. Under the facts here present, however, the assault and battery (the slapping of the prosecutrix by the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>lant) was a separate and distinct offense. Therefore, there was no merger, and the conviction of assault and battery was proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Cottrell v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">. The prosecutrix was examined by a physician shortly after the incident. Although the State agreed to stipulate that \u201cwhat the police report as far as the examination was is what the doctor said,\u201d the record does not disclose that a stipulation, police report or a report of examination were proffered or admitted in evidence, nor did the doctor testify. In argument to the trial court, counsel for the appellant stated, \u201cThe police report says \u2018Dr. Tse (apparently the examining physician) examined Shirley (the prosecutrix) and examination showed no sperm and no signs of injury.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\">.. In view of our finding, we do not reach the question whether an assault and battery is necessarily committed by the mere act of sexual intercourse essential to the offenses of incest and carnal knowledge. Unlike the offense of rape, where there is a merger of the assault into the rape when the facts used to establish the assault are essential elements in establishing the greater offense of rape, <em>Green v. State, </em>243 Md. 75, force is not an essential element of either incest or carnal knowledge, the crimes being complete (the necessary elements being otherwise present) when the act of sexual intercourse is performed, even if freely and voluntarily on the part of a female legally able to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"Ado\">We note that there was a count charging assault and battery in each of indictments Nos. 31410 and 31411. As shown by the transcript, the trial court rendered a verdict of not guilty on the offense of assault and battery under indictment No. 31411 as merging with the offense of assault and battery under indictment No. 31410 (the docket entries do not show the not guilty verdict on the count in indictment No. 31411 but only show a merger into the assault and battery count under indictment No. 31410). These offenses did not merge, but, as the counts charged the same offense, they were duplicitous. See <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609. No matter what the reasons of the trial court, the verdict of not guilty on the assault and battery count under indictment No. 31411 was proper and the appellant was not prejudiced. For a discussion of the modern doctrine of merger see <em>Tender, etc. v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 692 and <em>Chittum v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 205.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
