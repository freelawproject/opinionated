Titus </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-8\"><em>Frank A. DeCosta, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, William A. Linthicum, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County, </em>and <em>James P. Tomes, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b483-9\">PER Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Maurice Ernest Gazaille, the appellant, was convicted by a jury of daytime housebreaking and grand larceny in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County before Judge James H. Pugh. Such facts as are necessary for the opinion are stated hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Gazaille complains that certain articles, constituting \u201cfruits\u201d of an illegal arrest, were introduced into evidence. Since there was no objection to the introduction of the articles at the trial, the question is not properly before this court, Maryland Rule 1085, <em>Porter v. State, </em>230 Md. 535, 187 A. 2d 870. In <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 659, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 1693 (1961) at footnote 9, the Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">\u201cAs is always the case, however, state procedural requirements governing assertion and pursuance of direct and collateral constitutional challenges to criminal prosecutions must be respected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Gazaille complains that Maryland law does not define the crimes of grand larceny and daytime housebreaking but merely provides a punishment for the crimes; that since the crimes did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>not exist at common law and are not defined under present statutes, daytime housebreaking and grand larceny do not exist under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Maryland Code Art. 27, \u00a7 340 does not define grand larceny but merely provides a punishment. However, grand larceny was a common law crime, Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 12.07 (6th Ed. 1958), and is a part of existing law in Maryland under Article 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights which adopted the common law that existed on July 4, 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Maryland Code Art. 27, \u00a7 30 (b) extends the definition of burglary to include \u201cAny person * * * who shall be convicted of the crime of breaking a dwelling house in the daytime * * We think that is a sufficient description of the crime. See <em>Swift v. </em>State, 224 Md. 300, 167 A. 2d 762. Nevertheless, housebreaking was also a crime at common law, <em>Putnam v. State, </em>234 Md. 537, 542-44, 200 A. 2d 59, 62-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Gazaille complains that there was not enough evidence to establish the crime took place in the daytime, and that the value of the stolen goods was one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Since the time of the housebreaking could not be ascertained, the appellant was charged with and convicted of the lesser included offense \u2014 daytime housebreaking as opposed to common-law burglary. <em>St. Clair v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 605.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">There was direct testimony by the owner of the stolen goods that the value was over one hundred dollars ($100.00). This is sufficient evidence of the value of the goods, <em>Scott v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 481, 494, 231 A. 2d 728. The jury as the trier of the facts weighs the credibility of the witnesses, <em>Hill v. State, </em>237 Md. 630, 206 A. 2d 677, <em>Tillery v. State, </em>236 Md. 614, 203 A. 2d 704. The owner\u2019s precise testimony indicated that while he was not positive of the fair market value on the date of the theft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>he felt that it would be between $100 and $150. We think this testimony was sufficient to make the issue a question for the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">JuJudgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-12\">. Appellant relies on <em>People v. Zwierkowski, </em>368 Mich. 56, 117 N. W. 2d 179. In that case, the defendent was convicted of nighttime burglary \u2014 the conviction was reversed because it was not proven that the defendant had broken into the house at night. This is not inconsistent with <em>St. Clair, supra, </em>where the nighttime element is not proven, the defendant can be convicted of the lesser included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
