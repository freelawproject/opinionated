Parker in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, on March 29, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">The Applicant was convicted of murder in the first degree in 1953 and received a life sentence. A direct appeal was entered by his attorneys and thereafter withdrawn before a transcript of the testimony at his trial was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">The record indicates that the court reporter at the Applicant\u2019s 1953 trial died during the interval between that trial and the instant proceeding wherein a transcript of the original trial has been requested. The unusual shorthand method used by the reporter at the original trial renders any attempt at present transcription impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The Applicant\u2019s sole contention is that his inability to obtain a transcript of his original trial offends his constitutional rights and entitles him to a new trial. We disagree. See <em>State v. Hance, </em>2 Md. App. 162; <em>Moore v. Warden, </em>237 Md. 613; <em>Bauerlien v. Warden, </em>236 Md. 346; <em>State v. Long, </em>235 Md. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">In <em>Long, supra, </em>Judge Henderson (later Chief Judge) spoke for the Court as follows (p. 127):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-16\">\u201cIt is unfortunate that the judge who presided at the original trial in the instant case is dead, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the court stenographer\u2019s notes cannot be transcribed. We think, however, that these facts do not, in and of themselves, require or justify the award of a new trial. Cf. <em>Michigan Nat. Bank v. Racine, </em>234 Md. 250, 253, and cases cited. In the late case of <em>Norvell v. Illinois, </em>373 U. S. 420, the Supreme Court held that no constitutional issue was presented by the denial of a delayed review of the original trial where a transcript could not be procured by reason of the death of a court reporter and through no fault of the State authorities, and where the applicant had been represented by counsel and did not take a direct appeal. The maj ority opinion concluded with these words : * * where transcripts are no longer available, Illinois may rest on the presumption that he who had a lawyer at the trial had one who could protect his rights on appeal.\u2019 See also the later <em>Illinois </em>case of <em>People v. McKee, </em>185 N. E. 2d. 682, <em>cert. den., </em>374 U. S. 810, <em>reh. den., </em>375 U. S. 872, applying the rule laid down in <em>Norvell. </em>In the instant case there is no showing that Long\u2019s decision not to appeal was based in any degree upon his indigency. Cf. <em>Brown v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 582, 584 and cases cited.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Here there was no allegation that the Applicant\u2019s appeal was withdrawn because of indigency nor was there any showing that the transcript was otherwise essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
