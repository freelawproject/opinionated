Vol.), by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Following his recommitment to Patuxent Institution, he immediately expressed his desire to file an application for leave to appeal from the jury\u2019s determination, stating in a let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ter to the court, dated December 23, 1966, that \u201cI wish to appeal on the grounds of incompetent counsel, for the attorney I had did not show any defense whatsoever.\u201d The court promptly appointed counsel to represent the applicant and prosecute his application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On March 7, 1967, applicant\u2019s counsel filed a detailed \u201cReport to Court,\u201d stating therein, <em>inter alia, </em>that after his appointment as counsel for the applicant, he examined all pertinent files pertaining to the case, including applicant\u2019s files and records at Patuxent Institution; that he thereafter personally interviewed the applicant who told him that his basis for appeal was incompetency of counsel in that \u201che did not try quite hard enough in his address to the jury;\u201d that an examination of the redetermination proceedings indicated that both the State\u2019s and applicant\u2019s own privately employed psychiatrist testified that applicant was still a defective delinquent; and that his investigation demonstrated that trial counsel was not incompetent and, accordingly, applicant\u2019s counsel \u201cdoes not believe that an appeal based on incompetency of counsel and which is the only issue that the patient himself feels is the basis of his appeal, is even fairly debatable under the law, and that this court either dismiss the appeal or allow (him) to be relieved of his appointment herein.\u201d A copy of counsel\u2019s \u201cReport to Court\u201d was sent to the applicant at Patuxent Institution on February 24, 1967. No response to that report has been filed by the applicant with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In <em>Anders v. California, </em>387 U. S. 738 (decided May 8, 1967), the Supreme Court held, in effect, that the constitutional right to counsel requires that on an indigent\u2019s first appeal from his criminal conviction, court-appointed appellate counsel must support the appeal to the best of his ability, requesting permission to withdraw only if he finds the case to be wholly frivolous, in which event he must file a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal. The court further held in <em>Anders </em>that a copy of the brief should be furnished the indigent and time allowed him to raise any points that he chooses, following which the court, after full examination of the proceedings, may decide whether the case is wholly frivolous; and if the court so finds, it may decide the case on its merits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>while if it finds any of the points \u201carguable on their merits,\u201d it must afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">While <em>Anders </em>involved a direct appeal from a criminal conviction, we nevertheless consider the instant application for leave to appeal from a redetermination of defective delinquency as being controlled in principle by <em>Anders.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Considering counsel\u2019s \u201cReport to Court\u201d in the light of applicant\u2019s sole basis for appeal, namely that counsel \u201cdid not try quite hard enough in his address to the jury,\u201d we hold the application is wholly frivolous and, as such, must be denied. In so concluding, we accept counsel\u2019s \u201cReport to Court\u201d in this instance, and under the circumstances of this case, as the equivalent of a brief and, while it is not in literal compliance with the requirements in <em>Anders, </em>it contains a summary of the proceedings and, in so providing, demonstrates the frivolity of applicant\u2019s ground for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>United States v. Camodeo, </em>383 F. 2d 770 (2d Cir. 1967). We note additionally that the applicant was served with a copy of his counsel\u2019s \u201cReport to Court\u201d on February 27, 1967 and has neither responded to it, nor requested the appointment of other counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-10\">. Maryland Rule 1094 a 2(b), and Article 31B, Section 11A of the Maryland Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), provides for the appointment of counsel to represent indigent applicants seeking leave to appeal in defective delinquent cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\"><em>. </em>We do not intend to hold that such a \u201cReport to Court\u201d as was here filed would necessarily suffice in a direct appeal from a criminal conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
