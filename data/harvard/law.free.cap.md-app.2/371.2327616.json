Burch, Attorney General, Charles E. Moylan, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>and <em>James B. Dudley </em>and <em>Edward Angeletti, Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b392-15\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">Appellant was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon, and assault with intent to murder, in the Criminal Court of Baltimore by Judge James K. Cullen, sitting without a jury. He was sentenced to terms of twenty and ten years, respectively, in the Maryland Penitentiary, the sentences to run concurrently. Appellant contends on this appeal (1) that the testimony of the State\u2019s rebuttal witnesses was improperly admitted, and (2) that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">It is well established that any competent evidence which explains, or is a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>evidence introduced by the accused may be produced by the prosecution in rebuttal, and that which constitutes rebuttal testimony in a criminal prosecution is a matter resting largely in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Lane v. State, </em>226 Md. 81, 90, and cases therein cited. Here, appellant\u2019s defense was that he was not at the scene of the crime. The State\u2019s rebuttal testimony consisted of eyewitnesses who testified that appellant was at the scene and, in fact, committed the act. This evidence tended to contradict the defense, and its admission as rebuttal testimony was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Appellant\u2019s second contention, concerning the sufficiency of the evidence, is likewise unfounded. Appellant was identified as the perpetrator of the robbery by three eyewitnesses. Identification by a single eyewitness, if believed by the trier of facts, is sufficient to support a conviction. <em>Bennett and Flynn v. State, 237 </em>Md. 212; <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The identification here clearly supports the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Judgment affirmed~</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
