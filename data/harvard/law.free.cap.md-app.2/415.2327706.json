Perrott sitting without a jury. Jordan, now, complains that he was deprived of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States because of inadequate court appointed counsel. This question was not raised below; therefore, it is not properly before this court, Maryland Rule 1085. We have repeatedly invoked this Rule in similar cases because, among other reasons, counsel has had no opportunity to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
