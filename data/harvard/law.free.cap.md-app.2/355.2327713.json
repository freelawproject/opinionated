Russell Jr., in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">With regard to the contention raised by petitioner in his application for leave to appeal that he has new facts to prove an allegation of perjury by the State\u2019s chief witness, the law is that a claim of discovery of new evidence that might have changed the result of conviction is not ground for post conviction relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>State v.
