Harold Grady, sitting in the Crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>nal Court of Baltimore, denying relief sought under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The application is denied for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">1. A contention of insufficiency of the evidence produced at the applicant\u2019s trial cannot be raised under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. <em>Young v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 596, <em>Burgess v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 610, <em>Nixon v. Director, </em>1 Md. App. 14, <em>Ross v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 46, <em>Walker v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 534, <em>Watson v. Warden, </em>2 Md. App. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">2. A contention that \u201cpetitioner was denied due process of law\u201d is a bald allegation, not considered under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, <em>Carney v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 676, <em>McCoy v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 108, <em>Ross, supra, Watson, supra. </em>An examination of the hearing judge\u2019s memorandum shows that there was not a complete lack of evidence, <em>State v. Brown, </em>235 Md. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">3. As the petitioner\u2019s allegation, that his past record was made an issue and was a deciding factor in his conviction, was not supported by facts, it may be disposed of as either a bald allegation, not properly considered under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, <em>Carney v. Warden, supra, </em>etc., or an abandoned contention, as Judge Grady in his memorandum states that none of the testimony taken at the hearing touched upon this contention. <em>Szukiewicz v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 61, <em>Carney v. Warden, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Since the petitioner did not take advantage of his right to a direct appeal from his conviction and under Md. Code (1967 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (c) must be deemed to have waived his right to now raise contentions No. (1) and No. (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">It should be noted that applicant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, prepared by his attorney, failed to comply with Md. Rule, BK 46 b in that no reasons were set forth as to why the lower court should be reversed. This alone would be sufficient to deny relief. <em>Isaacs v. Warden, </em>243 Md. 687, <em>Norris v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 69; <em>Ross v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
