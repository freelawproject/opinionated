Howard,, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Charles B. Moylan, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>and <em>Howard Cardin, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">On October 4, 1966, the appellant was convicted of assault upon a police officer acting in his official capacity in violation of Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 11B and of the common-law offense of resisting arrest, in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, before Judge J. Gilbert Prendergast, presiding without a jury. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years on the assault charge and one year on the charge of resisting arrest, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">On this appeal, the appellant contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">1) The trial court erred in denying a motion for judgment of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">2) The verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">3) A statement of the appellant was improperly admitted in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">The appellant was also indicted, with another person, for storehouse breaking and related offenses and a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the State was granted as to both defendants on these charges. The address of the storehouse broken into was incorrectly stated in the indictment and the lower court denied a request by the State to amend the indictment after the commencement of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">There was evidence produced by the State that about 9:30 P.M. on July 10, 1966 two police officers, Robert McGlynn and George McHargue, in unmarked radio car #143 were in the vicinity of the 1300 block North Charles Street when they heard a call come over their radio for police car #501 to proceed to the unit block of West North Avenue, \u201ctwo colored males breaking a window at Clayton Shop.\u201d About a minute later they heard a call for police car #104 to respond also \u201cbecause they were reportedly looting the window.\u201d Thereupon McGlynn and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>McHargue started toward the area and as they approached the 1800 block North Charles Street received the information that one of the males was wearing a light shirt, dark pants, with possible cuts on the hand and that he had run south on Charles Street. As they approached Trenton Alley, about 50 feet south of North Avenue on Charles Street they \u201cobserved this colored male come out of the alley, start to walk north on Charles Street, on the west side of Charles. He was wearing a light blue shirt, dark pants and he was wrapping what looked like to us a rag around his hand, had a blood soaked rag.\u201d They stopped their car, got out and walked over to him, confronting him in front of the Little Tavern at North Avenue and Charles Street. He was the appellant. Each officer identified himself as a police officer, showed the appellant the police badge each carried and placed him under arrest. He blurted out, \u201cI didn\u2019t break the window, the other boy did it.\u201d This was not said in response to any question asked or statement made by either officer soliciting any information and was stated by the appellant immediately upon being informed he was under arrest. The officers started to walk him to their car, but the appellant \u201clunged\u201d attempting to break away from them and \u201cbecame very violent.\u201d They struggled with him to the west side of Charles Street and in attempting to get away the appellant bit McGlynn on the hand necessitating treatment at Mercy Hospital. The appellant struggled for four or five minutes until several uniformed policemen arrived and helped place him under control. McHargue was also injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Breaking a storehouse with intent to steal goods of the value of $100 or more is a felony. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 32. Breaking a shop and stealing goods to the value of $5 or upwards is a felony. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 33. There can be a legal arrest without a warrant for a felony when the arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a felony has been committed and that the person arrested committed it. Information placed on a lookout prepared by a police organization, of which the arresting officer is a part, may constitute probable cause for the arrest. <em>Johnson, etc. v. State, </em>238 Md. 528 and cases cited. The testimony in this case, herein detailed, clearly supports the conclusion of the court below that the arrest was legal. Ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the validity of the convictions would not be affected by whether the arrest of the appellant was or was not legal, since no evidence was seized or used against him as a result. Here, however, the appellant contends that he had a right to resist seizure by the officers inasmuch as they had no valid cause to arrest him. As the arrest of the appellant was legal, the appellant was not justified in resisting it, and assaulting the police officers. <em>Hawkins v. State, 237 </em>Md. 395; <em>Sharpe v. State, </em>231 Md. 401; <em>Price v. State, 227 </em>Md. 28; <em>Kellum v. State, </em>223 Md. 80.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\u201cFor this Court to reverse a judgment entered in a case tried by the lower court without a jury, it must be shown that there was no legally sufficient evidence, or proper inferences therefrom, from which the court could find the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Crum and Dunbar v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 132, quoting <em>McCray v. State, </em>236 Md. 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">There was clearly sufficient evidence before the trial court, as herein summarized, from which the court could find the appellant guilty of the crimes for which he was charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The findings of the trial judge will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule, 1086; <em>Anglin v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 85. We find no error in the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal and hold that there was legally sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions. The appellant denied on the stand that the police officers made their identity known to him. In explanation of why he ran when the police \u201cgrabbed\u201d him, he said that he had been fighting with the co-defendant. He admitted resisting arrest but felt \u201cthe police didn\u2019t have no right to approach me in this kind of way.\u201d He stated that he could have bit the officer but did not remember doing so. He said that he had been at Spring Grove about four or five weeks \u201cfor barbituates\u201d and on the night he was arrested he did not \u201chave too much to drink\u201d but \u201chad about five or six barbituates.\u201d He had been convicted on a previous occasion of larceny, resisting arrest and assault. Since one of the functions of the lower court is to determine the credibility of the witnesses, it may, in judging credibility, disbelieve exculpa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tory statements made by the defendant. <em>Bird v. State, </em>231 Md. 432; Maryland Rule, 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The appellant also argues that the \u201cdecision of the lower court was against the weight of the evidence.\u201d In <em>O\u2019Brien v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 94 at 97, we quoted <em>Graczyk v. State, </em>233 Md. 245:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cThis Court has repeatedly stated that our function in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence on an appeal from a conviction in a non-jury criminal case is not whether we might have reached a different result from that of the trial court, but whether the court below had sufficient evidence from which it could be fairly con- ' vinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Thus, the weight of the evidence is a question for the trial court. <em>Graef v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The appellant also contends that the testimony that he said, immediately upon being informed that he was under arrest, \u201cI didn\u2019t break the window, the other boy did it,\u201d was inadmissible because the police did not employ the procedural safeguards set forth in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436. We held in <em>Gaudio and Bucci v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 455 that those safeguards applied to statements made during a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d and that <em>Miranda </em>did not protect an accused \u201cunder any and all circumstances * * * to the extent that no inquiry at all by the authorities is permissible without prior warning.\u201d In the instant case there was not even an inquiry by the police; the appellant simply \u201cblurted out\u201d the statement to which objection was made. As in <em>Gcmdio-, </em>the appellant here was \u201cnot held incommunicado in an isolated setting in the privacy of an interrogation room in a police station\u201d nor was he \u201cswept from familiar surroundings into police custody,\u201d and \u201csubjected to the techniques of persuasion.\u201d He was standing on a public street and volunteered the information upon being told he was under arrest. We note that the Court said in <em>Miranda </em>that \u201cVolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ing today.\u201d We do not believe that <em>Miranda </em>compels that the statement here objected to be held inadmissible and hold that there was no error in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
