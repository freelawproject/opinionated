Cullen presiding, and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 years. At arraignment he pleaded not guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the commission of the offense and not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the trial. At the close of the evidence offered by the State during the trial, after denying a motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial judge, over objection, heard the question of the appellant\u2019s sanity out of the presence of the jury. After considering evidence produced by the appellant, consisting of testimony of a psychiatrist and of the appellant, the trial judge found the evidence insufficient to raise a question in the minds of reasonable men whether the appellant was or was not insane, and did not permit the issue of insanity to be presented for the consideration of the jury. On appeal the appellant contends that the trial judge erred both in the procedure followed and the finding made.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Chapter 709, Acts of 1967, codified as Art. 59, sections 7-12, Md. Code (1964 Repl. Vol.), changed the standard for determining sanity with regard to criminal responsibility. We think it clear that th^ legislative intent was to have the provisions of the Act applicable to all cases tried on June 1, 1967 and thereafter but that they were not to have retroactive effect and we so stated in <em>League v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 681, 685. Therefore the M\u2019Naghten rule \u2014 the appellant\u2019s ability \u201cto distinguish between right and wrong and understand the nature and consequences of his acts as applied to himself\u201d \u2014 existing prior to June 1, 1967, was applicable to the appellant at his trial. <em>Bergin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 74. <em>Rowe v. State, </em>234 Md. 295 held that the M\u2019Naghten rule was the standard for determining sanity at the time of the commission of the crime as well as at the time of trial. In <em>Bradford v. State, </em>234 Md. 505, the Court of Appeals, confronted with the questions for the first time, determined which party \u2014 the prosecution or the defendant \u2014 had the burden of proof on the issue of insanity and which degree of proof \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt or preponderance of the evidence \u2014 should be applied. In <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>238 Md. 451, at page 463, the Court stated that the holdings in <em>Bradford </em>were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">\u201c(1) a man is presumed to have been sane and responsible for his acts at the time he committed a crime until there is adduced proof of his inability \u2018to distinguish between right and wrong and understand the nature and consequences of his acts as applied to himself\u2019 (the M\u2019Naghten rule) sufficient to raise a doubt as to his sanity as defined in the minds of reasonable men (\u2018Evidence of some undefined mental disorder or instability is insufficient proof to overcome the presumption of sanity\u2019), and (2) when there has been offered proof of insanity so defined sufficient to overcome the initial presumption of the sanity of the accused the State must prove sanity, as well as the other elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"><em>Fowler v. State, </em>237 Md. 508, held that the trial court should determine as a preliminary matter of law whether there has been offered evidence of insanity under the M\u2019Naghten rule, sufficient, if believed, to raise a question in the minds of reasonable men whether the defendant is or is not insane. If the evidence is so sufficient, the question of the defendant\u2019s sanity is to be considered by the jury with instructions that the burden is on the State to prove the defendant sane beyond a reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not so sufficient, the issue should be withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. The Court followed the same rule in <em>Jenkins v. State, supra. </em>Finding that there was not sufficient evidence of insanity to rebut the presumption of sanity, it said, page 466, that \u201c* * * the issues of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>insanity now and then should not have been submitted to the jury.\u201d The appellant points out, correctly, that in both <em>Fowler </em>and <em>Jenkins </em>the issues were presented to the jury. In <em>Fowler, </em>although the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the burden was upon the defendant to prove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court agreed with the contention of the State that it was not reversible error \u201cbecause there was no sufficient evidence of insanity adduced at the trial to require the submission of the issue of insanity to the jury and, therefore, the submission of that issue to the jury (which found him sane) was more than the appellant was entitled to.\u201d 237 Md. 512. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the Court said that whatever the reason the issues went to the jury, the appellant was not hurt. But despite the fact that in those cases the issues were before the jury, we think it clear that it is now established that the trial court should determine as a preliminary matter of law whether there has been offered evidence of insanity (under the M\u2019Naughten rule as to cases tried prior to June 1, 1967 or under the provisions of chapter 709 of the Acts of 1967 as to cases tried on or after June 1, 1967) sufficient, if believed, to raise the question in the minds of reasonable men whether the defendant is or is not insane. Only when the court finds that there is such sufficient evidence are the issues of insanity at the time of the commission of the offense and at the time of the trial to be submitted to the jury. We think it logically follows that it is preferable that such evidence be adduced out of the presence of the jury to avoid any possible prejudice and to obviate the necessity, when the evidence is found to be insufficient; of instructing the jury that the issue is not before them and that they are to disregard such evidence in their deliberations of whether the State has proved the commission of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Of course, if the trial court finds the evidence to be sufficient, it should then be introduced before the jury with the proper instructions. The appellant urges that Article XV, \u00a7 5, of the Constitution of Maryland, providing that \u201cIn the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction,\u201d requires the issues to be determined by the jury in any event and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>fore precludes any preliminary decision by the trial court on evidence proffered out of the jury\u2019s presence. We do not agree. The logical conclusion of the appellant\u2019s contention is that any evidence offered in a case must fall to the jury as a matter of course. We are not persuaded to adopt the appellant\u2019s interpretation of the constitutional provision and it does not prevail in other matters. For example, it is clear that the trial court is vested with sound discretion relating to the reception or rejection of evidence. <em>Koprivich v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 147. The admissibility of a confession is, preliminarily, a matter for the trial judge, and evidence with respect thereto is properly taken out of the presence of the jury. Only if the confession is found to be voluntary is the evidence presented to the jury. <em>Davis and Peterson v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 581. The trial court must take the case from the jury upon motion for judgment of acquittal if the evidence is not legally sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>Culver v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 406. We see no error in the procedure followed by the trial judge in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">There remains the question whether the trial court erred in its finding that there had not been offered evidence of insanity under the M\u2019Nagliten rule, Sufficient, if believed, to raise a question in the minds of reasonable men whether the appellant was or was not insane at the time of the commission of the offense and at the time of the trial. To show he was insane, the appellant offered the testimony of Dr. James Edgar Smith II, a psychiatrist, who testified that he examined the appellant on May 11, 1966 and had reviewed a report concerning him and had seen a report recently made by \u201cone of the medical officers for the Supreme Bench.\u201d He arrived at a conclusion that the appellant \u201c* * * does, indeed, suffer from a form of mental disorder which would be best characterized as a severe character disorder * * * with schizoid tendencies, passive aggressive traits, and antisocial and sexually deviant difficulties.\u201d Evidence of such mental disorder was insufficient proof under the M\u2019Naghten rule to overcome the presumption of sanity. On the contrary, we think it clear from the responses of the doctor on direct examination and cross-examination that he found that the appellant had the ability to distinguish between right and wrong and understand the nature and consequences of his acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>as applied to himself both at the time of the commission of the offense and at the time of the trial. The testimony of the appellant, in substance, was that he did not remember what happened at the time of the commission of the offense and that he was having emotional and personal problems and \u201ceverything was all confused.\u201d We feel that there was no evidence of insanity sufficient to rebut the presumption of sanity. The trial court, therefore, did not err in so finding and in refusing to allow the issues to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
