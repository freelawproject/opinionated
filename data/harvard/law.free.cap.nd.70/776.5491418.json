J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9L\">On June 21, 1937, plaintiff Glinz made two applications for state hail insurance, one covering some wheat on the northwest quarter of section 26, and one on two fields of grain, aggregating 127 acres, on the southwest quarter of section 26 \u2014 -all in township 160, range 79. These applications were mailed to the Insurance Department on the morning of June 23, 1937; and were received and approved on the 24th, the only insurance involved here being on the crop on the southwest quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">On the evening of June 23 a hailstorm passed through this territory and over the crop. This is conceded. The issue, as stated by appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>lant, is whether the crop was <em>struck by hail and maternally damaged </em>\u201cprior to the effective date and time of said policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The crop was injured by two hailstorms in July. When claim for loss was made under these later storms and adjusters arrived, the hailstorm of June 23 was brought to the attention of the Department. Liability was repudiated on the theory that the application for insurance was not subject to approval by the State Hail Insurance Department, owing to statutory prohibitions, though the adjusters determined the crop was injured by the July storms and adjusted the loss at $139.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Some three years afterwards the plaintiff commenced this action to recover on this adjustment. The case was tried to the court without a jury. The court found for the plaintiff, the findings showing \u201cThat on or about June 23, 1937, some hail fell on the crops insured but did no material damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The memorandum opinion, after referring to the evidence and summarizing it, says the burden of proof is upon the defendant to show that this hailstorm \u201cmust have caused material injury to the plaintiff\u2019s crops. It has failed to do that. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony on the other hand is positive that such damage was less than 2 per cent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Judgment was ordered for the plaintiff, and the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Section 2, chapter' 137 of the Session Laws of 1933 expressly states: \u201cThe insurance provided for in this act shall not be effective on crops <em>struck by hail </em>before an application is filed with the Hail Insurance Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Section 5 of the same act provides: that an \u201capplication may be taken ... at any time before crops are struck by hail. . . . Provided, however, that <em>in no case shall insurance take effect before such application is actually received in the office of the Hail Insurance Department</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">In Issendorf v. State, 69 N. D. 56, 283 N. W. 783, we were required to consider this expression \u2014 \u201cstruck by hail.\u201d Therein we held the fact a hailstorm may have passed over the field did not render the crop uninsiirable, when the amount of hail that fell was \u201cso small that it did no material damage.\u201d If a hailstone or two fell on a field and struck between rows, or even hit some stalks, it could not be said that the crop was struck by hail when no material damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>was done. It is the <em>crop </em>that must be <em>struck </em>by hail. The purpose of the insurance is to protect a previously undamaged crop against loss by hail; and if the former hailstorm did no damage, caused no loss, then it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the crop, before' being insured, was <em>struck by hail </em>within the meaning of the law. Damage to property means actual loss, some substantial damage, some injury by which the value is diminished or destroyed. Weeks v. Shirley, 33 Me. 271, 272; Dudley v. McKenzie, 54 Vt. 685, 687. In this sense the word \u201cdamage\u201d is synonymous with \u201closs.\u201d i\";</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">As stated in Fay v. Parker, 53 N. H. 342, 16 Am. Rep. 270, \u201cLoss is the generic term. Damage is a species of loss.\u201d See also Turner v. Woodward, 123 Ga. 866, 51 S. E. 762; Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Mink, 126 Ky. 337, 341, 103 S. W. 294, 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Material damage means an actual injury. See Nierodzinski v. Chicago, 284 Ill. App. 598, 602, 1 N. E. (2d) 244, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">\u201cStruck by hail,\u201d as we noted in the Issendorf Case, means that the hail caused some material damage; but percentage of loss is not the standard. The legislature has not seen fit to set up percentage as the criterion. A percentage definition would be largely a matter of speculation or judgment, and where the legislature has failed to make a more or less arbitrary definition, using percentage as a basis, it is not for this court to lay down any such arbitrary rule; but an opinion as to the percentage of loss, based upon judgment and observation, may be of value in determining whether the crop was in fact struck by hail.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The fact that the crop was injured by the hailstorms in July in such an appreciable amount that the adjusters fixed the damages at $139.90 is of no moment here, provided it be shown that the crop was \u201cstruck by hail\u201d prior to the effective date of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">That the crop was damaged visibly by the hail storm of June 23 is beyond dispute. Immediately after the storm the plaintiff Glinz and his son, a youth of sixteen years of age, went over the field to ascertain what damage, if any, had been done. Their testimony is to the effect that they \u201cdrove from one end of the field to the other end. Right straight across and around.\u201d The plaintiff said he estimated the damage at 2 or 3 per cent; maybe 5. The son was more specific in his testimony. He narrated how he and his father \u201cwent over all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the field\u201d \u2014 made five or six counts in about nine rows in the fields. Sometimes he counted a hundred or some stalks in the portion selected, and he found the damage to be about 2 per cent or somewhat less. He said: \u201cWe just go a ways and stop and get down and count the spears coming up and if we find any broken off, probably count 100 and then count the broken ones in that number.\u201d Nothing was said as to how he made the selections.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The plaintiff testified he made no report of this hailstorm, even though he had made out his applications two days before, because he understood he could have no recovery under the applications unless the crop was injured 10 per cent, and that he and his son came to the conclusion _ the damage did not amount to 10 per cent, but was only from 2 to 5 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The adjusters testified to the manner of their examination of the crop, and the observation of the fact that the heads were crooked and crinkled. Their testimony shows such crinkled heads were the result of hailstorms prior to July. It is conceded there was no hailstorm prior to July, other than this one of June 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">After detailing the method of examination for the process of adjustment, these adjusters testified that the crop had been damaged by hail on June 23 from 3 and 4 to 8 per per cent, the percentage for the three storms being about 18 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">It appears that crops on section 22 were damaged by this storm by about 20 per cent. Neighboring fields on all sides of these fields damaged had been insured, and this hailstorm of June 23 damaged crops on sections 21, 24, and 28 also. As these crops had been insured prior to this storm of June 23, losses were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">It is clear from the testimony that the crop was struck by hail. The result was visible. The loss was visible. Where the stalks were struck, they were damaged materially. The stems were broken, the head in the shot blade was stunted, deformed, and partially destroyed. This was apparent to the plaintiff himself upon a more or less casual observation; it is made more certain by the method adopted by the son in an attempt to ascertain the percentage, and is confirmed by the testimony of the adjusters. Other than difference of opinion as to percentage, there is no dispute but what the crop was materially damaged to an extent that was visible, observable, understandable. It is clear, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>fore, that before the application for insurance, was received by the department, the crop had been \u201cstruck by hail,\u201d and, therefore, was uninsurable.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">We are not unmindful of the fact that the trial court found for the plaintiff; but it is clear from the memorandum opinion the trial court was being guided by a more or less arbitrary rule of percentage rather than by visible, material damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The judgment is reversed and the action is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b797-6\">Christianson, Morris, Burke, and Nubssle, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b797-7\">Burr, Oh. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJn\">In a petition for rehearing, plaintiffs urge that this decision \u201cnegatives and nullifies the law on this subject as laid down in the case of Issendorf v. State, 69 N. D. 56, 283 N. W. 783.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In this plaintiffs are mistaken. We cite and follow the Issendorf case. In the latter case, we were required to consider the phrase \u201cstruck by hail,\u201d and therein pointed out that when the amount of hail was \u201cso small that it did no material damage\u201d to the crop, then the crop was not \u201cstruck by hail\u201d within the intent of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In the ease at bar, we are not defining the expression \u201cstruck by hail.\u201d We are considering the expression \u201cmaterial damage.\u201d It is the crop as it was on June 23 we have before us. i</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">When material damage is thus caused to the crop, then the crop is struck by hail, no matter what may be the yield thereafter. The two cases are in harmony. The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b797-11\">Nubssle, Burke, Morris and Christianson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
