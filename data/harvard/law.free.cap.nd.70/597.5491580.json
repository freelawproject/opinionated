The complaint conforms to the provisions of \u00a7 8147 of the N. D. Compiled Laws 1913, and alleges, among other things regarding the property, \u201cthat the defendants claim certain estates or interests in or liens or encumbrances upon the same adverse to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The demurrer alleges: \u201cThe complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Appellant urges two points. The first is that as the state may not be sued except in \u201csuch cases, as the legislative assembly may, by law, direct\u201d (\u00a7 22 of the Constitution), and the legislature, by the provisions of \u00a7 8175, N. D. Compiled Laws 1913, has limited such an action as this to one \u201crespecting the title to property,\u201d it is not sufficient, so far as the state is concerned, merely to state in the complaint that the state claims an interest in the property, but the complaint must show also \u201cWhat Possible Claim to the Property the State May Have, and (the complaint) Does Not Give the Defendant Information Necessary to Defend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">This contention is answered by our recent decision in Dunham Lumber Co. v. Gresz, ante, 455, 295 N. W. 500. A complaint is sufficient as against such demurrer by the state when it alleges the state claims some interest in the land, inferior to the interest of the plaintiff, and demands the state set forth a statement of its claims. The rule laid down in the case cited .is decisive of this point. \u201cAn objection that a pleading is not sufficiently full, definite, certain or specific is not reached by demurrer, but rather by motion to make it more definite and specific.\u201d 21 E. O. L. 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The second point is that the complaint is defective in that it \u201cdoes not allege compliance with the conditions precedent to the right to sue the state provided by \u00a7\u00a7 8175--8177, inclusive of the Compiled Laws of 1913.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Appellant points out that the complaint does not show that, at the time of commencing this action, the plaintiff had filed an undertaking to pay \u201cany judgment for costs that may be rendered against him,\u201d though \u00a7 8175, N. D. Comp. Laws 1913, requires that in actions brought against the state the plaintiff shall do so, \u201cat the time of commencing such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In Dunham Lumber Co. v. Gresz, supra, we held that \u201cthe complaint is not demurrable because it fails to plead the filing of the bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">The order overruling the demurrer is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b614-10\">Burr, Ch.
